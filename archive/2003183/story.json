The company also found it appealing; not eye-catching. Standing on the porch, I sighed as I looked at the golden fields across the road and the strip of forest bordering the horizon beneath the rich blue sky. Not a single house or shop for miles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking back into the house, I skipped down the stairs leading into the basement, which also happened to be my office. Working in the research facility actually didn't leave me with some elaborate laboratory in my house, just a desk and a computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, a metal briefcase laid on my desk, its sleek appearance contrary to the homely basement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat myself down and looked at the case with anticipation, eventually reaching into a drawer and pulling out a tape recorder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Recording Number 1, June 13, 200X. Project is Barry-8, an additive supplement for commercial retail. Desired outcome is a healthy, non-lethal desire for the subjected food. Test has been successful on 8 lab rats, and human test is about to go underway. Test subject is Hank Forrest, Age 30, Height 6'1\", Weight 176 lb. Test has not commenced. About to treat a meal with Barry-8 and monitor results. End tape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClicking it off, I sighed as I looked at the brief case. I couldn't believe I was the one they'd chosen. You'd think they'd get some guy in contract, but no. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas, there's always gotta be a test subject, I suppose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching into the mini fridge, I pulled out a plate wrapped in cellophane. Peeling it revealed a slice of cake on a paper plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a gulp, I flicked open the briefcase and revealed two vials, each filled with clear liquid. After uncorking one, I brought it under my nose and gave a small whiff. It had no noticeable smell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHovering the open tube over the vial, I let some of the liquid trickle onto the cake. It seeped into the sponge cake, acting exactly as water would. Once it'd set in, I sliced off a bite with my fork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, down the hatch\u2026\" I announced as I brought the fork into my mouth.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My eyes widened as my tongue was met with an explosion of flavor. The stuff tasted amazing! Far more results than the lab rats had proven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the cake was destroyed in two large bites, which I\u2019d tried to savor the taste out of as much as possible. I\u2019d even licked the plate clean of every last crumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTests results are positive!\u201d I chuckled into the recorder. \u201cCake has shown incredible taste and satisfaction while eating. Shall stand by to monitor further results.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI set the recorder down and silently sat back in the chair, awaiting more results. Five minutes went by with nothing coming up, and I started thinking back to the cake. It tasted so good, and I was almost disappointed that I\u2019d eaten it all in an instant. A growl from my stomach extenuated that feeling as I realized how hungry I felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d I hummed curiously as I glanced over at the test canister. \u201c\u2026maybe I could try testing on other kinds of foods\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t bother getting out of my chair as I leaned forward and creaked open the door, pulling out a sandwich wrapped in cellophane. After ripping off the plastic, I reopened the canister and dribbled more of the stuff on, a bit more generous this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTesting of sandwich shall begin.\u201d I announced into the recorder before leaning back and biting in. letting out a contented sigh as that same explosion of flavor came back. Even after I\u2019d stuffed down the sandwich, it\u2019d still left me with an apetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTesting on apple shall begin\u2026\u201d I informed the recorder as I leaned forward and pulled out an apple, which I treated as before and chowed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next several minutes went by in a flavor safari as I continued to raid the fridge of its contents and wolfed it down with the additive. Halfway in I\u2019d long forgotten about testing as I just stuffed myself and let the recorder gather dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t notice the mini fridge\u2019s dwindling contents until it was almost empty, save for a 2-liter bottle of soda. After lifting the bottle out, I picked up the canister and saw that it was down to half of its original contents. A somewhat mischievous smile crept across my face as I screwed open the bottle and poured in the last of the additive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBringing the bottle to my lips, my eyes widened and I let out a laugh as I chugged down the cool, and recently infinitely delicious beverage. I didn\u2019t lift the bottle from my lips as I gulped it all down for a minute straight until the bottle was empty, which clattered on the ground as it fell from my mouth and I let out a belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*UUUUUUUUURRAAAAAAAARRRRRPPPPP\u2026* Heh, scuse me. Any way\u2026\u201d But my smile faded my hand fell onto my lap, which I felt a soft mass resting on. Looking down, I stared in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy stomach had fattened to the size of a beach ball, my shirt stretching as the bottom half lay exposed up to my naval. My legs had also blimped up as well, now filling the seat and pushing out through the arm rests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah\u2026\u201d A whispered to myself, still registering what I was seeing.</span></div></div>",

As per our species migration, we've taken it upon ourselves to nominate you as our new planet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI began to open my mouth to speak, but the potato apparently saw its chance and launched itself straight at my face, shoving itself into my mouth as I let out a yelp of shock. I grabbed at the potato and tried to pull it out, but it proved itself too strong for me when my mouth stretched painfully as it pushed itself through, a huge bulge running down my neck as it traveled down my throat and landed in my stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGasping for breath and absolutely horrified by what just happened, I placed a hand on my fattened belly only to, sure enough, feel a magic potato-sized lump inside. However, it began to find room as I began to fatten out, my stomach inflating like a giant water balloon and passing over my widening legs. In addition, the back of the chair crept down my back as I grew taller. At my monstrous size, the chair understandably crumpled under my expanded rear end and threw me onto my ass as I gasped for breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy stomach was the size of a giant exercise ball, pushing my ham-like legs apart and barely covered by my rope-like shirt. I had to five feet tall while seated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I apologize for the intrusion, human!\" A muffled voice from within my belly announced. \"But do not fear, my subjects shall be much easier to ingest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GET OUT OF MY BODY, YOU OVERSIZED FARM CROP!!!\" I bellowed, but several small <i>\"poof!\"</i>s from behind me signified the presence of five equally large potatoes, all of which seemed to notice the king-sized human on the ground and shot themselves straight at me.</span></div></div>",

Slowly, and with considerable labor, I braced my feet on the ground and managed to stand myself up, but my tree-trunk legs buckled under my immense weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the potato managed to zoom around my head and jab me in the back of my neck, causing me to let out a yelp of pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YA-MMMPH!!!\" My eyes widened as the potato forced itself into my mouth and managed to worm itself halfway through, escaping my attempts to pry it out as it went down my throat. Once it was in, my legs blew up to balloon-like proportions, causing me to land backwards and land on my ass with a horrendously loud <i>BOOM!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PLEASE, STOP!\" I begged, only for another potato to force itself in my mouth, the other one right on its tail as one by one I was forced to choke down each. As I expanded, my arms began to hang uselessly at my sides, dangling in the air as the biceps grew too huge for them to bend. At seven feet while seated and growing, I could see less and less of the room as my monstrous gut grew so huge that it began to reach the wall ahead of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn top of that, several \"poof!\"s burst about as one by one more potatoes began appearing in the room, each one ready to cram itself into my face. As hard as I tried to reach forward and defend myself, my blob-like arms put up no fight as the potatoes worked their way into my face and I swallowed them whole. My belly started bending the wall away from me and my head pressing against the ceiling, the potatoes pausing as the ceiling gave way to the pressure as my head burst through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I gasped for breath, I could see the living room around me. My head protruded from the ground on a small mound of fat and chins, and I could feel the entire room beneath me filled in by my obscene size. However, a swarm of the potatoes floated in through a door to the basement, and I obviously couldn't fight back as they shot into my mouth and fattened me like a hot air balloon. The floor around me began to swell as pressure beneath built up from my inflating body, and cracks appeared in the hole my head was in until the floor was finally torn apart by my body. My globular belly began to fill up the room as I gained with more speed, the walls breaking away as I grew outward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough my head reached the other ceiling and broke through, and my fat tore through the floor of my bedroom with much more ease than before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom outside, the house seemed to swell out as the windows broke out and soft fat seeped through, but the stretched foundation finally gave way and broke apart as a globular blob of flesh tore the house apart from inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2026.ugh\u2026\" I groaned sickly, barely aware of what happened. As my eyes cleared up, I was horrified to see the blue sky above me. Looking to my sides, my arms by that point were mountains of fat that my hands stood out from, and the only part of my legs that I could feel were my feet, the remainder of my limbs lost in borderline spheres of fat. I couldn't see past my dozens of chins, but I could certainly feel my stomach, which was now larger than house I'd just burst through.</span></div></div>",

I took a few more bites out of the cake, and sure enough, nothing. It wasn't even soggy. Thankfully, I wasn't choking to death on the ground, but nothing to record.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No immediate change.\" I scribbled into a notepad before slipping it into my pocket and standing up. I always thought that the best way to endure research was to briefly forget there even was an experiment, taking breaks between monitoring to notice changes more easily. Heading for the TV room, I plopped myself in an armchair and flipped the TV on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, the laboratory didn't enforce it, but I'd found it rather invigorating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an hour or so of watching until my watch beeped, indicating a monitoring section. I grabbed my pen and pad from my pocket and narrated as I wrote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mental state: No pain, sickness, or discomfort detectable. No changes in mood or sudden agitations. Physical state\u2026\" I looked down at myself for observations, but dropped my pen and pad to the floor in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy once-average midsection was beginning to form a potbelly, sticking out a few inches more than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2026The hell? Is this bloating?\" I gave my stomach a poke, getting a feel of how soft it now felt. However, I could suddenly feel a faint rumble coming from within, and I yelped in shock as it suddenly began to bloat out again, expanding a few more inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat there in stunned silence before standing myself up with unfamiliar difficulty and heading down the hall. Upon opening the bathroom door and flipping on the lights, I could see myself in the mirror. Sure enough, I'd become fairly plump, my one baggy t-shirt now gripping at my rounded belly, large enough that a sliver of flesh was visible on the bottom of my shirt. In addition, I could feel that my pants now felt less roomy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What\u2026the\u2026<i>hell\u2026</i>\" I poked at my arm, which now bore a soft paunch. I also gently slapped my belly, which sent a ripple throughout. Waddling (to my misery) up to the bathroom scale, the wheel spun out of control as I stepped my engorged girth upon it, the reading slowly halting on 256.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2026This isn't happening.\" I whispered to myself. \"This\u2026this is all some kind of dream, and soon enough, I'll wake up and this will all be\u2026\" But a louder rumble interrupted me as my belly grew even larger and my jeans became skintight, the scale jumping to 341.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2026oh boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe steps leading down to the basement began to bow under my newfound weight. I lumberedd for the phone on my desk and hastily dialed the lab, four dial tones beeping until an automated tone came through.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n\"You've reaches FESPA laboratories, we're sorry to say tha-\"<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n\"DAMNIT!\" I hollered as I slammed the phone down, but began to feel my stomach growl again as I heard my jeans begin to rip around my big, blobby legs, and my belly growing so large that my shirt covered a third of it as it contained my suddenly existent \"breasts\". A telltale cracking noise from beneath me appeared as my chair buckled under my insta-fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2026gotta\u2026DO SOMETHING!\" I uttered as I thrashed myself to stand up, my body continuing to grow in a stream. I had to weigh well over 400 pounds and still growing. After finally getting on my feet, I lifted my obscene bulk and stood tall, but fell still as I looked above me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe basement was somewhat small; only a foot from my head. It'd never caused me any problems before, but at that moment, I could just notice that I stood a few inches closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was growing in height as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if in response to my discovery, my stomach let out a vicious grumble as it again started to expand, growing so large as to begin to tear at my shirt as it became like a rope around my torso, and my pants formed more larger tears. I put my fattening arms around my stomach, which pushed away as it began to stick out further and further from me. This time around, I could see myself inch closer and closer to the ceiling. By that point, I must've looked like a head on top of a spherical balloon of obese flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut another feeling erupted within me, my eyes becoming pinpricks and I moaned as my gigantic stomach let out a huge rumble, overwhelmed by a feeling of intense...</span></div></div>",

I was desperately hoping that it would pass, that it was just a temporary side effect, but sure enough I'd reached over seven feet in height, and the black rubber of my suit touched the ground as my globular stomach became so grotesquely large that it passed my legs and reached the floor, allowing me to stand supported on my tree-trunk like legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"7'5, 1342 pounds!\" I hollered, but the readings were increasing much faster than I could describe them. \"No, 8'1, 1732 pounds!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n I began feeling at my behemoth of a stomach as it pushed out further and further from my back. It felt incredibly supple and squishy, emphasizing the gigantic blob I was becoming. My arms reached less of my body at my biceps bloated incredibly large, preventing me from folding them in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"9'2, 3319 pounds! No, 9'11, 3734 pounds!

I struggled to lift my balloon-like leg forward around my stomach, succeeding in moving forward a few feet as my stomach. After another few increasingly laboring steps, I managed to trudge forward several more feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Walking is possible\u2026but extremely difficult! Weight reading is\u2026\" I turned my head to look at the small reading on my incredibly swollen arm. \"12'4\", 7327 pounds!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Excellent work, Jacobs!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI struggled to stay upright as the exhaustion of the \"workout\" I'd endured overcame me and I swayed back, failing to maintain balance as I fell backwards and landed on my gigantic butt with an incredibly loud WHAM!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Don't be sitting around, Jacobs! We've got work to do!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm\u2026TRYING!!!\" I uttered through gritted teeth as I tried to heave my monstrous body forward, but to no avail as my ass never left the ground. My body still continued to gain weight, and the suit I wore still managed to stretch around my behemoth stomach as I blew up into a gigantic fat ball. My blobby legs were pushed apart to accommodate my stomach's immense size, and I watched fearfully as I noticed the ground stretch further away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, my belly let out an insanely loud rumble that gave it a generous shake, sweat dripping down as I...</span></div></div>",

Thankfully, all the windows and doors had been properly boarded up, but the idea of what'd I'd become still chilled me to the bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cabin was may miles away from the nearest town, and I'd made sure to make myself as alone as possible. I had no idea how strong I'd become, or whether or not the entire place was barricaded enough to prevent me from escaping. That's what made it scary; not knowing whether or not I could control what would happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, I did all that I could. Every singly possible exit in the home was locked, chained, and boarded tight, so much that a fly could't get in. The only door I'd left open was for the basement, which I filled with food as a second precaution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnything the least bit appetizing that I could get my hands on I bought in massive bulk, filling the food with shelves upon shelves of food, so much that any living thing attempting to eat it all would at least die in one sitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'd hoped it would all serve to distract me until morning, or at least make me so fat as to render me immobile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I peered in a teeny slit in one of the board windows, I gulped as I saw a cloud drift across the sky, exposing the full moon.

The anthro-humans live along side the regular humans but there are key differences. The first one is that anthro-humans tend to be bigger, most averaging around eight feet tall, some up to twelve feet tall. They're bigger and stronger, but they tend to cap off at the intellectual level of a 16 year old human. So you see a lot of anthro-humans working in the trades, as bouncers, as shelf loaders, farmers and more. You would never see an anthro-human doing your taxes. The anthro-humans tend to live outside of big cities and more in rural areas where there is more room to stretch. <br>\r\nAll the anthro-humans in this world are ground mammal based so there are no bird, lizards or whale anthro-humans, but there are skeleton remains of them. <br>\r\nThere is also now human and anthro-human hybrids after centuries of keeping the two separate. In the last thirty years the societies have started to come together more. There were transitions, a few harsh. The NFL fell to pieces because who would want to watch a few scrawny humans play football when you can watch monsters of bears, bulls, dogs, gorillas and even rino humans play? Oh and don't even get me started on on the porn industry. Human guys have been going in for penis enlargement surgery just to try to complete with some of the anthro-human guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat brings us to Jason, our main character.

He lost enough blood to require a blood transfusion..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason felt like he had been hit by a bus or that 10 foot tall bear that plays for the Chicago Bears. Everything a he'd. His neck and back were sorry and he felt like he was tied down.<br>\r\nHe slowly opened his eyes and the ringing in his ears let in the sounds of an hospital room and two arguing people in front of him.<br>\r\n\"...well how was I suppose to know?\" came one muffled voice.<br>\r\n\"The 'H' on the request,\" said the other man,\" Who knows what will happen to this kid.\"<br>\r\n\"Well the kid has a unique need and we didn't have any human blood of his kind in,\" came the first voice, either a technician or a nurse.<br>\r\n\"Shit.. well we will have to see if he reacts to it or not,\" said the second man, likely the doctor.<br>\r\nThen it hit Jason, he had received some anthro-human blood!

His heart pounded at the inside of his rib cage as the alien blood traveled to the last points of his feet and fingers, the stinging sensation coursing out through all his muscles and seizing him of any control, leaving him hot, sweaty, and paralyzed from getting himself any aid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears streaming from his eyes, Jason opened one enough to stare down at his own body, and whimpered at the sight of something about him under the blankts visibly changing, even with their covers. He could see what little pectorals he might\u2019ve owned before developing into two thick slabs of muscle, bulking up enough to audibly stretch the chest of his garbs, and he could feel the sleeves digging into his shoulders as his biceps expanded with the muscle mass gained from a lifetime spent lifting and eating red meat. Even his legs were growing; not just in sinewy bulk, but with a considerable spurt in height as well, his entire frame surging upwards over half a foot in seconds, and accelerated to put a full one on top of that, as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his shoulders widening close to the width of the bed, his heavy legs shifting around uncomfortably for room, Jason watched in fascination as the tingling pain muted over to but a stinging numbness. The bed creaked beneath the extra few hundred pounds of mass resting on top, but he managed a smile as his garbs shrank to conform around his ballooning body and loudly shred around his arms, barely requiring a flex to expand several inches beyond what his sleeves could contain. He opened up his collar to see the results up close, excited to see the results...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...only for his smile to plummet at a field of thick hair spouting from his chest like uncut grass. Even worse, his view of his brilliantly chiseled six-pack only lasted for a few seconds before any definition to his abdomen disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling at his swelling middle, Jason was horrified to realize how <i>soft</i> it was, giving barely any hint to the strength lying underneath; the growth of his muscles slowed down to a crawl, but the bed still groaned and flexed underneath him as his weight <i>skyrocketed,</i> his stomach rapidly inflating under his garbs before shredding through the front like a giant, fleshy yoga ball, its skin displaying a haggard amount of hair spreading down from the chest and around the naval, shrouding him in what was due to become a coat of fur. Those solid pectorals he\u2019d been ogling blossomed into a feminine set of man-breasts that snapped apart what little of the garbs lay clothed on his body. His arms and legs ballooned by several times their newfound girths as his body gained in fat <i>twice</i> the mass he\u2019d gained in muscle, then double <i>that,</i> before his super-sized buttocks poured through guardrails to his bed and tore them from the frame, the mechanics in the bed finally giving with a sickening <i>crunch</i> beneath his evergrowing tonnage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn some vain attempt to keep its relentless expansion contained, Jason grasped his stomach with his hands and pushed down, fighting a losing battle as his stomach continued to rise, foot by foot. By that point it was completely covered in fur, and the excessive hair was traveling down his arms and legs. It was invisible beneath all his blubber, but in the back of his head he could feel the hair growth twisting around the joints and bones of his skeleton into more animalistic anatomies as it spread past, and his eyes fluttered as his IQ dropped by a few dozen points, shedding off a majority of his college education. S large as his gut was becoming, he was wracked by how empty it was; he needed to <b><i>EAT</i></b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the fur covered his plumpened hands and fingers, their fattened digits transformed into that of his donors, all that remained was his head, the fur pausing in its growth before coating what remained of his humanity in one foul swoop, completely transforming his face into that of...</span></div></div>",

Nothing's really\u2026\" But I stopped as I felt my shirt stringing around my arms, becoming tighter. My legs also began to feel more cramped within my pants, as though they were shrinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floor moving downward didn't support that claim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE-!?<i> I'M GROWING!!</i><i>!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any other changes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I DON'T CARE ABOUT ANY OTHER CHANGES!!!

I was about to vent both my relief and fury upon the scientists when a loud rumble came from my stomach. Putting my hands on my abdomen, I jumped slightly as my stomach filled up quickly, as though the toast was expanding within me. My shirt and pants zipper were torn apart as my stomach inflated like a balloon, my sleeves and pants tearing as my arms and legs got fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON?! WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME!!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scientific process, Frank! All part of the future!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't bother to retort as my stomach fattened to the point where it draped over my knees, puffing out further and further. Soon enough it touched the ground, and by that point my obese body had grown so wide that I looked like some sort of fleshy balloon.

Inside I motioned her to follow me up the steps, the creaking of both our footsteps filling the staircase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how's this look?\" I asked as I lead her into the guest room, placing the bags on the floor away from her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad!\" She whistled, stepping to a corner of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, anything I should immediately know about you before we get settled in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't touch my guitar, alright?\" She warned as she knelt down and snapped open its case. It had a smooth red finish with a long, black neck with silver knobs at the end. \"Aside from that, we should do just fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I promise I won't touch it!\" I vowed. She took out a stand from the case and set it in the corner, but as she gently pulled out the guitar I noticed something seemed\u2026off about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile bent down, her legs seemed to be a bit puffier, and her butt actually looked bigger as well, her jeans looking a bit tighter than I immediately noticed. After setting the guitar up she stood up with a tiny amount of difficulty, and I could see that her stomach seemed a bit bigger as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Huh\u2026must've been the bags on her sides.</i> I deduced. \"So, Amira, anything I can get you right now?\"</span></div></div>",

Right this way.\" She said as she all but skipped back to the weird house down the street, I knew about their weird cult but they didn't really do anything. Just huddle around the house, do some chants here and there. Sometimes trying to sell weird looking cookies or something. I just ignored them for the most part. As she brought me in through the door I was at ill ease. While none of the women there were off putting... anymore than a bunch of smiling ladies in matching robes could be... the place was musty and every wall had a myriad of crazy symbols and patterns scrawled on them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soul Keeper, I have the witness.\" The one that brought me said to one of them with a special hood that had some kind of holy symbol made of gold perched on her hood<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful! Please stand right here.\" She said pointing to a definite eye with a pupil made of more crazy symbols swirling into an oval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ebbing kindling, listen for we have our witness. The passing can now commence.\" The Soul keeper explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Toe nook!\" They responded gingerly before bowing in unison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now...\" The Soul Keeper exclaimed, holding out a vial with something pink inside. Two other robed figures came in front of her with a brass cauldron filled with water. \"It begins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe uncorked the vial and dropped it into the cauldron, and immediately, a mushroom cloud of black smoke erupted out that rapidly filled the entire room, burning my eyes as it came down all around me. They didn't fight it off as the gas surrounded them all, but I barely had to breath to begin coughing, the rancid air quickly numbing my brain, and I slumped down in the floor, barely able to tell when my eyes were closed as the all the blackness became so strong, and soon it all overcame my brain...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the police got my statement I shambled home. With being unconscious for so long, by some miracle I managed some sleep. But when I got up that morning the was another knock at the door when I opened it I was shocked to be looked down at from at least eight feet in height with a loving smile from some kind of white furred wolf-woman with bizarre bull horns, claw like finger nails, black eyes with grey pupils and a dragon tail covered in fur, I could tell because she was completely naked with some bizarre symbol burned on her left breast and a spike piercing on her left nipple \"Hello, husband.\" She greeted sweetly before letting herself in, looking at her waddle I saw she had thick sea foam green hair hanging down to her giant butt in natural curls \"Let me make you breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Husband!? What are you!? Why are you in my house!? Ho-how is this happening I-\" But my questions were halted by another giddy laugh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Husband you are so funny.\" I was floored as some purple tusked alligator woman of similar stature walked in but she also had feathered wings, her eyes glowed with an orange hue as well as stegosauri spikes along her back, she too had weird symbols along her body and her lips were much larger with blue lipstick<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You witnessed the passing so by the divine's law we are all your devote wives.\" She said pointing to my yard which was full of them, each one another crazy and huge creature that looked to have parts of other creatures added onto her each with a different set of strange symbols while some of them simply glowed an aura of differing colors<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut emerging through them was a man in a jumpsuit \"Paul Bennetty?\" He asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah.\" I said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here to repossess your TV.\" He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-Oh shit.

Be gone insolent worm! Lest we cleave you to sunder!\" Out of the lot of them a bunny girl with giant ears going down to her waist studded in uniform dangling above several fox tails and a snake tongue coming out of her mouth, holding a gigantic cleaver with eyes sobbing black tears on either side of the blade clutched in her hand<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit!\" I yelled and the repoman was frozen as the rest of them seemed to crowd around him with horrifying demonic weapons appearing in their hands pointed at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Husband, do you desire anything else?\" The bunny asked innocently<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Time out! you can't threaten people like this!\" I said trying to push my way through them.

I just want to see my family!\" He pleaded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry!\" I yelled to him \"Let him go!\" I said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't want to punish him?\" A tiger woman asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!

We live for you!\" The wolf lady said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"St-stop it! Okay so I doubt there's any way out of this so I'm making some ground rules. Don't attack people just because their not being nice. Also clothes! Please just put some clothes on!\" I said \"Why are you even these... animal people!?\" I asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh we didn't choose these bodies.

With luck, the service would be the same as foretold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany years ago, what'd started out as a freak lab experiment exploded into one of the most bizarre, albeit popular fashion trends in history. Contrary to the opinions of some on weight gain, people would begin fattening themselves up to monstrous weights. They'd even begin to increase their heights as well, growing into insanely obese giants ranging from eight to fifty feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt'd been an expensive process, however, only affordable towards the rich. I'd never constantly dreamed about it, being skinny as a rail, but a pretty big recent lottery winning gave me a chance to jump the bandwagon, and I decided to jump on with a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe main lounge was scarcely decorated, boasting a very sleek, futuristic style to the walls and furniture. I was surprised at how little fat people there were inside the lounge when the office doors nearby slid open, and my jaw slacked open in amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the office came the most massive woman I'd ever seen. She'd had to be at least eight feet tall, and almost as wide as she walked on two tree trunk legs trapped in black jeans beneath a jiggling, monstrous gut that stood out incredibly far and was halfway exposed by her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seated her mammoth-sized rear on a seat behind the front desk and began typing away at a keyboard. Once I'd snapped out of my daze and began to approach her, I could see she was squeezed in a miraculously intact white dress shirt that left her monstrous breasts half exposed, her chin almost resting in her cleavage. For somebody of such massive proportions, she was also somewhat attractive, with a clean look and brown hair tied back in a bun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't notice me approach, but her head perked up as I pressed a buzzer on the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I help you?\" She politely inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah\u2026I'm here for\u2026the thing\u2026\" I stammered, and she giggled in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing just gotta get the paperwork ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began typing away at her keyboard, several sheets of paper scrolling out of her printer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready for the big life, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just seemed kind of interesting, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, a first-timer!

After a few minutes, the double doors nearby parted, and I gasped at the behemoth that trudged in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe almost didn't look like a human as much as she did chubby head on a huge balloon of fat, so huge that she was force to maneuver about on a gigantic wagon that allowed her to skid about on feet sprouting from her blobby legs. She had to be at least ten feet tall whilst seated, with a spherical, monstrous belly atop which two huge breasts lay. She was also dressed in an outfit similar to the other clerk's, but obviously larger to accommodate her leviathan girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a\u2026James Dufrey here?\" She chirped in a perky voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh\u2026here!\" I announced as I approached the titanic woman, who glanced over her blobby shoulder to see me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hello, there!

That was quick\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's how we do things here. C'mon, follow me!\" She began scooting her ludicrous bulk towards the doors, and I gave a nod to the clerk as she waved me goodbye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began leading me to my room, going through the assorted facilities of the resort on the way. Sure enough, I couldn't see a single thin person anywhere. Everyone was bloated and fattened to ridiculous proportions, some of which were the size and volumes of houses. Many were lounging about or stuffing themselves with food. Soon enough, I, too, would be going for the ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe reached a tower with enormous double doors before each room. Inside, my room had to be twenty feet tall, with a bed just as square.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah\u2026this place is huge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The place makes the man, we always say.

I looked down wearily at the plate as I sat myself down, having no idea how I was going to finish this all off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting the abnormally head burger to my lips, I took as large a bite as I could. My eyes widened as I was met with an amazing taste the likes of which I'd never eaten; it was probably the best I'd ever had!

I smiled as I looked down at my colossal stomach, which as of late completely covered my chubby lap. It still amazed me how quick this whole thing was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter pushing myself off the bed, I waddled over to a wide scale near the wall, connected to a small monitor on the wall.

The waitress gave a giggle before she pulled the cart away and left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour or so passed as I indulged myself, stuffing down every last bite. My stomach was even rounder and bigger as I licked off the remaining syrup on each plate, the other ones barren dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, that *urp* hit the spot!\" I laughed with a hand on my bulging gut. With my meal done, I pushed myself out of my chair and waddled to the wardrobe and slipped on a warm hoodie.

Presented below is one of several story lines in this path that will show WG, Growth and TF of a more mythical persuasion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pegasus Ring<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt begun in a mysterious shop, looking as if it was the domicile of a wizard and on the table in the middle of the room stood a minotaur\u2019s skull covered in jewelry ready for sell. However, there was one in particular that is the center of our story. This ring was a pink diamond ring with two images of pegasi at the sides of the crystals. It let out a bright glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is just as well, for at that time, a young man by the name of Ryan was walking into the store. He was planning to propose to his girlfriend later in the day, but all he needed was a ring. \u201cHello?\u201d called Ryan as he walked in. Is anyone in here?\u201d However, there was nobody at the main counter of the store. Ryan walked in and saw the pink diamond ring in the center of the table glow. He was immediately enticed by the pegasus ring and walked forward. \u201cAmazing,\u201d he said. \u201cA diamond ring. It\u2019s just April\u2019s color. Horses are her favorite animal. She\u2019ll love it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan reached for the ring when suddenly the minotaur skull opened its mouth. \u201cI advise you to seek another ring,\u201d said the minotaur\u2019s skull in a deep voice. \u201cThis is the enchanted king of pegasus.\u201d Ryan was initially shocked, but figured that it was nothing more than mere ventriloquism and didn\u2019t pay the skull any heed. \u201cWhat is wrong with you?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhoever you are, this isn\u2019t funny. Come and face your customer. I want to buy this ring for my girlfriend.\u201d \u201cThis is no shop for the likes of you,\u201d said the skull. \u201cAnd once that ring finds a finger, there\u2019s no turning back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan let out a scoff. \u201cThat\u2019s what I want. Find, if you\u2019re gonna be that way, I\u2019ll just assume the ring is free.\u201d Ryan put the ring in his pocket and then walked away. The skull just made its eyes glow. \u201cNobody ever listens. Just promise that you\u2019ll be happy with the results.\u201d With that, the lights suddenly went off. It wasn\u2019t long before Ryan and his girlfriend, April were having a picnic on the hill and looking up at the sunlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s so beautiful,\u201d said April as she looked up at the sunset. \u201cThe sunset.\u201d \u201cI can think of something more beautiful.\u201d Said Ryan as he held his girlfriend\u2019s shoulder. \u201cOh you.\u201d Said April. As April giggled, Ryan smiled and reached into his pocket. Ryan handed April a bottle of coke and April was about to drink from it when she gasped and spotted the pegasus ring before letting out a smile. \u201cOh Ryan,\u201d she said. \u201cYou little trickster.\u201d Ryan let out a laugh. \u201cSo what\u2019s you answer, my little pony?\u201d He asked in a joking tune. April quickly slipped on the pegasus ring. \u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cYes. I\u2019ll marry you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the young couple sealed it with a kiss, neither of them noticed the ring glowing or letting out an ominous neigh.</span></div></div>",

Ryan immediately headed for the living room and sat on the couch with a relaxed sigh, April joining him on the other end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So\u2026\" She began with a sigh. \"...we got a date planned, or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't got a ceremony planned straight-up, but I'm thinking next spring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyplace specific where you want it to be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, I'm not picky. Just as long as the ceremony's nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same here. Can I have the ring?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, here.\" Ryan pulled the small box out of his pocket and gave it to her, who smiled at the sight of the bright-pink gem inside. The jewel seemed to glow purple as she slid it onto her finger, observing it at arms reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so beautiful\u2026where'd you find it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just say that life has a way of bringing you such treasured little wonders\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, you dork\u2026\" She chuckled as she jabbed her elbow at him. \"Wanna watch a DVD?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, whatcha got?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's see\u2026\" she pushed herself off the couch with slight strain and walked to the shelves of cases, but stopped in the middle of the room to scratch at her face, groaning slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetie, you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It\u2026It's my face, it's\u2026\" But she didn't as she covered her tingling face with her hands, which were pushed away by her nose and mouth as they stretched from her head and melded into a long, square snout. Her ears also stretched and grew into points, and the skin on her arm turned to a light brown as a soft pelt gradually formed along her body. From behind, Ryan only stared in stunned shock as a black, bushy tail sprouted from her back above her pants, and two appendages grew from her shoulders that stretched through her collar that formed wings as they sprouted long feathers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking her eyes, the itching now subsided, April turned around to face her spouse who returned with a look of horror. The only semblance she bore to herself was her messy black hair, along with the clothes she'd been wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2026\" She softly began, breaking the stupor filling the room. \"I feel\u2026ugh\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held at her stomach as it began to expand, tightening her shirt until a button popped off and exposed the brown-furred flesh beneath. Her paunchy legs started to buckle under her newfound weight as her once slim body blew up bigger and further, pouring itself out of her clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan'd practically forgotten the entire english language as he watched her transformation happen before his eyes. Along with her spontaneous weight gain, she started growing taller as well, making him seem like a toothpick compared to her mammoth-like form. Her clothes miraculously stretched but did little to conceal as foot by foot and several hundreds of pounds of fat by the second filled her, sending her closer to the ceiling and filling up a good chunk of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she was forced to crouch as she came temptingly close to the ceiling, but her extreme size sent her falling back onto her ass with a massive WHUMP!!! Her growth seemed to hasten and sent her closer to the top of the room again, but thankfully came to a stop only inches away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny sign of the slim woman she used to be was absolutely gone. Her stomach was so large that it filled in all the space between her blimp-like legs, puffing out several feet beyond what were now hooves. Her shirt was strained so much that it only hung on by one button, wrapping around a small part of her gigantic breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-wh-wha\u2026\" She began, hoping this was all a dream. \"WHAT HAPPENED TO ME?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I-I-I don't know!\" Ryan stammered. \"I just\u2026but this\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHERE'D YOU GET THAT RING?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh\u2026oh\u2026\" He nervously began. \"I\u2026I was at this weird store and they had all this weird magical stuff, I guess\u2026and they had this ring out that I though was for free, and I just-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MAGICAL!?

I didn't-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WELL, LET'S GET RID OF THE THING!!!\" She screeched as she grabbed the ring and yanked it off her pudgy finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Karmically, hitting Ryan in the forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril saw that as her body was growing bigger and fatter, her wings were actually glowing with bright silver colored sparkles. She looked nervously but Ryan could only look in awe as he saw in front of him an equine ass big enough to crush a car. \"Ryan!\" yelled April as she continued to bulk up. \"You do realize this means you're going to be married to a pegasus!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't panic,\" said Ryan. \"I'll think of something.\" April heard a grumbling noise that knocked Ryan off of his feet before grabbing her bloated belly that looked big enough to hold two Buicks. \"Well you better think of something fast. I'm starving. I feel like I could eat an entire forest.\" Ryan wasn't sure what to do. He had inadvertently turned the woman he loved into a sumo sized pegasus that was still getting bigger</span></div></div>",

INTO A <i>PEGASUS!!!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, sir, but I seem to perfectly remember you running in here and practically swiping it off the counter!

Strength, I might add, that you've just used as an engagement gift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-this is\u2026\" Ryan stammered, clutching his hair. \"This is insane\u2026I've gone insane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, you want me to pinch you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about that ring? What'd it do to her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That ring was the heirloom of Vespa, a pretty powerful pegasus from the outer realms. When you gave it to your wife, Vespa's strength transposed onto her, and she's gonna get more powerful the bigger she gets. Hell, the outer realms limit its inhabitants abilities, so your wife may get even fatter and stronger than Vespa could ever get, or anything else there! Good for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what can I do? How can I reverse this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, buddy, you're on your own.

Ciao!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Ryan could respond, an invisible yanked him by his shirt collar and threw him out through the font door and onto the street. When he jumped onto his feet to ran back inside, he was only met with the local bakery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, god\u2026\" He uttered in despair, walking down the path back home. What could he do now?

Ryan ran in and looked for April. \"April!?\" he yelled. \"April?\" Ryan saw that in the middle of the floor was a large hoof print that was the size of a dining room table. \"Don't tell me that she actually got bigger!?\" yelled Ryan. Ryan then ran out into the street and yelled because he fell into another hoof print, one that looked like it was the size of a car. Ryan climbed out and realized that April was probably huge by now. From the looks of it, she would have to be the size of a house and weigh three times as much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan followed the trail of pegasus footprints and with each footprint getting bigger and bigger, he knew that he really screwed up. \"That shopkeeper knew what he was talking about. She'll just keep getting bigger, fatter and stronger. I am so in trouble. When I tell April that there's no way to turn her back, she's going to be really mad. I'll be lucky if she kills me. But where <u>is</u> April? How could a giant obese winged horse just disappear.\" Ryan saw that the trail of footprints seemed to stop. Then Ryan yelled and slipped. He appeared to have tripped on one of April's feathers. It was the size of a tree and then Ryan gasped. \"She couldn't have!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan immediately ran to the woodland area and climbed the tallest tree as she took out a pair of binoculars. \"Don't tell me that she managed to fly away. How could a horse that huge and fat be even capable of flying. It's impossible. But then Ryan heard flapping and looked up to see something eclipsing the moon. It was April and she landed on the ground with a loud thump that shook the forest. Ryan looked in shock because April was now 150ft tall and was even fatter than she was before with a belly and ass that were both as wide as she was tall, a pair of H-cup (in scale) breasts and four large chins. Ryan also saw that the horse girl's wings had grown big enough to allow her to fly despite her massive bulk. She let out a loud neigh as Ryan looked up in pure shock at how large April had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is Ryan?\" asks April in a much deeper voice than before. \"I hope he's not mad about me wrecking the house, but I got too big to fit in the house.

Ryan immediately rolls out of the way of April's car sized teeth as April continues to stuff her mouth with trees that she chews up. \"April!\" yells Ryan. \"It's me! Spit me out!

The lumber rolled into her mouth and pushed Ryan towards her esophagus. Ryan then let out a scream as he tried to climb the trees. He climbed tree after tree as each fragment fell down the black hole that was the pegasus woman's throat. The fat horse lady put one last tree into her mouth and it was a particularly large one that crushed the other trees already inside her mouth, including one that Ryan was climbing on. Ryan had no choice but to grab onto the branch of this large and tall tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on!\" yells Ryan. \"She can't possibly still be stuffing her face!\" Ryan then heard a snapping and grinding sound and saw that the trunk of the tree was being mangled by April's enormous teeth that were pulling the trunk of the tree in as the pieces fell down her throat. Ryan knew he was in a dangerous situation. He had to choose between being swallowed whole or being crushed by his equine fianc\u00e9e's titanic choppers. Ryan climbed all the way to the end of the tree he was on just as the last branch came apart. \"Oh no.\" Said the young man. Ryan let out a scream as he fell down into the esophagus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside, Ryan was barely visible as a small, pimple-like bulge going down April's throat as the pegasus woman held her wings up high and gave a deep gulp to swallow what little trees she had in her mouth. Inside, Ryan landed with a splash followed by several pieces of trees in April's stomach. He took a deep breath as he swam upwards and climbed atop the biggest pile of leaves and branches he could find. Ryan breathed in and out as he stood on top of the pile and then he looked around in shock. He was in April's belly. \"I can't believe this,\" says Ryan. \"First I give my fianc\u00e9e a magic ring, then she gains more weight than 10 sumo wrestlers, turns into a Pegasus the size of a skyscraper and now... now she ate me. April! April!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan called up to April and even pounded the side of the giantess's belly, making barely noticeable bulges appear on the massive horse gut that was touching the ground. April was rubbing her stomach as she let out a sigh. \"I never knew how tasty trees could be. One of those last ones had something on it that tasted particularly delicious. I wish I knew what it was so I can eat it again. But where <i>is</i> Ryan? I'm getting impatient waiting for him.\" Before April could grouse any further on where her boyfriend was, she felt her stomach growling again and grit her teeth. \"Oh come on,\" she groans. \"I can't <i>still</i> be hungry.\" April's stomach growled again and the horse lady gave a pout before turning her head and seeing the big city up again. She then licked her lips. \"Maybe I could find something yummy there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril flapped her wings, surprisingly lifting her enormous bulk off the ground as she makes her way towards the city.</span></div></div>",

She adjusted her glasses and looked at her watch. \u201cWhat is taking that blockhead?\u201d she asked. The truth was that when it came to boyfriends, Erza lost the lottery. Ian fancied himself a monster hunter, albeit one who has yet to actually catch a monster. The fool had no interest in getting an actual job and believed that he could make a easy living if he actually managed to bag a monster. But all he managed to find trouble and this time would be no different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza heard yelling and turned to see a familiar fool with a large black pompadour. He was running from the other guests of the lodge, mostly large men right before he tumbled. \u201cGet him!\u201d yelled one male skier. \u201cIan?\u201d asked Erza. \u201cWhat did you do now?\u201d The bespectacled woman could only shake her head as she watched Ian get beaten up. Once the mob was done, Erza skied up to Ian. \u201cIan?\u201d she asked as she helped her boyfriend up. \u201cAgain? What the hell were you doing now?\u201d \u201cShows what you know, one of those goons was a yeti, I swear Erza.\u201d \u201cWhy must you always be looking for creatures? We came here to relax.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou came here to relax Erza,\u201d said Ian. \u201cI came here to get bag a yeti.\u201d Erza just shook her head. Ian wasn\u2019t exactly what one would call the perfect boyfriend. In fact, even she couldn\u2019t figure out what she saw in him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIan,\u201d Erza said as she and her boyfriend skied down the hill. \u201cYetis live in the Himalayas. This is Canada.\u201d \u201cMaybe that\u2019s what yetis want you to think. You don\u2019t know monsters.\u201d Erza skied ahead and let out a sigh. None of Ian\u2019s monster hunts ever ended well. One time he thought he bagged a kraken in a lake when it was just a child\u2019s toy. She was seriously considering breaking up with him but for some strange reason, she always insisted on giving him a chance, despite the creature obsession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as she skied closer into the woods, Erza hit something and pratfalled into the snow. \u201cOw! What the\u2026?\u201d Erza then noticed something strange in the snow that looked somewhat petrified. She walked forward and lifted it up. \u201cWhat kind of rock is this?\u201d she asked. The \u201crock\u201d was in the shape of some kind of hand that belonged to some kind of hominid creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Erza grunted in pain as the rock broke in her hands and enveloped her in a strange aura. As the aura cleared, the skier held her head and started to walk back towards the lodge, unaware that her hair was turning white.</span></div></div>",

As she was walking up the mountain, she grunted in pain and looked at her feet. \"What is with these shoes?\" the young woman asked. \"I just bought these and they already feel too tight. What Erza didn't know was that it wasn't so much that the shoes were too tight, but that her feet were getting bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the main lodge, everybody was laughing at Ian as Ian gave a sour look. \"What happened here?\" asked Erza as she walked in. One man stopped laughing and turned to Erza. \"You aren't gonna believe this. That idiot over there threw a net over some kids building a snowman because he thought that he found a yeti. Doesn't the moron know yetis only live in Asia, eh?\" Erza shook her head. That was how it usually went with Ian. She was seriously considering dumping him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she was still his girlfriend and walked up to him. \"Ian,\" she said. \"I'm gonna put this as nicely as I can. You're not exactly cut out for monster hunting. Yetis are not only not indigenous to this area, but they're not real. Just try to enjoy the slopes. We're on vacation.\" Ian just let out a scoff. \"And give up so soon? I'm gonna show those hyenas. One of these days, I will catch a monster.\" Suddenly Ian started to stare at Erza. \"What's with the hair?\" Erza raised her eyebrows above her glasses because she didn't know what he was talking about, let alone the fact that her hair had somehow completely turned as white as snow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach had also started to bulge out as well, not that she noticed. \"Are you putting on weight?\" asked Ian. Insulted, Erza slapped Ian in the face and stomped off. Soon, she was back in the room they rented and was taking off her coat. \"Jerk,\" she said. \"First he ruins our vacation by hunting for stupid cryptids and then he has the nerve to call me fat. I have half a mind to find a new boyfriend and...\" It was at this point that Erza looked into a mirror and gasped. She saw her hair was turning white and that she was getting large in the belly and from the looks of it, in the breasts and thighs as well. \"What in the...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza grunted and then her white hair grew longer and started to extend to her arms, torso and legs, leaving only her gut, breasts, face, arms and legs uncovered by the thick white fur. She grunted as her skin then turned a grayish blue color and she started to grow bigger and her clothes started to tear. She was turning into a yeti, much to her horror and could see that she was growing at a rapid rate, she was already ten feet tall and by her estimate, it wouldn't be long until she was the size of King Kong. \"This was supposed to be a simple vacation.\" The yeti groaned to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there was a knock on the door... but who was it?</span></div></div>",

The instant he was met with the sight of the monstrous, extremely obese snow beast in room, dozens of emotions seemed to flash across his face all at once.

Ian is so thick-headed. After all, this is the same dimwit who tried to look for the <i>Jersey</i> Devil in <i>Kansas</i> and mistook an eel for the ogopogo.\u201d It took Ian two minutes to process what the enormous yeti said to him and then gave a look of total surprise and even dropped his jaw. \u201cIt can\u2019t be,\u201d he said. \u201cErza, is that you?\u201d Erza rolled her eyes. \u201cWell,\u201d she thought. \u201cMaybe there is hope for him after all.\u201d Erza then snorted before speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course it\u2019s me, you idiot! Think before you act for just once in your life, Ian! We\u2019re in North America! Yetis are indigenous to Asia! Wouldn\u2019t that give you a clue that it wasn\u2019t an ordinary yeti you were looking at? Do the research before you go out all willy-nilly.\u201d Ian was stunned. He had not expected Erza to turn into a large yeti. \u201cBut how did you...?\u201d Erza let out a sigh. \u201cWhile you were busy making a fool of yourself, I found what looked like a fossilized hand, my guess is that it was a yeti\u2019s hand and from the looks of it, it was magical.\u201d Ian was now more confused than ever. \u201cBut you just said that yetis were from Asia. How did a yeti\u2019s hand get here?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t ****ing know! Maybe somebody dropped it. Don\u2019t ask me who.\u201d Erza stomped her foot on the ground and accidentally cracked the floor before she blushed slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan grabbed his hair and groaned. \u201cThis is just great. All the time I\u2019ve been hunting cryptids and you turn into one. What gives?!\u201d Erza then grabbed Ian by the back of the shirt with one hand and held him up. \u201cYou think I wanted this to happen?\u201d asked the large yeti woman with a loud snort. Look at me. Look at these feet! Look at this girth!\u201d Erza slapped her stomach before dropping her boyfriend on the ground. Ian looked up to see that Erza was 12ft tall and had to weigh 3 tons, especially in the stomach area. \u201cI didn\u2019t think mutations could be so fattening.\u201d Erza looked down and glared at her boyfriend. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a joke, Ian,\u201d said the abominable snowman giantess. \u201cSomething tells me that I haven\u2019t stopped getting bigger. And what\u2019s worse, there are so many people out there who would freak out royally if they saw a rather huge yeti walking about.\u201d Ian thought about that. \u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be a problem. But don\u2019t panic. Perhaps I can get you out of the lodge later and we can find some place to hide you until...\u201d \u201cUntil what? A yeti as big as me isn\u2019t the easiest creature to hide. Besides, what are you planning to do? Keep me locked up in an attic like a pyromaniac?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan bit his lip nervously because he seriously had no idea where his and Erza\u2019s plans were going and planning was not one of Ian\u2019s specialties. \u201cWell,\u201d said the would-be monster hunter. \u201cThat\u2019s a bridge we\u2019ll jump off when we get there.\u201d Erza shook her head and grabbed herself by the face. \u201cI really wish that you had phrased that differently.\u201d Before Erza could say another word, she heard a loud growling. Ian yelled and reached into his pocket for some kind of weapon before Erza stopped him. \u201cDon\u2019t get overheated, Ian. That was just my stomach. I\u2019m starving. Big surprise. Getting turned into a 3 ton yeti gives you a monstrous appetite.\u201d Erza even patted his stomach as it made a noise like an empty oil drum. \u201cIan,\u201d said Erza. \u201cThere is no way that I could go out there in this condition. I\u2019m going to need you to bring me back lunch.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Honey, I got it.\u201d However, that\u2019s when Ian realized something. \u201cWhat do yetis eat?\u201d \u201cHow the hell am I supposed to know? Yetis aren\u2019t 100% concerned to exist, not counting me, so how could anyone possibly document the diet of a creature that\u2019s so rarely seen? Just get me what I\u2019d normally eat as a human.\u201d Ian nodded his head. \u201cGot it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then Ian had a sudden flash of insight and then walked up to his girlfriend\u2019s knee before he took out his cell phone. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d asked Erza. Ian positioned his cellphone because he was preparing to take a photograph of himself and Erza. \u201cThose people out there think I\u2019m some idiotic jerk. I\u2019m going to show them while at the same time telling off those hecklers on EyePage. I\u2019m going to show them that I at least found a real cryptid.\u201d Erza gave a look of horror. \u201cYou numbskull! That\u2019s the last thing we want.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Erza,\u201d said Ian. \u201cI\u2019m not going to show them your face. I\u2019m not stupid.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a matter of opinion.\u201d Growled the yeti woman as she covered her face with one of her oversized hands. Once Ian took the photograph, he let out a grumble. \"Oh, man,\" he said. \"The sun was in my eye.\" Erza noticed the window was open and closed it so as not to allow anyone to see her in her mutated yeti form. \"Please, Ian,\" said Erza. \"Be careful. I still don't think taking that selfie is such a good idea.\" \"Relax, Erza,\" said Ian. \"With my luck, it's not like anybody would actually believe you were a real abominable snowman.\" Erza let out a roar. \"Abominable snow woman? Seriously, do they think yeti is a male only species. Ian, please just get me some food. I need something in my stomach.\" \"Alright, alright. I'm going.\" Ian was walking out of the room as Erza let out a sigh. \"And while you're at it,\" she said. \"Could you please get me an aspirin. This whole situation is giving me a headache.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan just left and Erza let out a sigh. \u201cThis is going to be a long, long, long trip.\u201d The yeti laid down in the cabin\u2019s bed, crushing it in the process to her embarrassment as she blew a snort of cold air. \u201cOh sure,\u201d she said \u201cAs if this situation wasn\u2019t bad enough. Maybe I\u2019ll rent a movie from the cabin. That should put me in a better mood.\u201d The yeti woman adjusted her glasses to get a good look at the movies but none of them seemed appealing. Vampire Monkey Circus? Oh no. Spiders on the Plain? Good grief. Bengal? What\u2019s with all these films about carnivorous animals, is it monster movie week up here or something.\u201d However, the last movie on the list was the one that irked the yeti woman and made her drop it. \u201cHopelessly Abominable?! Really, a movie about a killer yeti?! That is so offensive.\u201d Erza looked at herself in the mirror and grunted. \u201cEven if that wasn\u2019t me, that doesn\u2019t look like the face of a brutal beast. This sucks. Now I\u2019m going to have to spend the rest of my life as a big hairy ape.\u201d Erza pouted and then she grabbed a hold of her large stomach. \u201cGuess I\u2019ll have to forget about fitting into a size 6 ever again.\u201d As Erza was lamenting the size of her belly, she heard a rather loud ripping noise that caught her by surprise before she let out a sigh. \u201cAnd there go the pants.\u201d The bespectacled ape giantess said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, out in the hallway, Ian was making his way towards the cafeteria when he spotted several snowboarders who spotted him and were laughing at him. \"Well if it isn't the mighty monster hunter.\" \"Finally realized that the yeti was on the other side of the planet?\" \"Hey, monster hunter, there's a werewolf in my granny's closet that you can go after.\" \"What's next on the agenda, hunter? Are you going to go after the Mongolian Death Worm?\" Ian was quickly getting annoyed with those he saw as mocking him. He knew that he had to get food for Erza, but his pride was overriding his common sense and he took out his cellphone. \"Oh yeah? I'll have you know that I found an actual yeti!\" \"Yeti nothing,\" said one of the snowboarders. \"That looks more like a giant llama if you ask me. You can do a lot with photoshop these days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan grit his teeth but then he had an idea. \"We'll see who'll be laughing last, you jerks. I may not have caught a <i>cryptid</i>, but I've at least found proof that one exists.\" Ian took out his computer and hooked his phone up to it so he could get a good look at the photograph of him next to Erza's leg. There was not enough of Erza's body to show it was her but still looked yeti enough for the photograph as Ian was starting to upload it onto the Internet. \"Erza is probably going to kill me for this, but hey. What are they going to do. There's not enough of her showing to raise any eyebrows. That's what Ian thought as he put his yeti photo online.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028Erza at this time had resorted to watching the television without renting one of the movies that made her feel so uncomfortable. At this point she had grown to 20ft tall and her stomach had to be 27ft wide as her butt was 15ft wide and her breasts expanded to a D-Cup. The yeti giantess looked like she weighed 10 tons at the moment. As she sat on what used to be the bed, the yeti giantess\u2019s stomach was rumbling and signaled that she was desperate for food. She grit her teeth because she was growing impatient with Ian. \u201cWhat is taking Ian so long?\u201d the abominable snow giantess thought to herself as she tapped her large feet and cracked the floorboards. \u201cI\u2019m starving here. If Ian doesn\u2019t get me something to eat soon, I\u2019m going to have to go outside and see if there\u2019s something yummy out in the forest. That man has got to be as sucky a gatherer as he is a hunter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza kept flipping through the channels when at that moment...</span></div></div>",

While yetis are indigenous to Asia, one so-called hunter managed to locate an actual yeti. Judging by this very photograph, this yeti is bigger than usual.\" Erza could not believe her eyes.

Renee stopped and chewed on a large slice before she looked at her boyfriend. \u201cCome on, Pat,\u201d said Renee. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t enjoy pizza as much as the next guy.\u201d Pat let out a sigh. \u201cI do love pizza, yes. But I\u2019m not the one eating like a duck.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was true, everyone in the restaurant stared at the girl who had managed to eat six plates worth of pizza. \u201cI really don\u2019t know where you\u2019re putting it all.\u201d Said Pat as he chuckled and shook his head. \u201cAnd you wonder why our dates never make it to the movie.\u201d Renee just shrugged her shoulders before biting on three slices at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally Pat would just deal with it but he looked at the sign on the pizzeria door. \"Renaissance Pizza\u201d it read. \u201cTry Our Kappa Fossil Sushi - First to Finish one Whole Pie, Eats free for a month\u201d. The idea of free pizza for a month appealed to a glutton like Renee and she was willing to try anything. The kappa fossil pizza had yet to arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure if this is such a good idea, Renee,\u201d said Pat. \u201cAfter all, you don\u2019t even know what that kappa fossil pizza is even made of.\u201d Renee just shrugged her shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m sure they wouldn\u2019t sell anything poisonous at a restaurant like this one. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d Renee finished her pizza crust as the waiter came by with the kappa fossil pizza. Pat took one look at it and was disgusted. It was a green pizza that had what appeared to be cucumber slices and strange scales in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI must warn you,\u201d said the waiter. \u201cNobody has ever managed to actually finish one slice of kappa fossil pizza.\u201d Pat let out a scoff. \u201cMy girlfriend will eat anything,\u201d he said. \u201cShe just won\u2019t gain a pound.\u201d \u201cYou heard him,\u201d said Renee. \u201cBring it on!\u201d The waiter laid down the pizza on the table and Renee licked her lips before picking up a slice. She bit into it and her eyes popped. \u201cThis isn\u2019t like any pizza I\u2019ve ever tasted. Heck, it\u2019s not like anything I\u2019ve ever tasted. I like it!\u201d Renee shoved the slice down her mouth as the waiter looked in horror. Pat shook his head as his girlfriend downed the rest of the pizza and finished it off with a swig of soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenee was quite proud of herself. \u201cLooks like I\u2019ve won your challenge. You\u2019ll be seeing a lot of me here more often.\u201d The waiter was more dumbfounded than anything. It wasn\u2019t long before Pat and Renee left in triumph. \u201cThis time,\u201d said Renee. \u201cWe should have enough cash for the movie.\u201d \u201cI still can\u2019t believe you ate all that pizza, Renee,\u201d said Pat. \u201cYou aren\u2019t human.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the pizzeria closed, the waiter gulped. \u201cI told the cook that recipe was not meant for the public, but I didn\u2019t think anyone would be able to stomach it. I should have never stolen that recipe. But maybe it won\u2019t do what it says it will do\u2026 will it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did Renee know, she was about to feel a whole lot green later and all the pounds she should\u2019ve put on from her monstrous appetite would catch up to her.</span></div></div>",

On the screen was a strange reptilian monster with a skull like face rising out of the water as it let out an evil growl and drooled. Pat was shaking in his seat, not just because of the horror movie, but because Renee was doing what should not be possible. She had just about finished a large popcorn bucket, the kind that no human being should possibly be able to finish over the course of one movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can she eat so much after all that kappa fossil pizza?\" thought Pat to himself. \"She isn't human.\" What neither of them knew was that as the movie was going on, Renee's back started shifting and something appeared to be growing. Her stomach and breasts also appeared to be getting bigger as her skin was turning bright green. After the movie ended, Pat and Rene were walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeekers,\" said Renee as she heard her stomach growling. \"I am famished.\" \"You ate an entire pizza you didn't know anything about <i>and</i> that coliseum of popcorn and you're still famished?\" asked Pat in disbelief. \"That sounds excessive even for you.\" Renee let out a scoff as she failed to notice that she was now twelve feet tall and was getting fatter with every step. \"Come on, I've got a fast metabolism. I know a sandwich shop nearby. It's gotta be better than that movie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPat rolled his eyes but then heard a rumbling noise and looked down to see it was coming from Renee's feet. Pat was more than a little surprised that his girlfriend had been turning green but then he gasped because her feet tore through her boots and revealed they were both clawed and webbed. \"That entire plot,\" said Renee as her eyes turned blood red. \"It was unbelievable. I mean, a river monster that could pass as a human being?\" Renee's ears enlarged as a dome appeared on her forehead that was filled with water and her mouth elongated into a beak like that of an alligator snapping turtle. Renee even laughed as her clothes became to rip in the front, revealing strange scaly plates beneath. Finally, her shirt and coat ripped in her back as a giant gray shell covered in spikes appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, monsters don't really exist, right?\" asked the now twenty-foot tall and nine-ton kappa giantess, too busy laughing at the ridiculousness of the movie she saw to realize that she was not the petite human girl she was a few minutes ago. Pat looked in fear at the monster he was dating. \"What was in that pizza?!\" he thought to himself. Renee looked down in confusion at her smaller boyfriend. \"What's the matter, Pat, you look like you've seen a ghost?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPat was dumbfounded. How did Renee not notice that she had turned into a enormous fat kappa who could effortlessly swallow him whole. Does he tell her now or should he wait until they get to the sandwich shop? </span></div></div>",

She gasped and then felt her back and felt the spikes on her shell before looking down to see what kind of monster she had become, unintentionally spilling some water from the dome in his head on top of her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh Pat!

How the heck does a snapping turtle the size of a skyscraper just disappear?\" Suddenly there was a rumbling in the water and huge waves passing 10 feet tall came up. Pat tried to row his way away from the waves but had no luck and yelled as his rowboat was capsized and he fell into the water.

The kappa giantess's stomach had expanded to 200ft wide and her ass was now 150ft wide. Her shell had to be the size of an island at this point and from the looks of it, she had four chins. But that wasn't all. Pat saw that Renee was carrying a large colossal squid in her mouth and was slowly devouring it. \"You have got to be kidding me,\" said Pat. \"She's <i>still</i> eating. The waters aren't safe for anything small enough to fit in her mouth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPat then watched as Renee tilted her head and swallowed the colossal squid right down before letting out a loud belch that forced Pat to cover his ears. The kappa giantess then rubbed her massive stomach as it seemed to be swelling even bigger. \"Renee!\" yelled Pat. \"Renee! Down here!\" However, Renee's head was so high up in the air that the kappa didn't seem to hear him. \"Renee!\" yelled Pat. \"Look down into the water, you fat terrapin idiot! Do you have any idea how much trouble you caused!? A fisherman actually saw you!\" But Renee was too busy belching and rubbing her stomach to pay any heed to Pat. Pat let out a groan. \"You stupid turtle!\" Pat swam up behind his titanic turtle girlfriend and then punched the terrapin on her massive booty. \"Renee!\" yelled Pat. \"Listen to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the water begun to shift into waves and Pat found himself being carried out by riptide, created by Renee's moving body. Pat let out a yell as the turtle giantess looked down into the water. Pat saw Renee scanning the water as the kappa girl waved her tail and lowered her obese head. \"I can't believe it,\" said Pat. \"Did I finally get through to her? Maybe she's not so oblivious after all.\" Unfortunately for Pat, that wasn't it. The water was dark so Renee couldn't get a good look at her boyfriend. But from what she saw, she did something that made Pat extremely afraid. She opened her large jaws and licked her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPat gasped because he suddenly realized what was on Renee's kappa mind. \"Oh no,\" said Pat. \"She thinks I'm a fish! Renee, wait!\" But it was too late, Renee thought Pat was a little fish in the water. A little fish that she wanted in her belly. Renee opened her jaws wide and Pat screamed as he swam for his life. Renee unfortunately was better built for the water and was swimming after Pat with her jaws opened wide. Pat let out a grunt to himself. \"That gluttonous moron!\" Pat thought to himself. \"First she eats weird pizza that mutates her into a skyscraper sized kappa and now she thinks I'm nothing more than a tasty guppy. As soon as this is over, I'm going to break up with her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then as Pat was swimming, he felt the water moving and saw that he was actually moving backwards as he paddled. Pat then turned and screamed because Renee was sucking him into her mouth. Before Pat could escape, he was sucked into his turtle girlfriend's awaiting beak before it snapped shut. Renee's tongue wrapped around Pat and assaulted him as he continued to scream. Finally, Renee held her head up into the air and gave a loud gulp as Pat traveled down her throat in a tiny screaming bulge on the kappa's obese neck. It wasn't long before Pat landed with a splash in Renee's ginormous stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Renee patted her stomach a few times and let out an earth shattering burp. \"What kind of fish was that?\" asked the kappa giantess to herself as she licked her lips. \"It tasted unusual and it seemed oddly shaped. Didn't taste like any fish I've ever had before. But it was sure delicious. I hope I find more of those tasty fish. I wonder when Pat's going to get back and find me. I'm starving.\" The kappa giantess then shrugged her shoulders and started to swim off.</span></div></div>",

Fortunately, there were several pieces of shipwrecks that Renee ate that were floating around and Pat climbed upon the wreckage before he panted heavily. It was there he looked around and couldn\u2019t believe it. \u201cThis can\u2019t be happening,\u201d said Pat in absolute horror. \u201cShe ate me. Renee actually swallowed me. Well, she most likely didn\u2019t see me but....\u201d Pat stopped himself and then yelled as his scream echoed through Renee\u2019s stomach. \u201cThat gluttonous idiot! Knowing Renee, she probably enjoyed my taste. Eaten by a kappa. Never thought it would end like this.\u201d Pat grunted as one of his shoes fell into the stomach fluid and sank. Pat looked around to see several whale skeletons floating around in the digestive fluids. \u201cUgh,\u201d said Pat as he held his nose. \u201cIt totally reeks to high heaven in here. What does she, eat everything in her path? Well that\u2019s a stupid question. It\u2019s Renee.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly all of the stomach juices begun to shake and waves came up into the sky, forcing Pat to duck into the shipwreck\u2019s cabin as the stomach fluids came down. Several of the whale skeletons sank right before Pat looked out to see hundreds of fish coming down, some of which landed on the deck. Pat let out a groan of absolute amazement. \u201cI swear,\u201d he said. \u201cShe would eat the moon if she could. I really hope that she doesn\u2019t get that big though. I...\u201d Suddenly, the entire ocean of digestive slime expanded as more and more fish came from the sky. Pat gasped and then ran out just as an octopus fell on his head and he groaned in disgust before shaking it off. Pat then screamed as a swordfish landed next to him and almost impaled him. Pat saw the stomach expanding and realized Renee had most likely just gotten bigger but since he was inside of her stomach and couldn\u2019t get a look at his kappa girlfriend, he didn\u2019t know exactly how much bigger she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that time, Renee was 200ft tall and had a 150ft wide ass, 350ft stomach and E-cup breasts. Her shell had also gotten bigger to compensate and her hair appeared to have gotten longer. At that moment, the kappa giantess was shaking a fishing boat in the air in order to drop the contents into her mouth as the fisherman was hiding in the cabin and screaming. Once every last fish was dropped in, the turtle giantess licked the hull and then put the ship down in the water. She let out a sigh and shook her head as she continued to swim through through the water. \u201cThose fish were yummy,\u201d the giantess said to herself. \u201cBut<br>\r\n that other fish back there was much yummier. I wish I knew what it was.\" Suddenly, Renee stopped herself and then she let out a rather loud and thunderous belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused her stomach to shake up and Pat had to jump off of the shipwreck he was on as it sank and landed on the skeleton of a sperm whale that Renee had feaster on. Pat had to hold on his ears to make sure that Renee's burping didn't make him go deaf. \"So crying out loud, Renee!\" yelled Pat. \"That was so loud that my ears are still ringing! You're gonna give me tinnitus!\" Once the stomach stopped shaking, Pat let out a groan. \"Well,\" he said. \"It could've been worse. It could've come from the other end. I have got to get out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly something dripped from up above. Pat stood up and saw that several tentacles were coming down from the esophagus. \"What in the?!\" Before Pat could even react, into the stomach dropped a colossal squid that Renee swallowed. \"Oh no!\" yelled Pat. \"Oh geez! Oh no!\" The squid rose out of the stomach juice and let out a hiss at Pat as Pat was clearly very afraid. \"Nice giant squid,\" said Pat uneasily. \"Good giant squid!\" The squid let out a shriek and swung its tentacles as Pat had to jump from the whale skeleton he was on to the neck as it shattered to pieces. from the hooked tentacles of the monstrous squid. The squid let out another roar as it reached its tentacles out to try and grab Pat who was yelling as he tried to get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just had to eat a colossal squid didn't you, Renee?!\" yelled Pat. \"You gluttonous pig! You just have to eat everything in sight don\u2019t you!? When I get out of here, you are <i>so</i> going on a diet!\" Outside, Renee was feeling her stomach and groaned. \"I forgot,\" said the turtle giantess. \"Squid never agrees with me.\u201d Renee let out another belch and her head was spinning. Inside of her stomach the squid was still chasing after Pat who was screaming before the squid sprayed out some ink. Pat slipped on the ink and was grabbed by the squid\u2019s tentacles. The squid let out a shriek and Pat begun to sweat. The squid squeezed Pat tight and Pat struggled in the creature\u2019s grip and before he noticed an anchor in a sinking ship. Pat grabbed the anchor and assaulted the squid with it to make it yell before the squid dropped Pat in the stomach fluid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI still can\u2019t believe I\u2019m not being digested,\u201d thought Pat as he held his breath and tried to swim through the slime. \u201cMaybe it just takes kappas longer to break down their food.\u201d The squid was swimming after Pat but Pat found a submarine that Renee swallowed and swam inside of it. The squid wrapped all around the sub as Pat was looking around in surprise. \u201cYou have got to be kidding me,\u201d said Pat. \u201cA submarine? Where did she find a submarine. For that matter, why did she eat a submarine in the first place. This thing looks like it was left over from World War II.\u201d The colossal squid continued to squeeze hold of the submarine as Pat begun to sweat and searched the submarine for weapons. \"Come on!\" he yelled. \"Come on! Come on! Come on! There's gotta be something in here that can fight off a squid!\" Pat was more than desperate to find something on the submarine because the squid was tearing into it with its long and hooked tentacles and sharp beak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside, Renee was continuing to stuff her face and had swallowed several oarfishes as if they were spaghetti and let out another belch. \"I'm still hungry,\" she said. \"And I wonder how Pat's doing back in the city. Maybe he's confronted the pizza parlor owner and found a way to turn me back to normal. If not, I hope he at least brings back pizza. I better move out of here. I'm getting sick of seafood and my stomach feels like a whirlpool.\" Renee burped again. \"Ugh,\" she said. \"That squid was definitely not the best thing I ever ate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the stomach of the titanic kappa beast, Pat was still searching the ship for any weapon that could dispatch a colossal squid. \"Aha!\" yelled Pat. \"Ah!\" The squid had almost broken through the hull of the submarine right before Pat pulled a switch and the submarine made a shrieking sound accompanied by very slow movement. The squid turned and looked in surprise because what Pat did was activate the torpedo launcher in the submarine. The squid loosened its grip but it was too late because Pat fired the torpedo and the squid had to hold onto it as it was sent barreling right through the stomach acid and destroyed several shipwrecks in the process. The colossal squid swam down to the bottom of the stomach just as the missile continued to move through Renee's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenee was stomping through the ocean towards shore at the time when the torpedo hit the side of her stomach and forced her to hold her stomach in pain right as the torpedo exploded in her stomach. The kappa got on her knees and roared in pain before she let out a thunderous fart that blew several fish out of the water. Renee let out a roar of distress that turned into a moan and held her stomach and butt in pain. \"Oh,\" she groaned. \"Oh. Bad squid, definitely bad squid. I feel like I have to swallow a truckload of antacids. Bleh. It's not medicine I want. It's food. I wish I still had my cellphone so I could call that boyfriend of mine and ask him what's taking so long. Where is Pat anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPat was still in Renee's stomach and he was panting as he was now safe from the colossal squid. \"That girl definitely needs to lay off the seafood. Wait. What am I doing. I'm still in her stomach. There is no way I'm coming out the other side or being dissolved into Pat soup. Maybe I can use something she swallowed to my advantage and get her to cough me up.\" Pat looked at the controls of the submarine and then smirked. \"Maybe if I fired another missile, it would irritate her stomach just enough to make her barf.\" Pat smirked and tried to fire another torpedo but all the torpedo launcher did was make a clicking sound. Pat tried again but heard the same sound. \"Dammit!\" he yelled. \"You've got to be kidding me. Only one torpedo and I used it on the squid?! Crud. No need to panic, Pat. Maybe you can get this hunk of junk running. I hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as Pat was trying to activate the controls of the submarine, all the control box did was blow smoke in his face as he coughed. \"Crap! I should've known. This submarine has been lost in the ocean for decades and probably had its engine eroded by saltwater if my girlfriend's stomach acid didn't finish the job.\" Suddenly there was loud rumbling. \"What now?\" asked Pat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, people were screaming and running as Renee stomped into town. The colossal and hungry kappa was stomping the street to pieces as her belly was pushing down buildings and flattening cars under its hulk. Renee bent down and grabbed a fruit stand before throwing it into her mouth and then plucking out several small trees before chewing off all the foliage.\" Inside his girlfriend's belly, Pat noticed fruit scraps sinking into the ocean and moaned. \"That idiot!\" he yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPat exited the submarine and boarded a catamaran swallowed by the beast to see all manner of scrap falling into Renee's stomach and splashing into the water. Of course, things are only about to get worse because at that moment.</span></div></div>",

The driver, a young Chinese woman with purple hair was beeping her horn. \u201cMove it jerks!\u201d she yelled in the intense gridlock. Her husband was looking at her nervously. This tended to happen when they were caught in traffic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmber,\u201d said the young man to his wife. \u201cI think there\u2019s a school bus up ahead. Maybe that\u2019s why\u2026\u201d \u201cShut it Dale!\u201d yelled Amber. \u201cIt\u2019s almost summer. That bus should be out of service at this time. Move it! At this rate we\u2019ll be late for work. Geez, why did it have to be sixty degrees outside. I\u2019m sweating like bacon.\u201d Dale just rolled his eyes. He was used to this. He knew that Amber had a temper when he married her, but she wasn\u2019t a mean person. She just let her emotions run her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the traffic was moving and Amber started to drive through the slowly breaking gridlock. \u201cAmber,\u201d said Dale. \u201cOne of these days your temper is going to get you into trouble.\u201d Amber just let out a scoff. \u201cHow so?\u201d she asked. \u201cWell, for one, you\u2019re speeding.\u201d Amber glared at her husband, causing him to cower back. \u201cI for one do not feel like arguing with the postmaster. It\u2019s a nightmare enough working at the post office without being late.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Amber sped down the road, she eventually came to a cross walk and didn\u2019t see a middle aged looking women dressed like a teenager in a hoodie walking down the street. \u201cAmber!\u201d yelled Dale. \u201cLook out!\u201d Amber suddenly stopped as she looked in shock at the woman who could only flinch as she was nearly run over. Of course, as she stopped, Amber just had to give the woman an earful. \u201cYou stupid crone! Get off the road! I could\u2019ve killed you!\u201d The woman just let out a scoff. \u201cI had the right of way, thank you. You would\u2019ve noticed the stoplight if you\u2026\u201d \u201cYou criticizing my driving?!\u201d yelled Amber. \u201cMy husband and I are gonna be late because of you. Get lost!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman just stuck up her nose and walked across the road before the light turned green and Amber and Dale were on their way. \u201cSomething tells me you shouldn\u2019t have done that, Dear.\u201d Said Dale. Amber just scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber would\u2019ve done well to have controlled her temper, because what she didn\u2019t know was that that woman was in fact the legendary witch Circe and she gave an evil smirk. \u201cThat girl has the manners of a wild boar,\u201d she said. \u201cWhich truth be told, isn\u2019t that bad an idea. When I\u2019m done with her, she\u2019ll be the world\u2019s biggest boar.\"</span></div></div>",

Dale however, was feeling uneasy about his wife losing her temper at the woman from earlier. \"Amber,\" he said. \"Don't you think you were a little too hard on that woman?\" Amber gave a glare. \"It was her fault for not looking before crossing the freakin' street. Besides, she looked like a deadbeat. Someone her age shouldn't dress like that. Get a job, freak.\" Dale shook his head. He knew no good could come from this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the couple reached the post office, Amber parked the car and when she was about to walk out, she grunted because she hit her head on the ceiling of the car, as if she had mysteriously gotten taller. Then she struggled to squeeze out of the car door, as if she had mysteriously gotten wider. This resulted in her struggle breaking the door off the car as Dale looked in surprise. \"Cheap, defective, piece of junk!\" yelled the hot-tempered woman as she stomped away. Dale was the only one who knew it at the time but as he saw Amber walking into the post office, he noticed that not only had her butt grown to be five feet wide, but she also appeared to sprout a pig's tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDale took off his glasses to rub them but he was still concerned for his wife. Speaking of which, Amber met with the postmaster who wasn't pleased she was late. \"You're late, Wu.\" \"Well, sorry,\" said Amber sarcastically. \"Traffic was a nightmare.\" What Amber didn't notice was that he ears had started to form to a point and her teeth started to turn into fangs. \"Maybe if you weren't such a road hog,\" said the postmaster. \"Your temper is out of control.\" Amber let out a scoff. \"You're starting to sound like my husband.\" The postmaster nodded his head. \"Well, you and your husband will be delivering the mail down Main Street today and this time, he's driving. You're already too fired up to be in driving condition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Asian woman rolled her eyes. \"Whoop de foo,\" she said in a snarky tone. \"Back on the road from hell.\" Dale let out a sigh and his wife had to follow him out back. \"By the way, Amber,\" said the postmaster. \"You might want to have somebody look at your teeth, they look like fangs.\" Amber let out a snort but failed to notice that in her mouth at the sides, size razor sharp tusks were forming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Amber and Dale were in the mail truck making their rounds, Amber had bloated to ten feet tall and now looked like she weighed a ton and was feeling herself in the stomach. \"All that anger is eating you alive inside,\" said Dale to his wife. \"And I'm pretty sure that that woman did something to you. Haven't you noticed that you've gotten a little... bigger.\" Amber growled at her husband as they arrived to deliver a package. \"Watch it, Dale.\" She said as she stepped out. \"The sooner we get this deliver done, the better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Amber was walking towards the door and knocked on it, she accidentally caused the door to crack. \"Huh?\" asked Amber. Suddenly Amber grunted and then she yelled as her fingers turned to claws. \"Amber!\" yelled Dale. Amber's stomach and thighs ballooned up before her feet turned into hooves and burst right through her boots. Then six tusks sprouted out of the side of her mouth as it stretched out into a snout and her nose turned into that of a pig. Amber let out a snort that evolved into a squealing roar of agony as she was turned into a wereboar the size of a...</span></div></div>",

As Amber's transformation into a wereboar was almost complete, she had become 60ft tall with an 85ft belly and ass that tore through her postal pants as well as a pair of D-cup breasts that reduced her shirt to a bra. Finally, her tusks grew sharper and her remaining teeth turned into razor sharp yellow fangs as her skin turned blood red and grew fur all over her body to match. Amber let out a squeal as she held her head and her curly tail stood out. \"Oh my gosh!\" yelled Dale. Amber just continued to squeal as she dropped the package and walked up to the address, smashing the porch beneath her foot just as the homeowner walked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man looked up at the giant boar woman in a postal outfit and screamed as he stood back. Amber looked down to reveal that her eyes were now glowing bright red. \"Go ahead and take a picture, asshole,\" she said. \"It'll last longer. What's the matter? Never seen a mail <i>woman</i> before.\" The homeowner was muttering in fear before Amber lowered her head and snorted steam into his face. \"Don't just stand there looking like a dipstick, sign the stupid clipboard for your stupid package whatever the mother of **** it's supposed to be.\" \"Amber,\" said Dale. \"Calm down.\" \"Shut up, Dale!\" The customer nervously signed for his package and then ran off screaming. Amber just gave a snort. \"He's not even taking the stupid package. That is unspeakably rude.\" \"Uh, Amber,\" said Dale. \"I think you should be more concerned at the fact that you're a giant wereboar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber looked at her reflection in the side of another building and let out an angry squeal. \"As if I didn't have enough trouble today. Amber then sat right down, forcing Dale to move out of the way to avoid being squished with the mail truck underneath his porcine wife's meteor-sized ass. Amber was breathing in and out from her snout as she was fuming with rage. \"Uh,\" said Dale. \"Amber, honey. I think maybe that woman you were arguing with earlier must've been a witch. She probably cast a spell on you to turn you into a wereboar.\" \"Gee,\" said Amber sarcastically. \"Did you figure that out or did that mouth breather mother of yours help you with it?!\" \"You need to calm down, Amber,\" said Dale. \"Maybe if you apologized to her than...\" Amber just spat a loogie out that landed at her tiny husband's feet. \"Is it <i>my</i> fault that that woman was such a hothead?! Forget it! I wasn't in the wrong, so I won't apologize!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDale shook his head. \"You know, my mother didn't want me to marry you. She told me that you were a stubborn pig. I guess now she's right on both counts.\" Amber then grabbed Dale and squeezed him between her clawed fingers as he yelled in pain. \"I SWEAR DALE, IF YOU DON'T SHUT UP AND STOP LECTURING ME RIGHT NOW, I WILL MAKE YOU INTO *****ING HOG FEED!\" Dale figured that there was no reasoning with his giant obese pig of a wife and made a gesture that he was zipping his lip. As Amber let out a snort and got up to stomp away, the remains of the mail truck fell from their spot being plastered to her right butt cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber was stepping through traffic and people were beeping their horns at the giant pig woman. \"Move it, Ms. Piggy!\" yelled one driver as he tried to ram her heel with his car. \"Out of the way, road hog!\" Amber was getting angrier and angrier. \"Yeah! That's REAL smart! Arguing with the 60ft tall pig woman! Shut your traps, jerks!\" Dale just let out a sigh. If this was how mad she was now, she would be hard to live with from now on. As soon as they got back to the post office she would no doubt get into another fight with the postmaster. Dale knew Amber's temper was horrid before but now that she was a pig the size of a kaiju, it would only get worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere is Amber headed now?</span></div></div>",

The post office is the other way.\u201d Amber gave a snort. \u201cTo hell with the stupid postmaster,\u201d she said. \u201cHe can\u2019t tell me what to do. I\u2019m getting something to eat. I\u2019m starving.\u201d The pig giantess stomped away as her husband was trying to hold onto her shoulder. \u201cAmber,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t you think that we should report back to the post office first. We\u2019re still on the job. If we take too much time off, we might get fired.\u201d \u201cOh goodness me,\u201d said Amber sarcastically and rather rudely. \u201cThat\u2019s way worse than being turned into a giant, magenta-skinned, tremendously obese wild boar!\u201d Dale shook her head as Amber walked away and yelled because somebody crashed their motorcycle into the pig giantess\u2019s heel. The young man in the motorcycle gasped and got off his vehicle as Amber turned her head and gave him a vicious glare. The pig let out an angry squeal and then she stomped on the motorcycle to shatter it to pieces. This only served to make her squeal in more pain because some of the metal got stuck in the bottom of her hoof. \u201cDammit!\u201d yelled the giant pig. \u201cI stubbed my ****ing toe!\u201d Amber dragged her foot in pain as she moved away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know,\u201d said Dale. \u201cYour temper got you into this mess and a bad temper plus a 60ft pig woman is a bad combination. Somebody might decide that you\u2019re a threat.\u201d Amber turned her head and glared at her husband as she showed him her long tusks and her enormous teeth that looked more like the teeth of a shark than a pig. \u201cListen here, Dale,\u201d she said. \u201cI am really not in the mood for your preaching. If you keep this up, you\u2019ll be sleeping in my ass for five weeks!\u201d Dale shook his head. \u201cShe\u2019s more stubborn than ever,\u201d thought Dale to himself. \u201cIf she gets too mad she might wreck the city. Man, why didn\u2019t I listen to mom. She told me that marrying such a stubborn pig would give me nothing but grief.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Amber\u2019s stomping took her to a cornfield and the pig giantess licked her lips and tusks. \u201cAmber,\u201d said Dale. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d \u201cWhat the mother of **** does it look like, Dale? I told you I was hungry. It\u2019s feeding time.\u201d \u201cAmber! This isn\u2019t our property!\u201d \u201cShut your trap, Dale! Besides, the crows don\u2019t own this cornfield either. Now leave me alone before I decide to eat you.\u201d Dale just slapped himself in the face and let out a moan. \u201cThis is going to be a long, long, long day.\u201d Amber let out a squeal and opened her mouth wide as she was messily devouring corn anad maize and scattering corn kernels over her face as she swallowed corn cobs. Dale gagged in disgust as his porcine giantess of a wife continued to devour her meal. She even went so far as to devour a scarecrow that was in the cornfield as well. In seconds, there was a large patch of dirt where there once was corn and Amber let out a loud belch that knocked several partridges out of the sky. The pig lowered her head and then noticed the birds on the ground before she slurped them up with her tongue as well and then let out a smaller but still very loud belch that made Dale cover his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGeez!\u201d yelled Dale. \u201cShow some class, Amber! You very nearly gave me tinnitus! If that came out the other side, I\u2019d keel over.\u201d Dale then looked and saw the damage that his wife\u2019s feast had done. \u201cUgh. What a mess. You know, the people who planted all that corn aren\u2019t going to like this.\u201d \u201cOh yeah?\u201d asked the wereboar giantess. \u201cWhat are they going to do against a 60ft tall pig woman.\u201d \u201c60ft tall?\u201d asked Dale. \u201cUh, Amber.\u201d Amber heard  a ripping sound and then saw her ass and thighs had expanded and reduced her postal pants to a loincloth that was barely big enough to cover her heart-printed panties. At this point, the pig woman had actually gotten bigger. She was now 85ft tall  with a 110ft tall stomach and ass. She also had a prominent triple chin. \u201cOh geez,\u201d grunted Amber. \u201cLook at how big I am now.\u201d Dale was legitimately afraid now. His wife was still getting bigger and bigger. Who knew how big she would be when she finally stopped. \u201cAmber,\u201d said Dale. \u201cYou\u2019re now a pig the size of Godzilla. Perhaps maybe we should find that witch and apologize.\u201d \u201cWhen I fly!\u201d yelled Amber at her husband. Amber then heard a loud gurgling noise and looked down to see her stomach was still growling. \"You have got to be kidding me?\" asked Amber. \"I just ate and you're telling me I'm still ****ing hungry! What more do you want from me! The pig snorted angrily and then walked away to try and find something else to satisfy her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber walked up towards the reservoir and stomped in as a security guard spotted her and let out a scream. \"Amber?!\" yelled Dale to his giant porcine wife. \"What are you doing now!? This is the reservoir!\" Amber paid her tiny husband no heed and then stuck out her large tongue to suck up the water. \"Hey!\" yelled the guard. \"Stop that, you, you pig!\" The guard shot at Amber but her obese neck deflected the bullet. Amber let out a grunt and then turned her head as her eyes glowed bright yellow and the ginormous wereboar gave the guard an angry glare. \"Excuse me,\" said the pig titaness. \"Do <i>I</i> shoot at <i>you</i> when you're taking a drink!? I happen to have an upset stomach and I would appreciate being uninterrupted here!\" The guard stepped back as Amber continued with her drink. Dale could only look in embarrassment. \"I'm really sorry about my wife's boorish behavior. Ugh. Poor choice of words.\" The guard looked in surprise. \"Your wife?! What could you possibly see in such a big, fat, mean, ugly porker.\" Amber held out her sharp fingernails and was about to grab the guard when Dale pulled on her ear to make her squeal in pain. \"Let him live, Amber! Let him live!\" The guard ran off right before Amber grabbed Dale and squeezed him as he yelled in pain. \"Don't! You! Ever! Pull! My! Ear! Again!\" Dale shivered in fear as his obese pig giantess of a wife stared down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Amber had half-emptied the reservoir and rubbed her stomach before she let out another thunderous belch and then there was another gurgling. Without warning, the were boar giantess let out an enormous planet-shattering fart that completely devastated a nearby brick wall. \"Oh my gosh!\" yelled Dale as he coughed and grabbed hold of his nose. \"Amber! That is so nasty!\" \"Oh cry me a ****ing river,\" said Amber to her minuscule husband. \"I'm a literal pig. What do you expect. Just be glad you weren't at ground zero or you'd be a charred up skeleton by now! Come on Dale, we're leaving to find something else to put in my big belly.\" Dale could not believe it. \"Seriously, Amber? You can't still be hungry?\" Amber gave a snort. \"What do you want from me?! I think that when I got turned into a wereboar, I was also cursed with an insatiable hunger. Oh, I need food right now!\" The boar giantess walked away again in search of food and as she walked away, she went into the mountain area and started to tear away and eat an entire mountain as Dale looked on in disbelief. He walked onto one of his wife's six long tusks and then he heard his cellphone ringing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDale gulped and learned all too well that the postmaster was on the phone. \"Oh no,\" he said. \"The postmaster. Uh, hello.\u201d \u201cDale!\u201d shouted the postmaster on the phone. \u201cWhere the hell are you?! We need you and your wife back at the post office. You\u2019ve been gone an hour longer than you should\u2019ve!\u201d \u201cUh, something happened that we didn\u2019t see coming, sir.\u201d \u201cDid you get into an accident.\u201d \u201cUh, not exactly.\u201d \u201cWell, you had better return quick or you\u2019re both fired.\u201d Dale gave a gulp as the postmaster hung up. At that moment, Amber had finished devouring the mountain and let out a snort. \u201cBig mouth. I am really getting tired of him pushing us around!\u201d \u201cAmber, calm down. After all, he is our boss.\u201d Amber gave a snort. \u201cBoss, boss, boss. Let\u2019s see him try to pick on me now.\u201d \u201cAt any rate,\u201d said Dale. \"He's right. We need to get back to the post office as soon as possible. We don't want to lose our jobs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDale's enormous wereboar wife just gave a snort. \"Oh sure,\" she said sarcastically. \"We don't want to lose that deadened backbreaking job that pays the garbageman even more than us. Besides, I'm in charge of this relationship and we are not going anywhere until I've had enough to eat.\" Dale was completely mortified. \"You have got to be kidding me! You just razed an entire cornfield, half-emptied out a reservoir and right now you've finished off an entire mountain. How can you still be...\" The pig giantess just gave an angry roar. \"What do you want from me, you little twerp!? Do you think I like being this hungry all the time!? Do you think I like being a giant gluttonous wereboar! I need something in my belly right now or my stomach is going to tear me apart!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly something occurred to the titanic pig and then she stared at Dale who looked in surprise at his monstrous wife. Amber just gave a deep squeal. \"Uh, Amber,\" said Dale. \"Are you feeling okay.\" Dale then gasped as Amber adjusted her gaze to him and then opened her mouth and licked her tusks. Dale was horrified because his wife's intentions were clear. \"Amber,\" he said. \"Please control yourself.\" Dale then grunted as the boar woman grabbed him by the shirt and lifted him in the air over her head. \"Dale, Sweetie,\" said Amber. \"Do you remember what the preacher said at our wedding? Love, honor and obey? Well, you can honor my decision to drop you in my mouth.\" Amber opened her mouth wide and Dale looked down in pure fear at the pit that led to his porcine wife's stomach. \"Amber! Snap out of it! That's just the curse talking! I'm your husband for crying out loud! Please don't eat me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Amber at this point was drooling as she prepared to swallow her husband and let out a snort as she awaited her tiny snack.</span></div></div>",

Well, as long as it keep her from eating me.\u201d Amber started to violently dig into the ground as she squealed and bit away at the dirt. \u201cAha!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder the dirt, Amber had discovered a bushel of truffles growing in the ground. \u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d Dale looked in shock. \u201cOh my gosh,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen so many truffles in one place.\u201d Amber smiled, licked her lips and then drooled. \u201cOh yes. And they\u2019re going to another place. Namely, my belly.\u201d Amber shoved her face into the ground and scooped up an entire mouthful of enormous truffles. The pig woman messily devoured the truffles when Dale realized something. \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d he said. \u201cPigs are used to search for truffles. Amber!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber gave a snort and turned her attention to her husband. \u201cDo you mind!? I\u2019m eating over here! I could still eat you, you know!\u201d Dale found himself with a front row seat to his wife\u2019s massive teeth and that made him nervous. He narrowly avoided being inside her mouth and he sure as heck didn\u2019t want to risk getting eaten. \u201cAll I\u2019m saying,\u201d said Dale. \"You can find truffles. Truffles are valuable. We could make a fortune.\" Amber gave a snort. \"I have a better idea! I eat these truffles and you shut up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was then the sound of strange laughter. That woman who cast the spell on Amber had appeared before the couple. \"So,\" he said. \"How are you enjoying the curse?\" Amber let out a growl. \"You!\" You yelled. \"The jaywalker! Give me one good reason why I shouldn't swallow you whole!\" Dale then realized something. \"Amber!\" he yelled. \"Don't do anything rash! That woman is the one who turned you into a wereboar to begin with.\" Amber glared as she looked down at the woman who was smiling wickedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust who the hell do you think you are!?\u201d yelled Amber. The woman gave a scoff. \u201cHave you even read the Odyssey? My face is well known in Greek Mythology.\u201d Dale gave a gasp. \u201cYou\u2019re Circe aren\u2019t you? The witch who turned sailors into pigs.\u201d Circe let out a laugh. \u201cNot always. I turned Odysseus\u2019s men into the animals that best fit their personality. Your wife was so stubborn, rude and might I say, pig-headed that I decided to make her outside match her inside. But with a twist. Her bad temper and personality would cause her to expand as long as she\u2019s a pig.\u201d Amber let out a squeal and tried to step on Circe, but Circe quickly moved out of the way. Then, Amber felt her pants rip even more than they already had and saw that she seemed to have gotten slightly taller. She was now 100ft tall and her ass and belly had expanded to 150ft wide and her breasts had ballooned to H-cups in scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, what I mean,\" said Circe as Amber crushed several trees underneath her large hooves. \"You'll be a giant pig for the rest of your life. But then again, you were a pig before I made it much more apparent.\" Circe then faded away as Amber growled. \"Amber,\" said Dale. \"If you keep acting up, you'll only get bigger and fatter. You need to calm down.\" The wereboar giantess continued to growl. \"Hear me out!\" yelled Dale standing up for himself. \"Your bad attitude is only getting you in more and more trouble. But your nose for truffles has given me and idea. We're probably going to be fired from the post office, but if we could dig for and sell truffles, it might more than make up for it. Would you be willing to control that awful temper of yours for the sake of logic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut is Amber willing to listen to reason?</span></div></div>",

They never fought and while Diego was prone to making poor decisions and not thinking things through, Angela never held it against him and could see the good in anyone\u2019s heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was just one problem with their relationship. Diego was saddened by the fact that he married a woman who was born blind. It didn\u2019t bother Angela or affect her ability to paint the most visceral pictures this side of their town, it broke Diego\u2019s heart that his wife couldn\u2019t see the world in all its beauty. He wished that he could find some way to open her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat day, Diego was going into town to do some shopping. Angela\u2019s birthday was coming up and while she\u2019d be happy with anything he gave her, he wanted to give his wife the one thing that nobody could give her. The power to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Diego was pondering what to do, he heard screaming and turned his head. \u201cHoly frijoles!\u201d he shouted as he saw an old man drowning in a nearby lake. Wasting no time, Diego dove in after the man and pulled him to safety. The man gave a gasp and sputtered before he saw the young man that saved him. \u201cGracias young man,\u201d he said. \u201cI owe you my life.\u201d \u201cNo problemo,\u201d said Diego. \u201cI can\u2019t ignore a dude in trouble. That\u2019s my wife rubbing off on me.\u201d \u201cOh?\u201d asked the man. Diego gave a frown. \u201cMy wife, Angela, she\u2019s the greatest. She\u2019s turning 28 next week and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou seem to be troubled young man,\u201d said the old man. \u201cWhat is wrong?\u201d \u201cAngela is the sweetest woman I\u2019ve ever met. She\u2019s put up with this idiot without so much as a complaint and she\u2019s the best painter I\u2019ve met. But, she\u2019s blind. I\u2019ve always wanted for her to be able to see. That\u2019s what I\u2019d like to give her, but I\u2019m not sure how\u2026\u201d The old man stroked his beard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I might have something that is the answer to your prayers.\u201d The man took out a strange red vial that had a had a horned face with one giant bulging eye on the front as Diego looked in confusion. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d he asked. \u201cThese are the tears of a cyclops, a legendary potion believed to give sight to the blind. Think of it as my gratitude to you for saving my life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe offer was too good to pass up and he wanted to give Angela the gift of sight, so he took the potion. \u201cThanks man! You\u2019re a saint.\u201d As Diego walked away with the cyclops tears, the old man suddenly remembered something. \u201cOh no,\u201d he said. \u201cShould I have told that young man about the side effects of the cyclops tears? For that matter, what were the side effects?\"</span></div></div>",

On the night of Angela's birthday, after dinner, Diego showed his wife the potion, or more accurately told his blind wife what it was. \"Cyclops tears?\" asked the blind painter. \"That's right Angie,\" said Diego. \"Happy birthday. The man I saved told me that this potion will cure your blindness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela was reluctantly to let her husband go through with it. \"Come on, Baby,\" said Diego. \"I want you to see how beautiful the world can be. You've been so good to me for years and you deserve to see. Just drink the tears and you can kiss your blindness good bye.\" Angela was reluctant but she could hear her husband's heartbeat and realized that he was being honest with her and could feel how sad he was about her condition. The blind woman smiled. \"If it makes you happy, Honey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela took the vial and drank the contents before she felt her head and Diego ran to her. \"Angela!\" he yelled. \"What's wrong.\" Angela raised her head and looked in surprise but then smiled. \"So that's the man I married?\" she asked. \"I picked a real handsome one.\" Diego smiled. The potion worked. Angela could see. \"Well,\" said Angela to her husband. \"I guess I don't need these sunglasses anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as Angela took off her sunglasses, Diego gave a look of surprise at his wife's face. \"Diego?\" asked Angela. \"What's wrong? You look a little pale.\" Diego couldn't believe it. Instead of two eyes under her glasses, Angela had only one eye, which was strange given how Diego distinctively remembered her having two eyes. \"Aye Carumba.\" Said Diego. \"Angela, whatever you do, don't look in the mirror. D'oh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiego had completely forgotten that whenever you tell somebody not to look into the mirror, they do just that and Angela walked up to a mirror they had in the hallway and let out a scream as she saw she only had one eye. \"All these years I've only had one eye?\" she asked. \"Diego. You could've told me early.\" \"What?! Angela, you had two eyes just this morning and...\" Suddenly Angela grunted as two horns grew on each side of her forehead and her skin turned bright red-orange and her fingers turned into claws. \"Oh no.\" Said Diego. Angela was growing bigger both in high and weight. Her belly was expanding as well as her thighs and she was quickly starting to tower over her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn no time at all, Diego looked up to see his wife turned into a fifteen foot tall, three ton cyclops. \"What have I done!\" yelled Diego. \"I'm such an idiot! I tried to do something nice but I turned my wife into a cyclops. I should never have given her those cyclops tears. Idiot.\" Angela looked around and was speechless at the creature she had turned into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question is how would she react.</span></div></div>",

However, the formerly blind woman just looked around at her new form and looked in the mirror as she tried to access her situation. She even blinked to confirm that she indeed had only one eye. \u201cAngela,\u201d said Diego. \u201cI am very sorry about what just happened. I have got to be the worst...\u201d However, Angela just let out a cheerful laugh and held her gut as the laughter got to her and she had to breathe in and out a few times. \u201cWhatever do you have to be sorry for, Diego?\u201d asked Angela. \u201cThis has got to be the best birthday present anyone\u2019s ever given me.\u201d Diego was surprised and dumbfounded at what his now colossal wife had just said just as she bent over to speak with him. \u201cAre you telling me that you actually like being a Cyclops?\u201d Angela bent down to speak with her husband and gave him a smile that seemed somewhat unnerving with her new and much sharper teeth. \u201cOkay,\u201d said Angela. \u201cSo maybe I\u2019ve put on a ton or two. Maybe I\u2019m a monster. But in the land of the blind, the one eyed woman is queen. I should be grateful to finally have one good eye. Hmm, I never noticed how handsome you were.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cyclops smiled down at her husband who smiled nervously. \u201cI was seriously expecting her to be seriously pissed off,\u201d thought Diego to himself. \u201cBut instead I find out that my wife enjoys being a cyclops. What exactly where in those cyclops tears?\u201d Angela then kissed Diego and made him slightly uncomfortable but then Diego blushed. \u201cOkay,\u201d he thought. \u201cThose sharp teeth are going to take some getting used to and one eye is definitely something that I\u2019ll have to acquire a taste for. But she was blind when I married her so I guess things could be worse.\u201d Angela then lifted up Diego who let out a grunt. \u201cWhat?!\u201d yelled Diego. \u201cAngela? What are you doing, Honey.\u201d Angela then held her husband like luggage and gave a smile as she took him upstairs. \u201cIt may be my birthday,\u201d said the one-eyed behemoth. \u201cBut I\u2019ve got a gift for you to thank you for this amazing new lease on life.\u201d Diego immediately realized exactly what his wife had planned and was somewhat horrified. \u201cOh geez,\u201d Diego said to himself. \u201cThis could get hairy.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the two of them got upstairs, Angela proceeded to chain Diego up to the bed and had stripped him to his underwear. \u201cI wonder if Odysseus ever had to deal with this?\u201d asked Diego. Angela then proceeded to walk out of the closet and the 15ft tall cyclops was wearing a train conductor\u2019s outfit complete with a cap. She stared hungrily at her husband with her one eye and gave an excited smile. \u201cAll aboard, Baby.\u201d Said the cyclops amazon. Diego screamed in terror and then screamed in ecstasy right before his cyclops wife proceeded to destroy his body, hard. His screaming was so loud that the neighbors could hear it. \u201cWhat are the Riviera\u2019s doing up there?\u201d asked one old woman. \u201cIt sounds like somebody is being sadistically tortured. \u201cAngela!\u201d yelled Diego. \u201cStop it! Oh, I don\u2019t think I can take any more! How could something that hurts so bad feel so good!\u201d Angela let out a giggle. \u201cCome on, Baby. Take it like a man.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t stop now! Oh!\u201d The female neighbor was absolutely horrified at what she was hearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe very next morning, Diego was laying in bed in absolute pain with a smile plastered on his face. His chest was covered in scratch marks, no doubt from his cyclops of a wife playing a little too rough with him. \u201cAnd I thought she was a terror in bed before,\u201d said Diego. \u201cUgh. That man could\u2019ve given me a potion to turn her into something a lot more gentle.\u201d Diego then looked around in surprise because from the looks of it, Angela was nowhere in sight. \u201cAngela?\u201d he asked. \u201cAngie? Where did? Oh!\u201d Diego felt himself in absolute pain because he had yet to recover from the beating his wife inflicted on him last night in bed. He immediately grabbed his shirt and ran downstairs to find something strange. The door appeared to have been broken off of the hinges and there were large footprints wedged into the floor. No doubt they were made by Angela, but Diego noticed something rather strange about the footprints. Namely, he noticed that the footprints appeared to be deep and looked like Angela\u2019s feet had gotten bigger. Diego turned his head and saw that the rug was missing as well. \u201cIt can\u2019t be,\u201d thought Diego. \u201cCan it? I better check out the studio to see what\u2019s up with Angela.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiego noticed the car was still in the driveway (though given how Angela was currently too big to fit in the car, he couldn\u2019t really be surprised), so he decided to drive to the studio where he and Angela created their sculptures and paintings respectively. As he was driving, he noticed more of Angela\u2019s footprints in the ground and looked in shock. They did indeed seem to have gotten much bigger. \u201cOh my,\u201d said Diego to himself. \u201cOh my. Oh my. Good grief.\u201d Diego ran out into the studio and saw something that surprised him. His cyclops wife now stood 25ft high with a 30ft stomach and 15ft wide ass and D-Cup breasts. Her hair also seemed to have gotten long and from the looks of it, she was wearing the rug from the living room as an improvised skirt and was only wearing a bra as something else. The Cyclops was blissfully painting a large mural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiego took a look at his wife\u2019s mural and saw that it was more brightly colored than her usual work, mainly because now she could see the colors she was painting. The painting mainly depicted numerous animals. In one corner appeared to be the Great Wall of China and there appeared to be a giant jellyfish riding piggyback on a rhinoceros who was jogging and standing on his hind legs. In another corner of the painting there was a wolfman riding in a buggy and dressed in a pilot\u2019s outfit yelling at a yeti who passed by him in a zamboni. In another corner, there was a mummy selling zombie faces to a tapir dressed like a kindergartner and in the fourth corner there was a sea turtle and a chameleon that appeared to have robbed a bank filled with sea urchins. In the center of the painting, an enormous dragon was looking down at a devil and a gecko in the middle of a boxing match. Angela seemed very pleased at what she was painting. That was when she looked down and finally noticed her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Angela. \u201cHi, Diego. Sorry I got up early. I wanted to get an early start on painting, now that I can actually see my work. So, how does it look.\u201d Diego took a look at Angela\u2019s painting and smiled. \u201cBaby,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is hands down one of the best pieces of artwork I have ever seen.\" Angela bent down just so she could kiss her tiny husband and then let out a giggle. \"Thanks, Babe,\" she said. \"The sky's the limit. Now I must get to work on another painting.\" Diego was curious as to where Angela got a canvas so big but then he saw that the giant cyclops woman was actually using oversized billboards as canvases for her paintings and  gasped. However, she was painting again and Diego didn\u2019t like to stifle his wife\u2019s creativity and shrugged his shoulders as he decided he needed to figure out how to make a wax sculpture that would be good enough to sell. That was when he spotted his wife and then he smiled as he went to work putting together a mold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter half a day, Diego had managed to create a wax sculpture of Angela\u2019s cyclops form painting at her canvas. \u201cSo?\u201d asked Diego. \u201cWhat do you think.\u201d Angela gave a smile and nodded her head. \u201cVery good. But do you think anybody will be interested in a wax sculpture of a cyclops.\u201d \u201cWhy not?\u201d asked Diego. \u201cIt\u2019s modeled after the most beautiful cyclops that I know.\u201d Angela let out a giggle and picked up her husband to give him a kiss, accidentally coating him in her saliva in the process right before he shivered. But then he gave a nervous laugh. \"Well,\" he said. \"In a few hours, I'll show the sculpture and your first painting from today to Don Blanco and we'll see how well he likes it.\" Angela gave a smile. \"Oh,\" she said. \"I'm sure that we won't have any problems.\u201d That\u2019s what Diego thought. As he later drove off to meet with the art dealer, he was beginning to realize something really painful. What would people think if they knew a giant cyclops was the artist. The sculptor could only hope for the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Diego arrived at Don Blanco estate to sell him the painting and sculpture, the dealer looked quizzically at the sculpture of Angela, not realizing who it was the sculpture was supposed to represent. \"I think we should be able to find a buyer for your wax cyclops, Diego. But what possessed you to create something like that in the first place.\" Diego hastily tried to think of an explanation and gave a rather nervous sounding laugh. \"Well, you know how people make sculptures of Greek gods and heroes. I figured that there weren't enough statues of Greek monsters.\" \"I see. Is that supposed to be a woman? Well, art is in the eye of....\" Before Don Blanco could finish his sentence, he let out a gasp because he had noticed Angela's mural. \"Is that your wife's painting?\" \"Uh,\" said Diego. \"Yes.\" \"It's unlike anything I've seen from her before. It's not like her to use such bright colors. Especially since she's blind.\" \"Uh,\" said Diego. \"Not anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there was something about the mural that puzzled Don Blanco. \"I've never actually met your wife,\" he said. \"But from the looks of it, Angela had no more trouble creating such a large scale painting than she would a normal-sized painting. I'd like to meet this artist.\" Diego gave a gulp. \"I got to warn you. You do not want to do that, Don Blanco. Let's just say she got a makeover that's... well, alarming.\" \"Nonsense,\" said Don Blanco. \"An artist should not be judged based on looks. I'd like to meet this mysterious painter if you don't mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiego was sweating. He didn't know what to say about that proposition.</span></div></div>",

The two of them were dating and practicing their routine. Atlas was effortlessly lifting two benches covered in cinderblocks while his girlfriend was walking a very thin tightrope. Atlas however had a tendency to get distracted by the young redhead on the rope to the point that he wasn\u2019t paying attention to where he was swinging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRollo the dwarf walked in and it was only his short height that prevented him from getting whacked. \u201cHey, Atlas, quit gawking at Daphne. Mr. Burns isn\u2019t going to like it if you keep getting distracted.\u201d Daphne just gave a scoff. \u201cLeave him alone, Rollo. He can\u2019t help if he likes what he sees.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s not to like?\u201d asked Atlas. \u201cWhy did you come in here anyway, Rollo?\u201d Rollo let out a gulp. \u201cThe new attraction that Mr. Burns bought has arrived and it\u2019s making me nervous. He said it was a genuine weretiger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtlas and Daphne both let out laughs. \u201cThat ringmaster has been pulling your leg. There\u2019s no such thing as a real weretiger.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not sure about that,\u201d said Rollo. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like any species of tiger I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d Daphne jumped down from the rope as Atlas put down his weights. \u201cAlright, Chicken Little. We\u2019ll see this so-called weretiger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple walked into the next tent and saw a tiger in a cage. It was a big bright pinkish red tiger with blood red stripes and appeared to have glowing eyes as it walked around in its cage. \u201cHuh,\u201d said Atlas. \u201cRollo might\u2019ve had a point. That\u2019s a strange looking pussycat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Daphne was unafraid and walked to the cage before turning to face her strongman boyfriend. \u201cYou\u2019re starting to believe in Rollo\u2019s pessimism, Sweetie,\u201d said the acrobat. \u201cThis is just an ordinary tiger. The ringmaster got ripped\u2026 ow!\u201d Without warning, the tiger bit Daphne on the rear and caused her to jump back. As the tiger roared, Atlas ran and banged on the cage to intimidate it. \u201cYou do that again and I\u2019ll make you into a rug, you mangy cat! Daphne! Are you okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne grunted. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Like I said, somebody found a particularly irritable tiger and painted it before telling Mr. Burns it was a weretiger. Now let\u2019s get away from that awful creature.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Daphne was walking away, she didn\u2019t notice her ass getting bigger and she also didn\u2019t notice bright red stripes appearing on her body.</span></div></div>",

If you're not careful, we're going to have a new fat lady in the carnival. \"Shut up, Jane. I'm just swollen because that alleged \"weretiger\" just bit me. It's all. Now, the show will be on in a few minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before the show was about to commence and Mr. Burns, the ringmaster stepped up as he saw there was a full house. \"Welcome one and all to the Cirque de Flame! I am Mr. Burns and I will be your ringmaster tonight! We have an astounding show tonight!\" Everyone was cheering as the show was about to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First up,\" said Mr. Burns. \"Meet my son, Pyro! Our 16-year-old, fire-eater!\" As usual, Pyro started the show and not only swallowed the flames off of a burning stick but he blew out several flames in the shape of roaring dragons as everyone cheered. All while the flame eater was entertaining the masses, Daphne had managed to get her costume on and it was beginning to rip as she growled and it appeared that there were stripes reaching up to her arms now. But she didn't think about that right now and had to climb up to the trapeze as her boyfriend, Atlas looked on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next up!\" yelled Mr. Burns. \"It's Beauty and the Beast! Our animal tamer, Jane, and Tarzan the gorilla.\" Jane, the animal trainer was standing on the shoulders of Tarzan the gorilla as the ape rode a unicycle and both animal and trainer were juggling oranges. This got the crowd's attention as Daphne looked down and smiled. Soon it would be her turn to wow the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now,\" said Mr. Burns. \"I give you, Atlas, the strongest man alive.\" Atlas was at the time balancing an elephant with one hand while spinning a piano on his other hand's index finger and quickly tapped at it to play music, just as everyone who looked on cheered. \"And for the moment you've been waiting for,\" said Mr. Burns. \"Dazzling Daphne, the acrobat and her catlike reflexes! And speaking of cats, after Daphne's performance, you will see a creature believed initially to only exist in the mind, a genuine were tiger. But for now, gave open Daphne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone cheered on as Daphne waved down and leapt into the air, grabbing a trapeze and swinging 180 degrees before she held her legs in a position to the letter D. All male eyes (even the married ones) were on her, but one quick glare from Atlas changed that before the strongman gave a smug smile and then looked up at his girlfriend as she leapt into the air and bounced off two poles before descending to the ground and landing on all fours. Not only did the crowd look in surprise, but so did the carnival staff. \"That's strange,\" said Jane. \"I didn't know she could...\" \"No,\" said Rollo the dwarf. \"No one could do that. At least no human I've ever seen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Daphne begun to groan as red stripes surrounded her body and the crowd's gasped. She started to get bigger and heavier, growing past 15 feet and 3 tons as her outfit tore apart and she sprouted cat's ears and a tail. \"Daphne?\" asked Atlas. Daphne gave a nervous laugh and showed her teeth turned into fangs. \"It's okay everyone,\" she said. \"Remember, it's all part of the show, all part of the...\" Daphne roared out that last line as she sprouted whiskers and her nose turned black like that of a cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O...M..G.\" Said Mr. Burns in pure horror as he looked back and nearly fainted, requiring Pyro to catch him. \"I thought the man who sold you the tiger was ripping us off.\" said the teenage flame eater. \"Pyro, my boy,\" said Mr. Burns. \"This is much worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne let out a roar as her transformation into a beast was nearing its completion. Despite the danger, Atlas ran up to his girlfriend. \"Daphne,\" he said. \"What's wrong.\" But Daphne just roared at him as she begun to sprout fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had transformed into...</span></div></div>",

Daphne was now a 35ft tall white tiger and a rather obese one at that. Had she been human sized, she would weigh a ton as she now had a 50ft wide belly and butt and she stood on all fours. Her legs and arms were as thick as tree trunks and her breasts were now H-cups. The circus staff looked in horror as Daphne let out a loud roar. Atlas could not believe what his girlfriend had turned into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my gosh,\u201d thought Atlas to himself as Daphne was looking around. \u201cThat was a real weretiger after all. And its turned Daphne into a weretiger as well.\u201d Daphne roared in absolute panic and feared the worst, but that\u2019s when the tiger giantess was promptly caught by surprise. The entire crowd cheered as they spotted her. \u201cSo that\u2019s the weretiger?\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s gorgeous!\u201d \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting a white tiger. Those are the most beautiful ones.\u201d \u201cThe lady turned into a big tiger.\u201d The circus staff was stunned. The crowd wasn\u2019t afraid of Daphne\u2019s transformation and instead thought it was part of the show. Mr. Burns even took out a cloth to wipe off his sweat and gave a nervous laugh that soon turned into a genuine laugh. \u201cBehold, ladies and gentlemen and boys and girls of all ages,\u201d said Mr. Burns. \u201cThe wonder of transformation. You have just witnessed beauty become the beast.\u201d Daphne smiled nervously as the crowd cheered for her and she even let out a growling purr.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat nobody knew was that in the back, the pink weretiger that bit Daphne, as it was walking around in its cage, it underwent a transformation itself, the pink weretiger let out a roar that evolved into a laugh before it started to bloat as grow as well. The pink tiger grew bigger and fatter and burst out of its cage as it showed its teeth. The pink tiger\u2019s shape changed until it revealed itself to be a female tiger as it appeared to have breasts like a human being as well as long strawberry blonde hair. This tiger was now just as big as Daphne and gave a smirk as she spoke. \u201cHow\u2019s that for a show.\u201d The pink tigress heard the crowd cheering and decided to investigate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, the circus was taking advantage of Daphne\u2019s transformation and had crafted a rather large hoop and set it on fire. Daphne gave a growl and then glared down at Jane. \u201cI\u2019m going to get you for this, Jane,\u201d growled the white tigress rather angrily. \u201cJust because I\u2019ve turned into a weretiger doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m an animal you can sadistically boss around.\u201d Jane just gave a sneer. \u201cYou\u2019re just lucky that we happened to have a hoop big enough for your ass.\u201d \u201cWatch your language,\u201d said Mr. Burns. \u201cThere are children present. Now, everybody, Dazzling Daphne will jump through a burning ring of fire.\u201d The crowd was beginning to laugh. \u201cDo they actually think they can get that fat cat through the ring?\u201d \u201cI know, she\u2019s ginormous?\u201d \u201cWhere did they get a ring of fire big enough for that big pussy.\u201d Daphne gave a confident grin and then leapt right through the ring, creating a small earthquake as she landed and everybody cheered. Daphne gave a smile and Atlas looked up and smiled at his girlfriend. \u201cShe\u2019s going to be tough to beat in bed.\u201d Said Pyro mockingly to Atlas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the large pink weretiger let out a growl and jumped through the hoop next, catching both staff and audience by surprise. The pink tigress let out a roar. \u201cIt\u2019s good to be free!\u201d yelled the pink tigress. \u201cIs that the weretiger that bit Daphne?\u201d asked Jane in horror. \u201cYes,\u201d said Atlas. \u201cBut she\u2019s super huge now. I didn\u2019t even know the first tiger was a girl.\u201d Daphne looked in surprise and the pink tigress smiled at her. \u201cDaphne, I presume,\u201d said the pink tigress. \u201cI\u2019m Dahlia and this is my true size. Boy, have I got a story for you for how I wound up in that cage. But first things first. It\u2019s show time.\u201d Daphne didn\u2019t mind sharing the spotlight but was surprised at the first weretiger revealing herself to be sentient. The crowd was surprised themselves. \u201cA second giant tiger? What kind of a circus is this?\u201d Both tigresses smiled and took turns leaping through the hoop and shaking the ground before both of the tigresses gave a roar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery soon, the show was over and Dahlia and Daphne were both devouring raw steaks. Daphne gave a look of disgust as the rest of the staff watched her eat. \"This is absolutely disgusting,\" said Daphne. \"I prefer cooked meat, but I can't stop eating.\" Dahlia let out a scoff. \"You get used to it after a while. If you don't eat raw meat every day, you'll get a craving for people.\" Dahlia grit her teeth at Rollo and frightened the dwarf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now let me get this straight,\" said Mr. Burns. \"Dahlia, was it? You were a weretiger all the way from India and a local mystic tranquilized you, shrinking you into that form we saw you in and put you in a cage hoping to get rid of you.\" Dahlia then let out a loud belch. \"That was the idea. I kinda romped on a village or two back in Asia. Sorry about the nasty nip, Daphne. The only way I could've returned to normal was to bite a virgin. That's the only way I can transmit the curse as well.\" Jane then let out a laugh at Daphne's expense. \"You're a <i>virgin</i>, Daphne? You've been dating Atlas for how long and he hasn't popped your cherry?\" Daphne growled at Jane as she kept laughing. \"I can eat you with one gulp, Jane,\" said Daphne. \"Don't tempt me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Burns let out a sigh. \"Well, this is going to make the Cirque de Flame a lot more interesting.\" Pyro nodded his head. \"Dahlia,\" said Mr. Burns. \"If you're going to stay here, there are going to be a few ground rules. The most important one is that you are not allowed to eat anyone, staff or customer.\" Dahlia let out a scoff. \"Fine with me. Humans give me horrible gas anyway.\" \"Well,\" said Pyro. We all better turn in. We'll get up bright and early tomorrow to move the circus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce everyone else had left, Atlas approached Daphne and Dahlia. \"Dahlia,\" said Daphne. \"This is my boyfriend, Atlas.\" Dahlia gave a growl as Atlas looked up in fear. \"Oh yes. The man who threatened to flay me. I hear you're the strongest man alive. Why don't you prove it by trying to lift one of us.\" \"I do not make bets with weretigers.\" Said an annoyed Atlas. Dahlia let out a scoff. \"Oh. I get it, the alleged strongman is nothing more than an ant.\" Atlas got really mad as Dahlia laughed at him and Daphne bit her lip. \"Atlas, don't let her get to you.\" But Atlas was determined. \"You're on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtlas decided he was going to prove his strength by trying to lift up one of the giant obese tigresses. But which one?</span></div></div>",

Which of us is it going to be.\" Atlas looked at Dahlia's smirking face and then back at Daphne's worried face. The obese white tiger giantess couldn't believe that her husband was willing to accept such a suicidal challenge. Atlas saw the worried look in Daphne's eyes and realized that he probably couldn't trust Dahlia to play fair, so he nodded his head. \"Daphne,\" he said. \"I'm going to need you to trust me on this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne gave a distressed growl. \"Atlas,\" she said. \"Are you crazy? You can't agree to that challenge.\" Dahlia let out a scoff. \"It's okay, Daphne. If you like being the girlfriend to a bug, I'm not one to stop you.\" Atlas gave a glare at Dahlia before maneuvering around Daphne's enormous body that kept shifting as Daphne tried to convince her boyfriend not to try anything. \"Baby,\" said Atlas confidently. \"I got this. I'm the strongman of this circus, remember?\" \"No human is strong enough to lift a 50ft tall tiger, Atlas. Besides, if I was still human sized, I would weigh at least a few thousand pounds.\" Atlas rolled his eyes, obviously not wanting to further argue with his colossal girlfriend and simply slide underneath Daphne's multi-rolled stomach and through the gap between her striped black and white legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Atlas grabbed Daphne by the flesh her left butt cheek and made her grunt. Atlas was groaning to himself in effort as he was trying to lift his giant white tiger girlfriend over his shoulder. Pyro heard the noise and came to investigate and looked in horror at what Atlas was doing. Atlas continued to pull on his girlfriend's ass and made her meow rather loudly and in distress as he actually managed to get her feet to move across the ground. \"Oh no.\" Said Pyro. Pyro immediately ran off as Atlas was sweating heavily. \"I know Dahlia's bite turned her into a giant weretiger,\" thought the strongman to himself as he finally managed to budge Daphne. \"But why the hell did it have to make her fat as well? What sense does that make.\" Atlas then managed to finally lift up Daphne, much to Dahlia's surprise as the white tiger giantess was flailing her arms in the air and growling nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Mr. Burns was in his office trying to make heads or tails of what was going on. \"I can't believe it. I get suckered into buying a cursed weretiger that turns out to be a Godzilla-sized fatso and then turns my main acrobat into an enormous tiger as well. The crowd thought it was all part of the show. Why did I get into the circus business in the first place?\" Mr. Burns then walked up to a painting on the wall and revealed a safe inside before he took out a bottle of wine. \"I just hope I don't have to deal with anymore supernatural surprises for a long time. At least this is ending better than that freak show with the mind-reading clown up North. Mr. Burns had trouble opening the bottle and tried to remove the cork when Pyro burst in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad!\" yelled the fire eater. \"Trouble!\" Pyro's interruption caused a startled Mr. Burns to drop the bottle on the floor and break it. \"Dammit, Pyro!\" yelled the ringmaster. \"That bottle was 15 years old. I was really looking forward to...\" \"It's Atlas!\" yelled Pyro. \"He's trying to lift Daphne into the air!\" Mr. Burns grabbed his chest as if he was having a heart attack. \"What?! You're kidding me! Daphne and Dahlia are both over nine times his size and a thousand times his weight! He'd have to be Superman to lift either of those fat cats!\" Mr. Burns and Pyro ran out in an attempt to stop Atlas's fool hearty actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtlas at the time was still holding up Daphne who appeared to have gotten even larger, especially in the ass. From a far away perspective, Atlas looked like an ant trying to lift an enormous tigress. Of course, Daphne's weight was putting a massive strain on her strongman boyfriend's body and it took all the concentration Atlas had just to avoid cracking under the pressure. Dahlia was looking down and was impressed as she seductively looked on at Atlas. \"My, my, my,\" said the pink weretigress titan. \"He's a lot stronger than he looks. Meow. Maybe we can share him after this is over.\" \"What?!\" yells Daphne at the rather audacious suggestion coming from the other tigress. Then, Daphne heard a tearing found and her nylons were coming loose as her thighs were expanding. She looked back to see her leotard appeared to be coming undone as well. \"Oh my! Am I getting fatter.\" Daphne then saw that Dahlia looked bigger and fatter as well. \"That goes with the curse,\" says Dahlia. \"You're gonna be really huge really soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Daphne was getting bigger, it was getting harder and harder for Atlas to hold up his white weretiger lover and he could hear bones cracking and it sounded like they were his own. Mr. Burns and Pyro ran in just in time to see exactly what Atlas was doing. \"Atlas!\" yelled Mr. Burns. \"You idiot! What possessed you into trying something so stupid!\" Atlas just gave a grunt. \"Leave me alone. I'm busy taking that smart aleck newcomer down a peg.\" Mr. Burns turned to Dahlia who gave a feline smirk. \"You dared Atlas to do this?!\" yelled the ringmaster up to the pink tiger giantess. \"Why I oughta...\" \"Dad,\" said Pyro. \"I really don't think threatening a tiger the size of a skyscraper is a good idea.\" Mr. Burns looked up at Dahlia's large toothy smile and realized that Pyro made a rather good point. \"Oh, crap.\" Grunted Mr. Burns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtlas was now sweating rather heavily and his back was bending as his knees were cracking. There was no way that he could keep holding up Daphne for long and Daphne was hissing and shaking as she tried to escape her minuscule boyfriend's grip. \"Put me down!\" yelled Daphne. \"Put me down, Atlas! This is insane!\" Atlas was huffing and puffing and from the looks of it, he was quickly getting tired and he had to admit that perhaps he had made a horrible mistake agreeing to the challenge. But he wasn't about to give up so soon, despite all the agony he was in. Daphne was screaming as Atlas was collapsing underneath her. Mr. Burns lowered his head to Atlas\u2019s level. \u201cAtlas, sometimes it\u2019s better to be a living coward than a dead idiot! Put down the giant tiger already!\u201d But Atlas wouldn\u2019t budge and Mr. Burns let out a groan. \u201cPyro,\u201d he said. \u201cRemind me to never get involved with anyone selling supernatural looking felines ever again. This is a disaster.\u201d Atlas just continued to stubbornly hold up Daphne and panted. He couldn\u2019t hold on any longer and suddenly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtlas had collapsed under Daphne\u2019s weight and found himself fatigue and flattened but alive underneath Daphne\u2019s enormous white and black striped butt cheeks. Daphne gasped and got up. \u201cAtlas!\u201d she yelled out. \u201cAtlas!\u201d Dahlia gave a laugh because Atlas was still stuck in between the white tiger lady\u2019s enormous ass cheeks. Daphne turned her head with four chins as Dahlia pulled out Atlas and placed him on the white tigress\u2019s nose. \u201cAtlas!\u201d yelled Daphne. \u201cSpeak to me! Atlas!\u201d Atlas just let out a groan. \"I'm fine, baby,\" he said. \"Just reached my limit. Ouch.\" Mr. Burns grabbed hold of his hair and let out a groan. \"You should not have done something so stupid, Atlas! You're lucky you're not a red stain on a white and black striped ass.\" Mr. Burns even fainted and Pyro had to catch the ringmaster before he fell to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne grabs hold of Mr. Burns and rubbed his tiny form against her (face) cheek as she purred. \u201cThank goodness you\u2019re alright.\u201d Atlas let out a scoff. \u201cStrongest man alive, remember. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!\u201d Atlas held his shoulder in pain. He had pulled more than a few muscles trying to lift up his obese giant tiger girlfriend. \u201cDon\u2019t you move around too much, Atlas,\u201d said Daphne. \u201cYou\u2019re going to further hurt yourself.\u201d Atlas and Daphne then heard Dahlia giving a purr herself. \"Looks like you're tougher than I gave you credit for, little man.\" Dahlia gave a wink at Atlas that made Daphne growl slightly. \"I'm going to have to keep an eye on this new tigress.\" Said Dahlia.</span></div></div>",

We want the pumpkin to be just right for the Landers family jack-o-lantern. Especially since this is our first Halloween with Cythnia.\u201d Samantha gave a smile.

I can\u2019t wait to carve it out.\u201d Jack let out a laugh and Samantha smiled but then the goth girl spotted something that caught her attention. In the field there was a bright silver colored pumpkin that appeared to have a stem shaped like a crown. She found herself drawn to the pumpkin and lifted it up. \u201cWhatcha got there, Samantha?\u201d asked Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha took the pumpkin off the vine and smiled. \u201cThe perfect pumpkin, for our little pumpkin.\u201d Jack took his wife by the shoulder before they returned home to their farmhouse. In a crib in the center, their daughter was sleeping away. Samantha smiled and walked to kiss Cynthia. \u201cGood night, sweetie,\u201d she said. \u201cTomorrow, Mommy will show you how to make the perfect jack-o-lantern.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s what Samantha thought, but she neglected to read a special seal that was underneath the pumpkin.

The fence had been lined with barbed wire with plastic skeletons inside of it and the windows were painted with fake blood while fake tombstones lined the garden. Indoors, Samantha had dressed up Cynthia in her Halloween costume. Cynthia was wearing a tiny costume that made her look like a baby vampire who was giggling. \"The most adorable vampire I've ever seen,\" said Samantha. \"That was my first Halloween costume too.\" Cynthia giggled as Samantha tickled the little baby under her chin. Jack just let out a sigh. \"I still think that we should've dressed her up as a werewolf. She would've made a better werewolf than vampire.\" Samantha just let out a laugh. \"Come on, Jack,\" she said. \"This is Cynthia's first Halloween ever. We've got to get this right and make sure she has some fun. Besides, you know that as cute as our little girl is, she\u2019d look good in anything. Just you wait. By the time tonight is over, Cynthia is going to love Halloween as much as us.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack looked around at the decorations and then took a look at his daughter. \u201cI sure hope so,\u201d said Jack. \u201cIt\u2019s too bad I have to go to work. But the good news is the boss is letting me out early since it\u2019s Halloween. He\u2019s going to a Halloween party at a friend\u2019s house by the cemetery.\u201d Samantha let out a laugh. \u201cHope he brought his zombie repellant. It\u2019s the night of the dead tonight.\u201d Jack bent down and then kissed his wife on the cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll see you both later. Can\u2019t wait to spend Halloween night with my two favorite girls.\u201d Samantha held up Cynthia and held her by the hand. \u201cWave goodbye to Daddy, Cynthia,\u201d said Samantha. \u201cYou\u2019ll see him tonight.\u201d Cynthia burbled to Jack in baby talk and then Jack kissed Cynthia on the forehead before walking out. However, as Jack walked out the front door, he found it was surprisingly windy and there was lightning cracking in the sky. He could swear her heard panicked yelling in gibberish as he was walking out the door to go to work. \"Huh?\" he asked. \"Those are some very eerie sounds. But then again, it <i>is</i> Halloween. I wonder if there are spirits out tonight this time.\" Jack shrugged his shoulders and walked up to his car. He looked back and smiled as he saw Samantha rubbing the pumpkin they picked out last night. That same silver pumpkin with the crown-like growth appeared to be glowing in the light as clouds filled up the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLong after Jack had left, Samantha thought it would be time to show Cynthia how to make the perfect jack-o-lantern. She placed her daughter on the floor before laying down the newspaper to put down the pumpkin. \"Okay, Cynthia,\" said Samantha. \"Pay attention. Pumpkin carving can be very messy. That's why you first have to lay down the newspaper. And now here comes my least favorite part.\" Cynthia watched as her mother took out a knife. She realized something. \"Please don't do this until you're older and not without Mommy's supervision,\" she told her infant daughter. \"This is a very dangerous tool. Samantha started to carve off the top of the pumpkin, not hearing a scream of agony as a bright light shined in the pumpkin. Cynthia seemed to notice and was paying close attention to the pumpkin as she burbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, Honey?\" asked Samantha. \"Ouch!\" While her daughter had distracted her, Samantha accidentally cut her finger. \"Ow! See, Cynthia. This is why you have to be super careful when you're carving a pumpkin.\" Samantha put her finger into her mouth and then grunted. She saw that she was bleeding but her blood was a bright orange color and looked like pumpkin juice. Before she could think any more on the subject, Samantha saw the wound heal almost instantly. \"Huh? Oh well.\" Samantha then started to remove the contents of the pumpkin. \"See, Cynthia,\" said Samantha. \"This is why we need the newspaper. Pumpkin carving is messy business. Okay, now here's the fun part. Oh, darn. Where did I leave that sharpie.\" As Samantha bent down to look for her marker, she failed to notice that somehow her butt had expanded and looked like it was the size of a mammoth pumpkin. And it was turning bright yellow-orange. Cynthia spotted her mother's giant rear and crawled up and laughed as she begun to climb it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha grunted and then looked back to see her baby sitting on her rear end, finally seeing how big it was. \"What the?\" asked Samantha. Samantha picked up Cynthia who was laughing and clapping and then looked at her behind. \"Oh my, Cynthia. Looks like Mommy's been eating too much Halloween candy.\" Samantha then begun to gag a few times. \"Why does my mouth taste like candle wax?\" thought the ginger-haired girl to herself. Samantha opened her mouth and then gasped as she looked in the mirror because there was a candle in her throat and a lit candle at that. \"Okay,\" said Samantha. \"That fudge I ate must've been tainted.\" Samantha then heard a tearing noise and saw that her breasts were now as big as pumpkins as well and just as orange. \"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha then gasped because her ginger colored hair was turning a more golden yellow color and her face was distorting. Her lips and teeth had fused together as her teeth turned the same color as  her skin and became triangular shaped. Samantha let out a scream as Cynthia held on tight to her and giggled. Samantha then saw that her hands had turned bright green and stretched out as they started to look more like vines and tentacles. Samantha's stomach was the next to expand and it now only looked as big and orange as a pumpkin but it had the same texture as one as well. Samantha let out another scream as her thighs expanded and her nose turned into a large triangle shaped hole in her face just as her skin was completely turning orange. Samantha also became taller and wider as she kept growing and her head became more rounded as she stuck out her tongue, giving a much better view of the candle in her throat. By the time the transformation was complete, Samantha was a giant 20ft high creature resembling a human shaped pumpkin. She had a 35ft wide stomach and 15ft wide butt with H-cup breasts and six tentacle vines where her arms used to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my good golly gosh!\" yelled the pumpkin giantess. \"What happened to me?!\" However, Cynthia just looked in awe. Despite seeing her mother transmogrified into an enormous pumpkin-headed plant beast right before her eyes, she had no fear of Samantha and just clapped her hands before giggling and hugging her mother's shin. Samantha looked down in surprise. \"Cynthia?\" she asked. Cynthia just continued to hug her giant mother's leg before Samantha lowered her vines to pick the infant up. Samantha rocked the baby girl in her vines that she had in place of her arms and Cynthia continued to giggle. Samantha looked down and smiled at her daughter. Sure, Samantha may have been turned into a pumpkin monster that looked big enough to be built into a carriage, but to her daughter, it didn't make any different at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess the younger you are,\" said the pumpkin titans to herself. \"The less likely you are to show fear. You know that Mommy's still Mommy despite being a big fat pumpkin.\" Samantha reached her vines into the kitchen to get her daughter's baby bottle, however, one of the vines grabbed an entire turkey from inside the fridge that the pumpkin creature promptly devoured before she started to feed her daughter. \"I hope we have enough milk,\" thought Samantha. \"Then again, I could always feed my baby some of the pumpkin juice flowing through my body. But what could've possibly caused me to turn into a giant pumpkin. This doesn't make any sense at all.\" That's when something occurred to Samantha. \"That silver pumpkin,\" she said. \"The one with the crown on it. It definitely wasn't a normal pumpkin. Maybe it was a magical pumpkin. Hmm, perhaps I should've accepted the pumpkin that Jack found with a bruise on it.\" Samantha let out a sigh and then she extended her vines to reach into the bowl of candy that she had prepared for the trick-or-treaters. She swallowed three pieces of candy, without sen bothering to unwrap anything. \"I better leave the rest for the trick-or-treaters,\" said Samantha. \"Boy would they get a big surprise to see me. Hmmm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Samantha laid down Cynthia in her crib, she walked up in front of the mirror and smirked. Samantha let out a slight growl and opened her mouth wide to show her teeth and the flames in her throat. Then the pumpkin-headed creature made her eyes glow bright red and wiggled her vines like snakes and even billowed embers out of her nostrils. This caused Samantha to scream at her own reflection. \"Oh geez,\" she said. \"I even scared myself. This could be fun. Just imagine the kids' faces when they see a pumpkin the size of a monster truck.\" While Samantha was laughing, she heard a loud knock on the front door. The giant pumpkin lady gave a smirk and she twisted her vine tentacles together as she was getting prepared to get her Halloween on. \"Oh goody,\" she said. \"That must be the first trick-or-treaters. They're earlier than I expected but I'm looking forward to giving them a good scare. Remember, Cynthia, if you're not getting scared or scaring people, then you're not having a very good Halloween.\" Cynthia let out a giggle as she watched her mother slink her way up to the front door. She was getting ready to terrify the first person who walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pumpkin creature then opened the door slightly and poked a yellow eye out to look and see that outside the door was...</span></div></div>",

Every hundred years there is a bright red moon, one as red as blood. There is a legend that the Red Moon Baby is the most dangerous vampire there was.

But these were different times. Only one girl born on the night of this red moon will become the Red Moon Baby but nobody could tell for sure because the Red Moon Baby is a vampire that is originally born a human but will develop her vampire powers at an uncertain point in her life before she becomes full on vampire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince there aren\u2019t as many vampire hunters as there were before in this day and age, there is no guarantee that the Red Moon Baby will be stopped in time this year.

He was on the phone with an as-of-yet unknown person. \"059,\" said the man on the other side of the phone. \"Do you have the Red Moon Baby in your sights.\" The hunter nodded his head. \"I do, 001. Mildred Moon, 35 years old, married with 2 kids. Doesn't yet know that she's about to evolve into the vampire titan we've feared for centuries.\" 059 clicked his shot gun and was going to aim it at the chubby brunette. \"And she never will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n059 fired but before the bullet could even strike, Mildred accidentally broke a plate on the ground and bent over to pick it up, causing 059's shot to miss. \"Dammit!\" yelled the vampire hunter. While Mildred was on the ground, she looked at her reflection in the plate and was stunned at how her appearance seemed to have changed. \"Blatherdale,\" she said to herself. \"Where did all those gray hairs come from?\" Mildred was looking at the white stripe in her hair that wasn't there before and then she saw that she had bright red eyes. \"Yeesh,\" she said, completely ignoring the fact that she now had fangs. \"I've got to get more sleep. Look at those red eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n059 tried to shoot again, but as Mildred got up she seemed to have put on a colossal amount of weight, especially in her ass which had gotten so thick that the bullet bounced right back off of it and hit 059 in the side to make him yell and fall to the ground without Mildred even noticing him. The slowly transforming woman was soon on the phone with her friend. \"Oh no he didn't, Ellen,\" she said to the woman on the other line. \"Seriously, after 15 years he would say something like that to you.\" On the other side of the phone was a blonde haired woman with tan skin and glasses who appeared to be scratching her head with large blue fingernails. \"Well,\" said Ellen as she adjusted her glasses revealing bright blue eyes. \"We can't all net a prize like you.\" As Ellen was speaking to Mildred, she seemed to be scratching the side of her head with her foot absent-mindedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" said Mildred. \"Married life hasn't been doing me much good in the looks department. My hairs graying already and my eyes are as red as a tomato, ow!\" Mildred walked forward and accidentally hit her head over a doorway. \"And some idiot lowered the roof to the doorway when I wasn't looking.\" \"You think you've got problems,\" asked Ellen on the other line as she looked to see brown reddish fur growing on her leg. \"I've been shaving my legs every day, twice. Maybe middle-age is finally getting to us. TTYL GF.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMildred at the time was walking out the door when she opened the front door and flinched as she was forced to step back. The sun hit her and seemed to weaken her. \"I must be getting sensitive to the sun,\" said Mildred. \"I need to wear more lotion.\" Mildred grabbed an umbrella and walked out, albeit she had to force herself out because her ass seemed to have outgrown the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere was the woman oblivious to her own transformation into a giant SSBBW vampire heading now?</span></div></div>",

As Mildred was almost to Ellen's place, she took out her compact mirror and looked in surprise. She didn't see herself in the reflection at all. \"What the devil?\" she asks. \"I really hope I'm not going blind. But it would explain the red eyes.\" Mildred let out a slight hiss as her body continued to swell and she reached the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long until Ellen answered and Mildred looked in surprise at the sight of her friend. Ellen had put on a lot of weight. Both she and Mildred had to each weight at least 700lbs. But that wasn't the only thing. Ellen had fur all over her body as well as wolf's ears and a tail as well as bright blue eyes and fangs. \"Ellen?!\" yelled Mildred in surprise. \"What happened to you? You're as big as a house.\" \"Look who's calling the kettle black,\" says Ellen with a scoff. \"Look at your ass, girlfriend.\" Mildred feels her ass and lets out a grunt and then shows her fangs. \"And what's with those teeth, Mildred?\" asks Ellen. \"And that hair. You've got the same hairstyle as my granny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" says Mildred. \"Hey, hey, hey. I may have gray hair, but you've let your hair grow over your body.\" \"Oh,\" says Ellen. \"About that. Come in this way.\" Mildred screamed her obese frame through the door and then looked down at her friend's gigantic ass and her swaying tail before she stopped and let out a hiss. The sunlight entering the room seemed to hurt her and she stepped back. Ellen noticed this and then she quickly closed the blinds. \"I don't understand,\" said Mildred. \"The sun never bothered me before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllen let out a laugh. \"Well no wonder. You're turning into a vampire.\" Mildred gasped and then Ellen bent down, accidentally knocking over a vase with her oversized rump that had to be as wide as she was tall by this point. She drew out a large book before she opened it, just as her pants were coming apart. Mildred saw that her own hips were starting to expand. \"Ah,\" says Ellen. \"Here it is. Legend tells of a vampire called the Red Moon Baby who will initially take the form of a human woman but will get bigger and bigger.\" \"Oh great,\" groaned Mildred. \"How will I break it to the family? Hey kids, mommy's become the queen of the living dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllen let out a laugh. \"And get this,\" she said with a slight howl. \"Here's where I come in. The story also tells of the Blue Moon Baby. The queen of the werewolves. That no-good husband of mine will have to treat me better once I'm a giant wolf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly both Ellen and Mildred twitched and felt themselves growing until both of them were past the ten foot and two ton margin.

She quickly blossomed outwards several feet like an inflating balloon; the room seemed to grow to small for her monstrous size as her head touched the ceiling. Ellen started to expand as well, but grunted in pain as her skull began to stretch and change shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding at around eleven feet tall, her breasts grew so large that it was impossible for her to reach around them, the belly beneath sticking out nine feet from her back. She could feel her thanks against her gums, and her gray hair had grown thicker and longer, the tips at the back brushing against her car-sized butt cheeks. Ellen stood only a foot shorter, but had a body shape that almost seemed slightly fatter than Mildred's, her fur-covered belly completely exposed as her shirt hung intact by one button around her enormous breasts. She also sported a canine snout, her ears much more fluffy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs horrified as Mildred was about everything, she had to admit Mildred could pull it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a dream.\" Mildred wished with despair, running her hands down her giant belly. \"Sweet lord almighty, <i>please</i> tell me this is a dream!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mil, easy there!

What positives?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, look!\" Ellen rolled onto her side with surprising agile as round as she was and lifted an armchair from the ground, rolling back and holding it with ease. \"We've got all kinds of powers now! Think of all the stuff we could do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We\u2026yeah, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And think of how much fun we could have fun with our new bodies!

I emptied out the kitchen earlier. The only thing left in the fridge is the lightbulb and a box of baking soda.\" Mildred squeezed her fat ass into Ellen's kitchen and opened the fridge to find out that this was all too true. \"Ellen!\" yelled Mildred. \"You pig!\" \"No,\" said Ellen. \"I'm the wolf. Although I could go for a live pig right now.\" Ellen licked her lips. \"Don't worry, Mildred, I'll order out. I was planning to send for pizza anyway.\" Mildred gave a hiss before licking her fangs. \"I could go for a pizza with thick tomato sauce right about now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as Ellen nodded her head and reached for the phone to call the pizza parlor, she didn't realize that the line was wire-tapped. Another of the vampire hunters, one who was dressed in a pair of sunglasses and a white fedora with a goatee, was listening in on the conversation with the pizza place. The hunter gave a smirk as he listened in. \"001,\" he said as he spoke on his communicator. \"This is 006. I have a rather tasteful plan to get rid of the Red Moon vampire.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown the street, there was a car from the pizza parlor and the delivery boy was struggling as he tried to hold up 12 boxes of pizzas. \"Who on Earth could possibly eat 12 pizzas?\" asked the boy as he was straining himself trying to move his heavy load. \"That lady on the other end must be a hippopotamus or something. And why so much meat? If this stuff was any rarer it would still be alive.\" 006 then approached the pizza boy and held out his wallet. \"How would you like to make an easy $500.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at Ellen's house, Mildred had managed to find an apple and drove her fangs into it to suck it dry and make it shrivel. Ellen then yelled in discomfort. \"What is wrong with my teeth?! They feel like they're shivering.\" \"Mildred,\" said Ellen as she continued to scratch herself with her blobbish canine legs. \"You're a vampire now. Your body wants blood.\" Mildred gagged. \"That's disgusting. I may be a vampire now, I may be tall enough to play basketball, I may be so monstrously fat that I'd need a truck scale to know my own weight but I'm not a monster.\" \"Hey,\" said Ellen. \"Be grateful that it's only blood you want. I've been craving meat. In fact, as soon as my man gets home, if he's still doesn't know who wears the pants in the relationship, he's dog chow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when the doorbell rang. \"Oh good,\" said Mildred. \"I'll... wait, wouldn't the pizza boy be horrified to see a giant vampire at the door?\" Ellen let out a scoff. \"Wouldn't be a problem with a giant werewolf.\" Unfortunately, it wasn't the pizza boy at the door but 006 dressed in the pizza boy's uniform and carrying the pizzas, waiting to ambush Mildred. \"Say goodnight, vampire.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMildred opened the door and smiled before she realized something. \"You're not the usual pizza boy? Huh, must be new. How much do we owe you?\" 006 put down the pizzas before he held out a gun. \"Your last meal is free, vampire.\" Mildred gasped and stepped back as 006 cornered her and Ellen looked in surprise. 006 smirked and then put away his gun as Mildred hissed. Then, he took out a wreath of garlic and put the wreath around Mildred's neck. \"Chew on that, bloodsucker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, to 006's surprise, Mildred took off the garlic wreath and swallowed it before letting out a slight belch. \"Huh,\" she said. \"I guess you can't believe in everything you read.\" Ellen let out a laugh as 006 looked at Mildred in surprise. \"Alright, so you like garlic. Do you feel the same about <i>stake</i>!?\" 006 took out a wooden steak and tried to stab Mildred through the heart. However, Mildred's rolls of flesh and fat made her body too thick for the steak to penetrate and as 006 furiously tried to stab Mildred, his hand slipped and he cut himself on the shoulder and screamed in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the process the hunter bled and the cent of blood assaulted Mildred's nose. Mildred's pitch red eyes widened and she held out her fangs and hissed as she caught the scent of blood. Mildred grabbed 006 and 006 tried to scream but his mouth was muffled by the vampiress's thick breasts. Mildred then bite into 006's neck to drink his blood. 006 kept on struggling as Mildred continued to suck on him. However, Mildred actually managed to open her mouth wide enough to stuff 006's head in as he let out a muffled scream. Ellen looked in fascination as Mildred unconsciously pushed the vampire hunter headfirst into her large mouth and proceeded to swallow him whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMildred let out a loud and resonating belch as she rubbed her unbelievably huge belly. Suddenly, the vampiress realized what she had done and gasped. \"Oh my!\" she yelled. However, Ellen clapped her hands and smiled. \"Well done, Mil,\" she said. \"You sure showed that vampire hunter who was boss.\" Mildred blushed and gave a look of fear. \"Not one word to Vince,\" she said. \"He wouldn't enjoy knowing he was married to a giant bloodsucking cannibal. I can't believe it, Ellen. I ate a man alive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllen just picked up the pizzas and smirked. \"Mildred, he was trying to kill you. I'd say your response was appropriate. And don't worry, I won't tell your hubby you ate someone. On one condition.\" \"What's that?\" Ellen smirked and showed her sharp teeth. \"I get to eat the next one. After seeing you swallow that hunter, I've got a craving for human myself and I can't wait to stick a jerk in this big gorgeous gut.\" Ellen laughed and pounded her own stomach a few times as her fat rippled. \"Hey, at least we got free pizza out of the deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the werewolf and vampiress had completely murdered Ellen's couch with their truck-sized butts as they were sitting down to pizza. \"So,\" said Mildred as she shoved an entire pizza into her mouth. \"I'm now the vampire queen and you're now the werewolf queen.\" Ellen was greedily licking away at a pizza box before showing her sauce covered face to her friend. \"Looks like that's how it works, Your Majesty.\" Said Ellen teasingly. Mildred gave a teasing look herself. \"Whatever you say, Your Majesty. It's odd though, I though werewolves and vampires were enemies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllen ate another pizza before letting out a belch as cheese dripped from her face. \"Hey, we've been friends for 27 years, why ruin it now. So, how are you going to explain this to your kids.\" Mildred bit her lip before eating pizza crust. \"You're just lucky you don't have kids to break the transformation to. You and your husband haven't been getting along well lately, am I right?\" Ellen nodded her head but then smiled. \"Oh, but when he sees me now, he'll know who's the boss. So, how do you think Vincent's going to take it.\" Mildred let out a sigh. \"When I get home later, I'll try to tell him in the best way I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllen and Mildred then let out a laugh at their transformations. \"You know,\" said Ellen. \"I think we both might've actually gotten bigger. Maybe we'll be as big as Godzilla when this is over.\" Mildred let out a nervous laugh at that thought.</span></div></div>",

You don\u2019t want to scare Johnny and Cassie do you?\u201d Mildred gave a blush and a hiss. \u201cWell,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t break a promise. Besides, I\u2019ll try to explain the whole thing to them.\u201d Ellen let out a scoff as she nibbled on some pizza crust. \u201cWell, it\u2019s lucky for you that it just got cloudy all of a sudden. I\u2019m not one hundred percent sure that being the queen of the vampires will protect you from getting fried to dust.\u201d Mildred shivered at that. \u201cWell I hope it does. I wouldn\u2019t want to live like a gargoyle. Ciao, Ellen.\u201d However, Mildred had trouble squeezing her enormous girth and car-sized butt through Ellen\u2019s doorway and the werewolf had to push her to get her out as she shrieked. Mildred then gave a hiss. \u201cI hope that vampire hunter I ate didn\u2019t go straight to my thighs.\u201d Of course, Mildred found out the hard way that she was about to have other problems. Mainly, the fact that her ass was bigger than her entire car. The vampiress put her buttocks against the vehicle and realized that there was no possible way that she would be able to fit inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDang,\u201d she said. \u201cThis might be a...\u201d Suddenly, the vampiress got an idea. \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m a vampire. I wonder...\u201d Mildred then held out her arms as they shifted and turned into enormous bright red leather wings and her gray hair grew longer long black fur grew over the rest of her body and her face stretched out and her ears extended. Her clothes disappeared into her body as her feet turned into sharp claws with hot pink toenails. As the vampiress transformed again, she also got bigger. Now, Mildred was an 18ft tall vampire bat with a 17ft wide stomach and 21ft wide ass and huge E-cup breasts. The vampiress hissed and let out a laugh. \u201cNow this is what I\u2019m talking about. The obese giant bat let out a laugh and then slapped one of her car destroying butt cheeks to make it ripple and shake. Then she opened her wings, revealing a 30ft wingspan that would allow her fat ass to fly as she took off into the air and let out a laugh to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, what the titanically colossal and obese vampiress in the sky didn\u2019t know was that there was a bus heading towards the schoolyard and two of the vampire hunters were on it. One of the hunters was wearing a hood and appeared to have smoke bombs strapped to his belt while the other one was a mad with bright pink hair who appeared to be loading a gun with nerf-style darts right before he held up a communicator of some sort. \u201c091,\u201d said 001. \u201cYou know your mission. Find the children of the Red Moon Baby and the vampiress will have no choice but to surrender with her life. \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile at the school baseball field, the rest of the baseball team had left while Mildred\u2019s twins, Johnny and Cassie had remained on the baseball field. Johnny was holding up his bat as he twisted his hat. \u201cCome on, Johnny,\u201d said Cassie. \u201cI\u2019m almost ready to make my move. Why do you have to have to twist your hat every time.\u201d \u201cCome on, Cassie,\u201d said Johnny to his sister. \u201cIt\u2019s for luck.\u201d Cassie let out a laugh. \u201cThere is no such thing as luck, Johnny. People make their own fortune. There is a logical explanation to everything.\u201d Johnny let out a sigh. \u201cCome on, Sis. You\u2019re no fun. Just throw the ball.\u201d Cassie shook her head and tossed her baseball before suddenly a dirt struck the baseball and knocked it in half. Johnny gasped. \u201cWhat the heck!\u201d Then Johnny screamed as several smoke bombs hit the ground. \u201cJohnny!\u201d yelled Cassie. Before Cassie could say another word, 050 grabbed her and made her groan as he covered her mouth. 091 stepped out and held Johnny in his grip as he held up his dart gun. \"Let me go you ugly jerk!\" yelled Johnny. 091 shot another dart and it knocked a bird out of the sky as Johnny and Cassie looked in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright brats,\" said 091. \"This is how it's going to work. You two are hostages. We need you to smoke out the Red Moon Baby.\" \"Red Moon Baby?\" asked Cassie. \"What are you talking about?\" 050 just squeezed Cassie tight and made her scream. \"You leave my sister alone!\" yelled Johnny. Johnny bit 091 and made the vampire hunter groan in pain. \"Why you little!\" yelled Johnny. \"I oughta shoot you right now if it weren't for your mother.\" Cassie gasped but then 050 gagged her. It looked as though the villains would capture Mildred's kids but then they heard a loud and angry shriek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hunters turned and saw Mildred in bat form flying down from the sky and she was pissed. She let out a scream as she swooped down and knocked Cassie out of 050's hands. 050 grunted and tossed several grenades but none of them hit Mildred. While 091 was distracted, Johnny was able to slip out of his hands just as the pink-haired hunter fired darts at Mildred. \"What is that?!\" yelled Cassie. \"That's the biggest and fattest bat I've ever seen!\" yelled Johnny. \"Are they using growth hormones on bats.\" \"Growth hormones don't work like that, Johnny!\" yelled Cassie. \"A bat that size shouldn't exist. The biggest bat in the world is the giant golden crowned flying fox and it only reaches 5.6ft in terms of wingspan. Besides, the golden crowned flying fox is a fruit bat and that creature is clearly a vampire bat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n091 kept shooting at Mildred but ran out of aim as the bat landed on the ground and morphed into her true vampire form. However, the vampiress was now even bigger than she was as a bat. She stood 30ft tall with a 25ft wide stomach and 45ft wide ass as she looked down and hissed at the hunters who could only stare. Johnny and Cassie were just as surprised. \"A vampire!\" yelled Johnny. \"A vampire the size of a Megazord!\" \"B-But that's impossible,\" said Cassie. \"Vampires aren't real, are they?\" Mildred however, was all too real and she looked down angrily at the hunters who threatened her son and daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n091 and 050 looked up at the enraged vampiress in pure fear as she bore her teeth and screamed right as Mildred was about to stomp them. She barely missed but that was enough to make 091 and 050 realize that there was no way they could win a fight with such an enormous bloodsucking beast. \u201cListen here,\u201d said Mildred rather angrily. \u201cI already dealt with one hunter today but if you so much as touch my kids, your fate will be 100 times worse than his.\u201d Mildred\u2019s eyes glowed red as both Johnny and Cassie looked up and shivered at the sight of their mutated mother. At least they showed more courage than 091 and 050 who ran away in fear. They definitely didn\u2019t expect Mildred to get so big so fast and could do nothing to stand up to her. This prompted the giant vampire housewife to smile smugly and show her fangs. \"I wish they stuck around,\" Mildred thought. \"I owe Ellen a snack. Oh my gosh. I think I actually got bigger. I wonder if my bat form is actually smaller than my vampire form now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMildred then turned to see Cassie and Johnny looking down. They knew she was a vampire now, but they still recognized their mother's face. \"Mom?!\" yelled Johnny. \"Wh-What....?\" \"How did you get so big?\" asked Casey. Mildred let out a nervous laugh. \"Well, this is going to be hard to explain, but I'll tell you on the way home.\" Mildred transformed back into her 18ft tall vampire bat form, showing that she indeed was bigger as a vampire than she was as a bat. She lowered her head and smiled as her children climbed upon her and she flapped her wings. \"This is awesome!\" yelled Johnny. \"Our mother is a vampire and a big one at that. \"This is impossible,\" said Cassie. \"There's no such thing as vampires.\" \"Hello, Cassie! Our mom is a giant vampire and she just turned into a bat.\" \"That's another thing,\" said Cassie. \"Something this huge and heavy shouldn't even be able to fly.\" Mildred lets out a shriek. \"Watch what you say, Cassie! I\u2019m still bigger than you. And your mother.\u201d Cassie zipped her lip as she rode on her giant and morbidly obese mother's back.</span></div></div>",

It had NOT been a pleaseant trip back: what with them trying to kidnap two kids in broad daylight, the police had been on their tails quite soon after they'd fled from Mildred. To make matters worse for the duo, the sudden appearance of a giant vampiress in the city had caused such a panic that cops seemed to come in swarms, hounding them from every direction--it was only through luck, and 050's last few remaining smoke bombs, that they'd managed to flee. Even now, 050 was peeking out the windows for signs of any tailing police<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe it, how could she have gotten THAT BIG?!\" 091 ranted, running a hand through his pink hair. \"She's only just transformed....taking her kids; what a joke! Even if he had managed to grab the brats, she'd have just tracked us down somehow and stomped us flat! What was 001 thinking with that plan?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n050's  head snapped toward his partner, a scowl on his face. \"Watch your mouth, you know better than to badmouth our leader. It was OUR fault this didn't work, not his. Really, smoke bombs and poison darts against THAT beast? What were WE thinking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n091 looked ready to retort that, but he was interrupted by his communicator beeping. He shared a look of dread with his cohort before taking out the device and keying the comm. \"Er, 091 reporting...\"<br>\r\n<i>\"I know there's a radio or television in your safehouse. Turn it on, now.\"</i> It was 001's voice, even more stoic and commanding than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hunters shared a look of confusion before 091 obeyed, flicking  on a radio atop a crate of medical supplies. <br>\r\n<i>\"--breaking just now, a kidnapping was foiled at a local school park today when what eyewitnesses insist was a...vampire swept down and saved two children. Jake Morgan is on the scene--\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n091 tuned to a new channel, a look of dawning shock on his face.<br>\r\n<i>\"Ah say a monster is a monster, simple as that,</i> Came the Southern  accented voice of one presumed witness. <i>\"But it takes a right sicko to go an' hurt a kid. So, while I'd reach fer mah shotgun if I saw either Miss Vampire OR them hunters, I'd at least give HER a warnin' shot.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs 091 promptly turned the radio off, 001 resumed berating them. <i>\"Not only did you two fail, but now that demon is seen as a hero by much of the public! Do you two have any idea how much this could damage our efforts?! Now our mission to save the world from this abomination will be seen as propaganda! In their eyes, she'll be the victim, not the true threat!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n051 Cleared his throat. \"Sir, the beast doesn't appear to be hostile to humams yet, or have designs on the world at large. We take full responsibility for this setback, but the Red Moon Baby is likely NOT at her full power and potential yet. Even seen as a heroine, she isn't invincible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStatic sounded as 001 humphed. <i>\"....You make a good point. All is not lost yet. And at least you two didn't get yourselves killed, lime the other hunters sent after our target. Very well, lay low until the autborities are off your trail; keep an eye on the news and roumors for any new developments with the Red Moon Baby...or her canine companion, for that matter. We'll have another chance to end this meanace within time. Just remember you won't be so lucky if you fail next time\"</i> <br>\r\nThe line went dead with a *beep*.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n051 sighed, rubbing his temples. \"That was close, for a second I thought he was gonna send us out against that bloodsucking  bitch again. Guess it's just intel-gathering for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n091 slumped into a chair, looking exhausted beyond words. \"Huh...just how big will that vaml and her werewolf friend get, anyway? Do I even want to know...ugh, i need a drink. A STRONG drink....\"</span></div></div>",

I can\u2019t believe it! Mildred, please tell me this is a joke. However, Mildred who was at that moment in the form of a 25ft tall and 10 ton vampire bat, shook her head to let her husband know that she was being serious. At that moment the bat giantess was perched in a tree that was coming apart under her weight and even though she was in the tree, her immense rear was still touching the ground. Vince let out a grumble. \u201cDad,\u201d said Johnny. \u201cDon\u2019t blow a blood vessel.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVince glared at his son. \u201cReally, Johnny? You couldn\u2019t have chosen a better choice of words?! Your mother is now a vampire the size of a whale. I knew all brides let themselves go but this is ridiculous. Why did this have to happen? All because of some stupid prophecy. It doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d Mildred just lowered her head and smiled at Vince. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay, Vince,\u201d she said. \u201cI may be big and bloated and bloodthirsty but it\u2019s not like I\u2019m plotting to enslave or destroy humanity or everything. Those idiot hunters must think I\u2019m a...\u201d \u201cAnd that\u2019s another thing. Where there\u2019s two hunters, there\u2019s going to be more. If I had any idea I would be married to a vampire, I swear...!!\u201d Before Vince could finish his sentence, Mildred flapped her wings and then flew up into the air before she grabbed her husband between her toes and then turned to her tiny son. \u201cJohnny. Please go back in the house with your sister. Your father and I have to talk.\u201d Johnny obeyed his mother right as Mildred flew into the air carrying Vince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVince closed his eyes and held on tight to the bat giantess\u2019s toes. \u201cDammit, Mildred! I told you I\u2019m afraid of heights. Mildred just shrieked slightly as the clouds parted and revealed that it was night. Mildlred smiled before the vampiress flew down into a mountain area and placed her husband on the top of the mountain. Vince looked like he was about to have a heart attack right before Mildred transformed back into her vampire form. Now the vampire woman was 50ft tall, had F-Cup breasts, a 45ft wide stomach and a monstrous 75ft wide ass that looked like it was touching her neck as she sat down and looked down and smiled at Vince. Vince couldn\u2019t help but look in fear at his wife\u2019s sharp fangs. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Honey,\u201d said Mildred. \u201cI know this is sudden but it looks like for the rest of my life, I\u2019m going to be a creature of the night. Guess that leaves PTA meetings, pancake breakfast and Good Morning America out of the question.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVince let out a groan as he walked up towards his wife\u2019s chins. \u201cHow can you joke about this? You\u2019re a vampire. Where am I going to get enough blood to satisfy you.\u201d Mildred just smirked at his husband. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she said as she licked her lips. \u201cI promise I\u2019ll stop at 7 pints, honey.\u201d Mildred even licked her husband\u2019s entire body and made him scream. \u201cDon\u2019t even joke about that, Mil,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not a juice box. With how big you are, you might swallow me if you tried to suck my blood.\u201d Mildred bit her lower lip. She definitely couldn\u2019t tell her husband that she swallowed a would-be hunter earlier. Vince just let out a groan. \u201cI\u2019ll bet your friend Ellen doesn\u2019t give her husband this much grief.\u201d \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be so sure about that, honey,\u201d said Mildred as she leaned forward and obliviously flattened a hill under her ass. \u201cEllen\u2019s a werewolf as big as me now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVince was now very horrified. \u201cA werewolf!? You\u2019re kidding me! Is every housewife in the neighborhood going to turn into a giant fat monster? The transformation, the hunters and now a werewolf. This isn\u2019t happening, this isn\u2019t happening, this....\u201d Before Vince could rant any longer, Mildred stared down at him as her eyes glowed bright and she stared into his eyes. Vince\u2019s eyes became wide and his pupils became dilated as if he was in the trance. Mildred had hypnotized him. \u201cListen and obey,\u201d said the vampiress. \u201cYou are acting tense. I know how to fix this. Take off your clothes.\u201d Vince was unable to do anything but obey his ginormous and obese blood drinking wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd now,\u201d said Mildred. \u201cAllow me to destroy your body. I am your wife and your queen and you must give in.\u201d Vince nodded his head and then Mildred managed to tilt back as she started to raise one of her thighs as thick as road tunnels and it was there...</span></div></div>",

She'd already loved her new lease on life as a 50-foot lycanthrope, and had been spending the day enjoying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarly morning had been a long stomp through the woods outside of town, swallowing a whole herd of deer whole for breakfast\u2026and scaring the daylights out of some hunters. Seeing the tough-looking men squeal like little girls and run had left her (literally) howling with laughter. She even teased the poor hunters, half-heartedly chasing them and knocking trees aside with her ample hips. The few accurate shots they got off before she got bored felt like pinpricks; most didn't even pierce her hide. <br>\r\nEllen gave a fanged smirk. Even <i>with</i> silver bullets, they wouldn't have hurt her. At her size, and with her girth, it\u2019d take silver <i>artillery shells</i> to kill her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the morning was some of the most fun she'd had in ages: stomping through her neighborhood, enjoying seeing people panic and stare in shock; lifting the roof off the grocery store to do some shopping\u2014sitting on a few cars in the parking lot, just because she could. \u201cMake that out to credit, will ya kid?\u201d She told the shivering cashier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe even tore strips off a circus tent to make some crude clothing for her giant form, managing to make a set of lingerie. <br>\r\nEllen ignored the terrified crowd fleeing her as she put on her new clothes. \u201cA bra and panties aren't exactly modest, but it was better than going around in my old clothes. They're pretty much destroyed anyway.\u201d She spotted a cotton candy trolley, now small enough to hold in her hand. Shrugging, she snatched it up and tossed the whole thing into her canine maw, swallowing it whole.<br>\r\n\u201cMmm\u2026blueberry flavored.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way home Ellen experimented with walking on all fours like a \u201cnormal\u201d wolf.<br>\r\nShe could mange it, but her still-human cleavage swayed wildly, even with her newly-made bra on. \u201cUgh. So much for that. Guess I\u2019m walking upright from now on,\u201d she grumbled, not noticing her tail knocking over a telephone poll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA swarm of cop cars and talk of a giant vampire woman interrupted Ellen\u2019s fun. Apparently those hunters had tried to kidnap Mildred\u2019s kids! \u201cSickos\u2026I hope Mildred ate them alive for that! Mmm, maybe I should try and find where they're coming from\u2014they could be tasty!\u201d She blinked; \u201cDid I just say I want to eat people? \u2026Meh, guess it comes with being a werewolf.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got home that afternoon, she found her husband drunkenly stumbling around the yard, and growled at the sight. Now it was time to teach him a lesson! She began to stalk him, staying as low as she could and hiding behind her neighbors\u2019 houses. (Though given how fat and tall she was, it didn't conceal much. Luckily, her husband was drunk out of his mind; barely able to stand as he fumbled with his keys by the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllen was just behind him, crouched in a hunter\u2019s pose, fat rear in the air, when her stomach growled. During all her fun, she'd forgotten to get lunch. And here was an easy meal, right in front of her\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut did she really want to eat her husband?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What made it striking was that there was literally not a cloud in the sky. The biker chick then looked forward and saw something on the side of the road. Since it was so distant, she couldn\u2019t tell what it was and mistook it for someone in need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLance!\u201d she yelled. \u201cPull over, I think there\u2019s somebody out in the side of the road.\u201d Lance did so and drove up to what Velma assumed was someone in the side of the pavement, but as it turns out, it was a totem pole with what looked like a large thunderbird on the top. \u201cLooks like it was only a totem pole that collapsed from the heat,\u201d joked Lance. \u201cBut what\u2019s it doing all the way out here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelma got out of the sidecar and walked up to the totem pole before picking it up and walking it out into the desert. \u201cWell,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can\u2019t just leave it on the ground. These things are sacred.\u201d Velma dug a hole to stick the totem pole in and suddenly she thought she could see the totem\u2019s eyes glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d she asked. Then she heard Lance revving the vehicle. \u201cCome on, Velma. We need to get back to our road trip.\u201d Velma walked up to the sidecar but had some trouble squeezing in. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Love?\u201d asked Lance. Velma groaned. \u201cWell,\u201d she said. \u201cIt looks like I\u2019m putting on more weight than I thought.\u201d Lance shrugged his shoulders and soon they were off.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Velma held onto Lance as the lovely couple were continuing to drive down the road. \"Hey, Velma,\" said Lance. \"What do you think that totem pole was doing out in the open like that.\" \"No idea, Love,\" said Velma. \"Perhaps it was left there by some friendly Native Americans who couldn't take it when they migrated.\" Velma then saw purple feathers on her arms and then looked up. \"Fast moving crows they have around here.\" She said. Then Velma's stomach let out a gurgle and she held it. \"Hey, Lance,\" said Velma. \"I'm feeling hungry. Let's see if there's a place to get a bite in this area.\" Lance nodded his head. \"My baby is hungry,\" he said. \"So let's see if Lance can't find anything.\" Lance looked ahead and saw what looked like a diner down the road. \"Looks like we're in luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance and Velma drove up and parked in the parking lot to the side of the diner. However, Velma had trouble getting out of her seat because it looked a lot like her rear had gotten bigger, to the point where her bike pants looked more like a thong. \"Lance, Sweetie,\" said Velma. \"Do you think that perhaps you could...\" Lance grabbed his ginger-haired girlfriend by the arms and yanked the biker chick out of the sidecar, totally it in the process. \"I knew I shouldn't have left the bloody bike out in the rain. It must've rusted and contracted the sidecar\" Moaned Lance. Velma just shrugged her shoulders. \"It's alright, Love,\" she said. \"No one got hurt. Now come on, I'm starving.\" As Velma walked into the diner, Lance adjusted his sunglasses because he could've sworn that Velma was taller than he was and was more pear-shaped than he remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Lance shrugged it off as they walked into the diner. There, a burly and muscular trucker with blue heart tattoos over his body was just finishing his meal. \"We don't get a lot of bikers around here.\" Said the trucker. Lance and Velma sat down in the stools next to the biker as the barkeeper showed up and she smiled at them. \"You two look like you're dressed to kill.\" \"That's right,\" said Lance. \"Me girlfriend and I are taking a vacation to see America.\" The trucker next to them paid for his meal before speaking to them. \"Happy trails then. But be careful. The open road can be a scary and unpredictable place. You never know what you'll find. The other day, I picked up a guy who turned out to have been dead for 100 years. That and a wanted fugitive. Well, I'm off. I've got a mission to lug some strange chemicals for a soda company. You two be careful.\" Then, the trucker whispered into Lance's ear. \"You're a brave man by the way. Dating a gal twice your size.\" Lance raised an eyebrow before putting his money on the table. \"We'll have the house specials.\" \"Make mine a double.\" Said Velma. Lance looked at Velma in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before the barkeeper brought Lance and Velma their orders. Both appeared to be hamburgers with tuna, however, Velma had ordered double what Lance ordered and was biting into a burger before Lance could even think about eating his. \"Are you sure you know what you're doing, Velma?\" asked Lance. \"That's a lot of food.\" Velma shrugged her shoulders and continued eating. The burgers however, weren't enough to settle her hunger and she quickly was stacking up plates from her meal to Lance's disbelief since he still had only taken the first bite of his burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bar hostess then brought out a shake and pie for Velma to sample. \"Land sakes,\" said the woman as Velma continued eating. \"She sure is hungry. Your girlfriend eats as if there's a monster inside of her.\" Lance let out a sigh and he was about to eat his own meal when he saw that he had mysteriously been knocked out of his seat. Lance grunted and looked up and gasped because Velma had not only gotten taller but her ass expanded to the point where it was filling four stools and bending two of them. The bar hostess then gasped because Velma just appeared to be getting bigger and indigo feathers started to grow all over her body as her mouth extended and turned into a light bluish gray beak. Her feathers also had red and black highlights and Velma's ass expanded to the point where her shorts exploded off as she sprouted a few tail feathers and Velma's boots tore open to show her feet had turned into talons as green highlights sprouted around Velma's eyes. Velma kept getting bigger and bigger until every last stool was crushed. Velma grunted and stood up, crashing through the roof in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelma grumbled and then looked to see that she had turned into a 40ft tall thunderbird with thighs ten times thicker than tree-trunks, huge D-cup breasts, a 42ft wide belly and butt, a double chin and what looked like a 100ft wingspan. She gasped and looked down at Lance who was practically getting a nose bleed looking up at his thunderbird transformation. The bar hostess actually fainted at the sight of the thunderbird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Velma herself take the transformation?</span></div></div>",

I want other people to come up with their own ideas, but I wanted to get 8 creatures in based off 8 elements)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt begun one time at an old house near Central Park. A young Native American woman named Salli and her husband, Keith were walking up to an old chateau that was adorned with tens of statues of gargoyles. \u201cThis is the place,\u201d said Salli. \u201cGrandmother trusted me to safely move everything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith took a look at one gargoyle statue with a bird like face and cringed. \u201cI dunno doll,\u201d he said. \u201cShe left you all these gargoyles in the will. Kinda creepy.\u201d \u201cMy grandmother collected a lot of strange artifacts but none stranger than these gargoyles.\u201d Sally lowered herself to the level of a gargoyle statue resembling some kind of imp. \u201cI don\u2019t mind. I think they\u2019re actually kind of cute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith saw his wife petting one of the statues and gave a look of concern. \u201cWhatever,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll just box these things, take them home and decide what to do with them over the weekend.\u201d The two of them wrapped the statues in bubble wrap and placed them in cardboard boxes before loading them into the truck then rented. \u201cI still can\u2019t understand why your grandmother wanted to keep so many of those things around. Anything this evil looking can\u2019t be good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeith,\u201d said Salli as she dusted off a gargoyle with spikes jutting from its head. \u201cGargoyles aren\u2019t evil. Quite the opposite, they act to keep away evil spirits. Sort of like supernatural scarecrows.\u201d \u201cI can see why,\u201d replied her husband. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to run into one of these things in a dark alley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSalli shook her head and then noticed one statue that was covered in dead moss. She picked the statue up and took it out back to hose it off. \u201cPoor thing,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll bet you guys don\u2019t like being left out in the cold. Don\u2019t worry. I promised my grandmother, I\u2019d take good care of you.\u201d \u201cSalli!\u201d yelled Keith. \u201cCould you give me a hand here? This one is really heavy.\u201d \u201cComing, Keith. I\u2019ll be right back, my stone friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Salli walked away from that gargoyle statue, she didn\u2019t notice the statue\u2019s eyes opened. \u201cWe\u2019ve found our queen.\u201d The statue said telepathically.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Salli and Keith were unaware of that apparently alive gargoyle statue and soon the two of them had taken every gargoyle from the chateau back to their house. Salli laid nine of them in a row outside the front yard and even a few in the backyard. Keith was very worried about his wife decorating the house with the grotesque and horrifying looking statues and then turned and looked in fear and even screamed because he was face to face with an incredibly grotesque looking gargoyle with a face resembling a bird's skull of some sort and this gargoyle seemed to have been modeled to resemble some kind of mage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith fell to the ground and panting before he saw Salli right behind the stone statue. \"Sorry about that, Keith. There were too many gargoyles to place outside so I've decided to bring some of them indoors.\" Keith stood up and gave a glare at the statue that scared him. \"Your grandmother must've been crazy to keep so many gargoyles around her house. Just looking at that thing, I know I'm gonna have nightmares tonight.\" \"Oh hush,\" said Salli to her husband. \"They're not harming anybody. Besides, I think they give the place a supernatural touch.\" Keith let out a sigh and held onto his wife. \"Well, if you say so. Maybe those things are good. Maybe they do protect against evil spirits. But I would never want to meet a live one of those in a dark alley.\" However, Salli didn't agree and stroked the head of the gargoyle. \"Oh,\" she said. \"I don't know about that.\" Salli let out a laugh and didn't see the gargoyle mage statue's eyes glowing bright white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night it was pitch black and thundering while Salli and Keith were asleep in bed. One man passing the street saw the gargoyles outside and shivered but then he thought he saw one of them fold his wings down as if to act as an umbrella. The passerby took off his glasses and put them back on to see several seemingly immobile statues. Salli and Keith were in bed snoozing away until something startled Salli up. The Native American woman awoke to a scratching noise and as she got out of bed, she thought she saw something that looked like a set of sharp claws trying to scratch on the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she ignored it and let out a yawn. \"I must be more tired than I thought,\" she said. \"I need a nice warm glass of milk.\" Salli walked downstairs and made her way to the kitchen, but as she did so, it would appear that the gargoyles that decorated the stairway and living room were watching her. Salli walked into the kitchen and as she reached into the fridge, there was a crash of lightning and for a brief moment it looked as though the statue of the gargoyle mage was behind her. But when Salli turned around, she saw there was nobody there. Salli shrugged her shoulders and heated up a glass of milk. As she was waiting for her warm milk, the young woman heard a strange chanting sound that was in an unidentifiable language. Salli looked around and saw that she was completely alone, nothing but several inanimate statues. Salli smiled and drank the milk before stroking a small gargoyle on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as Salli walked upstairs, she underwent a strange transformation. First her skin turned a bright violet color and her ears grew to a point. Then six large horns that looked like they were in the shape of a tiara, begun to form on her forehead as her sleepy eyes took a more animalistic shape. With each step, she also appeared to be growing taller and putting on weight, most of it was going to her ass and thighs, but her stomach was getting quite large as well. Her pajama pants were beginning to tear, not just from Salli's growing booty and hips, but because she sprouted a long reptile-like tail. her slippers then fell off as her feet transformed into sharp talons just as her fingers turned into claws that looked sharp enough to slice through steel like butter. She also appeared to sprout spikes on top of her shoulders and four spikes on her upper back. Salli let out a yawn and revealed that she had grown fangs. Finally, she sprouted a pair of leather wings from her back that had a bright cerulean membrane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSalli was just about to return to bed with Keith when she walked by a mirror and saw that she had transformed into an 8-foot tall violet-skinned gargoyle who had to weigh at least a thousand pounds. Salli focused as she turned around to get a good look at her 6-foot wide belly and ass and wagged her tail and flapped her wings. How would she take this transformation? Given that she was half asleep, would she believe it?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Salli took a good look at herself in the mirror and then wiggled her humongous gargoyle ass in front of the mirror. She even took a closer look and opened her mouth to feel her fangs. It looked like she would realize that she had transmogrified into a huge violet-skinned gargoyle. However, Salli then let out a deep yawn. \"I must be tired. This has got to be the strangest dream I've had yet.\" Salli then noticed a gargoyle with a fish-like face and what looked to be an eyepatch sculpted into the stone. Salli smiled and rubbed the gargoyle on the head. \"Hey,\" she said. \"You're welcome to stay in my house, but I would appreciate it if you stayed out of my dreams. Unless of course you could somehow make it a dream about Hawaii.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSalli laughed at her joke and then decided to walk back upstairs to bed. However, what she didn't know was that her gargoyle transformation was not a dream. This was proven as she was walking up the stairs and each step begun to crack under her talons from her enormous weight. The gargoyle woman however, was completely oblivious and got back in bed with Keith, the mattress springs creaking underneath the weight of the enormous purple gargoyle as she covered herself, unconsciously curling her new wings into a nightcap-like hood as she yawned again. \"Maybe if I fall asleep in the dream, it will make more sense. I could've sworn that Keith was taller than me when we went to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBRIIIIIIIIIING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Salli and Keith's alarm clock rang loudly. Keith turned off the clock and mumbled. He would've ignored it and gone back to sleep, but in the back, he fell something huge and soft that appeared to be on Salli's side of the bed. \"WTF?\" thought Keith to himself. \"Has Salli been putting on weight lately? I warned her that those chocolate croissants would...\" Keith than woke wide awake and gasped at what he saw, surprisingly not waking Salli up in the process. Salli was still a gargoyle and she had gotten even bigger. She had to be 15ft tall and from the destroyed bed, she had to weigh at least 5000lbs. Her ass alone was big enough to completely cast a shadow over her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith sprung out of bed and looked at Salli's tail twitching in her sleep. He felt around Salli to notice that while her skin was soft and smooth it was also rough at the same time, which was not unsurprising since she was a gargoyle. In her sleep her wingspan had also gotten bigger in order to suit her massive size and it looked like she was using her wings as a blanket. \"OMG,\" said Keith in surprise. \"Salli.\" Keith then turned to a multi-horned, long-fanged and goateed gargoyle statue dressed similar to a knave of hearts by their bed. \"I don't know what's going on,\" he said. \"But I bet you rocky, nocturnal, leather-winged jerks are behind it somehow. How's that for gratitude? If it were up to me, Salli would've dropped you off at a cemetery. Just you wait, as soon as I get my wife back to normal, you and all your roof-warming buddies are pumice. How do you like them apples, Pebbles!? What am I doing talking to a gargoyle. Nothing more than a mindless, immobile piece of slate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith ran to the phone to answer it and as he turned around he looked in surprise because it appeared that the hand of the gargoyle statue he had just threatened had shifted position and appeared to be flipping him the bird. Keith rubbed his eyes and then saw that the statue appeared to have returned to its normal position. Keith didn't entirely know what was going on, but he also didn't care and so he dialed up a friend he knew who was a doctor. \"Hello, oh, thank goodness it's you, Chris, it's Keith. Something is seriously wrong with Salli. What's the matter? She's turned into a gargoyle. I am serious. She inherited a collection of gargoyle statues and I'm pretty sure that they're cursed because when I woke up this morning, Salli had transformed into a giant, fat, purple... hello?\" Keith's friend on the phone clearly did not believe a word he said and hung up, leaving Keith to grumble to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Keith turned around to see Salli still asleep and snoring away. \"She usually wakes up before I do,\" he said. \"Then again, this is the time when gargoyles are usually out cold. But does she even know what's happened to her? I'm going to wake her up.\" Keith walked past the gargoyle knave statue and was going to shake his giant obese gargoyle wife up. Keith then grabbed Salli by the tail and begun to pull it. \"Salli!\" he yelled. \"Wake up! Get your fat ass out of bed! It's an emergency!\"</span></div></div>",

Keith let out a groan. \u201cI heard gargoyles were supposed to be sleeping and immobile by day, but come on, Salli! Wake your fat ass up!\u201d The purple woman merely yawned in her sleep before wiggling her flabby clawed hand. She rolled over and showed that her stomach was as wide as she was tall but her ass had to be 25ft wide, to say nothing of her E-cup breasts. Keith couldn\u2019t help but feel all around Salli\u2019s ass. It was somehow soft and rough at the same time given how thick-skinned gargoyles were. Keith then got an idea and picked up a baseball bat that was laying around. His plan was to smack Salli in the ass to wake her up. \"I hate to do this, Dear,\" said Keith. \"But desperate times call for desperate measures. This bat won't be the only hard thing after the first whack.\"<br>\r\n\u2028<br>\r\nHowever, as Keith was about to assault his wife\u2019s rear, the gargoyle knave animated and ran in before grabbing hold of the bat before it could make impact. The statue\u2019s eyes glowed white to make it clear he didn\u2019t approve of Keith\u2019s actions. Keith himself looked at the living statue and gasped. \u201cWhat the hell?!\u201d The gargoyle knave then took the bat and broke it in half as he gave a glare Keith\u2019s way. \u201cThe statues!\u201d yelled Keith. \u201cThey\u2019re alive!\u201d The gargoyle knave then reached to his belt and took out a sword and swung it as Keith screamed and stepped back. \u201cAbout that pumice comment, I was just kidding.\u201d Keith gave a nervous smile but it didn\u2019t look like the knave was in the mood for jokes and the creature swung his sword, missed Keith and destroyed a lamp. \u201cGeez!\u201d The gargoyle knave appeared to be very angry with Keith and continued to attack him, all while Salli in her transmogrified form was snoozing away and unconsciously using her wings as a blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith backed up and then felt something sharp pointing in his back. Keith gave a grunt and turned to see another animated gargoyle statue. This one was a gargoyle with a long beaked face and what appeared to be a ponytail and an eyepatch. He appeared to be carrying a spear and he looked just as mad at Keith as the gargoyle with the sword. \u201cThis is not good.\u201d Muttered Keith. The two gargoyle soldiers attacked Keith and forced him to duck to the ground to avoid getting bisected and impaled. \u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d asked Keith. \u201cIf this is a bad dream, I\u2019d like to wake up, now.\u201d \u201cSilence, kur!\u201d yelled a deep male voice. Keith looked forward and gasped. That voice came out of the gargoyle with sword. Keith couldn\u2019t believe it but then the statue spoke again. \u201cThou dieth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the gargoyles were advancing, Keith begun to laugh slightly insanely. \u201cYou talked? Gargoyles don\u2019t talk! Gargoyles don\u2019t move! They\u2019re just statues built to be scarecrows for evil spirits!\u201d \u201cNot all gargoyles,\u201d said the beaked spear wielder in a rather raspy voice. \u201cYou just stumbled upon a nest of live ones.\u201d \u201cAnd you have immediately proven yourself our enemy.\u201d Said the swordsman. Both gargoyles swung their weapons, missed Keith and put holes in the wall. \u201cListen,\u201d said Keith trying desperately to save himself. \u201cI\u2019m not your enemy.\u201d \u201cYou must think we have rocks for brains,\u201d said the spear wielder. \u201cWe saw you about to assault our new queen.\u201d \u201cQueen!?\u201d yells Keith in surprise. The spear wielder tried to stab Keith, but Keith grabbed a book to act as a shield and tossed another one at the spearman to knock him to the ground. But the swordsman flew into the air and tried to attack Keith, narrowly missing his cheek in the process as he screamed. Keith felt his face bleeding and then he started to put two and two together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo those gargoyles did turn Salli into one of their own. Queen? They think she\u2019s their queen? Well, it would explain why they made her so freaking huge. Ah!\u201d Keith moved out of the way as the gargoyle swordsman nearly cut him below the belt with his blade and then his eyes begun to water. \u201cI didn\u2019t intend any harm!\u201d yelled the young man desperately. \u201cI was just trying to wake up my wife!\u201d \u201cBy resorting to such barbaric and violent extremes?\u201d asked the gargoyle swordsman. The spear wielder got up and pointed his sharp blade to the back of Keith\u2019s neck. \u201cEspecially since she is your wife,\u201d said the spearman. \u201cThat\u2019s domestic abuse. Don\u2019t think we didn\u2019t see you pulling her tail as well. Assault and potential regicide. That\u2019s what you stand accused of.\u201d \u201cAnd thou dieth.\u201d Said the swordsman. Keith realized that the gargoyles were not fooling around and fully intended to harm him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then he got an idea. \"You said that Salli was your queen, right?\" asked the young man. \"She is also my wife. That makes me your king. <i>You</i> are the ones attempting regicide.\" Keith smiled confidently, hoping that his logic would dissuade the gargoyles from harming him. However, both the spearman and the swordsman simply laughed at him. \"We have no use for a king,\" said the spearman. \"Besides, a human king commanding gargoyles? You're the one with rocks in your head.\" Keith let out a groan. \"It was worth a shot.\" Keith then grunted because the swordsman pushed him to the ground. Keith looked up to see twelve of the gargoyles staring down at him, clearly enraged at what they believed was an act of malice towards their queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" said Keith. \"I'm only going to ask this once, so you all better listen well. \"WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON AROUND HERE!? WHY IS MY WIFE A BIG FAT GARGOYLE!? WHY ARE YOU CALLING HER YOUR QUEEN!? WHY AM I SPEAKING TO A BUNCH OF STONE CREATURES?! AM I GOING CRAZY!\" Keith then screamed because the spear wielder proceeded to step on his back and drive his talons into him. \"Silence! You will be on trial for your sins! Take him to the dungeon!\" However, one of the gargoyles walked out of the crowd, a short gargoyle with fin-like wings attacked to his arms and a face resembling that of a scorpionfish. \"There isn't a dungeon in this house. We checked.\" The spear wielder rubbed the back of his head in embarrassment and would've blushed if he wasn't made of stone, just as the swordsman face palmed and let out a grunt. \"Then take him to the basement. There, he will face judgement for trying to cause our queen harm.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith was sweating heavily. He knew that these gargoyles clearly did not like him and would probably torture him. Then again, he realized that attempting to wake up his giant mutated wife with a baseball bat probably did have unfortunate implications but before he could think, both the gargoyle with the spear and the gargoyle knave with the sword were dragging him down the stairs to the basement. \"Ow! Ow! Ow! Watch it! Oh geez. Why oh why, oh why did Salli's grandmother leave her those damned gargoyles?\" One gargoyle with a hawk-like face and thick wings shrieked angrily into Keith's face for that \"damned gargoyles\" remark and Keith bit his lip to tell the gargoyles how he understood his mouth was only getting him into more and more trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the human-sized statues had gone downstairs to tend to Keith, at that moment, Salli had finally woken up with a large yawn as she stood up, her massive gargoyle hulk causing the bed to bend and creak and the frame to crack slightly. Although at this point, Salli did not realize that she was a gargoyle, as she let out a deeper yawn, she stretched out her large wings that had to have a 30ft wingspan and accidentally knocked over the bedside table and broke the alarm clock. Salli tried to reach over and bend her back but was having trouble reaching over her wing. Salli grunted and then looked at her hand to see the claws as she raised a (well, gargoyles don't have eyebrows, but you get the general idea). \"What the?\" asked Salli. Salli bit one of her chubby fingers just to confirm if her suspicions were true that they were claws. While she was at it, she felt around her mouth to realize her canine teeth had turned into fangs. \"Claws?\" she asked. \"Fangs?\" Salli then wiggled her toes and lifted up her tree-trunk thick leg to see that her toes had transformed into sharp talons. \"Talons?\" asked the gargoyle woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSalli stood up and stepped off the bed, murdering it with her colossal ass. Salli then felt all around her body to see exactly how ginormously fat she had become. \u201cWhat the?\u201d asked Salli. Salli then saw that her pajamas appeared to be coming apart at the seams and revealing her bra and panties that looked like they were painted on. She was now so huge and fat that her body didn\u2019t even fit in the entire mirror. She then wiggled her tail and looked down to realize that she did in fact have a tail. \"Oh my,\" she said. \"Is that a tail.\" Salli wiggled her tail and then she looked back to realize that she did have wings. \"Oh dear,\" said the Native American woman turned gargoyle giantess. \"Do I have wings. Big leather wings. It's as if I've turned into a gargoyle, like in that dream when I turned into a big fat gargoyle lady when I looked in the mirror. But it can't happen can it. Not for real.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSalli looked around and saw that the gargoyle statues had disappeared. \"Oh my gosh! Thieves! Wait a minute? Who would steal dozens of gargoyle statues. And how would they go about doing that to begin with. I mean, they're not exactly something that you can just hide away in your pocket. Maybe they just got up and flew away. That's ridiculous Salli. Hmm, Keith isn't here either. That's it.\" Salli giggled to herself. \"I'm dreaming again and it's a rather surreal dream. Hmm, I must be a deeper sleeper than I thought. Oh well, since I can fly.\" Salli opened up her wings and tore apart the roof before she started to fly off over the city in her ginormous gargoyle form, blissfully unaware of her new queenly status.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow we continue from...</span></div></div>",

She saw cars driving down the street before she flew up to a particularly high monument. She looked down and scratched her chin. \u201cMy,\u201d she said as she showed her fangs. \u201cThis is a surreal dream. I wonder what Keith is dreaming about right now. I\u2019ll bet it\u2019s our wedding night.\u201d The gargoyle giantess let out a laugh as her enormous belly hung off the edge of the monument. Salli then held out her stomach. \u201cThough who knows why I\u2019d have a dream where I weigh as much as two bull elephants.\u201d Salli then tapped her big gargoyle booty and made it shake. \u201cWell,\u201d she said. \u201cKeith did say that I needed more junk in the trunk. The doctor did tell me the other day that I was underweight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSalli then heard her stomach growling and then tapped her huge purple belly. \u201cI need something in my stomach. I hope that George\u2019s Pizza still exists in this dream world. Salli flew down from the sky and landed on a car on the ground, causing it to break beneath her heavy weight. Salli got up and in embarrassment the massive gargoyle pulled a steering wheel out from between her titanic butt cheeks that were murdering her pajama past. \u201cOops. I have definitely got to work on those landings. Salli then noticed a newspaper and read it. \u201cAha,\u201d she said. \u201cThey finally caught that cretin who was experimenting on the homeless. He\u2019ll never see the light of day again. What the? Loch Ness Monster sighted in American lake? How can anyone read this dribble.\u201d Salli\u2019s stomach then rumbled again. \u201cI heard you the first time.\u201d She said in annoyance as she slapped her bulging tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSalli noticed a pizzeria nearby and her mouth begun to water. She waddled towards the pizzeria, bending a street lamp in the process before she squeezed her way through the door. As Salli grunted and bent the doorway, the proprietor turned and looked in shock at the elephant-sized gargoyle squeezing into his eatery. \u201cHi, George,\u201d said Salli. \u201cYou\u2019re open late tonight.\u201d The proprietor\u2019s jaw dropped as he recognized the gargoyle\u2019s voice. \u201cSalli!? Is that you? You look...\u201d \u201cI know,\u201d said Salli as she assumed George was talking about the wardrobe she was wearing. \u201cI should\u2019ve thought about coming in wearing something other than my PJs.\u201d \u201cWhat?!\u201d yelled George. \u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019re worried about? You\u2019re a.. you\u2019re a gargoyle! And you\u2019re the size of a bus!\u201d \u201cI know,\u201d said Salli. \u201cIt\u2019s a strange dream.\u201d George blinked because Salli was still under the impression that she was dreaming. \u201cO...kay. Uh, where is Keith?\u201d Salli shrugged her shoulders as her breasts jiggled on her belly. \u201cHeck if I know. He\u2019s probably having his own dream. I\u2019ll have the house special, please.\u201d Salli walked forward and took 5 seats at the counter, all of which bent under her massive ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge decided to ignore the elephant...-sized gargoyle in the room and went to get Salli\u2019s order ready. \u201cOh darn,\u201d grumbled Salli. \u201cI forgot my wallet.\u201d \u201cUh,\u201d said George. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Gargoyles eat for free. So, why the sudden gargoyle dream?\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said Salli. \u201cI recently inherited my grandmother\u2019s gargoyle collection and I decorated the house with them. Of course, Keith can\u2019t stand them. I keep telling that husband of mine that gargoyles aren\u2019t evil spirits but he doesn\u2019t want to listen. But, oh well.\u201d George begun to sweat as he prepared a calzone as big as a surfboard and Salli instantly devoured it. While the gargoyle giantess was eating, George walked up to the phone. \u201cHello,\u201d he said. \u201cIs this the hospital. One of my regular customers came in and she\u2019s not herself. By that I mean she\u2019s a giant obese gargoyle. No! I\u2019m not admitting myself! I\u2019m trying to admit her! There must be... hello? They hung up.\u201d Salli at the time had finished her meal and licked her chubby claws. \u201cThanks for the meal, George. I\u2019ll pay you on Tuesday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSalli left the pizzeria and the proprietor saw her pants coming apart at the seams from her growing weight. \u201cShe thinks it\u2019s a dream,\u201d muttered George. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m the one who\u2019s dreaming.\u201d As Salli walked down the street she saw that she had grown again. She was now 30ft tall and with a 65ft wide belly and 60ft wide ass. Her wings had expanded to accommodate her weight and still allow her to fly. \u201cGee,\u201d she said as she accidentally whacked her tail against a building and damaged it. \"This dream is getting really weird. I think I'm ready to wake up now.\" Salli held up her thumb and bit onto it as she grimaced in pain. \"Ouch!\" Salli sucked on her thumb believing the pain awoke her from her dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she saw that she was still a gargoyle, she was still the size of a building and she was still ginormously fat. Salli gasped and felt her stomach as she gave a nervous look. \"Huh?\" she asked. \"What's going on.\" Salli bit her other thumb and yelled in pain but she saw she was still an obese gargoyle giantess. Her purple skin turned pale as she realized something. \"Good grief! I really am a gargoyle! Those gargoyle statues! They must've been magic. Oh dear. I gotta tell Keith about this.\" The ginormous gargoyle walked in the direction of her house, being careful not to crush any more cars. However, in the process, she accidentally crushed a car carrier under her huge belly and blushed. \"It's going to be a <i>really</i> long night.\" Said the queen-sized gargoyle queen.</span></div></div>",

But I have no choice since I want to increase traffic in this interactive)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody likes sick days, especially not one young woman named Carol Hale. She had caught a terrible cold and was forced to stay home from her job at the observatory and she was miserable about it. At that moment, she was sneezing her nose off while her husband, Marvin was busy in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI ate being sick,\u201d said Carol weakly. \u201cI haven\u2019t had a flu in ten years. This is hell.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just a common flu, Carol,\u201d said Marvin. \u201cNothing to worry about.\u201d As Carol was sick, Marvin was boiling some hot water. \u201cBut don\u2019t worry, I found a store that sells health food on my way here. The owners said they just bought it. Here it is.\u201d Marvin held up a strange box that had an image of a red Chinese dragon on it. \u201cRed Dragon Medicinal Tea. Must be one of those Chinese medicines.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh,\u201d said Carol. \u201cNever was much for tea, but I\u2019ll try anything to get rid of this flu. Ugh.\u201d Carol held her stomach in pain because her terrible flu was only going to get worse unless she took something. Marvin walked in with the tea and handed the cup to Carol who seemed to notice red clouds forming in the tea. \u201cWhere did you get this?\u201d she asked. \u201cThis tea looks like it\u2019s on fire.\u201d Carol saw flames briefly appear in the tea but by the time Marvin took a look, he saw nothing. \u201cYou must be sicker than you thought. I think you better stay here. I\u2019ll pick up the twins from school and you stay here and take the tea.\u201d Marvin kissed his wife and then left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol sniffed the tea and was worried. \u201cSmells like fire,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what would I know, I\u2019m sick.\u201d With that, Carol drank the tea and then she gagged and coughed. \u201cUgh,\u201d she said. \u201cFeels like my mouth is on fire. But I think it cleared my sinuses. Maybe there is something to this Chinese medicine.\u201d But Carol then begun to cough, completely unaware that her teeth were turning into fangs and red scales were appearing on her thighs.</span></div></div>",

The suddenness of the sensation put her at ease, but as she let it sink into her skin it actually felt very soothing and comforting. As the waves faded to nothign she could still feel a tinge of heat in her skin, as though it was the afterglow to a light bulb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah...\" She whispered in awe, slowly standing back up with no sign of resistance from her body. The flu she'd been suffering from for over a week felt as if it'd been completely washed away, replaced with a crisp, refreshed feeling of energy. After being so sick for so long it was off-putting how fast she'd healed, but at the same time she wasn't complaining after all the crap the flu had put her through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hell was<i> in </i>that stuff?\" She thought aloud. \"...well, whatever it was, thank GOD it-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she was interrupted as her stomach let out a loud, wavering rumble, making her groan in discomfort. As she placed her hand to her abdomen she looked down to see that her belly was expanding right before her eyes, which as it pushed out of her shirt she could see what looked like red and black scales growing along her white skin. She also realized a tightness in her pants as her legs began to grow as well, and two black talons tore through the tips of each of her shoes as her feet stretched into long, puffy claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT...THE...FUCK...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her stomach let out an even bigger rumble that sped up her change, her stomach puffing out even further and the seams of her pants tearing apart to show the scales covering her legs. With as much speed as her growing body could move with she hauled her bulk through. Along with her expansion and transformation she started growing taller as well, each stomp progressively getting louder and louder as she waddled towards the foyer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the scales reached her chest and started covering her neck, at which point two long, thick appendages sprouted from her back and through her shirt to form long, leathery wings. As the scales reached her chin her lips and nose stretched into a long, reptilian snout. Her black hair grew even longer and fuller, two petite black horns sprouting from the top of her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she reached the mirror in the foyer her hands were the only thing visibly human about her, which shortly turned into stubby black claws. She stared at herself with shiny orange eyes, the pupils turned to predatory slits. All that she was clad in was a few tattered remains of her clothes as she stood well nine feet tall, looking to weigh several dozen tons. Her stomach had bloated into a titanic, soft globe that covered a decent amount of the hardwood floor in front of her and pressed into her blobby legs, smoothly shaped by red scales and a long column of black armor that traveled along her enormous breasts to the bottom of her chin. Over the sides of her gut she could see the edges of her massive thighs, her rump large enough that it could fill (and obliterate) an entire sofa. She even sported a tail that gently tapered off of her enormous girth, with a line of black spikes running from the tip along her spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt a hot fire bubble within the depths of her monstrous gut, slowly stroking her midsection with her hand as she slowly absorbed that the monstrous figure in the mirror was, in fact, her.</span></div></div>",

She lifted up her black scaly underbelly and turned around to get a good look of her thick blubbery red-scaled backside and even flapped her new wings. Carol turned again and opened her mouth to see her newly sharpened teeth and a long green forked tongue. She even breathes out a slight flame before covering her mouth. What was surprising was that the 9ft tall dragon lady was not so much scared or freaked out at her new form but she seemed to be looking in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That must've been some tea,\" said the dragon woman. \"I can't believe it. It turned me into a dragon. Surprisingly a European dragon. But then again I do have British ancestry.\" Carol let out a laugh as she smacked her monstrous booty and let out a playful hiss as she showed her claws. \"Though honestly, I have no idea how the blasted tea could make me so ginormously fat. But what does that matter when you're a dragon? This might be fun. Boy is Marvin going to be surprised when he gets home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon woman then snapped her fingers. \"I've got it. I'll surprise him with dinner tonight. He thinks I'm too sick to cook. We've got those steaks in the fridge and I won't even need an oven to cook them. However, that's when Carol heard a ripping noise because what was left of her clothes had torn apart. \"Oh my gosh,\" said Carol. \"Can't let Alex and Jen see me like this. If I didn't know better, I'd say that I just got bigger.\" Carol then spotted the curtains and got an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarvin at the time had absolutely no idea about his wife being mutated into an enormous dragon and was driving their young son and daughter home from school. \"I hope Mom's doing a lot better,\" said Alex. \"That flu has her miserable.\" \"I wish she would get better soon,\" said Jen. \"Daddy, how long does the flu last.\" Marvin let out a sigh. \"I don't know, Jen. But I got some tea that should help get her over that flu faster.\" Marvin parked the car outside the garage and opened the door as he and his kids walked in to hear Carol humming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like she's doing better already,\" said Alex. \"She only hums that song when she's in a good... mood?\" Carol walked out in dragon form and it was shown that she was even larger than before and appeared to be 12ft tall. \"Hi, Alex,\" said Carol. \"Hi, Jen. How was school?\" Alex and Jen didn't answer. They were too busy dropping their jaws as they processed the fact that there mother was now a huge red dragon. Carol turned to face Marvin who was just as surprised at the monster that was his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol lowered her blobbish neck and kissed Marvin on the cheek. \"Marvin, I must thank you,\" she said. \"That Red Dragon Tea did wonders.\" Marvin was dumbfounded. He had no idea that the medicinal tea would turn his wife into a dragon. The only question is, what does he decide to do about this situation?</span></div></div>",

He wanted to say something but what could he say? He simply gave a nervous smile. Although he <i>was</i> going to give the company that made the Red Dragon Medicinal Tea a rather angry letter about this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, come on, Marvin,\" said the dragon giantess. \"Dinner will be ready shortly.\" \"Uh, I'm coming, Dear.\" Said Marvin. Many thoughts were going through Marvin's head. \"I can expect an earful from the in-laws about this, but what can I do? Calm down, Marvin. She's still your wife. So what if she happens to be a 10 ton dragon. For better or worse.\" Marvin smiled nervously and Alex and Jen just stared at their giant dragon mother. \"I am definitely not going to cross her anytime soon.\" Thought a very afraid Alex to himself. \"I wonder if I'll turn into a dragon when I'm Mom's age.\" Thought Jen to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol reached into the fridge and Marvin couldn't help but stare at his dragon wife's enormous butt as she was rooting around and looking for the steaks. \u201cIf she turns over in her sleep,\u201d thought Marvin. \u201cI\u2019m a dead man. Than again, I did marry her for that booty.\u201d \u201cAha.\u201d Said Carol. Carol then took out the steaks and smirked before she opened her mouth wide. Marvin gave a gasp. \u201cCarol,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you think it\u2019s such a good idea to...\u201d Carol let out a scoff. \u201cMarvin,\u201d she said to her husband. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of being a dragon if you can\u2019t breathe fire.\u201d Carol held her mouth out wide and spewed a stream of flames to cook the steaks, nearly burning them to a crisp in the process. Carol then coughed out smoke as she put the steaks down and then inhaled. \u201cThat is going to take some serious getting used to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n\u2028Meanwhile, unbeknownst to Carol, Marvin and their children, there was a movie producer in the area and from the looks of it, he was on the phone. \u201cNo, no, no,\u201d he said. \u201cThe CGI is all wrong, it makes the dragon look out of place. For this latest project I need the dragon to look as realistic as possible. I don\u2019t know. I mean, the dragon has to look like a dragon. Come on, male dragons are a dime a dozen. My latest project calls for a female dragon. I don\u2019t know, I can\u2019t build a machine. They\u2019re too unreliable. I know we have a deadline. I\u2019ll think of something.\u201d The movie producer let out a groan as he hung up. \u201cQuigley,\u201d he said to himself. \u201cThis is your last chance. You don\u2019t want to go back to working for the company that makes that insult to comic book heroes cartoon. I\u2019ve got to do something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when the producer came across an old woman talking to the police. \u201cI\u2019m not lying. I saw my neighbor, Carol Hale, from my window and she turned into a dragon!\u201d \u201cLady,\u201d said one of the police. \u201cThe doctor assigned you meds for a reason.\u201d \u201cI did not hallucinate! She got big and red and fat and....\u201d \u201cYou seriously think that it\u2019s entirely possible for a human woman to spontaneously transform into a giant obese firebreathing reptile? We better take you to a doctor.\u201d However, Quigley overheard what that woman was saying and he was now suddenly very interested to see if this dragon rumor was indeed true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the Hales were at home having dinner. Of course, being a dragon, Carol wasn\u2019t even bothering with her silverware and was messily devouring her steaks and chewing on them with her huge fangs. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d said Carol. \u201cKids. Don\u2019t be like me. Eat like human beings.\u201d Alex just inched his chair away from his mother out of pure fear.\u201d \u201cMom,\u201d said Jen. \u201cMy corn on the cob is a little cold.\u201d Carol just spewed fire out to fully cook Jen\u2019s corn. \u201cThanks, Mom.\u201d Marvin just kept watching the dragon giantess that was his wife eating her dinner. At this point, Carol had gotten so big that she crushed the four chairs she was sitting in underneath her huge dragon booty. \u201cCarol,\u201d said Marvin to his transmogrified wife. \u201cIs there any way to turn you back to normal.\u201d Carol shrugged her shoulders. \u201cI don\u2019t know but quite frankly, even if there was, I wouldn\u2019t take it. I like being a dragon way too much.\u201d Alex and Jen gasped. \u201cYou mean you\u2019re just going to be a dragon for the rest of your life?\u201d asked Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol gave a snort and then nodded her head before she pulled a T-bone out of her mouth and patted her large stomach as she belched out some smoke. One of her love handles even pushed up against Marvin. \"Carol,\" said Marvin. \"Are you sure that you thought that plan all the way through? I mean, you're more than three times my size and more than 50 times my weight.\" Carol gave a smirk. \"I thought you liked big girls, Marvin.\" Jen and Alex laughed as their father blushed and then there was a knock on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol got up to answer but Marvin gasped. \"Carol,\" said Marvin. \"I don't think you should be doing this. After all, what will people think to see a big and huge dragon at the door.\" Carol bent over to her husband's level. \"Come on, Marvin. I mean, who is the boss of this relationship?\" \"I'm just saying, maybe we don't want to alarm people.\" Marvin and Carol just stare at each other before...</span></div></div>",

By no extent of the mind, he was a gullible person; at most, he'd expected some sort of enlightening location scope, but by the monster-sized sounds coming his way, he could tell that the water was quickly rising over his head. \"...the hell is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and then the door opened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuigley's years of business training couldn't prepare him at the red, mountain-sized creature inside who eased the door open, filling the entire length of the opening with a portion of her girth. He could hear the fire warming her system bubbling ferociously within her mammoth stomach, which poured out of the doorway in a long, generous arch despite that her head still stood inside beneath the foyer's chandelier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn utter awe, he shuffled back down the steps and halfway down the path across the lawn so he could meet her gaze, who eyed him curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" She said starkly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-u-u-u-u-u-u-uh...\" Quigley couldn't form a single sentence in his head. There were only words, bouncing around in a hurricane of single thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuge. Monstrous. Immense. Massive. Crimson. Ferocious. Terrifying. Female. Passionate. Gorgeous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Perfect.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Miss! Hello.\" Quigley bowed, shakily putting his bussinessman face on display. \"My name is Quigley Petersen, and I'd happened to hear local word of a <i>dragoness</i> crossing some roads around these parts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm.\" Carol replied simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, if it weren't to blunt of me, I couldn't help but notice <i>you</i> were a dragoness...\" He weakly gestured to her. \"...and I'd been involved with the production for Night of the Red Sky II, the-soon-to-be-blockbuster that shall-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute, you want me to be in your movie?\"  Carol asked with immediate interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, well...\" She'd pretty much made it through the door, leaving him nothing to lure her with. \"What do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carol, who's at the door?\" Marvin asked his wife, entering the foyer to find her belly plugging the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna be in a movie, sweetie!\" She exclaimed excitedly, to Quigley's delight, as well. \"Tell the kids they're going to any college they want!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A movie? What the hell are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in!\" Carol eagerly told Quigley, who leafed through his briefcase for the right papers. \"There's a movie guy outside asking if I wanna play the dragon in his movie, and I'm going for it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, woah! <i>Wait a minute!</i>\" With his wife turning into a dragon and being cast for a movie in just one day, it was safe to say Marvin was overwhelmed. \"Carol, can't we talk about this?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Marvin, what's not to get out of this?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you think turning into a giant reptile and being seen by millions of people could have a <i>little bit</i> of an effect on our lives?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marvin, we'd already be seen by the entire neighborhood, so it's safe to say the ship has already sailed. Besides, I'm a dragon!

Daintily taking a pen from an end table by its fingers, Carol jotted her name into the contract.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get the kids to get their bags ready, Marvin, we're going on vacation.\" She smirked, turning to look back down at Quigley. \"Alright, lead the way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lead the way!\"</span></div></div>",

A wedding was about to take place this very night and the bride was getting ready. The bride was a tannish skinned young woman with bright red hair and a crescent moon tattoo over her left eye. As the bride was getting her dress ready, there was another woman with her, a middle-aged woman with graying black hair with green highlights and the exact same tattoo on her face as the bride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Andrea,\" said the older woman. \"You must reschedule the wedding. You'll live to regret this night.\" \"Aunt Nicole,\" said the bride. \"This is my night. Don't try to ruin it. You never liked Jonathan.\" Nicole just let out a scoff. \"That Belmont boy is trouble. He's only after the family fortune. But that is beside the point, there is a reason no woman in our family has ever married during a full moon.\" \"Why is that?\" asked Andrea as she put down her lipstick. Nicole then froze in place and then twitched her fingers slightly. \u201cUh,\u201d she said. \u201cTrust me, there is a VERY good reason. You definitely don\u2019t want to go through with this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea turned to face her aunt. \u201cWhatever it is,\u201d she said. \u201cIt can\u2019t be any stranger than the man I\u2019m marrying. He claims to be a vampire hunter. Said that he destroyed the last descendent of Count Dracula.\u201d \u201cKing Dracula,\u201d says Nicole correcting Andrea. \u201cAnd experience with vampires does not prepare him for what he\u2019s about to unleash onto the world by going through with this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when the organ begun to play. \u201cOh geez,\u201d said Andrea. \u201cIt\u2019s starting. Come on, Aunt Nicole. You may not agree with the wedding, but you did agree that you would give the bride away. As Andrea and Nicole were about to enter the church, Nicole looked down at her palm. There was a strange birthmark on it that looked like a pair of wolf\u2019s fangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Jonathan is a vampire hunter, or so he claims. He wasn\u2019t the first vampire hunter to fall into a trap set by the Luna Clan. No vampire can prepare him for the beast he will unleash. After the stroke of midnight on the night they tie the know, the monster will come out.\"</span></div></div>",

He's a young man with short brown hair that looks a little messy. \"He could have done something with his hair at least.\" Nicole mutters. \"That how his hair is.\" Andrea says under her breath. Jonathon looks at his future bride as she approaches and smiles broadly. To him there's nothing more beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they reach the altar Nicole stands by her niece as the priest says his part. She looks out at the guests and glances over Jonathon's family. There doesn't seem to be many of them. She gets a strange vibe from them as well. Sure they're dressed formally and are enjoying the wedding, but she feels like they're ready to fight for some reason. Indeed. the older of the men on his side look grizzled and experienced. There's even one old man with a long thick beard and an eye patch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonathon's family isn't the only strange thing about the ceremony. Andrea's family is pretty interesting too. In addition to outnumbering the Belmonts by quite a bit, they appear to be comprised of only females. Nicole knows why this is, but Andrea doesn't know yet. She would be told once she was married, but the stubborn girl had to have the ceremony on a full moon! That just complicates things. Well, she'll just have to let things run their course. </span></div></div>",

The preacher was a lanky and emancipated man who was obscured by his clothing and appeared to have withered skin and bandages covering his throat. \u201cEerie... I mean dearly, dearly beloved. We are gathered here to unite Jonathan Belmont and Andrea Luna in unholy... uh, I mean, holy, holy matrimony.\u201d Jonathan and Andrea both looked in concern because they didn\u2019t trust the preacher for some reason. They weren\u2019t the only ones in the church who had trust issues because Nicole was glaring at the older man with the thick white beard and the eyepatch. From the looks of it, he was the patriarch of the Belmonts and from the looks of it, he also had a gun in his belt. Several of the younger Luna girls seemed to growl but Nicole gestured for them to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you, Jonathan, take Andrea to be your un... I uh, mean, awfully... I mean LAWFULLY! Lawfully wedded wife.\u201d \u201cI do.\u201d Said Jonathan. Jonathan was slightly nervous as the preacher turned to face Andrea. Before the preacher could say another creepy word, Andrea covered his mouth. \u201cI do!\u201d The preacher gave a hiss. \u201cIf anyone has a reason why this wedding should not be, speak now or forever rest in peace. Uh, I mean, forever hold your peace.\u201d Nicole glared at the Belmonts who turned their heads as not to face their future in-laws and the preacher prepared to fully unite Andrea and Jonathan. \"By the power invested in me, I pronounce you human... er... man and wife. You may now kiss the bride.\" Jonathan and Andrea kissed as the organ played loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, the newlyweds were ready to go on their honeymoon but some of the relatives weren't too sure of themselves as they were at the airport. \"You are making a grave mistake, Jonathan,\" said the Belmont patriarch. \"That woman is not what she seems.\" \"Dad,\" said Jonathan. \"I knew when I laid eyes on Andrea, she was the one. And now we're married. Besides, she's not a vampire in case that's what you're worried about.\" \"Vampires you can handle. This woman is something that's more dangerous than a vampire. You best be on your toes.\" Andrea gave a giggle. \"Don't you worry, Mr. Belmont. Everything is going to be alright. Besides, it's just a flight to London. Nothing bad will happen.\" Nicole's eyes briefly turned animal-like as she heard her niece's words. \"That's what you think, Andrea. You'll see all too well.\" The Lunas looked right up at the sky and saw that the moon was glowing bright. She looked at her palm to see her birthmark was throbbing. Underneath Andrea's gloves, it was shown that the bride had the exact same birthmark and it was throbbing as well. Andrea looked at her hand in confusion but then shrugged her shoulders right before she and Jonathan were about to leave on the plane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bride tossed her bouquet and while one of the Belmont women tried to grab it, one of Nicole's cousins jumped into the air and caught the bouquet in her mouth before landing on the ground and letting out a growl. Some of the Belmonts took out guns but Jonathan's father gestured to them to put the guns away just as Jonathan and Andrea's plane took off. For some reason, Andrea couldn't stop staring out the window at the bright full moon up in the sky as it shined through the clouds. \"Andrea?\" asked Jonathan. \"Sweetie?\" Andrea turned to her husband and let out a laugh. \"I'm sorry Jonathan. I just can't believe it. Here I am, Mrs. Andrea Luna. I don't know why, but Nicole insisted that you took my family name. I hope you don't mind.\" Jonathan smiled, shrugged his shoulders and then laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is it,\u201d said Jonathan. \u201cI promise you this, Andrea. Our life together will be glorious. I\u2019m even giving up vampire hunting. Besides, the last great threat to humanity was wiped out last week.\u201d Andrea let out a laugh. \u201cNo more talk about vampires or other creatures of the night. You\u2019ll sound like my aunt if you keep that up.\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d said Jonathan. \u201cI noticed that your Aunt Nicole doesn\u2019t seem to like me that much.\u201d Andrea let out a sigh. \u201cShe thought that you were after the...\u201d Jonathan gave a glare as if he was insulting. \u201cWhat? She thinks I\u2019m a gold digger. She is so narrow-minded. You should listen to my dad, he said that there was something evil about you. He\u2019s trusted no one since somebody he considered a friend turned out to be a vampire and tore out his eye. Next you\u2019re gonna say that she thinks that vampires aren\u2019t real.\u201d Andrea let out a nervous laugh. \u201cShe\u2019s never denied it. But for some reason, she didn\u2019t want us to get married on the night of a full moon. I thought it would be more romantic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut at that moment, there was a clash of lightning. A storm was brewing in the sky and it was a rather large and loud one. Rain came down and thunder roared. Meanwhile, far away, Nicole was confronted by Jonathan\u2019s father. \u201cYou may have fooled Jonathan, but I know you creatures are devils in human clothing.\u201d Nicole let out a scoff. \u201cShows what you know. Historians remember our kind as enemies of the devil. Besides, your family may have wiped out several vampires but you have no idea how to deal with other creatures of the night. But on the off chance that your son tries to put a silver bullet through Andrea\u2019s heart, there will be war.\u201d Nicole even gave a slight growl as Mr. Belmont walked away. \u201cThis isn\u2019t over, Luna. You\u2019re the matriarch of those monsters, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can see us as livestock.\u201d Nicole gave a glare and gestured she was watching the Belmonts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Andrea and Jonathan had landed in London where they heard Big Ben ringing loudly. \"The sound of Big Ben,\" said Andrea. \"How majestic and romantic. C'est l'amore.\" Jonathan smiled and Andrea climbed into his arms so they could walk down out of the airplane. However, Jonathan grunted slightly. \"That's odd,\" he thought to himself. \"Andrea seems heavier than she was a few hours ago.\" But Jonathan shrugged his shoulders and felt that it was nothing to worry about. Andrea saw several clouds forming in the sky. \"Gee,\" she said. \"An evil night.\" Andrea and Jonathan thought it would be best to go to a nearby bus stop and wait for an omnibus.\" However, Andrea felt her stomach and groaned. \"Something wrong, Honey?\" asked Jonathan. Andrea just stuck out her tongue to pant. \"I dunno,\" she said. \"Maybe I'm having trouble getting used to this new and foggy London air.\" Jonathan then decided to feel Andrea's head. \"Your forehead appears to be fine. But your nose seems really cold for some reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Andrea grunted and crouched down. She then begun to growl in a feral tone as Jonathan looked in confusion. \"Andrea?\" As Andrea turned around, Jonathan looked in fear because his new wife\u2019s eyes appeared to be glowing bright. \u201cAndrea?\u201d asked Jonathan. \u201cHoney, what\u2019s going on.\u201d Andrea grunted as she held onto her chest. \u201cIf I knew,\u201d she said with a grunt. \u201cI\u2019d tell you. Suddenly, Andrea felt her stomach to see that it was growing and gasped. She turned and then Jonathan saw her rear was expanding. \u201cI know all brides let themselves go,\u201d said Jonathan. \u201cBut not this soon.\u201d Andrea then gave a howl and her fingernails begun to get longer as her breasts were expanding. Jonathan was in utter horror. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t know better,\u201d he thought. \u201cI\u2019d say....\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n\u2028Meanwhile, Nicole was laughing to herself as she saw the birthmark on her palm was glowing. Her own eyes glowed bright as she smirked and showed her teeth were fangs. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason that it\u2019s bad luck for one of the Lunas to have her wedding night during a full moon. Because now she\u2019s doomed herself to never be able to transform back. The rest of us can transform at will. I hope for Jonathan\u2019s sake that Andrea can control herself, otherwise, I hope he tastes good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with the newlyweds, Andrea was still getting bigger, but something else was coming over her because her long brown hair was getting even longer as bright silver fur was growing over her body. Her teeth turned into fangs sharp enough to munch on diamonds as her fingernails and toenails turned into razor sharp claws that looked like kitchen knives. Her fangs were so large her bright red gums were exposed as her eyes became more animalistic and her face stretched into a snout. She even sprouted a tail as Jonathan only watched in terror right before she let out a howl and held her head up into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the transformation was complete, Andrea was a 30ft tall werewolf with a 50ft belly and 60ft ass and a pair of H-cup breasts as well as three chins and chipmunk-like cheeks. Surprisingly, despite Andrea\u2019s massive increase in weight and height, her wedding dress, veil and tiara were completely intact, if a little tight on her body. Her shoes and gloves however were shredded by her claws. Andrea was drooling heavily as she grit her teeth and Jonathan could not believe what he was looking at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my gosh! She\u2019s a werewolf! My wife is a werewolf! I knew vampires were real, but werewolves too?\u201d Andrea\u2019s stomach rumbled heavily and then Jonathan got really worried. \u201cAnd me without my stake and hammer. What are you saying, Jonathan!? This is Andrea! Sure she\u2019s a giant, obese, flesh-gobbling canine, but she\u2019s still the woman you fell in love with. I just hope she\u2019s in control. I\u2019m not trained to deal with a werewolf, let alone one so big.\u201d Andrea got on all fours as her belly pushed into the ground and her boobs shook. She was wagging her tail as she panted and held out her tongue.\u2028\u2028The question was, was Andrea fully in control of her new transformation.</span></div></div>",

Somebody had broken into an occult jewelry store and was driving away with the contents. However, there were two women on motorcycles chasing after him. The first of the woman was a buxom young woman with long brown hair that had a slight white highlight in it and was dressed as a cowgirl. This was Daisy Downe, the sheriff of the town of Garlen. She was accompanied by a younger looking Asian cowgirl who appeared to be her deputy. \u201cSo what\u2019s the situation, Jen?\u201d asked Daisy. Deputy Lee nodded her head. \u201cRepeat offender. Shackleford.\u201d \u201cGood grief,\u201d muttered the sheriff. \u201cHow many times do we have to bring him in? Who did he rob this time?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the weirdest part, Daisy,\u201d said Jen. \u201cThere was nobody home. It was a new curio store that had all sorts of weird jewelry. It only opened yesterday.\u201d Daisy was curious but then shrugged her shoulders and then drove off in an attempt to catch Shackleford.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe robber was looking at the jewelry he stole, among witch was a strange skull that looked like it belonged to some sort of bovine. He then noticed Daisy driving her motorcycle towards him. \u201cDamn!\u201d he yelled. \u201cSheriff Downe!\u201d Shackleford held out his gun and would\u2019ve shot the sheriff, but she shot the barrel of his gun right off with her own gun. \u201cI don\u2019t think so, creep. Jen, you take one side, I\u2019ll take the other.\u201d Daisy drove to the right side of the car in order to distract Shackleford as he reached for a knife but before he could do anything, Jen drove to the left side of the car in order to handcuff the robber to his own steering wheel as he gasped. Before the car could go any further, Sheriff Down drove her motorcycle in front of it and kicked the car in the grill in order to stop it, causing the airbag to go off and force the crook to turn the car off. In the process, the cow skull was sent flying out of Shackleford\u2019s car and landed in the seat of Daisy\u2019s motorcycle as she stepped off of it and went to arrest him. \u201cWe have got to stop meeting like this. Good work, Jen. I\u2019ll take this polecat back to the station. Y\u2019all return these jewels.\u201d But as Daisy sat down on her motorcycle, she yelled in pain. \u201cDaisy!\u201d yelled Jen. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d Daisy stood up and rubbed her backside in pain to see she sat on the bejeweled cow\u2019s skull. \u201cDang it,\u201d she said. \u201cLooks like we missed one.\u201d Daisy picked up the skull, not realizing that its eyes were glowing and tossed it to Jen. \u201cThis is a funny looking skull, Sheriff,\u201d said Jen. \u201cNot like any cow I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d Daisy looked at the skull and seemed to agree with her deputy. \u201cThat is mighty strange. But then again, it came from a strange store.\u201d Jen nodded her head and went to return the stolen loot as Daisy was taking Shackleford to jail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know something, Sheriff,\u201d said the robber Shackleford. \u201cThere is one thing you are and that\u2019s a cow! Nothing but a big, mean, fat cow!\u201d Daisy was unintimidated and returned to her office before locking up Shackleford in jail. \u201cThat\u2019s what you say, you old coyote,\u201d said the cowgirl. \u201cBut I\u2019m the cow that brought you in. Maybe now you\u2019ll stay put.\u201d Back at the curio store, Jen had returned the stolen jewels and then put the cow skull in place. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a skull like this. It looks like it came from a cattle breed I\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d But then Jen gasped because the skull mysteriously vanished and then Jen rubbed her eyes. \u201cI must not be getting enough sleep.\u201d She said. </span></div></div>",

I\u2019ve seen every type of cow and what they look like inside and outside but that didn\u2019t look like any skull I\u2019ve seen before.\u201d Violet gave a nervous look but then her mother picked her up to walk her to her patio table. \u201cDon\u2019t be so worried, Violet. Your Mama is hard as steel and there ain\u2019t no such thing as a poisonous cow. Come on, let\u2019s get the grub going. I\u2019m hungry enough to eat a horse. And I ain\u2019t kidding. My stomach feels like it hasn\u2019t eaten in days.\u201d Both Violet and Rick laughed at what they thought was a joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the Downes were eating their ham steaks, but surprisingly for them, Daisy was devouring the lion\u2019s share of the meat and had already eaten three ears of corn. \u201cYou weren\u2019t kidding,\u201d said Rick. \u201cYou have a tapeworm or something?\u201d But Daisy just continued to eat. \u201cI\u2019m hungry, Rick,\u201d she said. \u201cIt feels like my stomach split into four.\u201d Then, Violet noticed something. \u201cMama,\u201d she said. \u201cDid you always have a tail?\u201d Daisy gave a look of confusion. \u201cTail?\u201d she asked. Daisy then looked to see she had grown a long tail like that of some kind of bovine. \u201cWhat the?\u201d asked Daisy. Daisy then twitched. \u201cMama!\u201d yelled Violet. Daisy saw that her breasts appeared to have doubled in size and then she heard her jeans unzipping and looked down to see what looked like an udder like that of a cow. \u201cHuh?\u201d asked Daisy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy then twitched again as she felt her thighs get bigger as her jeans were coming apart at the seams. \u201cDaisy!\u201d yelled Rick in horror. Daisy then felt herself getting bigger and then she felt what looked like long horns growing out of the sides of her head as her ears changed shape. Daisy let out a yell that then turned into a loud moo as her cowgirl boots tore apart and revealed that her feet had turned into hooves. She was also getting bigger and fatter with her stomach and chin bulging out and her ass following afterwards, destroying what was left of her pants. Her shirt was reduced to a bra on her growing breasts as Daisy\u2019s face twisted into a snout of some snort. Then copper brown fur grew all over her body with the occasional spots of sienna brown, including one spot over her eye. Both Daisy\u2019s husband and daughter looked up at the sheriff in surprise. She had become a 35ft tall, gigantically obese minotaur. A gigantic minotaur in her undergarments since her clothes were destroyed by her growth spurt. All except for her cowgirl hat that for some reason grew with her. Daisy looked around surprised at how she had become a giant bovid monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Daisy was not at all horrified at what she had become and even let out a laugh as she looked all around her new bovine body. She swung her tail and she even held up her udder as her husband and daughter looked in Daisy.\u201dDaisy,\u201d said Rick. \u201cYou\u2019re taking this surprisingly well.\u201d Daisy gave a smirk and lowered her head to Rick level. \u201cI\u2019ll admit it, Ricky,\u201d she said. \u201cBeing turned into a minotaur was not something I was planning to do today, but look at how ginormous I am.\u201d Daisy let out a laugh as she bumped her hip into the house. \u201cThink about it. If the crooks knew that the town\u2019s sheriff was a gigantic minotaur, they\u2019d think twice about trying anything.\u201d Rick was baffled at his wife\u2019s words, but she did have a valid point. No criminal could stand up to a minotaur lady the size of a house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy then looked around and noticed how fat she had gotten from the transformation before she shrugged her shoulders. \u201cWho ever heard of a skinny cow anyway?\u201d she asked before letting out a hearty laugh.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Daisy was immediately getting used to her transformation into a giant minotaur, she heard a ringing noise. It sounded like a bell from a burglar alarm. The noise made the bovine titaness smirk. \"Perfect timing,\" she said. \"Now to give crime a rude awakening.\" \"I don't know if that's such a good idea, Daisy.\" Said Rick. Daisy just smiled down at her husband. \"Don't worry, Rick,\" she said. \"What could one bank robber do against a mega minotaur. I'll be right back.\" Daisy bent down to kiss Rick and Violet, coating them in cow saliva before walking off. \"Yuck.\" Muttered Violet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy was walking off to the scene of the crime with a grin on her face. \"That sounded like it was going to Cherish's jewelry store,\" said the giantess to herself. \"Jen warned me that that nasty crook, Raymond Yates escaped from the state pen a few days ago. If he thinks he can cause trouble in my town, he is in for a big surprise.\" Daisy let out a laugh at her own joke pointing out her size. It would appear that the curse that transformed her was not over because she appeared to be getting bigger with every step. Although for some reason, her cowgirl hat seemed to be growing with her (it's magic, we don't have to explain. And if anyone calls it a cheat, that's too damn bad).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, there was screaming at the jewelry store and the sound of bullets. \"Next time I won't miss, you noisy bitch!\" yelled an aggressive sounding voice. That voice belonged to Raymond Yates, a criminal infamous throughout Texas. He had actually been sentenced to death for his violent crimes before he escaped and he was trying to get some pocket money before heading to Mexico. \"Depraved sadist,\" muttered Yates. \"I didn't mutilate any of those teachers until after they were dead. I wonder if they know I'm here. Bah! The sheriff in this town is a skirt. She'll be easy to get rid of.\" That's what Yates thought, but as he tried to start the getaway car, he saw that it wasn't going anywhere and then the criminal heard a creaking noise. \"What the hell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYates got out of the car and looked in surprise to see one of Daisy's hooves pressing down on the roof. He then looked in even bigger shock to see an 80ft tall and ginormously obese minotaur woman staring down at him with a smirk. \"Y'all must be Yates,\" said Daisy rather smugly. \"I happen to be the law around here. Sheriff Daisy Downe. I recently just got a rather extreme makeover and I'm in a very good mood today, so if y'all surrender, I won't have to get nasty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Yates was a violent man, he was a vicious man, he was a heartless man, but he wasn't a smart man. If he was he wouldn't have become a criminal in the first place. Yates took out his gun and shot at Daisy, but because Daisy was titanically obese and the size of a building, the bullet merely bounced off of her shin, to the shock of Yates. Daisy gave a smirk. \"Looks like nasty it is.\" Daisy then turned around and Yates looked in horror as the minotaur woman held her enormous rear over him and wiggled it. \"Oh no! Oh no! Oh f.....!\" Before Yates could finish his sentence, Daisy slammed her butt down on top of Yates, not enough to crush him but enough to immobilize him as he yelled swear words underneath the minotaur giantess's meteor-sized rear. Just to twist the knife, Daisy then got up and squeezed the robber between her cheeks as she gave a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she peeled the villain off her rear as he groaned. \"Tell all the crooks back at the state pen that they better stay out of Garlen,\" said Daisy. \"Or else they'll have this cowgirl to contend with.\" Several spectators looked in dumbfounded shock as their mutated sheriff walked away to take Yates to prison.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Daisy was walking away with the captured villain, there was a sound of a motorcycle approaching. Deputy Lee was coming forward, rather late to the scene of the crime. However, as Jen approached, she gave a look of shock and turned her head to see the 80ft tall minotaur that was her boss. The titaness had huge H-cup breasts, a 100ft wide stomach, 120ft rear and 60ft wide udder. As Jen was looking up at the cow woman, she wasn\u2019t paying attention to where she was driving and Daisy had to grab the back of her deputy\u2019s motorcycle to prevent her from crashing. \u201cIt ain\u2019t a good idea to stare at anything except what\u2019s in front of you when you\u2019re driving, Deputy.\u201d Jen heard Daisy\u2019s voice coming from the mouth of the giant cow and couldn\u2019t believe it. \u201cDaisy!? Is that you!? What the hell happened?\u201d Daisy just held Raymond Yates in her other hand as he kept struggling. \u201cI\u2019ll explain it on the way. Gotta take this varmint to the state pen. Daisy placed Jen on her shoulder before walking out of Garlen\u2019s city limits to make her way to the state prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the bovine behemoth was stomping away, Jen just looked around her giantess friend\u2019s naked fur-covered body and then looked at Daisy\u2019s cowgirl hat that appeared to have actually grown with her. \u201cSeriously, Sheriff Downe?\u201d asked Jen. \u201cHow the hell did you get transmogrified into a giant cow? Did you eat a bad burger or something? You do know they\u2019ve been using growth hormones in that crap.\u201d Daisy gave a snort. \u201cFirst of all,\u201d said the giant cow woman. \u201cI believe the proper term is minotaur. That\u2019s the bull critter in Greek Mythology. Kinda funny that female minotaurs apparently have udders. As to answer your question, remember that magic shop robbery we busted earlier. I think that skull I sat on was magic. It\u2019s like how a vampire\u2019s bite works.\u201d Jen just blinked in surprise. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said. \u201cThat would explain you turning into a minotaur but how come A) You\u2019re a giant and B) You\u2019re morbidly obese.\u201d Daisy gave a scoff. \u201cJen,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is Texas. Everything\u2019s bigger here, even curses apparently. Not that this is a curse. This transformation just solved the outlaw problem in Garlen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen blinked and then she understood exactly what Sheriff Downe was talking about. \u201cThat makes sense,\u201d said Jen nervously. \u201cWho\u2019d be stupid enough to pick a fight with a minotaur the size of Godzilla. Uh, just one more question though, Daisy; why are you naked.\u201d Daisy just blushed. \u201cI kinda outgrew my clothes when I went super colossal.\u201d \u201cThen how come your hat grew with you?\u201d Daisy actually stopped to think about that. That was a good question. But then she simply mumbled and then shrugged her shoulders.\u201d Jen gave a sigh as she laid back behind the cow woman\u2019s ear. \u201cOh well,\u201d she said. \u201cI guess we can chalk that up to magic that can\u2019t be explained. I just hope that if there is a sorcerer supreme in this dimension, that he isn\u2019t some brain dead moron who abandons real magic for street magic because real magic doesn\u2019t have \u201crules\u201d.\u201d Daisy let out a sigh. \u201cYou know as well as I do that that was the result of a biased writer. They were trying to kill the franchise because they didn\u2019t want to work on it any longer.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy then let out a grunt because Yates was still beating around in her hand. \u201cHey, fatso! It\u2019s bad enough that I got beaten into the ground by a big stupid cow. Do you have to torture me with your lame small talk as well. Go back to Moo Mesa you lousy ungulate!\u201d Daisy just gave a snort and smirked before squeezing her captive and making him grunt. \u201cOh really?\u201d asked the titanic sheriff. \u201cThat\u2019s funny. From my perspective, you\u2019re not in any position to be making threats and being nasty. And you know, it\u2019s a long walk to the prison even at my size. I might need a snack on the way.\u201d Daisy smirks, giving Yates a good view of her enormous herbivorous teeth that were big enough to crush cars and the outlaw shivers in her grip from pure fear as Daisy faked a sinister cackle. Jen just stared at her boss disapprovingly. \u201cWhat?\u201d asked Daisy. \u201cA giant cow lady can\u2019t have some fun? Fine, I\u2019m not going to waste another moment. It\u2019s off to Steeltoe Penitentiary for this varmint.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy was soon whistling to herself as she walked out into the desert to reach the prison. Jen just kicked back between the ear of the bovine titaness and was still wrapping her head around what happened. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it,\u201d she thought to herself. \u201cShe sits her big butt down on a magic skull and sure enough, she\u2019s a minotaur big enough to pick her teeth with the Eiffel Tower. What does she need me for? At her size, a Megazord could do my job better. Man, what I wouldn\u2019t give for a piece of that action. Though maybe not a cow. I\u2019ve eaten a lot of steak in my lifetime and that would just be creepy. Damn. I\u2019m going to have to give up eating beef. Now that I know a cow that could just as easily swallow me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Steeltoe Penitentiary at the time, the prisoners were working on a chain gang and stuck hammering away at rocks (I know it\u2019s a western cliche and this is the modern time, but give me a break). One particularly large prisoner with a yellow tattoo of the Greek letter Sigma was biding his time as he hammered away at a rock and was sharpening it to a point. \u201cI\u2019m gonna get out of here,\u201d he thought to himself. \u201cAnd as soon as I get out, that lady sheriff who put me here is ****ing dead. But before I kill her, I think I\u2019ll make sure that she can\u2019t be replaced. Maybe I should silence that pretty little girl of hers first.\u201d The crook with the hammer and the Sigma tattoo gave an evil smirk and was going to start to smash his chains. However, that\u2019s when there was a loud shaking and all the prisoners were clamoring as the guards tried to restrain them. The warden himself ran out to investigate. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d asked the warden. \u201cAn earthquake.\u201d The vice warden shook his head and he had a look of surprise plastered to his face as he pointed forward. The warden saw Daisy approaching the Penitentiary and all but had a heart attack when he saw the enormous cow woman walking in and waving at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowdy, Warden Eiding,\u201d said Daisy. \u201cIt\u2019s just the sheriff of Garlen returning one of your varmints that leaked into my town.\u201d Daisy then unceremoniously dropped Raymond Yates back into the prison into a puddle of rain water as he grunted. The other inmates as well as the guards themselves were shocked to see such an enormously titanic minotaur woman but they were even more surprised to hear that the creature was the sheriff. \"Sheriff?\" asked Warden Eiding. \"Sheriff Daisy Downe of Garlen.\" Daisy just blushed at the warden's question. \"It's a long story. I kind of got an extreme makeover from the last time anyone saw me.\" The prisoner with the Sigma tattoo, the one who was planning to escape and get revenge on Daisy, looked at the rock he sharpened to use as a weapon and begun to rethink his course of actions before smashing the rock and throwing away the hammer. He realized that now would probably not be a good time to pick a fight with the sheriff who originally captured him, especially now that there would be no way he could even harm her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYates stood up and was feeling rather irate and it was clear that anger was quickly overriding logic. \"You haven't seen the last of me, you lard-ridden colossus! I'll get out again and when I do, you're hamburger meat!\" The other inmates looked in horror at the idea that Yates still insisted on trying to provoke Daisy. \"This guy must have a death wish.\" Thought Jen to herself. Daisy just gave a smug grin at Yates. \"Don't you grin at me,\" said the criminal. \"I'm serious. I'm going to kill you. If it takes me one hundred years I'm gonna....!\" Before Yates could finish his sentence, Daisy flicked him into the wall with her finger and made him grunt as the guards went to apprehend the villain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bovine giantess couldn't help but snicker at how none of the inmates had any hope of challenging her and then grabbed her hat by the brim before speaking again. \"Let this be a grim reminder for all of you varmints to stay right where you are. I'm the kind of sheriff who's tough on crime. Really tough. And from now on, things are going to be a lot tougher for any sidewinders who think they can raise hell in my time. I'll make it perfectly simple; mess with this cow and you get her horns.\" With that Daisy gave a snort and then turned to face Warden Eiding. \"See y'all later, Warden.\" Said the giant sheriff as she tipped her cowgirl hat. As Daisy turned and walked away, the warden was completely dumbfounded. \"That is the last time I drink a single drop of hard lemonade.\" The warden said as he shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the walk back to Garlen, Daisy was attracting a lot of attention as she walked alongside the highway, making absolutely sure not to crush any cars underfoot. \"No need to worry, citizens,\" said the bovine goddess. \"I mean y'all no harm. Unless y'all is thinking about breaking the law and then y'all really in for a world of hurt.\" Daisy let out a laugh as Jen walked up to her ear. \"You better be careful, Sheriff,\" she said. \"You don't want to go mad with power.\" \"Don't be such a spoilsport, Jen. I'm just having fun.\" \"You know, you're taking this transformation surprisingly well. How are Rick and Violet taking it.\" Daisy shrugged her shoulders. \"They'll get used to it. Ugh. I better get back home fast. My udder is killing me. Hope Rick doesn't m...\" \"Ew!\" yelled Jen. Soon, Daisy had arrived back in Garlen and dropped off Jen on the ground before she walked off towards home. \"See you tomorrow, Deputy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as she watched her giant minotaur boss walk away, Jen begun to think to herself. \"I wonder if that magic shop is still open,\" she said to herself. \"I'd like to get in on some of that action.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Jen was walking away, she couldn't help but look back at Daisy as she was walking towards her home. Jen gave a scoff. \"Jokes on you, Boss. Rick is gonna have to take yoga classes before he fools around with you again. Oh, I can't believe this. If she's big enough to squash outlaws like bugs all by herself, what does she need me for. I wish that I was a giant mythical monster. Sure the poundage might be somewhat unattractive but at least I'd feel a sense of power.\" Jen passed by a department store with a mirror in it and looked all around her scrawny body and the Asian woman let out a groan. \"How she chose me as deputy I'll never know. I look like a total weakling. That is final. I want to be a monster too. But how.\" Then it occurred to Jen. That minotaur skull turned Daisy into a giant obese minotaur so it could probably turn her into a giantess as well. \"That's it!\" she yelled. \"That skull that was stolen from the magic shop. Time to even up the score.\" Jen ran forward and then grunted because she fell into one of the holes left by Daisy's footprints. She let out a grunt before climbing her way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen didn't have long to go to find the magic shop. There she saw from the window display alone, a brain in a jar, a gorilla's paw and what looked like a hurricane in a jar. \"I'm definitely at the right place.\" She said. Jen walked into the store and looked around. Nobody appeared to be around and yet there was a table that had the same minotaur's skull in the center, except that this time, the skull appeared to have a large bandage on it from where Daisy sat on it. Jen walked up to the skull and tapped it before looking around. \"Anybody home?\" the deputy asked. \"Hello?!\" Jen didn't get an answer and looked around. \"There's got to be a bell or something around here. Hello! Customer in the house over here!\" Jen still got no answer and resorted to banging her hand impatiently on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when the minotaur skull's eyes glowed bright. \"You don't have to act up,\" said the skull in a deep voice. \"I already know that you're here.\" \"Huh?\" asked Jen. \"Who said that?\" Jen then looked down because the skull appeared to be moving its jaw. \"Down here.\" Jen let out a scream and then held out her gun as she pointed it at the skull. The skull just let out a sigh. \"Unless those bullets are silver, they will be of no use to you.\" Jen couldn't believe it. \"You just talked. Skulls don't talk!\" \"This is a magical store,\" said the skull. \"What do you expect? More importantly, what have you come for.\" Jen showed the skull her badge. \"Deputy Jennifer Lee. I work for the sheriff.\" \"The sheriff,\" grumbled the skull. \"I remember her. Big tall brunette with the skunk stripe and tight green sweat pants. She had a really big ass if I remember correctly.\" \"Well now her ass is big enough to be used as a wrecking ball. You turned her into a giant minotaur.\" \"Not on purpose,\" said the skull. \"I used to be a minotaur myself, though not nearly as large as she is now. I'm afraid that the curse can't be broken if that's what you've come here for. She will be the new minotaur for the rest of her life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen gave a glare. \"That's not what I'm here for. Sheriff Downe is unstoppable. No criminal in Garlen stands a chance against her at her current size and form.\" \"And what's wrong with that? As long as she's tyrannizing evildoers like those hooligans who kidnapped me, I don't see a problem.\" Jen let out a scream and pounded the table again. \"Pay attention! Pay attention. This is the main problem. What does she need a deputy for if no criminal can stand up to her? What am I good for?\" \"I really don't like where this is going.\" Said the skull. \"My point,\" said Jen. \"Is that I want to be a titan too. I want to be as big and powerful as Daisy. I don't care what you turn me into. I don't have to be a minotaur either. Just make me a giant.\" The skull spun around. \"You do understand that this is magic you're trifling with. Magic is unpredictable. You have no idea what you're getting into.\" But Jen gave a glare. \"Excuse me, but do you have a permit to have your shop here? I could just as easily shut this place down.\" \"You are like a petulant child,\" said the minotaur skull. \"Exactly how big and powerful do you need to be in order to feel better about yourself?\" Jen blushed slightly. The skull had a point that she was mainly doing this for self-gratification and to feel important. Perhaps she was being a tad selfish and impulsive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then Jen shook her head and glared at the skull. \"Just please give it to me straight. I don't care what you turn me into. Just as long as it's something.\" The skull let out a deep sigh. \"Why must humans be willing to trade their humanity for nothing? Fine, I have something that might be the answer to your problems, that is if you're willing to go through with it. Once you transform, you will have little to no hope of ever becoming human again.\" \"I don't care. Just do it.\" The skull opened up his mouth to reveal a small box. As the box opened up, Jen instinctively closed her eyes, believing the contents to be something horrifying. \"Ew!\" she yelled. \"What is it? Newt's eyes? Bat wings? Dragon blood?\" But as Jen opened her eyes she was surprised because all that was in the box was a large farm brown egg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An egg?\" asked Jen as she picked up the egg and looked in disbelief. \"This is it. It's just a stupid egg.\" \"That \"stupid\" egg as you call it,\" said the skull. \"Is a freak of nature. It's a rooster egg?\" Jen raised an eyebrow. \"Are you kidding me? Roosters don't lay eggs. Hens do.\" \"I just told you it was a freak of nature. However, the egg was then stolen by a snake and partially incubated. Inside this egg is the very same power that you so desperately seek. All you must do is eat it.\" Jen was somewhat shocked. \"Are you kidding me. I hate eggs and an egg that was handled by a snake. Yuck.\" \"You do want to be a giant don't you?\" Jen let out a sigh. \"I do. I want to be a giant on par with Daisy.\" The skull nodded his head. \"So now you must eat the egg. You can scramble it, hard-boil it or just eat it raw. The end result will be the same.\" Jen didn't really fully understand what was going on but took the egg and put it in her pocket. \"How much do I owe you.\" The skull just glowed his eyes bright. \"Believe me, what will happen to your body is payment enough. Good day to you, Deputy.\" As Jen was about to leave, she turned her head. \"Uh, by the way. Is there any way to turn into a giant without becoming inhumanly obese.\" \"No,\" said the skull. \"I'm afraid that everything from this store that induces growth, also induces weight gain. No gain, no growth.\" \"Figures.\" Muttered Jennifer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen walked out of the shop with the egg. However, the second she walked out, the store mysteriously vanished and the deputy looked back in surprise. \"Okay,\" she said. \"That was a little bit freaky. But at least I have the means to become a giant. Hope this town is big enough for the two of us, Daisy.\" Jennifer wasted no time running home and frying the egg on a skillet. She looked in disgust because this egg was not colored normal. The yolk was pitch blue. \"Yuck,\" said the deputy as she sprinkled salt and pepper onto the egg in the skillet. \"How revolting. You're gonna have to choke it down, Jennifer. You want to be a giant of justice much like Daisy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the egg was fully cooked, Jennifer scooped it up with a spatula and then held it in front of her face. \"I really hate eggs,\" she said. \"Which is why I got to make this quick.\" Jen dropped the fried egg into her mouth and then screamed in pain because it was still hot. As she swallowed and choked slightly on the egg, she immediately drank a glass of water in order to make the egg go down faster. Jen then breathed heavily and then ran outside of her house. She knew she didn't want to be indoors when she turned into a big fat monster giantess. \"This is it!\" yelled Jen. \"I'm going to be big! I'm going to be mighty! I'm going to be monstrous!\" Jen let out a pretend roar and swung her arms. However, she looked around and saw nothing happened and let out a groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a rip! Stupid skull ripped me off! Wait, he didn't say that the results would be immediate. Maybe it takes time to... bucaw!\" Jen gasped because she could've sworn she clucked like a chicken. Suddenly she heard a ripping sound and saw that her hips were outgrowing her pants. \"Oh my.. squawk!\" Jen held out her arms to see that bright purple scales were growing on her arms as well as bright fuchsia leather wings.  Onn her back and face, she was sprouting bright light blue feathers as her purple hair got longer. Jen's belly was bulging as well and she felt herself grow purple scales on her legs as she sprouted a long dragon-like tail and her feet turned into bright golden-yellow talons like those of a bird but with abnormally sharp claws. As Jen grew bigger, she sprouted two more chins as her neck elongated and she squawked as she grow a fuchsia-colored chicken's wattle and her mouth extended into a golden-yellow beak. She just kept growing bigger and fatter as she squawked and her clothing, except for her vest and cowgirl's hat was torn completely apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the transformation was complete, Jen was a 65ft tall cockatrice with a 75ft wide rear and 80ft wide stomach and D-cup breasts. She looked at her new body and squawked as she saw her reflection in a window. \"I'm a cockatrice?\" she asked. \"Oh man. Not what I had in mind, but it's an improvement. Okay, so I'm not as big as Daisy, but it's still good.\" As Jen was laughing to herself, she heard a burglar alarm and squawked. \"Show time!\" Jen then waddled rapidly as fast as her chicken legs could carry her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a busy day at the Ajax Joseph Memorial Hospital and one of the surgeons in particular was hard at work. This doctor was a young woman with long golden red hair and a blue patch over her right eye who was dressed like a doctor. \u201cHer name was Dr. Diana Queen and she was in the middle of a surgery on a man who looked like he had been heavily wounded in an accident. \u201cFaster, people,\u201d said Diana. \u201cWe can\u2019t lose him. It\u2019s a miracle they brought him here on time. These neck wounds are very severe. Somebody get me the anesthetic.\u201d Outside, there were a couple of janitors listening in. \u201cDr. Queen sure sounds serious today.\u201d Said one of them. The other janitor just nodded his head. \u201cThe patient is a Stephan Warner. He was just in a mountain climbing accident and Dr. Queen is doing all she can.\u201d \u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry, kid. She\u2019s the best surgeon we have.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a few more,\u201d said Diana. \u201cEverything will be already. Maynard, hand me the scalpel. I have to get out this last piece of metal. I haven\u2019t lost a patient yet and I don\u2019t plan to. Not when there is so much to live for. Don\u2019t worry, Mr. Warner, you\u2019re gonna be alright.\u201d Hours passed and Diana took off her surgical mask as she smiled and spoke with Stephan Warner. \u201cGood news, Mr. Warner. You\u2019ve made a complete recovery.\u201d Stephan moved his hand a few times and sighed in relief. \u201cThank you, very much, Dr. Queen. But I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t pay the medical bill. Business has been slow this month and as for my insurance...\u201d Diana gave a smile. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d said the surgeon. \u201cJust pay the bill when you can. I joined this profession to help people.\u201d Stephan gave a smile at Diana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later after work, Diana was at her penthouse with her fianc\u00e9, Jim and they had just gotten through with intercourse. \u201cDamn, Jim. You are so weak. You must be out of shape.\u201d \u201cHey,\u201d said Jim. \u201cI <i>am</i> marrying a doctor in a few months, Diana. And you\u2019re vicious.\u201d Diana just let out a scoff. \u201cI have to be. Not everybody listens to doctor\u2019s orders. Oh, damn. I forgot to get the newspaper today. Wait right here, Jim.\u201d Jim just ran as Diana walked to the door. Of course he gave a glare. \u201cI just hope she never has to see that patient from earlier again,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the one thing I hate about her being a doctor.\u201d Jim was a very envious man and didn\u2019t like any other guy he even <i>imagined</i> would be trying to get it on with Diana. But as Diana went to get the paper, she saw a strange package waiting for her. When Diana walked back in with the package, Jim got concerned. \"What's with the box, Di?\" asked Jim. \"I don't know.\" Jim took a look and gasped. \"You have got to be kidding me. It's from that Stephan Warner joker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s odd,\u201d said Diana. \u201cWhat would a patient be sending me?\u201d \u201cMaybe he\u2019s paying you in advance,\u201d said Jim. \u201cHe must\u2019ve found some cash on hand after all.\u201d Diana opened the package and gave a gasp because what Stephan had sent her appeared to be a wool scarf that was in a bright gold color. \u201cI-I don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d Diana put the scarf on and looked at herself in the mirror. \u201cHow do I look, Jim? This wool is gorgeous. It feels almost like it\u2019s made of actual gold.\u201d Jim looked at the scarf and was kind of mad that Stephan would send his girlfriend something so nice. \u201cOh,\u201d said Diana. \u201cYou\u2019re being paranoid, Jim. Think of this as payment for the surgery. I told Stephan that he could pay me later and apparently he didn\u2019t have any actual money on him, so he sent me this golden fleece instead. it looks as if it\u2019s the same worth as the medical bill. Nothing to worry about.\u201d But Jim was still skeptic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana didn\u2019t think there was anything apparently wrong with the wool scarf and was wearing it to work the next morning. As she was walking into the hospital though, she let out a gasp. She clutched her chest and saw a billboard advertising a poster for a monster movie involving a werewolf. Diana shivered and then she raised an eyebrow in confusion. \u201cWhat am I doing?\u201d she asked. \u201cI never had a fear of wolves before.\u201d Diana shrugged her shoulders as she walked away wearing her scarf. She then let out a yawn that almost sounding like a bleat. \u201cBoy,\u201d said the surgeon. \u201cI must be tired.\u201d What Diana didn\u2019t realize that with every step, she appeared to be putting on weight.</span></div></div>",

Nora gave a nervous laugh. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like that, Dr. Queen, but for some reason you look so much.... bigger than you usually are.\u201d Diana crossed her arms but then noticed that her breasts were getting bigger. \u201cWTF?\u201d she asked herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Diana grunted and felt her head. \u201cDr. Queen?\u201d asked Nora in worry. \u201cNothing,\u201d said Diana. \u201cJust a strange headache. Ouch. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d That\u2019s what Diana thought but when she got to the bathroom, she saw that she did indeed get larger. \u201cYou gotta be kidding me,\u201d said Diana. \u201cHow could I get so fat so quickly? All I had for breakfast this morning was one banana and I haven\u2019t cheated on my diet even once.\u201d Then Diana felt her head and then grunted because she felt something prick her and she saw that her finger appeared to be pleading from a minor puncture wound. Diana felt around her head. \u201cThat\u2019s odd,\u201d she said. \u201cIt feels as if something is growing on my head.\u201d The female doctor splashed water on her face and even wiped beneath her eyepatch before splashing some water into her own eye. \u201cI must not be getting enough sleep.\u201d She said to herself. Then Diana let out a gasp<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Diana stood in front of the sink, she looked into the bathroom mirror to see that she was undergoing a strange mutation. She was not only getting taller, but she was growing very obese, especially in the thighs. She saw that her high heels had slide off as her feet turned to hooves. Diana then felt her butt expand until it was higher than her waist and revealed her naked booty (she was going commando) and she sprouted a stubby tail Diana than felt long and thick, shining, golden wool growing all over her body as her ears became pointed and her face extended into a snout as her skin turned pinkish gold. Diana let out a scream that turned into a bleat right before she sprouted a pair of long reddish gold curved horns like that of a ram, which contrasted with her ewe body. Diana backed up as her large rear accidentally knocked down down three bathroom stalls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana bent over and looked in the mirror to see she had transformed into a 15ft tall golden sheep who had to weigh at least 5 tons. As Diana stepped back, the floor begun to crack. She then felt her neck to learn that her scarf had somehow merged with her skin and formed a wool collar. \u201cWell,\u201d said Diana. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting this to happen today. I hope Jim likes the idea of being screwed by a ewe tonight.\u201d Diana even bit her fingernails to find they had turned to solid gold as well, every part of her body was shining as she looked in the mirror. It appeared that even though she was very obese and soft, her skin, wool, horns and bones appeared to have turned into actual gold. \u201cDid Stephan\u2019s gift do this to me? His profile did say that he ran a curio store. Perhaps the fleece was cursed and he didn\u2019t know it.\u201d Then, Diana heard a pounding on the door. \u201cDr. Queen,\u201d said a voice. \u201cDr. Queen. Come quick!\u201d Diana gulped because from the looks of it, the doctor was not going to have any choice but to go to work as an obese amazonian ovine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDr. Queen, hurry up. We need you in....\u201d </span></div></div>",

Her water's just broke.\" Diana blinked (or winked more accurately given she only had one good eye) in surprise and then she sheepishly (see what I did there) walked out and the orderly spotted her in her transformed state and gasped at the obese sheep giantess stood in front of him. \"No time for gaaaaawking,\" said Dr. Queen before grabbing her mouth in embarrassment at the fact she had just bleated. \"This is an emergency.\" The sheep woman was walking down the hallway as her lab coat was coming lose from her obese body. As the sheep waddled down the hallway, she seemed to be getting larger and fatter. She even accidentally knocked her booty into the wall and cracked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the maternity ward there was a pregnant woman screaming in agony as the nurses were trying to calm her down. \"Don't worry, Mrs. Duncan. Everything will be alright. The doctor will see you shortly.\" \"What's taking her so long?!\" yelled Mrs. Duncan. \"Oh!\" The orderly from before ran into the room and looked at the rest of the staff. \"Everyone,\" he said. \"When you see Dr. Queen, it might come to a shock. She's not looking like herself today.\" \"What are you talking about?\" asked a Hispanic female nurse. There was then a rumbling sound and Diana walked into the room as her golden fleece flashed brightly. The nurses looked in surprise at their mutated boss and Mrs. Duncan outright screamed to see a 20ft tall and 6 ton sheep woman looming down on her and wearing a surgical mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything will be alright, ma'am,\" said Dr. Queen. \"I'm still a doctor, even if I look like I belong in a zoo right now. Take it easy, just push, just push.\" Mrs. Duncan was looking up at the sheep giantess in pure fear but she remained calm and decided to let Diana do her job. \"Everything will be find. Lila, bring me some warm towels. This is gonna be messy.\" The Hispanic nurse nodded her head and went to get the towels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Mr. Duncan was called into the room. He saw his wife in pure fear and then he looked up and gasped in shock at the giant sheep holding his newborn baby. The baby herself was surprisingly unafraid of Diana and was even pulling slightly on Diana's wool as Diana was in mild discomfort. \"Congratulations, Mr. Duncan,\" said Diana. \"It's a girl.\" Diana handed Mr. Duncan his daughter who was giggling and reaching out for the large sheep woman. \"I must be more stressed out than I thought.\" Said Mr. Duncan. \"I'm starting to see things.\" Diana looked down at the newborn baby who was giggling at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Dr. Queen was in the break room buying a candy bar from a vending machine. However, since her body was now much bigger, the golden sheep giantess had emptied out the entire machine. Nora and Lila went out from behind the corner and was watching Dr. Queen in surprise. \"That scarf,\" said Nora. \"It must've transformed her.\" Lila nodded her head as she looked at Diana's enormous body. \"Well, it certainly hasn't stopped her from performing her job.\" Nora was drooling at the sight of the golden fleece surrounding Diana's body. \"It looks like her body, hair and bones have turned into gold. I wouldn't be surprised if her blood was golden as well.\" Lila then walked forward behind Diana and took out a pair of scissors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana then yelled in pain as she heard a snipping noise and turned around and looked down at Lila who had cut off a piece of her wool and then placed it in a jar. \"Lila.\" Grunted Diana rather crossly. Lila just smiled nervously. \"Dr. Queen. I read about the golden fleece. According to legend, it has the power to heal all ills. Your wool could be used to develop cures for cancer better than any chemo. In theory that is.\" Diana let out a sigh. \"Okay,\" said Diana. \"You can use my wool for research, but you better not clip anymore than you need. I'm too obese to fit into any known clothes and I do not feel like showing off a sheered buttocks around the office. I'm a surgeon, not a hooker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLila then walked away as Diana rubbed her thick, juicy mouton booty. She looked into her makeup mirror and saw her teeth had even turned to gold. I hope Jim doesn't mind the fact that he's engaged to a sumo-sized ovine made of organic gold.\"</span></div></div>",

But I\u2019ve never seen literal golden fleece. I thought it was only a myth.\u201d \u201cI knew it,\u201d said Lila. \u201cThat strange scarf must\u2019ve merged with Dr. Queen and turned her hair and skeleton into pure gold. That is, if you can find a skeleton underneath all that blubber.\u201d Nora was rubbing her chin as a sneaky smile appeared on her face. However, Lila had a more idealistic smile on her face. \u201cIf that truly is the golden fleece,\u201d she said. \u201cThen there\u2019s virtually nothing that it can\u2019t cure. I\u2019m going to take this stuff to that patient who\u2019s been in a coma for three months. If it wakes him up, we\u2019ll know it\u2019s the real deal.\u201d Before the nurses could leave however, the appraiser stopped them. \u201cWhere exactly did you find that golden fleece?\u201d Nora just bit her lip. \u201cWell that\u2019s simple,\u201d she said. \u201cFrom a golden sheep.\u201d The nurses walked out just as the appraiser blinked. \u201cThat... makes... sense. I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurses were walking down the street and Lila held up the jar with the golden fleece. Nora was smiling rather fiendishly. \u201cIf this truly is golden fleece,\u201d said Nora. \u201cThen that makes Dr. Queen a living gold mine. I wonder if Stephan Warner even knew what he had on his hands. Oh man. Think of the possibilities, Lila.\u201d Lila gave a smile. \u201cWith this fleece, the most incurable diseases will be a thing of the past.\" Nora just rolled her eyes. \"Uh, yeah. Something like that.\" Nora begun to think to herself. \"I just need to find a way to discretely sheer that giant sheep for all she's worth.\" Lila then realized something. \"Uh, Nora,\" she said. \"Exactly how big do you think Dr. Queen is going to get?\" \"What do you mean, Lila?\" \"Well,\" said Lila. \"Last time we saw her, she was 20ft high and I'm pretty sure that she's still getting bigger, not to mention fatter.\" Nora gave a look of surprise. \"Are you saying that we could be looking at a sheep as big as Godzilla?\" Nora gave an evil smirk because she figured that that way they're be more gold for her to harvest. \"Gee,\" said Nora. \"I wonder how Dr. Queen is doing? Hope she's alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, back at the hospital, Diana was walking down the hallway and the floor was cracking under her massive weight. However, Diana couldn\u2019t determine whether or not her weight was due to actual obesity or due to her wool and skeleton being turned into gold. \u201cWell this looks ominous,\u201d said Diana. \u201cIf this keeps up, I\u2019m going to have to retire early, due to not fitting in the hospital.\u201d Diana then felt her horns. \u201cEwes don\u2019t always have horns. Then again, magic doesn\u2019t necessarily have to make sense.\u201d Diana noticed that people were covering their eyes slightly as they saw her because of the sunshine reflecting off of her golden fleece.\u201d The sheep woman bleated and then went to shade the window. As she did this, she heard a tearing sound and realized the back of her coat was ripping. She let out a sigh. \u201cPretty soon,\u201d she said. \u201cMy eyepatch will be the only thing on my person that actually fits. I hope I eventually stop getting bigger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Diana heard a barking sound and turned around to see a blind man with a seeing eye dog who just so happened to be a sheep dog. Instinctively the mutated doctor moved into the corner. \u201cSorry about that, Dr. Queen,\u201d said the blind man. \u201cUsually he\u2019s not very chatty.\u201d The man\u2019s dog just barked again and Diana got on all fours as she blushed in embarrassment. \u201cThis is not doing much for my dignity.\u201d Said the obese sheep woman out of pure frustration. That was when Diana heard her cell phone ringing and picked it up out of her pocket as the sleeve on her coat tore. \"Darn! Hello. Oh, hi, Jim. Well, it seems like I'm gonna be late. Something really weird happened today. Oh no, the wedding is still set for June. I just hope you down mind (BAAH!).\" Diana covered her mouth and blushed. \"I'm sorry. That just came out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that time in the medical laboratory, Lila had successfully melted Diana's wool down into a liquid medicine as Nora was watching. \"Okay,\" said Lila. \"Now to test it.\" Diana took out a jar of what looked like tainted sea water. \"Be careful with that, Lila,\" said Nora. \"That stuff is dangerous Crimson Fever. It's incurable.\" \"Not yet.\" Lila dropped several drops of the melted golden fleece into the sea water and then it begun to glow before it transformed into cool clean water yet again. \"Yes!\" yelled Lila. \"It worked.\" Nora just let out a scoff. \"Seems like a waste of perfectly good gold to me.\" Lila just laughed at how the golden fleece was in fact the real deal. \"There's no denying it,\" said Lila. \"The myth of the golden fleece was all too true. This is amazing.\" Nora shook her head. \"What's really amazing,\" she thought to herself. \"Is that we have a living gold mine right under our roof.\" Nora let out a laugh to herself. \"Get ready, Diana. It's sheering time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as Nora looked into the hallway, she ran into something that made her grunt. \"Hey!\" yelled Nora. Nora then looked in surprise because what she had bumped into was one of Diana's thighs. Nora looked up to see that the golden sheep woman had gotten slightly bigger and her lab coat at this point had been reduced to a vest as the sheep woman was panting and sweating. \"Oh,\" said Diana. \"Hi, Nora.\" Diana looked down to see that the ground was continuing to crack beneath her. \"Oops,\" said Diana. \"No time to talk, Nora. I have to get to lower ground before I crash the entire hospital. Bye! Oh, and be careful to make sure I don\u2019t step on you.\u201d As Diana was walking away, Nora looked in awe because the sheep woman\u2019s wool had managed to get even longer as she got bigger. That was it, Nora needed to find a way to make sure the sheep woman overflowed with golden fleece, all the more that could be harvested by a very greedy nurse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Lila had left to tell Dr. Queen about her discovery with the golden fleece, Nora decided to dabble with some chemistry of her own. First she looked up ovine growth hormones and then she snuck off of work in order to meet up with somebody to pick up said hormones. She double checked the case before she spoke with the supplier. \"Are you certain that these are real growth hormones?\" \"What do I look like?\" asked the supplier. \"A criminal. They're legit. Why?\" Nora gave a smirk. \"Let's just say that I found out that dealing with wool can be very profitable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the hospital, Diana was stuffing her face with jelly rolls and swallowing gallons of milk in order to keep her hunger under control. \"This is one of the biggest drawbacks of a larger body,\" thought the giant sheep lady to herself. \"I have to eat a lot more food. As if I wasn't large enough.\" While, Diana was busy, Lila ran up to her. \"Dr. Queen! Dr. Queen!\" Upon hearing her nurse, Diana accidentally swallowed an entire container of milk and coughed before she let out a bleat. \"Lila,\" says Diana. \"Don't yell. Remember, this is a hospital.\" \"I'm sorry, Dr. Queen. I just had to show you the results. Your new wool has amazing healing properties. I liquidated the golden fleece and put it in a jar of poisoned water and in an instant the bacteria was gone.\" Diana smiled as she bit into another pastry. \"That's wonderful. If there's any of the liquid left, please bring it to that patient in room 13B, the one sick with Chaga's disease.\" \"Yes, Doc.\" Diana smiled and then caressed some of her wool. \"Maybe this transformation isn't such a bad thing.\" Diana then looked into her iPhone and then red several articles that looked interesting. \"My word,\" she said. \"Giant Pegasus woman spotted? Texan sheriff transforms into colossal minotaur? Good grief, these transformations must be more common than I thought. That must be very traumatic. Note to self, Diana; set up support group for mutated women.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the medical lab, Nora had put the growth hormones together and was smiling to herself. \"That curse is slowly making Dr. Queen bigger and woolier,\" she said. \"But the bigger the sheep, the bigger the gold. Time for Dr. Queen to become even more queen-sized.\" Dr. Queen at the time was outside with her cellphone (cellphones aren't allowed to be used inside the hospital) and was speaking with Jim. \"Yes,\" said Diana. \"I cancelled my order from the bridal shop. But don't get overheated. I'm just retracting my order because the dress isn't going to fit me and I need to schedule... uh, yes, I did put on some weight. How could I gain so much weight so fast? Uh, you'd be surprised. Jim, how do you feel about sheep.\" Diana then shivered because Jim didn't answer in the way she wanted. \"Okay, how do you feel about sheep <i>without</i> mint jelly.\" Before Diana could continue, the cellphone's battery ran out. \"Ram it!\" yelled Diana. \"I mean, damn it! I knew I should've charged this thing before going to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Nora had walked up to Diana and was holding up a glass of tea. \"Some tea, Dr. Queen.\" \"Thanks, Nora,\" said Diana. \"I need it after the day I've been having.\" Diana took the tea and swallowed it, cup and all before letting out a grunt. \"No offense, Nora, but that tea isn't exactly the best I've had.\" Nora let out a smirk because the growth hormones would soon take place. \"Well, Doc, maybe you shouldn't eat the cup?\" Before Diana could answer, the sheep woman bleated in distress as a strange sensation overcame her and her wool was growing at a rapid rate. \"What the?! What was in that tea?!\" Nora gave a smile but then looked in surprise because Diana was growing larger and larger. Apparently combining growth hormones with a curse isn't the best idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana let out a yell as the hormones took effect and the obese sheep woman's height reached....</span></div></div>",

Darren was dressed in a black knight\u2019s outfit modeled to look similar to a scorpion fish, even with a fish-like decoration on the helmet. His wife, Maggie on the other hand was getting all dressed out. She had her whitish blonde hair worn with crimson highlights and let down and was wearing a silver tiara with a horn in the center along with a pair of silver earrings shaped like skulls. She was wearing a large pink and red gown like one a queen would wear, with a large collar, gold bracelets and ankle bracelets and she was just putting her makeup on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaggie,\u201d said Darren. \u201cI still can\u2019t believe you\u2019re going as Morgan Le Fay.\u201d \u201cWhy not?\u201d asked Maggie. \u201cJarrod is going as King Arthur.\u201d Darren groaned. Maggie was referring to her older brother. Darren didn\u2019t care much for his brother-in-law and the two of them have been at each other\u2019s throats since high school. \u201cHow a sweetie pie like you could be related to a crumb like him is beyond me. The even had the nerve to make him king of the fare. I think he only dressed as Arthur to get under my skin.\u201d Maggie let out a sigh. \u201cIt always did disappoint me that you and I couldn\u2019t get along. Oh dang!\u201d Maggie then held up her dress as she ran upstairs. \u201cI almost forgot.\u201d Maggie immediately came back down with a strange ruby necklace with a black unicorn\u2019s head symbol on the medallion. Maggie put the necklace on and Darren let out a laugh.\u2028<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d asked Maggie rather accusingly of her husband. \u201cMorgan Le Fay was the most wicked sorceress in medieval times,\u201d said Darren. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine her being associated with unicorns.\u201d \u201cYou never know, Darren,\u201d said Maggie rather smugly. \u201cMorgan Le Fay had the power to transform into various beasts. Maybe she once decided that it would be a good idea to become a unicorn.\u201d Darren rolled his eyes. \u201cCome on, Maggie. We better get going or we\u2019ll be late to the fair.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028Maggie and Darren soon got into their car and Maggie was smiling as Darren drove the car. \u201cYou know, some say that Morgan\u2019s beef with Arthur was because Arthur killed her husband.\u201d \u201cWatch what you say, Maggie. I don\u2019t want you giving that jerk brother of yours ideas.\u201d \u201cThe fact is,\u201d said Maggie. \u201cMorgan has been plotting revenge on Arthur ever since. Eventually she morphed into the form of Queen Guinevere and tricked Arthur into fathering her son, Mordred who...\u201d Darren grit his teeth. \u201cCould you please stop it. It\u2019s bad enough you chose to dress as Morgan Le Fay in the first place. I don\u2019t want you feeding your brother\u2019s ego.\u201d\u2028\u2028Maggie just shrugged her shoulders. She was sure that Darren\u2019s rivalry with her brother was going to ruin the fair. But what Maggie didn\u2019t realize was that her medallion appeared to be glowing as the unicorn emblem on it let out a neigh.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There was upbeat violin music playing and jesters dancing as well as a man dressed in an old sorcerer\u2019s outfit who appeared to be commanding miniature fairies that were most likely just fireflies. Maggie and Darren looked around and laughed at the sights, though Darren gave a grim look afterwards. \u201cSo, Jarrod challenged you to a joust, Darren,\u201d said Maggie as she bit into a toffee apple. \u201cDon\u2019t get all worked up.\u201d Darren just let out a scoff. \u201cThis time,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to bring your brother down a peg. He can\u2019t push me around forever and I intend to put that pest in his place. King Arthur or no King Arthur, this time the black knight triumphs.\u201d Maggie just continued to bite into her apple before she scoffed. \u201cJust try to come back with at least one of your limbs. Maggie kissed Darren on the cheek and Darren blushed as he had to quickly wipe off the toffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Germaines walked up and noticed the display for the Excalibur sword. \u201cBloody hell,\u201d said Maggie. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t old Excalibur.\u201d Darren then gave a sly smile. He thought that this looked like a chance to get the one up on Jarrod. \u201cWatch me closely, Maggie,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got this.\u201d Darren tried to pull the Excalibur sword out but it wouldn\u2019t budge and he was groaning as he tried to move it. \u201cCome on. Come on.\u201d Darren then had to stop and catch his breath as Maggie walked forward and effortlessly took out the sword with one hand as she continued to eat her toffee apple with the other hand. \u201cI loosened it for you.\u201d Said Darren. \u201cSure you did, honey.\u201d Said Maggie as she patted her husband on the back. Darren let out a groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, trumpets were playing and everyone had gathered into an arena. Darren was getting his horse ready for the joust and was polishing his shield. Darren\u2019s brother-in-law, Jarrod, in his King Arthur armor, walked behind Darren and smiled. \u201cWell,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t Daryl.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s Darren, Jarrod.\u201d Said Darren in annoyance. Jarrod gave a smirk. \u201cI still can\u2019t see what Maggie sees in a blighter like you. You are so uncouth.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll see who\u2019s uncouth when I literally knock you off of your high horse, Jarrod.\u201d But Jarrod wasn\u2019t exactly worried about his brother-in-law\u2019s words. \u201cIn your bloody dreams. You couldn\u2019t even get a hobby horse to do what you want, Darren.\u201d As Jarrod laughed to himself, Maggie came forward and although nobody noticed it, she seemed to be taller and pudgier than before. \u201cJarrod,\u201d said Maggie angrily to her brother. \u201cI really don\u2019t like it when you pick on Darren.\u201d \u201cOh, come on, Sis. It\u2019s not like I can help it. There is so much wrong with him.\u201d Maggie then gave a glare and Jarrod let out a sigh. \u201cI never did like it when you looked at me like that. Fine, I\u2019ll try to try to go easy on him. I\u2019ll see you at the joust, Derek.\u201d Jarrod walked off as Darren was now angrier than ever. \u201cDon\u2019t listen to him, Baby,\u201d said Maggie. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna knock him dead.\u201d Darren gave a smile but then as he got up, he felt his wife\u2019s stomach and realized something. \u201cMaggie,\u201d he said. \u201cHow many of those toffee apples have you had?\u201d Maggie gave a look of confusion in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028At that moment, the trumpets blared to single the start of the joust. \u201cHere ye, here ye. People of Camelot, King Arthur will now face the evil Black Knight in a joust.\u201d Everyone cheered as Jarrod came out and booed at Darren. \u201cShut it,\u201d said Darren. \u201cHave at thee, you demon in King Arthur\u2019s form. I\u2019ve come to vanquish you.\u201d Jarrod gave a smirk as Maggie took her seat to watch the joust between her brother and husband. However, she felt her stomach slightly and failed to notice that her medallion was still glowing. Maggie looked at the medallion but shrugged her shoulders. \u201cThe joust will now begin!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Darren and Jarrod\u2019s horses let out a neigh as both challengers came at each other with their lances. Darren focused his lance and was going to knock down Jarrod but then he saw a flash of light and grunted. This left him easy pray for Jarrod to strike him and knock him to the ground with a scream. Darren fell into the dirt as everyone cheered, except Maggie that was. \u201cDarren!\u201d yelled Maggie. Jarrod got off his horse and stared smugly at his defeated brother-in-law. \u201cNot one word.\u201d Said Darren angrily. Suddenly, there was another flash of light and Maggie moaned. Everyone gasped as Maggie fell out of the stands. \u201cWitchcraft!\u201d yelled one spectator. \u201cIt\u2019s Morgan Le Fay!\u201d \u201cMaggie?\u201d asked Jarrod. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Darren then gasped as he looked at his wife and her pendant appeared to be glowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie\u2019s medallion let out another burst and suddenly Maggie underwent a strange transformation. She was getting bigger and larger. Her belly, thighs and breasts were all expanding at high speed and she appeared to be growing bright white fur over her body with a long curved red and pink horn grew out of her forehead right over her tiara. \u201cMaggie!\u201d yelled Darren as he watched his wife. Maggie\u2019s feet then turned into hooves as she sprouted a long tail that was the same color as her hair with the exact same crimson highlights. Her ears stretched out and her face stretched into a snout as she gave a neigh. Once her transformation was complete, Maggie had turned into a 60ft tall white unicorn who had to weigh several tons had she been normal sized and sported a pair of H-cup (in scale) breasts.\u2028\u2028Jarrod looked in fear at his younger sister and the entire crowd shared that look of fear. \u201cGood grief.\u201d Said Darren in shock at his wife. Maggie herself looked all over her equine body and then gave a smile. \u201cI am Morgan Le Fay,\u201d she said completely in character as the woman she was cosplaying as. \u201cQueen of the witches.\u201d It was then she let out a laugh that sounded like...</span></div></div>",

I have become among the most powerful of mystical beasts!\u201d Maggie then reached down and tore a large tree out by the roots as everyone yelled and ran out of the way in fear. Maggie held up the tree and squeezed it. \u201cThe strongest elm is a twig in my hands!\u201d shouted Maggie right before she dropped the tree onto the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie then raised a hoof into the air and brought it down hard, creating a minor earthquake that forced the people on their knees. \u201cMy mere footsteps shake the mother Earth, crushing the largest mountains like anthills!\u201d Maggie waved her tail as several men dressed as knights held up their swords to her, but Maggie held her hand in the way, knowing full well that the swords weren\u2019t real weapons and flicked her fingers to knock the legion away. \u201cEntire armies are little more than swarms of insects to me.\u201d Maggie gave a sinister sounding neigh as she appeared to be growing even bigger and heavier than before. Both her husband and brother looked up in concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDarren,\u201d said Jarrod. \u201cWhere the hell did you get that medallion for Maggie\u2019s costume?\u201d \u201cOh, so now you remember my name, Jarrod!? I have no idea! I didn\u2019t buy that stupid necklace. Maggie bought it in some strange shop after she made the rest of the costume. It must\u2019ve been enchanted and it turned her into a unicorn. A giant unicorn. A fat giant unicorn. And now she\u2019s drunk with power.\u201d Everyone at the fair bowed down out of fear of the enormous unicorn\u2019s wrath as Maggie stopped growing. The unicorn woman had doubled in size and now had three chins with a 150ft wide belly and rear. The giantess sat her large and bloated ass down on the fair\u2019s castle, using it as an improvised throne as she smiled wickedly and her eyes continued to glow. She smiled fiendishly at those that were cowering below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That has got to be an illusion, right?\" asked one man dressed as a squire. \"Special effects?\" \"I don't think so,\" said a man pointing to the hoof mark that Maggie left in the ground. \"That's definitely a real giantess.\" \"The end of civilization is upon us. Now we will truly return to the dark ages.\" Maggie could feel everyone's fear and it made her feel powerful. She scratched her own fat belly as she looked down at the people she had conquered. \"Yes,\" said Maggie. \"Yes. Tremble, you cowards! You are nothing more than bugs at my feet! Fearful for your lives that can so easily be extinguished, should I see fit!\" Jarrod could not take his sister's madness any more and walked forward with his sword held out to confront the equine despot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie then noticed her brother approaching her hoof. \u201cMaggie,\u201d Jarrod said. \u201cEnough fooling around. Did your brain fail to grow with your body? You\u2019re acting like a maniac.\u201d Maggie then glared down at her brother right before she picked him up and squeezed him. Darren looked at his wife in pure fear. He may not have gotten along with his brother-in-law but this seemed too much. \u201cSilence, worm!\u201d yelled Maggie. \u201cI can easily devour you whole.\u201d Maggie held her brother over the abyss that was her mouth to prove her point as everyone gasped. Jarrod looked down in fear and Darren was biting his nails.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie then turned to the rest of the fair and smirked wickedly. \u201cPeople of Camelot,\u201d she said. \u201cThe age of Arthur is over. Morgan Le Fay is in charge now and I promise you, medieval is going to be a lot more evil. Take a good long look at the man or woman next to you. They could very easily die not long afterwards.\u201d The people were shivering as Maggie let out a very evil laugh. \u201cSomebody has gotten a little too into their role.\u201d Thought a woman dressed as a jester.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie kept laughing evilly right before her evil laugh degraded into a playful and uncontrolled chuckle. Everyone who had previously looked at the unicorn giantess in fear looked up again in pure confusion. Maggie held her bloated stomach in pain as she continued laughing and Jarrod looked at her in shock. \"Oh,\" said the unicorn. \"If I had kept that up, I'd bust a gut!\" Everyone stood back up as Maggie continued to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?! It was all an act!?\" \"Lady, you have a sick sense of humor!\" \"Are thou insane.\" Darren let out a sigh of relief. Maggie wasn't corrupted by her powers after all. She was just playing a prank. \"For crying out loud, Maggie!\" yelled an enraged Jarrod into his sister's oversized ear. \"You nearly gave me a heart attack there.\" Maggie continued to laugh and then coughed before she got up off of the castle that had been toppled by her colossal ass. She placed her brother on her shoulder before she picked up Darren and placed him on the other shoulder. \u201cPeople of Camelot,\u201d said Maggie. \u201cMorgan Le Fay is feeling merciful tonight. Let the merriment commence!\u201d Maggie let out a laugh as a couple of minstrels played music and the festivities resumed. Some of the fairgoers even laughed off the charade from minutes ago as Maggie gave a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarren crawled up and kissed his wife in the chubby cheek. \u201cYou really got them good, Honey. Even I was scared back there.\u201d \u201cNot as scared as King Arthur.\u201d Said Maggie tauntingly referring to her brother. Jarrod blushed in embarrassment. \u201cOkay, Maggie. You proved your point. I\u2019ll leave Darren alone. But did you have to scare the hell out of everyone like that?! I mean, I thought you were going to eat me!\u201d Maggie gave a scoff. \u201cWhat do I look like, a cannibal?\u201d Maggie then proceeded to devour an entire cart filled with caramel apples as Darren gave a worried look. \u201cUh, Maggie,\u201d he said as he climbed up and felt his wife\u2019s horn. \u201cDo you think you\u2019ll be turning back to normal anytime soon?\u201d Maggie let out a sigh. \u201cI don\u2019t know. If anything, I might be stuck as a bloated Godzilla-sized unicorn for the rest of my life. But we\u2019ll get used to it, Dear. For now, let\u2019s enjoy the faire.\u201d Maggie laughed again and Darren just shrugged his shoulders.</span></div></div>",

The knight held out his shield that had a scorpionfish\u2019s face on it and tried to deflect the raptor\u2019s fire. However, the raptor knocked the knight down with its claws and would\u2019ve finished him off had it not for interference from another player in the MMORPG. She was a humanoid were-panda who was dressed as a jiangshi. The panda woman cast a spell that shrunk the raptor down to size and the raptor gave a hiss before the panda woman tossed a fan that pixelated the creature. The panda woman then helped up the knight and smiled at him. \u201cThanks for the assist Juliet.\u201d Said the knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the real world, the knight was a nerdy looking boy with curly blonde hair and glasses and also in the real world, the panda sorceress was really an Asian girl with long reddish brown hair worn in an oriental bun and ponytail. \u201cThat\u2019s the seventh time this week I\u2019ve had to save your butt, Yuri. For someone called ForeverKnight you\u2019re not really invincible.\u201d Yuri and Juliet were a boyfriend and girlfriend who got together every night to play the MMORPG Waves of Infinity. Both had been playing since high school and since they went to different colleges, they used the game in order to stay in touch. Yuri was currently in Massachusetts while Juliet was in Montana. Yuri was a level 85 lich knight called ForeverKnight while Juliet was a level 100 werepanda sorceress called PanicButton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Yuri. \u201cThat\u2019s another win for PanicButton.

Be ready for me.\u201d Juliet typed up a smiling emoticon and would\u2019ve wrote more when she got an e-mail saying that she had a package waiting for her at the post office. \u201cOh, I\u2019ll be right back, Yuri I\u2019ve got a package at my campus\u2019s post office.\u201d Juliet let her computer in order to go out and find out what kind of package she received.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, Juliet returned to her dorm with her package. From the looks of it, it was a very small package. Juliet opened the package and then looked in surprise. They appeared to be a pair of earrings designed to look like golden and purple shoots of bamboo. \u201cOh my gosh.\u201d Juliet put the earrings on and took a photograph of herself with her phone before texting the message to Yuri. Back in Massachusetts, Yuri picked up his cellphone the moment he heard it ringing and saw Juliet wearing the earrings. \u201cOh my gosh!\u2019 yelled Yuri in shock. \u201cAre those.\u201d Juliet gave a giggle. \u201cThey are, they\u2019re real life versions of Longevity Bamboo Earrings, a very rare item in Waves of Infinity that only works for werepandas.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s amazing. Does it say who they\u2019re from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuliet just shook her head. \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cIn no way does it say where they came from or who sent them. The company must\u2019ve sent then to me as a reward for reaching level 100. I\u2019m keeping them.\u201d \u201cDo whatever you want, Juliet,\u201d said Yuri. \u201cYou can even wear them when I come to see you.\u201d Juliet shook her head but neither she nor Yuri noticed that her new earrings appeared to be glowing and her backside also appeared to be growing.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Yuri mumbled and then tried to think of the right word but then gasped because Juliet was now chewing on her bamboo plant that was next to her desk and then he saw that Juliet appeared to have sprouted fangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuliet let out a sigh and then she noticed her big belly. \u201cWell,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll admit that I\u2019ve gotten a little rounder but...\u201d Juliet tried to get out of its chair but she grumbled because for some reason, she couldn\u2019t get her booty out of her seat. \u201cOkay a lot rounder. But they don\u2019t serve a lot of healthy food in the college cafeteria so I would appreciate it if you cut me some slack... ah!\u201d Juliet fell back in her chair and there was a loud crash as she fell through the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuliet groaned as she got up and saw that she was indeed obese and naked. She looked and saw she had fallen into the dorm right below her own and then bit on her lip. \u201cThank goodness nobody\u2019s home. Suddenly Juliet grunted and she started to grow bigger and bigger as she gasped. She felt herself getting fatter as well and the ground cracked beneath her feet as she then sprouted fur. She sprouted white fur all over her torso and face and black fur grew all over her legs and arms and she even sprouted a big black tail as her ears turned rounded and black as well. She then gasped and then she saw her stomach bulge out right before a purple Chinese-style sorceress\u2019s dress appeared on her obese body as gold bracelets appeared on her left ankle and wrist and she obtained a Chinese-style tiara on her head. Juliet saw that she had transformed into a 17ft tall and 5 ton werepanda (or pandaren if you prefer). Her belly was 25ft wide with a 20ft wide butt and D-cup breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my gosh!\u201d yelled Juliet.\u201d \u201cEverything okay there, Juliet?\u201d asked a very worried Yuri, still on FaceTime. Juliet was horrified. Could she show and tell what happened to her to Yuri? Should she? The literal giant panda girl didn\u2019t know what to do.</span></div></div>",

I\u2019d like to make it to the craft fair before they close today!\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t rush perfection.\u201d Said Jean down to her husband. At that moment, the redhead was still applying her makeup in the bathroom and brushing her hair. \u201cGive me a break,\u201d moaned Hank. \u201cYou always take forever with your damned makeup.\u201d \u201cYou expect me to go out without preparing the perfect face?\u201d asked Jean. \u201cHold your lasagna. I\u2019m coming.\u201d Hank shook his head. The bottom line was that his wife was the vainest woman he had ever met. She made a peacock look modest. The reason they were going out was because Hank wanted to buy a painting at the art fair to cover an empty space on the wall in the living room. However, Jean made it difficult. She believed that she was the most beautiful thing in the house and didn\u2019t like anything that Hank chose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter twenty minutes, the young woman walked down to her husband who was trying to pass the time waiting by cleaning his sunglasses. \u201cJean,\u201d said Hank. \u201cYou always take too long.\u201d Jean then shook her hips and flipped her hair as she smirked. \u201cBut it\u2019s worth it in the end isn\u2019t it, Hanky? You know, if you had just painted a portrait of me to place over the couch, it would save you a lot of frustration. Nothing in that fair will even come close to my level of perfection.\u201d Hank rolled his eyes from behind his sunglasses. \u201cMom told me not to marry her,\u201d he thought to himself. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I listen?\u201d Hank then cleared his throat. \u201cCome on, Jean,\u201d he said. \u201cWe better get to the art show before all the good paintings are gone.\u201d The Morrows were almost out the front door when Hank noticed Jean wasn\u2019t following. \u201cJean?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s... oh no!\u201d Jean had paused in order to look in the mirror and tapped her chin. \u201cYou think I should go out in my red vest instead of this green one, Hank?\u201d Hank slapped himself in the face and even looked like he was going to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgainst all odds, Jean and Hank arrived at the co-op. Hank was looking for a suitable painting while Jean was busy with her eyebrows. Hank held up a painting that depicted mermaids in a hot air balloon and a whale with a heart tattoo. \u201cHow about this one, Jean?\u201d Jean gave a scoff. \u201cWhy would you want a painting of sirens when I\u2019m all the siren you\u2019ll ever need?\u201d Hank let out a sigh and put the painting down. \u201cYou know, Jean. You could take interest in the paintings.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve taken note of the selection of paintings, Hank,\u201d said Jean. \u201cIt\u2019s just that there isn\u2019t much there that catches my eyes. I\u2019m the most gorgeous thing around here.\u201d However, that was when Jean felt a tap on her back and turned around as she gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind her was a man in a metal face mask and green rags that made him look somewhat like a Dark Ages wizard. \u201cSo, you two are looking for a painting? I recommend the mermaid painting. It\u2019s the best work of art around here.\u201d \u201cEw!\u201d yelled Jean. \u201cGet lost. This is an art fair for crying out loud.\u201d Erlking gave a blush. \u201cI was just trying to\u2026\u201d Jean stepped back and swung her hand at Erlking in order to scare him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh,\u201d grunted Jean. \u201cThey\u2019ll let anyone in here.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you think you were a little hard on him?\u201d asked Hank. \u201cHe looked down on his luck.\u201d Jean let out a scoff. \u201cHank, there are only two reasons why anyone would wear a mask like that. One would be if he was a fugitive from the law but the more obvious explanation is that he\u2019s got a face that\u2019s meant for radio. He\u2019s gotta be drop dead ugly behind the mask.\u201d \u201cWell, he did look somewhat old. He might have been really handsome in the past. Take you for example. You\u2019ll be old one day and what makes you think your face will last forever.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean was about to say something to confront her husband on his choice of words but then she realized that Hank had a very valid point. She may be beautiful now, but she was more likely than not going to be an old woman one day and there was no guarantee that her beauty would last. \u201cI hate it when you\u2019re right, Hank,\u201d said Jean as she looked at herself in the mirror. \u201cThankfully I don\u2019t have to worry about that for a long, long time. But still, I wish there was a way to keep my face young and beautiful forever.\u201d Hank let out a laugh. \u201cWell, while you\u2019re waiting for the fountain of youth, I\u2019m going to see about what kind of painting to buy. After all, unlike a woman, a painting can stay beautiful forever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, what Jean and Hank didn\u2019t know was that Erlking had overheard them. \u201cI can do that,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s lucky I\u2019m not the kind to hold a grudge. Time to work some magic. 1, 2, spell me do. Let this woman\u2019s wish come true. Hear me loud, hear me well, let me be this spell!\u201d With that, Erlking vanished into a puff of smoke. At that moment, an artist was holding a painting up for Jean and Hank to inspect. It was colored in gray and looked distorted. Hank took a closer look. \u201cYou know, Jean, this painting reminds me of your sister.\u201d \u201cHa-ha.\u201d Laughed Jean sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Jean let out a scream of pure pain. \u201cJean?\u201d asked Hank. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong!?\u201d Hank saw that ashes seemed to be coming from Jean\u2019s body and Jean was in utter panic because it looked like she was disintegrating. However, as it turns out, as the ashes cleared, she was changing. Not only did she seem to be getting bigger and rounder, bright green feathers with black and white eye patterns like a peacock appeared all over her body as she sprouted a tail of bright green and white feathers. Her arms were turning into glowing wings that looked like they were on fire. Jean felt her chin sprouting a triple chin and then more ashes fell from her face and her mouth and nose stretched out into a golden beak as her legs turned into talons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank looked up as Jean spread her wings and revealed her transformation. She had transformed into a 100ft high phoenix with bright green feathers, a 135ft wide stomach, a 150ft ass with thick thunder thighs, a pair of E-cup breasts and a large 200ft wingspan. Hank stepped back as Jean nearly stepped on him and all spectators looked in shock and even snapped photographs. \u201cOh my gosh,\u201d said Hank in surprise. \u201cJean?!\u201d Jean felt her obese stomach and butt with her wings and then shook her long tail feathers as she shrieked. </span></div></div>",

Hank was greatly worried and was expecting his vein wife to freak out. \"Jean,\" said Hank. \"Stay calm. Please don't blow a fuse.\" Jean let out a shriek and held up her wings as they set themselves on fire. \"You expect me to stay calm?! Look at how FAT I am! And I'm naked!\" Hank slapped himself in the face for that remark. \"Really? <i>That's</i> what you're worried about!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean then looked at her ass that was 50ft wider than she was tall and then tapped it to make it shake. \"Hmm,\" she said. \"On second thought, big butts are all the rage today. I even hear bustles are coming back into style. And midriffs are in.\" Jean looked at her compact mirror but it was too small for her to even see the tip of her beak. She gave a scoff. \"It should be a crime to make hand mirrors this small.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean then grunted because Hank pulled out one of her tail feathers. The feather was three times bigger than he was and was so heavy that he could barely hold it up. \u201cJean! Your weight is the least of our concerns. You\u2019re a phoenix so big she could use Godzilla as a couch cushion.\u201d \u201cA phoenix?\u201d asked Jean. Then Jean gave a gasp and then broke out in laughter that made her breasts and belly shake. She even twirled around and forced everyone to get out of the way of falling feathers. \u201cJean?\u201d asked Hank in confusion. \u201cAre you feeling okay?\u201d Jean giggled and held her rear into the air and opened up her tail feathers as spectators looked in awe. \u201cI\u2019m feeling magnificent,\u201d said Jean. \u201cThis is the answer to my problems. You see, Hank, a phoenix is forever young. At the end of their life, they burn themselves to ashes and then rise again, as young and beautiful as ever. I\u2019ll never lose my beauty.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean laughed as Hank slapped himself in the face. \u201cUgh,\u201d he groaned. \u201cEven as a giant monster, she\u2019s as vain as ever.\u201d Jean then noticed several artists had gathered their easels and from the looks of it, they were intrigued to see such an enormous green phoenix. Jean smiled and then sat down as she flipped her hair and then stared down at the tiny humans with easels. \u201cWell,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat are you waiting for? You have a goddess in front of you. Let\u2019s see if you can capture my otherworldly beauty on canvas.\u201d Hank saw that everyone was getting out pencils, brushes and paint and he let out a sigh. Then he realized something. \u201cWait a minute,\u201d he said. \u201cWomen don\u2019t just turn into giant phoenixes Something must have happened to cause this.\u201d Then Hank noticed something. \u201cThe man in the mask. He must\u2019ve cast a spell on Jean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point, several artists had already begun to draw outlines for their phoenix paintings and Hank ran up to Jean\u2019s left butt cheek and tapped on it to get his enormous wife\u2019s attention. \u201cJean!\u201d he yelled. \u201cJean!\u201d Jean smirked down at her husband. \u201cLike what you see, Hank? Don\u2019t think I forgot about you wanting to buy a painting. I\u2019m doing you a favor. Whoever can make the best painting of the new me, that painting, you will be able to hang.\u201d \u201cJean! This is serious. I think you might be curse.\u201d Jean let out a laugh. \u201cI\u2019m 100ft tall and I\u2019m going to be beautiful forever. If this is a curse, I don\u2019t want it to be undone. I prefer to be a phoenix.\u201d \u201cBut Jean...\u201d Jean then lifted up her husband and brought him up to her beak. \u201cListen, Hanky,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m going to make myself perfectly clear. I am going to stay this way forever. I already got used to it, so I expect you to do so as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Hank could say another word, his giant, vain, avian wife, placed him between the feathery rolls of fat underneath her left breast. Hank grunted right before he was sandwiched by his own wife\u2019s fat. Outside, Jean continued to pose for the artists below. She even heard tapping and noticed somebody building a sculpture. Inside the walls of flesh, Hank crossed his arms. \u201cI am going to get that man,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s going to be impossible to live with from now on.\u201d Jean for her part continued to be the muse to the artists below. Some were already ready to get to work while others were trying to wrap their heads around what they were going to draw or paint. One painter was unhappy with her position in front of the phoenix's giant ass and decided to move her easel to get a better view of the giantess she was painting.</span></div></div>",

A meteor passed through Capricorn and was bathed in a strange star power. The meteor glowed as it was coming closer and closer towards the Earth and begun to break up before turning into a pure crystal shape of lapis before falling into an ocean below. This ocean was located in Hawaii and the meteor sank further and further down, releasing a strange energy into the water. The energy was so intense that all the surrounding fish chose to move out of the way and get as far away from the glowing meteorite chunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown on the ground at the time there was a beach in Hawaii and there was a blonde haired Hawaiian girl with a pink flower in her hair taking photographs as her boyfriend drove their car. The girl let out a laugh. \u201cThanks for taking me out to the beach for my photography class in college, Keone,\u201d said the girl. \u201cI need to take a few pics of the ocean life for my project.\u201d \u201cNo problem, Phoebe,\u201d said Keone. \u201cWhat better place to take photographs in Hawaii than the beach.\u201d As Keone pulled up the car, the beach was buzzing and there were dozens of beachgoers carrying surfboards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe just let out a whistle at what she saw. \u201cMan,\u201d she said. \u201cThere sure are a lot of surfers here today, Keone.\u201d Keone was taking out his own surfboard and was waxing it as he smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s a moon tide tonight, Phoebe. That means the water is higher than usual and in turn, the waves rise higher than usual. It\u2019s going to be awesome.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe then remembered something. \u201cKeone,\u201d she said. \u201cDid you see anything unusual in the sky last night at 1:12 in the morning?\u201d \u201cUh, no, Phoebe,\u201d said Keone. \u201cI was kind of asleep at the time.\u201d Phoebe let out a sigh. \u201cWell,\u201d she said. \u201cLast night, I saw the constellation for Capricorn, clearly visible in the sky. However, something strange passed by Capricorn. It looked like a meteor. Look.\u201d Phoebe held up her camera and showed an image of the very same meteor that had passed through Capricorn but because of the bright light, there was barely anything tangible in the photograph.\u201d Keone just looked at the photograph and then shook his head. \u201cPhoebe, Phoebe, Phoebe. This could be anything. You might have even been dreaming. Now, if I remember, your project is on the deep sea, not deep space. Let\u2019s just get you a rental camera and you\u2019ll be ready to make something beautiful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeone took Phoebe down to the rental shack and rented Phoebe a scuba suit with an underwater camera. \u201cI won\u2019t be gone for long, Keone,\u201d said Phoebe. \u201cI\u2019m just going to take a few photographs of what lies below and then I\u2019ll be ready to join you surfing.\u201d \u201cYou better,\u201d said Keone. \u201cWaves wait for no one. Good luck, Phoebe.\u201d With that, Phoebe kissed her boyfriend and then retreated into the water. As she swam down and begun to take photographs, that meteor from earlier was nearby and it was glowing bright.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She noticed that the very same meteor that passed through Capricorn had landed in the area and was letting lose a beam of light. Out of curiosity, she swam up to the meteor and wound up being bathed in its strange light. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d she asked herself. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing.\u201d Suddenly, Phoebe grunted and then she felt herself in pain and then she gasped because gills appeared to be forming on her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that time, Keone was still waiting for Phoebe. \u201cShe sure is taking long to take her photographs,\u201d said Keone to himself. \u201cThat isn\u2019t like Phoebe to stay underwater for so long. You\u2019d think she sprouted gills.\u201d Keone then spotted several surfers running to the water and paddling themselves out as a rather large wave was coming forward. \u201cWell,\u201d said Keone with a smile as he held up his surfboard. \u201cWaves wait for no one.\u201d Keone let out a giggle. \u201cMaybe if I\u2019m lucky I\u2019ll see Phoebe under the water.\u201d Keone ran towards the water and then started to paddle out as he saw the wave coming and stood on her surfboard. \u201cHere it comes.\u201d He said with pride. However, that was when the waves suddenly became more violent and intense and knocked several of the surfers out into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeone tried to handle himself on his surfboard, but because the waves were so violent and fast moving, he could barely stand and wound up slipping as he let out a yell and fell with a splash into the water. He wasn\u2019t the only one because the waves kept on coming and several more surfers slipped and fell. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d asked one young man. \u201cA tsunami?\u201d There was a loud noise that was a sonic boom from a megaphone. It was the lifeguard who was about to speak. \u201cAttention all beachgoers,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone leave the water immediately.\u201d Keone saw everyone leaving the water and then looked back to see several fish and sea creatures moving around the water in a panic. \u201cUsually when small fish get out of the way,\u201d said Keone in worry. \u201cIt usually means that there\u2019s a big fish about to rise up from underneath. And I\u2019m afraid of whatever that big fish is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut from the water arose a rather frightening looking creature. The creature was exactly 50ft tall with a 60ft wide belly, D-Cup breasts, thunder thighs as thick as bell buoys, a 75ft wide butt and an udder as big as her head. Her upper body resembled a bright orange-furred goat with large curvy black horns and gills on her neck with a white underbelly. However, from the lower body, although she did have hooves big enough to trample cars, her legs were covered in the scales and spines of a pufferfish, complete with fins. The goat creature also had Phoebe\u2019s hair with the flower in it and the same bird of paradise tattoo on her arm as the goat creature was screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the rest of the beachgoers were screaming and running the otherwise, Keone looked up and recognized the creature as his girlfriend and gasped. \u201cPhoebe!?\u201d Phoebe kept screaming as she looked all around her new form. She was now a giant and obese hybrid of a goat and a fish and as she stepped back she accidentally crushed a boat beneath her foot and she screamed. Keone walked out and this made Phoebe more nervous out of fear of crushing her boyfriend beneath her hooves. \u201cPhoebe,\u201d said Keone. \u201cDon\u2019t panic. I have no idea what\u2019s going on but...\u201d Phoebe yelled again and from the looks of it, she was going to panic.</span></div></div>",

Understand?\u201d Kitadai nodded his head and he and his gang ran off as Lorelei\u2019s husband picked up the destroyed book. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame,\u201d he said. \u201cNay, it\u2019s a crime. To ruin a perfectly good book just for kicks.\u201d Lorelei let out a sigh. \u201cThanks for chasing out those hoodlums, Bubba,\u201d said Lorelei. \u201cI wish I had your backbone.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t let those creeps push you around, Lorelei. People like that shouldn\u2019t even be allowed here.\u201d Lorelei let out a groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey,\u201d said Bubba. \u201cIt\u2019s not completely bad. You have me to keep the riffraff out.\u201d \u201cI wish I didn\u2019t have to rely on you,\u201d said Lorelei. \u201cWho\u2019d be able to protect the library with you working at that construction site?\u201d Bubba shrugged his shoulders. \u201cI could quit and become a guard. Listen, Lorelei, the thing about these vandals is that you need to show them who\u2019s the boss. You show them who the bigger person is and they\u2019ll leave you alone. Well, I\u2019m off to work now, Baby.\u201d Bubba and Lorelei shared a kiss before Bubba was walking away. \u201cHow a good day at work.\u201d \u201cAnd I hope you have a quiet day at the library. Remember. Anyone else gives you trouble, you show them who\u2019s boss.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApproaching the library at that time was one of Lorelei\u2019s best customers. He was a young golden brown haired man with a strange demon-shaped ring on his finger who was reading the book, Moby Dick, as he was eating a sugar donut. The young man spotted a little girl losing a balloon and then made his ring glow and the balloon floated back to the girl. He smiled to himself and was going to finish the donut in his hand when a skateboarder passed by him and caught him by surprise. The young man accidentally bit his finger but even though he didn\u2019t see it, he bled slightly on the book that he was carrying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the young man just shrugged his shoulders and sucked on his finger as he saw Bubba walking away to go to work. \u201cHey, Bubba.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d said Bubba uneasily. \u201cThere you are, Haruto. At least there\u2019s somebody who respects my wife and the library among teenagers. Why are you sucking your finger? That\u2019s so unattractive.\u201d \u201cI accidentally bit it when I was\u2026\u201d Bubba just stared at Haruto. \u201cAll I ever see you eat are donuts. You\u2019re gonna get sick one of these days. How come you never gain any weight?\u201d Haruto shrugged  his shoulders. \u201cIt\u2019s magic.\u201d Bubba stared at the young man and they both had a laugh at what Bubba hoped was a joke and then they walked away in different directions. \u201cSomething about that boy isn\u2019t right.\u201d Said Bubba. What Bubba didn\u2019t see was that Haruto\u2019s blood on the book appeared to be glowing as he returned to the library with his book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the library, Lorelei was at the front desk trying to organize books and trying to repair the book that the vandals struck a knife through before Haruto startled her by ringing the bell. Lorelei screamed and then turned to realize exactly who she was speaking with. \u201cOh,\u201d said Lorelei in surprise. \u201cHaruto. I didn\u2019t notice you there.\u201d Haruto then held up the book. \u201cI just came to return another good one.\u201d Lorelei smiled. \u201cI remember,\u201d she said. \u201cMoby Dick. The classics. So, will you be checking out any other books today, Haruto?\u201d \u201cNot today,\u201d said Haruto. \u201cI\u2019ve got a date with my girlfriend tonight.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t know you had a girlfriend. How exciting.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Haruto. \u201cIf we\u2019re lucky, we\u2019ll end up like you and Bubba. Well, see you later, Lorelei.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Haruto walked away, Lorelei decided to take the copy of Moby Dick and put it away. However, Haruto\u2019s glowing blood seemed to enchant the book as the librarian was taking it away.</span></div></div>",

Haruto had bleed on a page in the book. \u201cOh no,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd Haruto is usually so careful. I hate to fine him. He\u2019s my best client. Oh well.\u201d Lorelei then walked up to the adventure section of the library and walked down to where the books were kept in alphabetical order. She saw the M-N Aisle and walked inside as she was counting the books in a row. \u201cMoa\u2019s Last Day. Mobius Will. Oh, here we are, Moby Dick.\u201d However, the bookshelf was very high and Lorelei let out a sigh. She went to get a ladder in order to put the book back where it belonged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorelei took a few steps on the ladder but with each step, she appeared to have gotten heavy and failed to notice that he butt was now extremely swollen. By the time she was about to reach the top of the ladder, Lorelei slipped and fell because the ladder mysteriously broke and she screamed as she landed on her butt and made the ground shake. The floor even cracked underneath her huge rear. Several patrons of the library who were reading their books. The patrons looked to see Lorelei rubbing on her head before she gave a look of embarrassment and let out a nervous laugh. \u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m okay. Nothing\u2019s broken. Except the floor apparently. But that\u2019s weird. I\u2019m on a diet. Now calm down, Lorelei. Let\u2019s just put the book back on the shelf. However, this time, for some reason, Lorelei didn\u2019t need the ladder in order to reach the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d asked Lorelei. \u201cThat\u2019s really weird. Did I suddenly have a growth spurt?\u201d Lorelei rubbed her head and then felt something on her forehead. She gasped and then water appeared to leak out of what looked like a hole on her forehead. Lorelei was so shocked, she was turning pale, pale white. But then she realized that that wasn\u2019t entirely due to stress and started to laugh insanely as she tried to make heads or tails of what was happening to her. She tried to move out of the aisle between the bookshelves and then she saw that her butt had expanded to the point where she was completely stuck. \u201cI get it,\u201d said Lorelei trying to convince herself that nothing was wrong. \u201cI\u2019ve been working so hard. This is a dream. A very bad dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorelei tried to push her surprisingly much fatter body out of from between the book shelves but then she heard a ripping sound. \u201cLooks like my butt just ate my skirt.\u201d She sighed. However, it wasn\u2019t entirely the fault of the librarian\u2019s massive booty, but she had sprouted a large white tail like that of a sperm whale. Lorelei squeezed her way out and the patrons of the library looked at her in surprise. Lorelei looked down in just as much surprise because she saw that the patrons of the library were small enough for her to use as breath mints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, they weren\u2019t small, Lorelei was just really, really big. She was now laughing somewhat insanely while crying at the same time. \u201cThis is all just a dream,\u201d she said trying to convince herself that was nothing more than a nasty dream. \u201cNothing more than a bad, bad, bad, dream.\u201d Lorelei then bumped a bookshelf with her butt and turned around to stop the shelf from falling down. In the process she knocked down a table with her tail and made a girl reading a comic book scream. Lorelei then grunted and felt her face as it begun to stretch out into a long cylinder shape right before scars appeared all over her body and she grew bigger and fatter as barnacles appeared on her face and flabby arms. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a dream,\u201d said Lorelei as she adjusted her glasses and watched as webs appeared on her toes and fingers. \u201cThis is a nightmare!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the transformation was complete, Lorelei was a 60ft high pure white sperm whale with an 85ft belly and ass and D-cup breasts. She opened her mouth in horror and spotted her rather sharp teeth. \u201cWhat has happened?\u201d thought the titanic librarian to herself. \u201cWait until Bubba sees this. He\u2019ll have a heart attack when he finds out he\u2019s married to\u2026 Moby Dick! I\u2019ve somehow turned into Moby Dick. But how? Oh my gosh! Haruto\u2019s blood! Bubba was always convinced Haruto was a wizard. Looks like he was right. Something tells me he doesn\u2019t know how to turn me back though. What do I do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorelei was now faced with the fact that she was going to be stuck as a real life Moby Dick for the rest of her life. How will she react?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Our story starts where a dark-blonde haired girl in dark blue glasses is driving her car to the beach. Her name was Darcy and she hated the beach. One look at the ocean made her want to vomit. She had crippling hydrophobia and normally, she would never even think about going to the beach. However, her boyfriend, Riven had just gotten a job at the beach as a lifeguard. She let out a sigh as she walked forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarcy heard Riven blowing on his whistle. \u201cNo running on the beach!\u201d he yelled. \u201cHey! Stop! That\u2019s an easy way to drown someone, mister!\u201d Darcy let out a sigh. Her boyfriend\u2019s temper was as hot as ever. She almost dreaded walking up to congratulate him, but she summoned the courage and walked forward. \u201cHello, Riven.\u201d She said. Riven turned his head and then spotted his girlfriend. \u201cWell, well,\u201d he said. \u201cDarcy. I never thought that I would think to find you anywhere were there was water.\u201d Darcy just let out a grunt and crossed her arms. \u201cWell, Riven, I came to say congratulations on the job.\u201d Riven gave a smile. \u201cThanks. You know, if you knew how to swim, then you could be a lifeguard as well.\u201d But Darcy just let out a sarcastic laugh. \u201cI don\u2019t think so, Riven. Water and I don\u2019t mix. I\u2019m like oil. I don\u2019t go well with\u2026 AAAAAAAA!!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large beach ball landed in the water nearby and splashed Darcy, causing her to scream and crouch while sucking her thumb. All the beachgoers in the area laughed at Darcy and Riven shook his head at his girlfriend\u2019s fear of water. \u201cGeez, Darcy,\u201d he said. \u201cNow that\u2019s just sad. You\u2019ve been running in fear of water for 15 years. I mean, when was the last time you bathed?\u201d Darcy blushed and ran off as everyone was laughing at her. \u201cI\u2019ll show that jerk,\u201d thought Darcy to herself. \u201cI\u2019ll show all of those jerks. But how? Just the thought of water makes me sick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Darcy was trying to figure out what she was going to do, she heard somebody yelling. \u201cCome on! Come on! It\u2019s gotta be a whopper!\u201d Darcy turned her head and then she spotted up ahead, something really strange. It was a man in green rags and a metal mask who appeared to be trying to fish from the side of a cliff overlooking the water. \u201cYou\u2019re not getting away, you whopper! You\u2019re gonna be Erlking\u2019s dinner!\u201d Erlking kept trying to reel his line in when he heard Darcy\u2019s footprints and while he was distracted, his line snapped. Erlking would\u2019ve fallen into the water, but Darcy grabbed a hold of him in order to stop him from falling but they both fell back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, ratzafratz!\u201d yelled Erlking. \u201cMy dinner got away.\u201d Darcy shivered. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you could possibly eat fish. Anything that comes out of the ocean has got to be nasty.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll take your word for it, young lady,\u201d said Erlking. \u201cAfter all, I read somewhere that humanity\u2019s ancestors crawled out of the sea.\u201d Erlking\u2019s stomach then growled, and Darcy soon found herself buying the strange man some fried clams. \u201cThank you,\u201d said Erlking. \u201cI guess I\u2019m going to have to find some more string if I\u2019m going to have a fish dinner for tomorrow, but this will last me through the night.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t look like somebody who eats often,\u201d said Darcy. \u201cWho are you?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m Erlking. A wandering wishgranter.\u201d \u201cWishes?\u201d asked Darcy. \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as somebody who grants wishes.\u201d Erlking shrugged his shoulders. \u201cYou know what they say: if wishes were fishes, we\u2019d all have something to eat. And we would.\u201d Darcy just continued to shiver. \u201cI really wish you wouldn\u2019t use fish as a euphemism. I hate fish. In fact, I hate the ocean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErlking raised an eyebrow. Darcy let out a sigh. \u201cI almost drowned during a storm when I was a kid and since then I\u2019ve been too terrified to even step foot on anywhere that\u2019s near a large body of water.\u201d Erlking nodded his head a few times. \u201cThat\u2019s completely understandable.\u201d Darcy let out a scoff. \u201cTell that to my asshole boyfriend. Riven just became a lifeguard and he won\u2019t let me forget about my fear. You know, Erlking. If you really are a wishgranter, then please grant me this wish. I wish that I was no longer afraid of water.\u201d Erlking nodded his head. \u201cYou fed me, so I\u2019ll just do it. Step aside.\u201d Darcy did just that as Erlking was ready to cast a spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI say, 1, 2, spell me do,\u201d chanted Erlking. \u201cLet this lady\u2019s wish come true. Here me high, hear me well, let me be this spell.\u201d Suddenly a strange raincloud appeared over Darcy and Darcy yelled and ducked as the rain came down on her and was even trembling in place as the rain came down on top of her. As Darcy was mumbling, the rain begun to glow and the cloud fizzled away just as the same thing happened to Erlking. Darcy stood up and saw that she was now surprisingly dry. She then shivered and held herself tight. \u201cIf that\u2019s your idea of trying to cure my fears, Erlking,\u201d she said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t work. That was horrifying.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarcy shivered and then begun to walk away again. However, as Darcy was walking off, she didn\u2019t notice that fish scales were growing on her butt.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She saw Riven in the lifeguard tower and Riven held down his sunglasses as he looked at his girlfriend and gave a mocking laugh. \u201cAren\u2019t you a glutton for punishment, Darc.\u201d Darcy just gave a glare and shivered. She was walking towards the ocean but then she remembered all the strange creatures in the water. The thought of being in the same water as sharks, eels, octopi and stingrays frightened her. Then Riven tapped Darcy on the back. \u201cYou know,\u201d Riven said. \u201cIt kind of helps if you know how to swim.\u201d Darcy let out a grumble and then started to step back right before Riven held onto her. \u201cCome on, Darcy,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve come too far to turn back now. I can teach you.\u201d Darcy grunted in Riven\u2019s grip but then Riven yelled as he felt her ass. \u201cGeez, Darcy. Did you sit on ice cubes or something? Your ass feels like a fish out of a lake.\u201d Darcy grunted and then gave a glare at Riven but gasped and looked down to see scales had appeared on her butt. \u201cOh no.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarcy got on her knees and then she grunted as her legs started to merge together as Riven looked in surprise. \u201cDarc?\u201d he asked. Darcy grunted as her legs merged together into the tail of a dark blue colored whale shark with white spots all over it. Darcy let out a scream and she started to get bigger and bigger as fins appeared on the sides of her head and her teeth became really sharp. She held up her hands to see that they had sprouted webs. \u201cHelp, me!\u201d she yelled. All the lifeguards ran forward and saw Darcy grow into a huge 65ft tall (or long given she was flat on the ground) mermaid with an 80ft wide stomach and 75ft wide tail (being a mermaid she didn\u2019t have anything resembling an ass).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiven ran up in shock at his girlfriend as well as a crowd of beach going spectators. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d asked one of them. \u201cA beached whale?\u201d \u201cA beached whale with blonde hair.\u201d \u201cI think we\u2019re looking at a mermaid. \u201cThat\u2019s what a mermaid looks like? I thought they\u2019d be smaller.\u201d \u201cHey, different fish come in different sizes, so why not mermaids.\u201d \u201cShe looks bigger than the princess mermaid.\u201d \u201cThis I\u2019ve got to take a photograph of.\u201d One young man even leaned up against Darcy\u2019s bloated tail to snap a selfie while another sat on one of her boobs. \u201cCut that out!\u201d yelled the mermaid giantess as she helplessly tried to flop around. This only caused people to take more photographs as Darcy gave an angry hiss and showed her sharp teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiven then decided to run up and wave his arms to defend his girlfriend from oogling onlookers. \u201cYou get out of the way!\u201d he yelled. \u201cHow would you like it if I stared at your giant mutated girlfriend.\u201d Everyone stepped back as Darcy groaned. \u201cDarcy,\u201d said Riven. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d Darcy let out a groan as she flopped about. \u201cIf you must know,\u201d she said. \u201cI made a wish to a creepy old man who told me that he could cure my hydrophobia. And to do so, he turned me into a creature that can\u2019t survive outside of water. Dammit. So literal. When I see that Erlking again I\u2019m going to\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n But then Darcy grunted because she could barely move. She was a literally fish out of water and was flopping helplessly on the beach. \u201cDarcy,\u201d said Riven. \u201cNeed some help? I mean, you probably weight 1,000,000lbs right now and you don\u2019t have legs, so maybe\u2026\u201d Darcy was struggling as she moved slowly forward. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she groaned. \u201cI just need to inch myself to the water and\u2026\u201d \u201cI\u2019m afraid you might need some help, you stubborn fish.

Almost instantly, Darcy became very exhausted and was panting heavily as Riven walked up to his girlfriend\u2019s double-chinned face. \u201cDarcy,\u201d said Riven. \u201cThere\u2019s no way that you\u2019ll be able to get into the water all by yourself. If you were a skinnier mermaid it wouldn\u2019t be a problem, but the fact is that you\u2019re basically a beached whale.\u201d Darcy shot a glare at Riven and tried to grab her boyfriend but he was out of reach and she was way too bloated to so much as move and as a result let out a pout. \u201cWell, that\u2019s just great. Stupid Erlking. When I get my hands on him.\u201d \u201cUh, Darcy,\u201d said Riven to his enormous girlfriend. \u201cIf you\u2019ll pardon the expression, you have bigger fish to fry at the moment.\u201d Darcy just gives a glare. She clearly did not appreciate Riven\u2019s questionable choice of words. \u201cI\u2019m serious, Darcy,\u201d said Riven. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get you in the water soon, you\u2019re going to die.\u201d Darcy let out a moan because Riven was absolutely right. Without taking her immobilizing bulk into consideration, she was still a mermaid and therefore would be unable to move on land anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Riven called the national seashore and they brought a crane in order to try and carry the giant and obese mermaid into the water. Darcy was grunting in pain because several buff men were attempting to push her into the tarp laid out to carry her into the water. One of the agents shook his head. \u201cI hate it when whales wash up on shore. If you called us any later than you did, it could\u2019ve been too late.\u201d \u201cWhale?\u201d asked Riven. \u201cThat is my fianc\u00e9e.\u201d The national seashore agent just looked in disbelief. \u201cYou\u2019re engaged to a whale? That\u2019s really depraved.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s not a whale you idiot! She was human this morning, but for some reason, she was transmogrified into a giant mermaid.\u201d \u201cMermaid? That\u2019s ridiculous. Mermaids aren\u2019t real.\u201d \u201cWhat do you call me then, asshole?!\u201d yelled a very annoyed Darcy. \u201cHow many whales do you see with sunglasses and long blonde hair.\u201d The seashore agent dropped his jaw. \u201cWe better get out of the way.\u201d Said Riven. Riven grabbed the agent and pulled him out of the way as the muscle team managed to budge Darcy and roll her on her back as she grunt and landed with a loud \u201cBOOM!\u201d. \u201cShe\u2019s in the net, Charlie!\u201d yelled one of the men. \u201cPull away.\u201d The man in the crane pulled a lever and grunted. It took minutes before the crane could lift Darcy, simply because she was that heavy. The mermaid titaness could only blush and moan. \u201cThis is SO humiliating,\u201d she complained. \u201cThis is not doing good for my self-esteem.\u201d The crane drove forward as more spectators watched and took photographs. \u201cEverybody who took a picture of me,\u201d said Darcy as she grit her sharp teeth. \u201cHad better stay out of the water. You do not want to piss off a mermaid the size and ten times the weight of an ocean liner.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crane then lowered Darcy into the water as she slipped out and then she let out a loud scream as the water touched her and flipped about, creating large waves that splashed everybody and made them run back, all except for two surfers of questionable intelligence who ran into the rising waves. \u201cOutrageous!\u201d \u201cDude, that fat mermaid chick is great to have around for surfing!\u201d Darcy\u2019s frenzied movements created several intense tsunamis as the agent from the national seashore looked in surprise. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong now?\u201d he asked. Riven blushed in embarrassment. \u201cDarcy is kind of hydrophobic.\u201d \u201cHydrophobic?! How can a creature that can\u2019t survive outside of the water possibly be afraid of it?\u201d Riven let out a sigh. \u201cAs a child,\u201d he said. \u201cBack when she was human, she and her folks went on a boat ride when a storm broke out. Darcy fell out of the boat and nearly drowned. She\u2019s been scared to death of the ocean since. She told me she made a wish to cure herself of this problem, but if anything it\u2019s gotten worse.\u201d Riven then had to plug his ears as Darcy screamed loudly. \u201cI hate water! I hate water! I HATE water!\u201d Darcy\u2019s tantrum created a large whirlpool that sucked the two idiot surfers in and made them fall off of their boards with a yell. Darcy then flapped her tail to slap the surfer\u2019s out of the water and back on the beach. Both of them got up and spat out some sand before smiling. \u201cThat was outrageous!\u201d the surfers yelled as they gave each other a high five.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarcy was shivering as she swam through the water rather clumsily and was becoming more and more distant from the beach with every swing of her large and obese tail. \u201cWhat is she doing now?\u201d asked the seashore agent. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that she can\u2019t swim either.\u201d Riven blushed in pure embarrassment at his girlfriend\u2019s hysteric behavior. \u201cI\u2019d better go after her,\u201d Riven said. \u201cWho knows what trouble she\u2019ll get into?\u201d Riven immediately ran off to the lifeguard station and got on his wave bike before revving it up. It was probably not the most ideal vehicle to chase after an enormous fish woman, but it wasn\u2019t as if time was on his side. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Darcy. Riven\u2019s coming.\u201d Riven took off as he went to search for Darcy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarcy at the time was far out as she was swimming through the waves as she was shivering and shaking. \u201cThis is a feeling that I never wanted to feel ever again.\u201d Darcy was remembering the night of that terrible storm and could hear herself screaming and her father calling for her. \u201cDarcy! Stay where you are! Hold on!\u201d In the present day, the mermaid was so stressed out that she looked like she would vomit and was shaking in place as her blubber appeared to be floating. Darcy let out a groan. \u201cNot enough that I was turned into a mermaid but I\u2019m also so fat that I could probably be mistaken for an island. Darcy then felt something pressing against her and she grunted. It was an enormous blue whale that was nudging against her tail and rubbing against her. Darcy let out a scream. \u201cHey! Hey! Hey! I\u2019m not a whale! I\u2019m a whale shark and I\u2019m a mermaid! And I\u2019m engaged!\u201d The whale swam away as Darcy was shooing it. \u201cOh damn,\u201d said the giantess. \u201cI am engaged. But to somebody small enough to live in my belly button. How is that going to work? Hell, I don\u2019t even know if we\u2019ll be able to have... Oh good grief. Our children would be part fish.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarcy let out a sigh and then swam down to rest on a coral reef. \u201cMaybe I should break up with Riven. After all, how would we make this work? I can\u2019t live outside of the water and he can\u2019t breathe underwater like I can now. Maybe out there somewhere there\u2019s a giant sumo merman under the same spell.\u201d Darcy then heard a rumbling. \u201cWhat is that?! A tsunami? Riptide! Waterspout!\u201d Darcy then looked down to see the rumbling was coming from her rather large stomach. \u201cOh man,\u201d she said. \u201cI need something to eat.\u201d Darcy then saw a giant squid swim by and licked her lips. \u201cYum,\u201d she said. \u201cCalimari.\u201d Darcy licked her lips and swam towards the squid with her mouth opened wide. Above the surface, as Darcy rose, she was slurping up the squid\u2019s tentacles as her belly got even bigger and she appeared to grow huger as well, to the point where her shirt was finally destroyed and her breasts were free. The giant mermaid was now 100ft tall with a 150ft wide stomach and tail. She let out a large belch as she rubbed her stomach to digest the squid. \u201cDelicious,\u201d she said. \u201cAlthough squid always gives me gas.\u201d Darcy gave another belch as she was swimming forward. \u201cHmm,\u201d said Darcy. \u201cOkay. Maybe I don\u2019t have to be afraid of water. Hell, since I\u2019ve been turned into a giant fat mermaid, I better get used to the ocean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as Darcy was swimming, there was a yacht nearby and at the bow there was a sleazy looking man in a Hawaiian shirt who looked like he was in his late 30s and was on his cellphone. \u201cI know attendance to the aquarium has been at an all time low. The cretins are  just too stupid to care about the different types of fish. If we\u2019re going to increase traffic we need something big. Something nobody has seen before. I don\u2019t know! The ocean is filled with several strange creatures. Vampire squids, oarfish... What do you mean? Alright, so nobody has been able to catch an oarfish and keep it alive, but just you wait, I\u2019ll find...\u201d Before the man could finish talking, he spotted Darcy breaching in the distance. The man in the yacht looked in surprise and then put on as he watched Darcy moving around in the water. \"A mermaid?!\" yelled the man in the yacht. \"An overweight mermaid from the looks of it! I better check this out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Riven was still on his wave bike and was looking for Darcy. \"Man,\" he said. \"How can a giant mermaid with a titanic gut just disappear.\" Riven saw an island in the distance and then parked his wave bike next to the island before he took a closer look. The island looked small and devoid of any form of life. \"Perhaps I can get a better idea where she is from this island. Riven climbed the island and felt that the ground was surprisingly soft. \"What the?\" Riven the stepped on something soft and round and saw a second island next to the one he climbed up. That was when he realized the \"islands\" were Darcy's breasts just as the chubby face of his mermaid girlfriend surfaced, as did her massive stomach that dwarfed her breasts. Darcy smiled at her tiny boyfriend. \"Hi, Riven,\" the mermaid giantess said. \"Fancy seeing you here.\" Darcy then lowered her head to Riven's level to give him a large kiss. But in the process, Riven screamed as he was sucked into the mermaid's mouth. Inside Darcy's mouth, Riven saw teeth as big as trucks and fish flopping around on the tongue right before Darcy spat him out. \"What the heck, Darcy?!\" Darcy just gave a blush. \"My bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Darcy heard something coming and turned to see a rather large boat. It was....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was never a dull moment in the Helder residence. For one, the patriarch of the family, Steve Helder, was a novelist who was brainstorming his latest novel as he stood at his laptop. \u201cZombies are too overused these days,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re even turning that wholesome book about that small town from the 1950s into a zombie apocalypse fiction. Perhaps I could jump on that train, but that would be too predictable. I know, I\u2019ll make a werecreature story. I even know how to open it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve immediately went to work as his son, Verne walked up behind him. \u201cUh-oh,\u201d thought Verne. \u201cHe\u2019s gonna do something weird again, I just know it.\u201d \u201cOur story begins in the middle ages in Ireland. Here, we follow the story of the beautiful princess, Wendy Wallflower as she is transformed into a creature of the night. This is the tale of Princess Were\u2026\u201d Steve stopped to think before he noticed his teenage son behind him. \u201cVerne,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat animals haven\u2019t been getting much attention as werecreatures and are native to Ireland?\u201d \u201cUh, I dunno. Beavers, boars, seals\u2026\u201d \u201cPerfect. Princess Wereseal. This is gonna be great. Thanks, Verne.\u201d As Steve kept writing, Verne shook his head. \u201cI wonder what mom\u2019s doing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turned out, Steve Helder had a wife named Wendy just like the character in his story, only she wasn\u2019t a princess, she was a scientist and arguably a mad one, she was working in her lab on several unusual chemical elixirs. \u201cJust a little more.\u201d Steve and Wendy\u2019s child daughter, Rosalind was looking around the corner to see her mother at work. \u201cWhat are you doing, Mom?\u201d Wendy gave a smile. \u201cHi, Rosalind. I\u2019m finally perfecting Warmblood No. 11. You remember, that lotion that would allow humans to survive in cold temperatures without having to wear tons of ridiculous clothing.\u201d Rosalind looked outside to see it was snowing. \u201cYou chose a perfect day to continue work, Mom, but who are you going to get to test that junk out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy let out a laugh. \u201cWell that\u2019s where I come in.\u201d Rosalind looked at her mother in pure surprise. \u201cMom?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou\u2019re not seriously going to use yourself as a test subject?\u201d Rosalind then poured some of her concoction onto herself and rubbed it all over her skin as she took off her lab coat. \u201cWell, what choice do I have, Rosalind? I don\u2019t have any other options. Oh, darn, I\u2019m out of nitro glycerin. Looks like I\u2019m going to have to stop at the store. You and your brother stay out of the lab while I\u2019m away, okay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Wendy was getting ready to run her errands, Steve was still working on his story. \u201cThe princess set off on a quest to retrieve the stones of red fire that have protected her kingdom for ages,\u201d said Steve. \u201cShe said farewell to her beloved right before she set off on the quest.\u201d As Wendy was walking out, she stops to kiss Steve. \u201cI\u2019m off to the store, Steve. Good luck with your writing.\u201d Of course, Steve was so immersed in his work that he was completely oblivious as to what his wife had just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve was writing up a storm while Wendy was busy with the groceries. \u201cThe princess eventually came upon an old witch sore in the head with a rather painful hangover.\u201d At that exact moment, Wendy was walking out of the store with her groceries when she noticed an old woman with a crooked nose and a wart-covered cheek. She was dressed in black with striped stockings and a flower in her hat. In other words, she looked almost EXACTLY like a witch. She was moaning and from the looks of it. She was hungover.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d said Wendy as she snapped her fingers. \u201cSounds like a perfect chance to test out those hangover pills I\u2019ve been working on. Excuse me, ma\u2019am.\u201d Surprisingly Wendy\u2019s misadventure was going much like in Steve\u2019s story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve continued to write as Verne was overseeing him. \u201cSeeing the witch in such a state,\u201d said Steve as he continued to write. \u201cThe princess offered her a potion that instantly cured her. As thanks, the witch cast a spell on the princess so that she would turn into a great beast that would ward off evil spirits. A wereseal.\u201d Verne raised an eyebrow at what his father was writing. \u201cOkay,\u201d said Verne. \u201cProbably not the weirdest thing you\u2019ve ever wrote, Dad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd the spell,\u201d said Steve. \u201cWould see to it that she would turn into a wereseal whenever there is a full moon. Hmm, full moon. That sounds too clich\u00e9. Aha. I know the perfect twist. She would become a wereseal every time there was a full moon on Jupiter.\u201d \u201cJupiter?\u201d asked Verne. \u201cBut, Dad, there are 63 moons on Jupiter.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s where the twist comes in,\u201d said Steve. \u201cWith 63 moons, there will be a greater chance of the full moon.\u201d At that time, Wendy, not aware of her husband\u2019s writing was walking back into her car, not realizing that her face was changing form and her nose now resembled that of an elephant seal\u2019s. She had also gotten noticeably fatter and taller and had a huge blubbery tail like that of a seal. Jupiter was in the sky overhead as the snow was coming down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe simply took her groceries into the car and started to drive off, not even noticing in the rearview mirror that she was turning into a giant and obese selkie. \u201cIt would appear that the Warmblood No. 11 formula works perfectly. I haven\u2019t felt a chill since I came from home. I wonder how Steve\u2019s novel is coming along.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Back at the Helder residence, Steve was still trying to think of what to type. \u201c63 full moons. Perhaps Verne was onto something. This is gonna be tough to beat. Aha. Princess Wereseal herself did not believe in the witch\u2019s blessing and shrugged it off, not realizing that she was slowly turning into a wereseal, a type of Fay. However, the witch\u2019s drunken state meant that she had not thought her magical spell all the way through. The princess retrieved the red fire stones only for her steed to collapse under her much bigger form as she was starting to walk back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Wendy, now an elephant seal-based wereseal had car trouble for her car broke down under her weight. The seal woman, still oblivious to what she had transformed into, waddled out of the vehicle and inspected the damage. \u201cOh, damn. My car just died. Oh well, I\u2019ve had this car since I was a teenager. Guess it\u2019s time to junk it. I\u2019ll just call a tow truck.\u201d While Wendy was talking on the phone, there was a middle-eastern man driving down the street with a truck filled with carpets. At home, Steve was further typing his story. \u201cFortunately for the princess, a genie appeared on a flying carpet and offered to return her to her kingdom. The dragon who watched over the Fire Mountains was about to open his eye and the genie was afraid that the dangerous creature would see an intruder in his mountain range.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe carpet salesman saw Wendy in the street and was slightly surprised to see a large wereseal, but for whatever reason, he decided not to question it. \"Hey, Lady, need a lift.\" Wendy gave a smile. \"That's very neighborly of you.\" Wendy squeezed her huge body into the truck, not realizing that she was taking up a lot of room and her blubbery body was pressing against him. \"There's got to be a hidden camera around here somewhere,\" said the carpet salesman. \"Uh. It must be nice to have such a thick suit in this cold weather.\" Wendy was confused and then came to the wrong conclusion. \"Oh, you mean my lab coat? Actually my secret is that I'm testing out a special formula that will allow us to survive in the cold without having to bundle up.\" \"Well,\" said the salesman. \"I think it worked better than you thought.\" The salesman begun to think to himself. \"Oh boy,\" he groaned. \"That's gotta be the sixth mad scientist I've picked up all week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack home, Verne and Rosalind were watching television when they saw a news report. \"There have been reports of a giant snapping turtle-like monster spotted in the San Francisco area. Local pizzeria denies involvement with this alleged creature.\" Said the anchorwoman on the television. Verne rolled his eyes. \"A giant snapping turtle created by magic pizza,\" he said. \"Maybe Dad should write about that next when he's done with <i>Princess Wereseal</i>.\" \"Get a life, Bro,\" said Rosalind. \"It's been done. Hmm. Mommy's been gone longer than usual.\" \"You said that she went to buy nitro glycerin from the store,\" said Verne. \"She can't be speeding down the street with nitro in her shopping bag. That's asking for trouble.\" Verne and Rosalind then heard the sound of the carpet salesman's truck and walked to investigate. They were surprised to see a truck carrying carpets near the driveway. \"Did Dad buy a new carpet?\" asked Rosalind. Verne shrugged his shoulders. \"I guess. Maybe it's inspiration for the <i>Department of Flying Carpets</i>. He's been putting that story off for some time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kids walked out and then they looked in surprise as their mother came out of the car. They looked up to see that the wereseal woman was now 20ft tall with an 18ft wide and 20ft wide tail and a 30ft wide belly. The kids looked up and recognized their mother's red hair on what initially appeared as an enormous elephant seal. \"Mom?\" asked Verne in surprise. Wendy still hadn't noticed her transformation as she waddled up towards the house and waved to the carpet salesman. \"Thanks for the ride!\" yelled the seal woman. The carpet salesman waved and drove away before he took out his cell phone to speak with his wife. \"Rihana. You're never going to guess who I drove home this time. Yeah, the samurai was the weirdest one, but this one puts him to shame.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy was waddling blissfully up to the steps of her house where her children were waiting for her and were looking up at her in surprise due to her rather unusual appearance. \"Hi, kids,\" said Wendy. \"What are you two doing outside dressed like that? You'll catch your death of cold. And no, I'm not going to inject either of you with Warmblood No. 11 until I'm sure I've got the bugs out of it.\" \"Uh,\" said Verne. \"Mom. Have you noticed something different about yourself today?\" Wendy didn't know what her son meant, but she decided to humor him and reached into her now much larger cleavage to take out a makeup mirror and then she looked into the mirror in order to see what Verne meant. As she looked in the mirror she screamed. \"Oh my gosh. That formula of mine got rid of my freckles. What a weird side-effect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVerne and Rosalind were completely dumbfounded. \"Really?\" asked Rosalind. \"That's all you notice.\" Wendy raised an eyebrow in confusion oblivious to the fact that she was A) a wereseal, B) as big as a tree and C) Morbidly obese. \"What else is there to notice.\" Rosalind would've said something but her brother covered her mouth before she could utter a single word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget it, Rosalind,\" he said. \"Our folks are too eccentric to notice a thing like this. Uh, Mom, did anything unusual happen on the way home?\" Wendy shrugged her shoulders. \"Unusual?\" she asked. \"I don't know what you mean by that, Verne. Well, along the way, I did encounter an old woman who was hungover and gave her my new hangover cure I've been working on.\" \"Old woman?\" asked Verne. \"Hangover? What did this woman look like.\" \"My, you're curious today. Well, she wore black with orange and yellow striped stockings and a pointed hat with a flower in it. She had thin gray hair and a long nose that was covered in warts. Now that I think about it, she looked a lot like a witch. Not that there are such things. Except in your father's stories. Now get inside, it's too cold out here for kids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Helder kids didn't know what else to do, so they followed their wereseal mom as she squeezed her enormous bulk through the doorway. Of course, Wendy had a little trouble getting through and Rosalind and Verne had to push her tail in. \"Wendy,\" muttered Wendy to herself. \"Not to yourself. Don't try to take all the groceries in at once.\" As Wendy walked away with the groceries, her son and daughter were trying to figure out what was going on. \"This can't be happening,\" said Verne. \"Moms don't just turn into giant elephant seals. I wonder if it has anything to do with...\" Rosalind gasped. \"Oh my gosh,\" she said. \"Warmblood No. 11. It must've had the side effect of turning people into big fat seals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVerne who had no idea of the formula his mother was testing out, was somewhat confused. \u201cWhat are you talking about, Rosalind?\u201d asked Verne. \u201cMommy was testing out one of her formulas in the laboratory and it was designed to make it so people could survive in the cold without...\u201d \u201cRosalind,\u201d said Verne. \u201cThose experiments aren\u2019t actually possible in real life. At least I don\u2019t think so. Wait. Dad was writing a story where a witch blessed a princess with the power to turn into a wereseal.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a blessing?\u201d asked a very confused Rosalind.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t ask me to explain Dad\u2019s train of thought. This is the same man who wrote an <i>Orangutang\u2019s Autobiography</i>. But my point is that what happened to Mom sounds exactly like what\u2019s going on in Dad\u2019s story.\u201d \u201cNow you\u2019re the one being ridiculous, Verne. How can Daddy\u2019s story be capable of doing something like this?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. That\u2019s a new laptop. Perhaps it\u2019s radioactive. Then again, I saw him taking medicine for his insomnia. I saw a TV show one time where a cartoonist took strange fertility pills and brought his comics to life.\u201d Rosalind looked at her brother as if he was insane. \u201cReally?\u201d \u201cHey,\u201d said Verne. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t happen every day. She could\u2019ve been the descendant of a seal god, could\u2019ve been bitten by a radioactive seal, what do you want me to tell you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Steve was typing as Wendy was in the hallway waddling by. \u201cAs the princess was moving through the castle hallway, there was a sudden quake that knocked loose the Jar of Mischief, an ancient container build to contain the ancient sprites of chaos who would seek to cause the most bizarre calamities to arise.\u201d Sure enough as Steve typed those words, Wendy moved throughout the hallway and her big bulky body pushed against a table and caused a vase to fall and crash. \u201cOh, darn,\u201d groaned Wendy. Not Grandma\u2019s vase. Maybe I can glue it back together.\u201d \u201cThe Princess was in anguish as the jar was destroyed for the kingdom\u2019s most insane enemies were released onto the world and their wicked ways would rear their ugly heads.\u201d As Steve typed this, Wendy picked up the pieces of the vase and put them in their pocket before waddling up to her husband and kissed him on the side of his head. \"Hard at work I see.\" Steve let out a sigh. \"I might have written my weirdest and best story ever, Wendy. But I'm having trouble continuing it. How goes Warmblood No. 11?\" Wendy smiled. \"It's working out fine. I haven't felt a chill since I got home. But it did get rid of my freckles.\" \"Hey,\" said Steve. \"It's no big deal. Good luck perfecting the formula.\" \"Good luck with your story,\" said Wendy. \"It looks good so far.\" Steve smiled at that before his seal wife was waddling away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the process, Steve saw the elephant seal shaped shadow and turned his head and realized that his wife had transformed. How does he react?</span></div></div>",

She\u2019s been working hard in the lab all day and doesn\u2019t need any disturbances. She\u2019s been working on that formula for a long time and she might have perfected it. Aha. I just had an idea. On her travels, the wereseal princess stopped at one point to bath underneath a waterfall. But what she didn\u2019t know was that the mystical waters induced rapid aging.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Steve was busy at his computer, Wendy had taken off her clothes and the giantess seal squeezed into the shower. \u201cUgh,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to get all these nasty chemicals off of me.\u201d Wendy turned on the shower and was scrubbing her thick leathery body as she hummed to herself, still blissfully unaware that she was an enormous elephant seal. After the shower was over, Wendy turned it off and then grabbed a towel. As Wendy was squeezing out of the shower, the wereseal saw her face in the mirror and screamed. \u201cIs that a gray hair?\u201d she asked. \u201cOh no! It must be another side-effect of the formula. Oh darn. Looks like I still need to troubleshoot it.\u201d The scientist let out a sigh as she waddled away to put on clean clothes, still completely unaware of the transformation. Her children were surprised that she still hadn\u2019t noticed by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA waterfall of rapid aging,\u201d said Verne. \u201cThe shower! Then she saw a gray hair. It\u2019s just like Dad\u2019s novel, sort of.\u201d \u201cThat was just a coincidence,\u201d said Rosalind. \u201cI still say that her kooky concoction Mommy made is what turned her into a seal.\u201d \u201cThe problem is that these things happened at the same time,\u201d said Verne. \u201cIf we knew what did this to her, we might be able to cure it.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. I think I like her better this way. Besides, she doesn\u2019t seem to mind.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s because she hasn\u2019t noticed it! For that matter, neither has Dad. Are they so engrossed in their work that they don\u2019t say anything?\u201d \u201cWell, guess all we can do is ignore the elephant in the room.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s not an elephant, Rosalind. She\u2019s an elephant seal. There\u2019s a difference. Though she\u2019s definitely the size of an elephant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, the next door neighbor was getting ready to jog down the street. \u201cWell,\u201d said the neighbor. \u201cAfter months of therapy, I\u2019m finally cured of my irrational fear that an elephant seal will see me in my gym shorts.\u201d Sure enough, as soon as he said that, Dorothy waddled out onto the verandah. \u201cExcuse me!\u201d she called out. \u201cAre you sure you should be jogging outside in the middle of the winter?\u201d The neighbor looked up in horror at the giant wereseal looking down from the verandah, her huge belly hanging off the railing as she innocently waved. The neighbor in fear  nervously stepped back into his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the Helders were having dinner and from the looks of it, they were having fried fish and calamari. Dorothy was stuffing her face with seafood as her children watched in concern. \u201cI don\u2019t know why,\u201d said the enormous seal woman. \u201cBut for some reason I\u2019ve been craving fish and squid. I usually don\u2019t eat this much.\u201d Rosalind and Verne stared at each other before whispering. \"Should we tell her?\" asked Verne. \"No, way, dummy,\" said Rosalind. \"We can't just tell her that she's a giant seal.\" \"Well, sooner or later we're going to have to say something, if nobody else does.\" Verne let out a groan. \"Okay, but this is like waiting for a bomb to go off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve for his part was too deep in thought to either eat or notice that his wife was an enormous seal that was so obese it was a wonder she could move. \"By the way, Steve,\" said Wendy. \"Don't forget. The maid we hired is coming tomorrow.\" Both Rosalind and Verne gave looks of horror. \"Oh no,\" whispered Verne to his sister. \"We forgot about the new maid Mom hired. Wait until she sees the giant seal.\" Rosalind nodded her head. \"Well, this just escalated.\" Steve ignored his wife speaking to him and his children whispering and continued to brainstorm ideas for his novel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, the Helder children were looking out the window waiting for the hired help. \"This is really bad,\" said Verne. \"Really bad.\" \"Why?\" asked Rosalind. \"The new nanny might be nice.\" \"But she doesn't know that one of her employers is a wereseal,\" said Verne in response. \"Mom and Dad might not have noticed the transformation but anyone they hire will and they'll ask questions. All because of that stupid book.\" \"There you go again? Dad's typing has nothing to do with this. This is science gone wrong. Not magic.\" \"I don't think those genetic experiments are possible in real life and even if they were, mom sure as heck wouldn't....\" But at that moment, the newly hired maid was walking to the door. From the looks of it, she had bandages wrapped around her body that only exposed one of her eyes and her hair was bleached white. She was wearing a thick red jacket as well. The kids were visibly intimidated by her. \"Oh geez,\" said Verne. \"She looks like she was in a horrible accident.\" \"Speaking of which.\" Said Rosalind looking down the stairs. Wendy was waddling to answer the door. \"Oh no.\" Groaned Verne as he slapped himself in the face. \"Here comes the fireworks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy opened the door and the maid looked up at the giant wereseal and gasped. \"Hello,\" said Wendy. \"You must be River. I'm Wendy Helder. I really appreciate you agreeing to the job. Between my experiments and my husband's writing, we've been meaning to hire someone to help with the house and the children. Uh, is something wrong?\" River wasn't paying attention to her new employer, or rather she was paying more attention to Wendy's body than her speech. She didn't know how to react to the wereseal woman in front of her. \"What the hell?\" thought the woman in bandages to herself. \"Does she know she's a giant seal? I thought I'd be working for a human. Should I tell her or shouldn't I?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jessica Hale was buttoning her blouse as she smiled. She and her daughter, Tara, had recently moved into a new neighborhood and Tara was starting school that morning. Jessica herself had gotten a job as a liberal arts teacher at that very same school. She smiled because it was her boyfriend, Tony, a mythology teacher at the school, who helped her get the job. She was hoping that things would work out, given that her previous marriage had failed horribly. To Jessica, this was a fresh start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d said Jessica with a sigh. \u201cIf only Tara would hurry up. Tara! Come down, sweetie! You\u2019re gonna be late.\u201d However, Jessica heard a scream. \u201cTara?!\u201d she yelled. \u201cMom!\u201d yelled Tara. \u201cCome quick!\u201d Tara was cowering in fear when Jessica ran up to check on her. \u201cTara,\u201d said Jessica. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Tara pointed to her desk and revealed that there was a rather large spider on it. \u201cReally?\u201d asked Jessica with a laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s just a spider. A rather large spider. Huh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica looked up and saw it was a dark blue spider with white spots and a yellow hourglass on its thorax. \u201cOh man,\u201d said Jessica. \u201cThat\u2019s a weird looking spider. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it before.\u201d Tara just shook her head. \u201cJust kill it, already!\u201d Jessica rolled her eyes. Tara hated spiders, especially ones that she couldn\u2019t identify and therefore didn\u2019t know if they were safe around humans. \u201cTara,\u201d said Jessica. \u201cSpiders are living things too. It\u2019s probably more afraid of you than you are of it. I\u2019ll just let it out harmlessly.\u201d Jessica took Tara\u2019s textbook and used it to lead the spider out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, just before Jessica had the spider out of the window, the arachnid suddenly bit her and made her yell in pain. The spider scurried out of the window just as Jessica slammed the window shut and blew on her hand. \u201cMom!\u201d yelled Tara. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d Jessica just swung her hand a few more times before she went to the bathroom to put something on it. \u201cNow that was one bad spider,\u201d she said. \u201cOuch. My hand has never felt this store.\u201d Tara looked in worry. \u201cOh,\u201d said Jessica to her daughter. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ve heard that the most dangerous bite is a human bite. After seeing that episode of that horror show from the 80s, I believe it. Now come on, you\u2019re going to be late for school, and I\u2019m going to be late for work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028Unfortunately, what Jessica didn\u2019t notice was that underneath her bandages, the spider bite was throbbing. It was not an ordinary spider that bit her.</span></div></div>",

As Tara walked away, Jessica let out a slight hiss of some kind and held her throat with the hand where the spider bit her. \u201cUgh,\u201d she said. \u201cMy mouth feels so dry. What\u2019s happening?\u201d Before Jessica could give a thought to what was going on, she bumped into somebody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, my gosh,\u201d said Jessica. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s my first day and\u2026\u201d \u201cWell, fancy seeing you here. Took that teaching position I see.\u201d Jessica looked up and recognized the man she bumped into as Tony, her boyfriend. \u201cTony,\u201d she said as she kissed her boyfriend. \u201cThere you are. I see that you\u2019re ready for your first class.\u201d \u201cWell, let\u2019s hope you\u2019re ready for yours, Jessica.\u201d Tony then gasped because he noticed the bandage on Jessica\u2019s hand. \u201cWhat the heck happened to her hand?\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d said Jessica. \u201cThat? Just a rather large spider bite.\u201d \u201cSpider?\u201d asked Tony in surprise. \u201cWhat kind of spider was it?\u201d Jessica shrugged her shoulders. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It was blue with white spots and a yellow hourglass on its butt. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen a spider like it. But Tara was screaming and I had to get\u2026\u201d \u201cWait,\u201d said Tony. \u201cYou were bitten by a spider you couldn\u2019t identify? What if it was poisonous? Don\u2019t you know there are certain species of spiders that are deadly to humans? Black widows, redbacks\u2026\u201d \u201cWell, I don\u2019t feel any different. I doubt I\u2019m dying, Tony.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony let out a sigh. \u201cWell, come into the lounge. Spiders actually have a lot to do with what I\u2019m teaching in class today.\u201d Once in the teacher\u2019s lounge, Jessica made coffee for herself and her boyfriend. \u201cSo, what exactly does my boyfriend have in mind for what he\u2019s teaching. In fact, what exactly is it that you teach?\u201d \u201cMythology,\u201d said Tony. \u201cSpecifically, Greek mythology. For class today, I\u2019m going to teach the kids about the myth of Arachne.\u201d \u201cArachne?\u201d asked Jessica. Tony then nodded his head before he explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn Greek mythology, Arachne was a seamstress who was more than a little cocky. She boasted that she could weave even better than the gods themselves.\u201d Jessica gave a look of surprise. \u201cOh, that\u2019s just asking for a trip to hell.\u201d \u201cOh, she got just that,\u201d said Tony. \u201cAthena, the goddess of war and wisdom, was furious and decided to take up Arachne on that claim. The two of them had a weaving competition.\u201d \u201cI know where this is going. Arachne clearly lost. I mean, you don\u2019t just pick a fight with the gods and expect to get away with it. \u201cOh yeah,\u201d said Tony as he drank his coffee. \u201cArachne paid dearly for her bragging. After she lost, Athena turned her into a spider. Hench, arachnids.\u201d Jessica let out a laugh. \u201cPretty high price to pay for arrogance. Good luck with your first class.\u201d Tony let out a laugh and then left the room. \u201cGood luck with yours.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as Tony left the teacher\u2019s lounge, he forgot his textbook and it showed an image of the Arachne myth. There, the spider Arachne turned into was depicted as looking remarkably similar to the very same spider that bit Jessica earlier. However, the ginger-haired woman could care less about the textbook because she had her liberal arts class to get ready for. Jessica was confident in herself and then took out her makeup mirror to fix her hair. She was confident but not arrogant like Arachne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Jessica heard a ripping sound and turned around to see that her butt had torn out of her stretch pants. \u201cOh no,\u201d she said. \u201cHow em-bare-ass-ing.\u201d Jessica let out a nervous laugh at her own joke before she looked closer in pure surprise because her ass had turned a dark blue color with what looked like white spots and a yellow hourglass shaped marking on it. \u201cWhat the?\u201d asked Jessica. \u201cThat\u2019s weird. It looks almost like that spider that bit me.\u201d Jessica then grunted and got on her knees before her butt expanded into a massive thorax as big as a car. Jessica gasped and felt her pants coming apart right before her legs stretched out and she sprouted six extra legs. Jessica\u2019s skin turned the shade shade of dark blue as her thorax as she yelled and her teeth all turned into fangs and mandible like growths appeared on the sides of her mouth. She then sprouted six extra eyes as she felt her belly bulging out. What was left of Jessica\u2019s clothes tore apart as her transformation was complete. She had transformed into an 18ft tall humanoid spider with 8 legs, 2 arms, 8 eyes, a 30ft wide thorax, an 18ft wide belly and huge E-Cup breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica was horrified that she had become a large spider. \u201cOh my gosh! That spider that bit me must\u2019ve been poisonous and in more ways than one. I\u2019m a spider as big as a truck. Wait until Tara sees me like this. How can I face my daughter when I\u2019m a giant arachnid?\u201d Before Jessica could even think about what to tell her daughter, she heard her stomach growling and she let out a loud shriek.

Normally she wouldn\u2019t even think of eating meat but the fact was, having been turned into a ginormous spider, she was technically a carnivore and needed meat. \u201cI need something to eat,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, spiders eat... anything smaller than they are.\u201d Jessica was now horrified. After all, she was in a middle school. She may have been a spider now but there was no way in hell she would eat children. She knew it was wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t eat Tara\u2019s classmates. It\u2019s not right. Only a sick psychopath eats children. But I\u2019m so hungry.\u201d\u2028\u2028Jessica then dismantled the water cooler and chugged down all the water in an attempt to settle her arachnid appetite. But the drider woman couldn\u2019t take it any longer and hissed again. \u201cWhat I need is an adult. I know, the first teacher that comes in through that... no wait! That\u2019s cannibalism. I can\u2019t do it. I can\u2019t....\u201d But Jessica\u2019s stomach gurgled and she rubbed it with four of her spider legs. \u201cOh,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m too hungry to care.\u201d Jessica crawled up the ceiling and was humming to herself as she begun to spin her web. As she was doing so, she noticed the illustration of Arachne in Tony\u2019s book. \u201cThat drawing,\u201d she thought to herself. \u201cThat\u2019s Arachne? That looks like the spider that bit me. Oh no. Don\u2019t tell me that Arachne survived. That\u2019s great. The spider that bit me turns out to be a millennia old cursed silk spinner who has turned me into a 12 ton arachnid cannibal. Just remember, Jessica. Students are off limits. Just eat something and you can make it through the rest of the day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica then stopped to notice all of the webbing she had arranged all over the room and smiled. \u201cNow that\u2019s a pretty good looking web if I do say so myself.\u201d Suddenly the doorknob was turning and Jessica heard it. Somebody was entering the teacher\u2019s lounge. Jessica couldn\u2019t control herself and begun to drool. \u201cForgive me for what I\u2019m about to do,\u201d she thought to herself. \u201cI wish it didn\u2019t have to end this way.\u201d \u201cIs anybody in there?\u201d asked the voice. \u201cWhat is that hanging from across the walls! Those brats must\u2019ve gotten in! I keep telling that idiot principal we need barbed wire around here!\u201d Jessica let out a groan. \u201cMr. Edwards,\u201d she groaned to herself. \u201cThat figures.\u201d Mr. Edwards was the school\u2019s math teacher. Jessica had heard some really bad things about him from both Tony and the students. She even heard that he once failed a student just because he was out with an appendectomy that made it impossible for him to take a quiz. Suddenly Jessica didn\u2019t feel bad about what she was about to do to satisfy her hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Edwards walked in and saw all the webbing. Of course, he didn\u2019t know about Jessica and figured that everything was just a prank. \u201cLousy brats! They have too much time. Why did people save recess? It\u2019s the most useless thing. That\u2019 why kids go to middle school and high school out of control. They oughta be chained up and studying for twelve hours in a row a day. That\u2019s what children are put on this Earth for! To think that new teacher they hired is a parent. Some people have those little monsters on pur...\u201d Mr. Edwards then realized that his feet were stuck to the webbing on the floor. \u201cWhat the...? AAH!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mean teacher soon found a web falling down on him from above and fell to the ground when he looked up and screamed as he saw Jessica\u2019s spider form staring and smiling menacingly down at him. \u201cHello, Mr. Edwards,\u201d said Jessica. \u201cI\u2019m Ms. Hale, the new L.A. teacher.\u201d Mr. Edwards was sweating in fear of the giant spider above him. \u201cY-You?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou\u2019re the teacher they hired?\u201d Jessica crawled down, her huge and fat arachnid body looming over her prey. Jessica just let out an evil laugh. \u201cI kind of had a run in with a rather unusual bug this morning. You know, I really didn\u2019t want to do this, but after those nasty things you said and the even nastier things I\u2019ve heard you do...\u201d Jessica let out an evil laugh and secreted webbing from her thorax that she applied to her legs to wrap Mr. Edwards up as he was screaming and trying to escape his bindings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spider giantess then licked her lips as she used two of her spider legs to hold up her prey.

Suiren was her name and she was moaning as she laid in bed unable to sleep. She even got up and tried to jog in place but nothing was making her tired enough to sleep. She went into the bathroom and looked in the mirror to see that she had large bags underneath her eyes. \u201cI read somewhere that a month without sleep is fatal. I only have 20 days left to live if this keeps up. I\u2019ve got to get to sleep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuiren didn\u2019t know exactly how she was supposed to get to sleep and so she went down stairs to watch TV to find a way to fall asleep. \u201cDamn,\u201d she said. \u201cNothing on but kaiju films. I\u2019d never get to sleep watching all of that.\u201d Suiren shook her head and flipped channels before she saw a commercial for something interesting. \u201cAre you having trouble trying to sleep? Yokaiba Corp is looking for an insomnia to take a 30-day trial period for our newest sleeping pill, Lasting Dream. The trial is free. Just call the number listed and we\u2019ll see if we can\u2019t give you sweet dreams.\u201d This looked interesting and Suiren immediately picked up the phone in order to order the sleeping pill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, right before she could even dial the number, there was a knock on the door. Suiren then decided to investigate and found nobody at the door, instead there was a box of sleeping pills labeled \u201cLasting Dream\u201d. Suiren picked up the box and begun to inspect it right as she was scratching her head. \u201cThat\u2019s odd,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t say what\u2019s in this stuff. But I\u2019m too tired to care.\u201d Suiren took one tablet of the Lasting Dream in hopes that it would make her fall asleep. However, when she crawled back into bed, she was waiting for the pills to take effect and nothing happened, making her rather angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028This went on for a few days. One Friday morning, she was trying to prepare tamagoyaki only to accidentally ruin the batch by pouring in salt instead of sugar as she served them to the family. Her daughter, Ran bit into one and gagged. \u201cYuck. Mom, are you feeling alright.\u201d \u201cGee, Ran,\u201d said a rather ticked off Suiren. \u201cWhat do YOU think!?\u201d Suiren\u2019s husband, Takeshi shook his head and then saw Suiren anxiously pouring in milk before putting in one of her sleeping pills. \u201cSuiren,\u201d said Takeshi. \u201cDon\u2019t you think that you should lay off those pills? They haven\u2019t worked yet?\u201d Suiren hissed and held her fork up to her husband while their son, Gou. watched in fear. \u201cRan,\u201d said Gou. \u201cI think we better start heading to school now. Mom\u2019s extra cranky today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuiren just slammed her chopsticks into the table. \u201cI haven\u2019t slept for over a week! I have a right to be cranky! If these pills don\u2019t work I\u2019m going to sue Yokaiba Corps for everything they have! They better work. They have to work!\u201d Suiren just continued to huff and puff before taking more of those pills. \u201cMom,\u201d said Ran. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t say what those pills are made of. They could be dangerous.\u201d Surien just stuck her tongue out at her daughter before she walked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakeshi let out a groan. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be another bad night in bed.\u201d However, neither Takeshi nor Suiren noticed a baku on the bottle of pills that seemed to be making an ominous noise.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That night, after the kids were in bed, Suiren and Takeshi were in the bathroom getting ready for bed themselves and Suiren held up the bottle of Lasting Dream and took out a tablet. \u201cSuiren,\u201d said Takeshi. \u201cThis is getting monotonous. You\u2019ve been taken that medicine for a week straight and you haven\u2019t had any results yet.\u201d Suiren just grabbed Takeshi by the shirt collar and made him groan. \u201cI haven\u2019t been sleeping that well, Takeshi,\u201d Suiren warned her husband. \u201cWhich means I haven\u2019t been having a good week and I haven\u2019t been in the best mood.\u201d Takeshi gulped and nodded his head a few times. \u201cYes dear, I understand dear. I think I\u2019ll go on ahead to bed. Good luck trying to get to sleep.\u201d Suiren then kissed Takeshi to wish him a good night. As Takeshi went off to bed, Suiren opened the bottle of Lasting Dream and took two tablets before retreating to bed herself. She pulled the covers over herself before she curled up. \u201cPlease,\u201d she said. \u201cPlease gods of sleep, pay me a visit tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, an hour later, the pills had no effect. Takeshi was dead asleep while Suiren was wide awake. As Suiren was tossing and turning in her bed unable to sleep, she grabbed her green hair and stood up. She looked at the sleeping medicine she had been taking and gave it a glare. \u201cBaka,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are a baka medicine! Lasting Dream. Didn\u2019t even work. Experimental. Failed experiment is more like it. I oughta.\u201d Suddenly, Suiren grabbed herself by the chest and groaned. She even coughed up some strange mystical smoke. \u201cWhat the?\u201d she asked. Suddenly, Suiren felt her fingers and toes becoming clawed hooves as her skin was turning a greenish yellow color to suit her green hair. \u201cOMG,\u201d she said. \u201cThat medicine didn\u2019t just not cure my insomnia. It made me sick. I\u2019ve turned green.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuiren then coughed again and held up her hands before grunting as she held her hoofed hands. Then she felt her stomach expanding as she held onto her face. Her eyes became pointier as she sprouted what looked like tusks on the sides of her mouth and she then grunted and yelled as her mouth stretched into a snout and her butt expanded to make her pajama pants come apart at the seams and the skin below her waist turned a bright purple skin. Suiren stood up and then banged her head on the ceiling before she turned to see that her butt was casting a shadow over Takeshi and the entire bed. Suiren let out a snort and saw that she had completely transformed into a 18ft tall baku with a 23ft wide butt and belly, thighs as thick as tree trunks and fingers and toes that were as thick as sausages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh great,\u201d said Suiren. \u201cNot only can I not sleep, but I\u2019m a baku. This is mortifying. I\u2019ll be the laughingstock of the neighborhood once everyone sees I got turned into a yokai.\u201d Suiren was so mad that she let out a growl. But that wasn\u2019t just her because her stomach was what was growling and growling very loudly. \u201cOnore,\u201d said the tapir giantess. \u201cI am starving. I need something in my belly fast.\u201d Suiren then begun to sniff the air because she sensed something. \u201cWhat the?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhat is that delicious smell? I\u2019ve got to taste it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExactly what does Suiren eat to get over her monstrous hunger?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Suiren was rubbing her stomach out of pure hunger and wondering exactly what to eat when something tickled her nose. \u201cWhat is that strange aroma?\u201d the baku woman asked to herself. The obese and huge tapir-like creature sniffed the air again and realized something. \u201cThat smells sweet. Suiren then looked out and saw that what she smelt was coming from Ran\u2019s bedroom. Suiren walked in to see her daughter sleeping and then she smelt something coming from her. \u201cWait,\u201d said Suiren. \u201cI\u2019m a baku. Bakus eat dreams. What I must smell is a delicious dream. I wonder what Ran is dreaming about.\u201d Suiren heard laughter and was somehow able to look into her daughter\u2019s dream. Inside the dream, Ran appeared to be having a foot race with several stuffed animals in a land that had roads of gingerbread and mountains made out of baked Alaska and trees made of pocky.\u201d Just looking at the dream made Suiren very excited. \u201cOh wow!\u201d she yelled. \u201cThat is one sweet dream that my daughter is having. Literally. I just want to eat it up.\u201d Suiren held out her snout and opened her mouth wide. She was going to inhale Ran\u2019s dream but stopped herself at the last second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the heck am I doing?\u201d asked Suiren. \u201cI can\u2019t wake my daughter out of such a pleasant dream just to feed myself. What kind of mother would I be.\u201d Suiren walked away, although it took her five minutes just to squeeze her newly obese body out of her daughter\u2019s room. \u201cMan,\u201d she said. \u201cI need something to eat. Maybe there\u2019s some leftover takoyaki in the fridge.\u201d But before the baku SSBBW could even take one step downstairs, she heard screaming and realized something. \u201cThat came from Gou\u2019s room!\u201d Suiren ran to her son\u2019s bedroom and saw Gou tossing and turning in his bed and he was sweating heavily. From the looks of it, he was having night terrors.\u201d Suiren decided to look into Gou\u2019s dream and saw something rather unpleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGou was having a rather horrible nightmare and there were several strange creatures in his dream that made it clear that they wanted to do him harm. There was a top-shaped robot with a buzz saw collar around his neck and a mace for an arm with nails sticking out of his head. There was a large armored cockroach creature that resembled a knight armed with a shield and axe who was walking forward. The third kaijin was a giant frog with a snake wrapped around himself and the last of the evil creatures resembled a dragon made out of teeth. All the vile nightmare monsters laughed wickedly as they cornered Gou in the dream world. From the looks of it, they were in a black castle of some sort that appeared to be wrapped up with barbed wire. \u201cOh my gosh!\u201d yelled Suiren. \u201cGou\u2019s having a nightmare. I told him not to watch Tokusatsu movies before going to bed. Now he\u2019s having bad dreams about kaijin. Don\u2019t worry, Gou, Mama\u2019s got this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028Suiren held out her snout and opened her mouth wide as she inhaled deeply. In the nightmare, the tokusatsu kaijin would\u2019ve attacked Gou but suddenly they grunted and held themselves tight as they begun to dissolve into smoke. \u201cNani?\u201d asked Gou in the dream. It wasn\u2019t just the monsters that fizzled into smoke but the entire dream landscape was transforming into smoke and that smoke was seeping out of Gou\u2019s head in the real world and being sucked into Suiren\u2019s mouth as the baku ate the dream. By the time Gou woke up to look around, Suiren quickly shut the bedroom door so her son wouldn\u2019t see her transformed into a sumo-sized yokai. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d asked Gou. \u201cUgh. Guess it was just a bad dream.\u201d Gou let out a yawn and then went back to sleep as in the hallway, Suiren was chewing on his nightmare and then swallowed it whole before rubbing and patting her 23ft wide belly. \u201cSleep tight, Darling,\u201d said Suiren. \u201cAll your nightmares are going in Mama\u2019s belly from now on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028But that was when Suiren hiccuped and grunted as her belly roared violently. \u201cOh my,\u201d she said with a belch. \u201cUgh. I forgot. Bad dreams make bakus sick.\u201d Suiren stepped down the stairs, making them crack under her 6 ton body in the process before she entered the kitchen and immediately chugged three entire bottles of seltzer water and then swallowed a couple of antacids. Once she had some relief in her stomach, the yokai let out an explosion of gas from body ends before feeling her tummy again. \u201cOh,\u201d she said. \u201cUgh. Eating that bad dreams makes me feel like I\u2019m about to vomit out a rhinoceros and that rhinoceros will in turn vomit a unicycle. I think I better eat a good dream in order to put out this fire in my belly. Oh, I know. I\u2019ll see what Takeshi is dreaming up.\" The enormous baku waddled her way up the ruined stairs, but she was having trouble because her ass had outgrown the stairway. Suiren grunted as she wiggled her rear to try and free it from the railing but in the process, broke the railing from the stairway. The baku girl just blushed. \"Okay,\" she said. \"That's gonna take some explaining to Takeshi. Speaking of which, I wonder what my husband <i>is</i> dreaming of. The baku then let out a giggle. \"As if I didn't already know. It's probably his beloved wife. Oh, when he wakes up, he'll get a big surprise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuiren saw her husband sleeping peacefully and then walked up to the bed, causing the legs on her side of the bed to break apart and the bed to tip as Takeshi slid down against his wife\u2019s stomach. \u201cYou know,\u201d said Suiren. \u201cI\u2019ll bet that whatever he\u2019s dreaming is delicious. I think I\u2019ll take a peak.\u201d Suiren looked into the dream to see a cruise ship at sunset. \u201cOh,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s this? A romantic cruise, a sunset on the ocean. Oh, this reminds me of back when we were first married. I\u2019ll bet that he\u2019s dreaming about me.\u201d Suiren heard Takeshi laughing and smiled but then she heard a female voice that didn't sound at all like her own voice. \"Huh?\" asked the big fat baku woman. \"Who is that?\" Takeshi laughed again in the dream. \"So what do you think, Sanae.\" \"Sanae!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuiren took a closer look and it was perfectly clear that she did not like what she saw because there was a black haired woman in a punk rock style outfit who walked up and grabbed Takeshi in an embrace as they kissed, prompting Suiren to yell. \"Who is that girl!? Why is she touching my husband!? What the hell is going on?\" \"The sunrise is beautiful,\" said the black haired girl that was most likely Sanae. \"Isn't it, Takeshi-san.\" Takeshi bent his head down and kissed the girl, much to the dismay of Suiren who was watching. \"No,\" said Takeshi. \"No, Sanae-Chwan. You're beautiful. You're the most gorgeous girl I've ever seen.\" \"What?!\" yelled Suiren. Sanae let out a laugh. \"Oh, you. It's too bad that when I met you, you were already married to... uh what is her name.\" \"Suiren. It means \"Water Lily\". It oughta mean \"drenched lily\" given that green hair reminds me of expired seaweed. Heck. 12 years of marriage and 2 pregnancies has completely made her less appealing. With her insomnia, she looks worse everyday. It's only natural that I need someone more... blessed... in the looks department.\" In the dream, Sanae bounces her large breasts as Takeshi continues to stare. \"We shouldn't have to see each other only in dreams and when you're pretending to be working late. When are you going to dump that green-haired hag for good.\" \"Soon my sweet, sweet Sanae, very soon. I'm just waiting for the right moment. I'm surprised that fat idiot hasn't figured it out already. Then again, I didn't marry her for her brains.\" Sanae and Takeshi were laughing in the dream as Takeshi twirled his mistress in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, Suiren was way past pissed off by this point and the baku was filled with rage as she saw the adultery that was taking place in Takeshi's dream, no doubt a reflection of adultery that was taking place in real life. \u201cWhy that jiggalo! We\u2019ve been married for 12 years and he has the nerve to do this to me! Ugh! Okay, DEAR. You\u2019re about to be in for a rather rude awakening.\u201d Suiren held up her snout and inhaled again. In the dream world, the ocean turned violent and the boat spun around as Takeshi and Suiren screamed. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening!?\u201d yelled Suiren. \u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d yelled Takeshi. \u201cThis is new to me! Don\u2019t worry, Sanae, it\u2019s only a dream. It\u2019s only a...\u201d Sanae then screamed and turned into smoke as did the rest of the dream as it billowed down Suiren\u2019s throat. \u201cToo bad that this is only a dream I\u2019m eating,\u201d thought the yokai to herself as the last of the dream went down her greedy throat. \u201cIf I find out where that tramp lives, she\u2019s getting a one way trip to my gut for trying to steal my husband. Hell, I'm even tempted to eat Takeshi right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakeshi woke up yelling as he held his head. \u201cWhat was that all...\u201d Takeshi heard a grunt and then he looked up and gasped at the 18ft tall and 6 ton fatass baku looking down at him. \u201cA baku?!\u201d asked Takeshi. \u201cYokai are real?\u201d The angry baku lowered her head and gave Takeshi a look at her green hair and realized that it was his wife that he was looking at. \u201cSuiren! Is that you? Am I dreaming?\u201d Suiren let out a grunt. From the sounds of it, Takeshi had no idea that Suiren knew exactly what he was dreaming about, let alone the fact that he was cheating on her, and so she decided to stay calm for a minute or two as her eye begun to twitch. \u201cWell,\u201d said Suiren. \u201cFrom the looks of it, I had a violent reaction to the Lasting Dream.\u201d Takeshi laughed nervously. \u201cWell,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely something.\u201d Takeshi then gave a gulp. \u201cDamn, she\u2019s huge,\u201d he thought. \u201cIf she finds out about Sanae, she\u2019ll swallow me whole.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut does Suiren make it known that she knows about the affair that her husband is having?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cHere it is, Wanda,\u201d said Simon to his wife as he drove their car in front of a cabin out in the woods. \u201cThe Pine Barrens of New Jersey. Home of\u2026\u201d \u201cThe Jersey Devil.\u201d Continued Wanda. Simon let out a laugh as the two of them parked their car under a roadsign that depicted a strange demonic looking creature with hooved feet, a horned horse\u2019s head with sharp teeth, bat wings and a pointed tail. \u201cSo that\u2019s the creature,\u201d said Wanda. \u201cAre you sure that it exists, Simon?\u201d Simon let out a sigh. \u201cI know that we never did find the NASA gargoyle and I\u2019m not one hundred percent sure that Hodag we saw wasn\u2019t just a dog in a suit, but I have a feeling that the Jersey Devil is here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda let out a sigh and then kissed her husband. \u201cWell,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is certainly the most interesting way to spend our honeymoon. I hope J.D. turns out to be real. After all, Daddy said that if you managed to find a cryptid, he\u2019d eat his socks. After what he said about your cryptozoology hobby, I\u2019d like to see that happen.\u201d \u201cWanda,\u201d said Simon. \u201cYour father was drunk when he said that. You check us in, I\u2019ll go see if the Jersey Devil is around here.\u201d Wanda let out a laugh and then went to check in. The hotel manager let out a sigh. \u201cFrom the looks of it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re looking for J.D. I\u2019m not even sure that he\u2019s real. But he does a very good job of lining our pockets so he can be as real as he wants.\u201d Wanda let out a laugh as she checked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, once Wanda had put everything in the hotel room, she decided to check out the woods for herself. \u201cI really hope Simon finally finds a cryptid,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to see one up close. Then again, anything with devil in the name is probably something we shouldn\u2019t mess with.\u201d As Wanda was walking through the woods, she saw a strange shadowed-out creature moving behind the trees. She gasped because she thought that it could potentially turn out to be the Jersey Devil. \u201cOh my gosh.\u201d She said. Wanda ran off as the figure was running and even took out some mace before she jumped out in front of the creature. The creature responded in surprise right before Wanda struck it with mace and caused it to scream loudly in pain. Wanda then took a closer look and saw that it was not the Jersey Devil that she had sprayed but a man in green rags and a metal mask who was holding his eyes in pain. \u201cOh my gosh!\u201d yelled Wanda. \u201cAre you alright?!\u201d The man held out his eyes in pain and then Wanda hastily rubbed them with a cloth. \u201cMama Mia,\u201d groaned the man. \u201cThese modern weapons will be the death of Erlking.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m really sorry,\u201d said Wanda. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuman?\u201d asked Erlking. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m not really sure myself. Ouch. That\u2019s some strong mace there. What\u2019s a young woman like you doing out here in the first place?\u201d Wanda let out a giggle. \u201cIt\u2019s my husband. We were just married last week and he wanted to take us to Jersey. You see, Simon has a fetish for cryptids. In fact, I first met him at a Halloween party when I was dressed as Frank Shaw\u2019s gargoyle.\u201d Wanda let out a laugh as Erlking blinked. \u201cGo on.\u201d The old man said. \u201cOh,\u201d said Wanda. \u201cRight. Well, Simon took me out here because he wants to show me the Jersey Devil.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cThe Jersey Devil?\u201d asked Erlking. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of the creature. People apparently like it so much that they named a hockey team after it. Do you know the story behind this creature? Legend has it that a woman had 12 children and was expecting the 13th one.\u201d \u201cGood grief,\u201d said Wanda. \u201cWho would want that?\u201d \u201cNot her,\u201d said Erlking. \u201cShe said that this one would be the devil. When she went to labor in 1735, the child was born normal but turned into a horse-headed monster with bat wings, hooves and a forked tail. It killed the midwife and then escaped out the chimney.\u201d Wanda let out a whistle. \u201cThat\u2019s quite a story, there, Erlking. But if I could get Simon to see the Jersey Devil... what I\u2019m saying is that I wish that Simon would see the Jersey Devil.\u201d Erlking then smiled and then climbed up on a nearby tree stump as Wanda looked in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI say, 1, 2, spell me do. Let this lady\u2019s wish come true, here me hihg, hear me well, let me be this spell.\u201d Erlking\u2019s eyes glowed bright and then Erlking disappeared. Wanda just blinked before she heard Simon calling. \u201cWanda!\u201d yelled Simon. \u201cCome quick! I found hoofprints, they might belong to the Jersey Devil!\u201d \u201cComing, Sweetie.\u201d Said Wanda. Wanda ran off to meet with her husband, but as she was running, she failed to notice that her ass was getting larger and she was getting taller. At this point, her butt was so big that her skirt could no longer cover it. She also appeared to be growing a devil\u2019s tail and a pair of leather wings as her feet turned into the hooves of the Jersey Devil.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was shaking her booty not realizing that she had a long pointed tail like a demon\u2019s. Her wings were even getting bigger and her teeth got sharper as her face was stretching into the shape of a horse\u2019s head as she was growing long curved horns. She saw Simon up ahead and noticed that he was looking at some hoof prints on the ground. \u201cSo, Babe,\u201d said Wanda as she pressed her breasts against her husband\u2019s back. \u201cAny sign.\u201d Simon let out a groan. \u201cFalse alarm, Wanda. These are deer tracks. The Jersey Devil is described as an equine, not a cervine.\u201d \u201cAw,\u201d said Wanda. \u201cToo bad. I was looking forward to seeing the Jersey Devil.\u201d Simon let out a groan. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure that your father is going to rib me about it. He almost called off the wedding after that fiasco with the ogopogo. But I'm gonna show him. I'll find a real cryptid if it's the last thing I ever due.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028Suddenly, Simon felt his neck in pain from the weight of Wanda\u2019s boobs that were at this point so fat they looked like they were at least H-cups. \u201cWanda,\u201d he said. \u201cHave you considered getting a reduction.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d asked Wanda. As Simon got up, he saw a shadow over him, a rather large and fat shadow with long wings, a horned horse\u2019s head and a devil\u2019s tail. \u201cOh my gosh! There he is! The Jersey Devil. Huh, he\u2019s much fatter than I imagined he\u2019d be.\u201d Wanda let out a squeal. \u201cWhere is he?!\u201d Wanda was too excited to notice that she had been turned into a Jersey Devil. Specifically she was now 20ft tall with a 30ft wide stomach and ass and thick thunderous thighs. She turned around and took out her camera phone to get a good look at the Jersey Devil that her husband spotted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t miss him,\u201d said Simon. \u201cHe\u2019s right... Ugh!\u201d Simon had slammed his head right into Wanda\u2019s big red ass that had all but swallowed her skirt and panties. Simon then gasped and felt around his mutated wife\u2019s ass before looking up and noticing her reddish brown hair. Wanda gave a snort and blew fire out of her nose before turning around and intimidating Simon with her demonic equine face and sharp teeth. \u201cI can\u2019t see the Jersey Devil, Simon. Where is he.\u201d Simon gave a gulp. \u201cUh, Wanda. He... is a she. Look in the mirror.\u201d Wanda was confused but she reached into her big cleavage and took out a mirror before looking at herself and screamed loudly. \u201cGood grief!\u201d Wanda then held up her stomach and then looked back at her big ass. \u201cLook at how fat I am, Simon! I'm morbidly obese! This ass looks like it should be wrecking buildings. My belly looks like it could deflect bullets and look at these breasts. I could just throw out my purses if I have a cleavage like this. How do they stay up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon was dumbfounded. \u201c<i>That\u2019s</i> what you notice first? You\u2019re the Jersey Devil! Well, <i>a</i> Jersey Devil, but the point still stands. What happened?\u201d Wanda scratched her obese stomach before she realized something. \u201cErlking.\u201d \u201cErlking?\u201d \u201cA weird old man I met in the woods. He said he granted wishes. I wished that you would see the Jersey Devil. So he turned me into the Jersey Devil. I guess you really do have to be careful what you wish for.\u201d Simon was very horrified. \u201cHow do we change you back?\u201d he asked. \u201cMy parents will not be pleased when they find out I married a demon.\u201d Wanda just twitched her fingers. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is a way to turn me back. I guess I\u2019m stuck being fat <i>and</i> a demon for the rest of my life.\u201d Simon shook his head. \u201cWell,\u201d he said. \u201cFor better or for worse. That\u2019s what the preacher said. All my life I\u2019ve been chasing after cryptids. And not even two weeks into our marriage, my wife becomes one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda just smiled and kissed Simon so hard that her mouth completely enveloped her husband. Wanda then lifted her head and heard Simon screaming and realized she accidentally sucked him into her mouth. Wanda in embarrassment opened her mouth and stretched down her tongue before allowing Simon to slide harmlessly out of her mouth. Simon gagged as he wiped Jersey Devil spit off of his body. \u201cThat is going to take some getting used to.\u201d Then Wanda smiled. \u201cAnd Daddy is going to have to get used to eating his socks. I\u2019ll send him a picture.\u201d Wanda grabbed Simon and placed him on her shoulder before taking a selfie, focusing on her demonic head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Wanda and her husband laughed before Wanda walked away, not realizing she still seemed to be getting bigger as the two of them...</span></div></div>",

What are you doing?\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s it look like, Hubby?\u201d asked Wanda. \u201cBig mama\u2019s hungry. I think there should be a diner around here.\u201d Simon gasped as he held onto his wife\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWanda,\u201d he said. \u201cAre you sure that this is a good idea? After all, people might think you\u2019re a monster.\u201d Wanda gave a snort. \u201cSimon, I am a monster now and a rather big one who is hungry enough to eat one hundred cows in one sitting. Simon, what do Jersey Devils eat?\u201d Simon begun to think and then had a horrible thought. \u201cPeople.\u201d He said. Wanda gave a look of surprise. \u201cAre you sure about that?\u201d asked Wanda to her tiny husband. \u201cWell,\u201d said Simon. \u201cI\u2019m not completely 100% sure about that, but you\u2019re definitely a carnivorous creature.\u201d Suddenly, Wanda heard a loud gobbling sound and begun to drool. \u201cHold that thought, Simon?\u201d The giant Jersey Devil licked her lips and rubbed her big belly as she walked into an open field and sniffed around for food. She heard a gobbling sound again and realized that she picked up the scent of a wild turkey, several wild turkeys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda flapped her wings and flew overhead as the turkeys gobbled and tried to run. Some of them managed to escape but Wanda snatched up five turkeys in her mouth and swallowed them whole. Once the turkeys were in her stomach, Wanda let out a thunderous belch that forced Simon to cover his ears. He even saw brimstone fly out of his wife\u2019s mouth. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d said Wanda in embarrassment. I guess getting turned into a 20ft tall and 6 ton demonic cryptid takes away your manners.\u201d Wanda then held up one of her sharp clawed fingers and started to try and pick at her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWanda?\u201d asked Simon with slight worry in his face. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Wanda let out a sigh. \u201cI think I have a feather or two stuck between my teeth. Simon Dear, would you be a sweetie and held me out with this.\u201d Simon was shocked. What his wife was asking him to do was to go into his mouth. \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d asked Simon, obviously afraid. \u201cYou want me to go inside your mouth.\u201d \u201cWell duh, Sweetie,\u201d said Wanda. \u201cIt\u2019s no different from what plovers do with crocodiles.\u201d Wanda opened her mouth wide and showed sharp teeth as big as stones and saliva was dripping from the top to the bottom. Simon let out a sigh. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you have to promise me that you\u2019re not going to eat me.\u201d Wanda just rolled her eyes at her husband\u2019s words. \u201cWhat do I look like?\u201d asked the Jersey Devil giantess. \u201cA black widow? Relax, Simon. I\u2019m not going to swallow you. Just walk in and everything will be okay.\u201d Simon let out a sigh because he saw no way out of this rather bizarre predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoping for the best, he simply stepped into Wanda\u2019s hand and then stepped into her mouth as she stuck out her rather large tongue right before closing her mouth and giving Simon a good view of her teeth. Simon crawled up to inspect Wanda\u2019s teeth and saw that Wanda did indeed have some feathers stuck in between her teeth. He took out a pocket knife in order to remove the turkey feathers right before he spotted some spinach caught between her back molars. \u201cUgh,\u201d he said. \u201cSomebody definitely forgot to floss last night.\u201d Simon let out a sigh as he continued to clean out his wife\u2019s mouth. \u201cI knew that I couldn\u2019t predict how well our marriage would turn out, but who would\u2019ve predicted that not even the first month of our marriage and my bride would turn into the very cryptid that I was looking for. Calm down, Simon. It will all work out. I hope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Simon had finished picking out Wanda\u2019s teeth, the Jersey Devil woman spat her minuscule husband into her hand and then bent her head down to give him a kiss. However, Wanda\u2019s stomach was still rumbling and Wanda let out a groan. \u201cYou\u2019re STILL hungry?\u201d asked Simon. \u201cI guess I shouldn\u2019t be surprised given how big you are now, but seriously?\u201d The Jersey Devil girl let out a sigh and then started to walk away. \u201cWell,\u201d she said. \u201cLooks like we\u2019re going to have to eat out anyway.\u201d Simon was beginning to sweat rather heavily. \u201cOh boy,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is big shock for little Jersey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda walked into town and the townsfolk gasped and stared. One young man on a bicycle crashed into a tree when he saw the big and huge cryptid woman. \u201cOh my gosh! It\u2019s the Jersey Devil!\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t know the Jersey Devil was female.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s humongous.\u201d \u201cThat devil has some serious booty.\u201d Said one teenager who couldn\u2019t help but stare at Wanda\u2019s huge and jiggling rear end. This resulting in the teen's rather jealous girlfriend slapping him in the face. \"Give me a break. Like that's attractive.\" Wanda noticed that everybody in the vicinity was taking photographs of her as she walked right down the street. She then grunted because several tourists were right under her ass as they took a selfie with her. \"You know,\" said one of the tourists. \"I thought the Jersey Devil would be a lot more intimidating.\" Wanda then begun to blush as she bit herself in the lip. \"Okay, Simon,\" she said to her husband. \"Perhaps you were right about me attracting unwanted attention.\" Simon let out a sigh. \"Well it's too late to do anything about it now, Wanda,\" he said. \"At least we should be glad that nobody is calling the army on you.\" The demonic giantess let out a laugh but then she noticed she seemed to have gotten bigger and fatter as well. She even stopped to look at her now 35ft wide ass in the reflection of a nearby window as she blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before she could worry about her own vanity, Wanda\u2019s stomach rumbled, reminding her exactly why she was in town. Then she looked ahead and saw a diner between two large oak trees. This diner was entitled \u201cMama Leeds\u201d and had a giant wooden statue of a Jersey Devil on top of it. \u201cWell, well,\u201d said Wanda. \u201cLooks like it\u2019s lunch time.\u201d Wanda walked up to the diner, startling the patrons inside, who turned around at the sound of the giant woman\u2019s large footsteps. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d asked one of them. \u201cOh my gosh!\u201d The waitress looked in surprise to see Wanda outside. However, Wanda gave a growl of pure frustration because there was one thing that she didn\u2019t take into consideration with her dining plans. Namely, it was the fact that she was currently much too big to fit in the diner. Wanda stomped her foot in rage. \"Dammit!\" she yelled. \"Don't lose your temper, Wanda,\" said Simon. \"I'll just go in and bring something for you to eat.\" Wanda held down her pointed demonic tail and her husband slid right down her back before he made his way into Mama Leeds's diner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Simon walked into the diner, Wanda crossed her arms and tapped her foot impatient. However, things were about to get much more awkward because several spectators had gathered around. \"Wanda?\" \"That's an odd name for a Jersey Devil. I thought that demons were supposed to have threatening names.\" Wanda gave a growl. \"Would you vultures leave me alone? I wasn't always a Jersey Devil.\" \"Well, duh,\" said one of the townspeople. \"Everyone knows that about you, Mrs. Jersey Devil.\" Inside the diner, Simon had order up several plates of fried dough. \"I really hope that this is enough to satisfy my wife's monstrous hunger.\" The chef let out a laugh. \"You're a brave man,\" she said. \"Marrying the Jersey Devil.\" \"Actually,\" said Simon. \"We came here looking for the Jersey Devil and my wife made a wish to a funny man in green to see the real deal.\" The chef let out a laugh. \"Honey,\" she said. \"This isn't the first time a human turned into Jersey Devil. The real deal was human for 5 whole seconds. Well, I hope your wife prefers fried dough over human flesh. Tell her that crypt ids eat free around Mama Leeds'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon smiled and then walked out with the order and Wanda looked down and smiled as Simon put the plates down and then the demonic giantess dug her head down into the food in order to snarf it down greedily. The crowd was repulsed and stepped back due to Wanda's rather poor table manners. That was when Simon heard his cellphone ringing and checked the caller ID. \"Oh no.\" He said. What Simon received was a text from his father-in-law. The young man was sweeting as he took a look at the text and read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You rat bastard,\" the text read. \"What did you do to my Wanda? I knew you wouldn't amount to anything chasing after windmill cryptids, but to turn my own daughter into one of your fantasies? What kind of mutagen did you use. If I ever see you again, I can promise you that I'm going to tear you apart just like they did last week to that Anton whatever-his name was.\" Simon let out a sigh. \"I should've known that Wanda's father wouldn't take this well. Of all the things to happen. I'm beginning to be glad that we didn't find the Frank Shaw's gargoyle at NASA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there was more vibrations and the townspeople gasped. \"Huh?\" asked Simon. Wanda rose her head right out from the fried dough she was devouring and saw a shadow cast over her. It belonged to a giant woman who was as big as Wanda herself. From the looks of it, she was a cryptid as well, but from the looks of it, she was definitely not a Jersey Devil like Wanda was. \"Well I'll be,\" said the new titaness. \"I didn't think there was a second cryptid in the area.\" Wanda turned and looked in surprise to see the second giantess was in fact a...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cBRIIIING!\u201d went Helena\u2019s alarm clock right before the young woman smashed it with her hand. \u201cOh dang,\u201d she groaned. \u201cThat\u2019s the fifth clock this month.\u201d The rather large woman got out of bed. Her Italian figure was muscular but big gutted. She had to be tough. It was a job requirement. She was the night guard at the first national bank.\u201d She checked to see that it was 7:30 at night, which meant she would have to be at work soon, so she wasted no time getting into the shower and then afterwards getting her strong body ready to take on another night. \u201cI really hope that Chuck finally stops picking on Stanley, tonight,\u201d she said as she put on her security outfit and tie. \u201cAfter all, it\u2019s not like he gave him any choice in regards to the latest job.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelena was referring to her boyfriend, Stanley, an accountant at the bank who in contrast to his musclebound Goliath of a girlfriend, was a small, neurotic weakling who was pushed around by their boss. Chuck, the bank manager was always picking on Stanley. Heck, Stanley might as well be the real manager of the bank since Chuck was very rarely if ever seen doing his job. It made Helena wonder why he hadn\u2019t been fired yet, but she just let out a sigh as she put away her gun and flashlight in her belt and then put on her glasses. \u201cThe bank is starting to be run like the post office these days. Well, time to get to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the bank at the time, Chuck and Stanley were going over several figures involving the bank\u2019s latest investment. \u201cI don\u2019t know if this is a good idea, Chuck,\u201d said Stanley. \u201cThe loan we gave this guy, Mr. Bededdy. I heard that the last few plays he directed were bombs.\u201d \u201cWhich is why it\u2019s important that this bomb sets off a stream of explosions that give us major interest. Which is also why I\u2019m naming you to oversee the production.\u201d \u201cWhat?!\u201d yelled Stanley. \u201cBut, Chuck. I don\u2019t know anything about the theater.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said Chuck. \u201cIf things go wrong. You\u2019re fired.\u201d Stanley gasped at that. \u201cOn second thought,\u201d said Chuck. \u201cYou\u2019re fired now. You can have your job back when the play succeeds.\u201d Stanley let out a groan. This was the very reason why Helena hated Chuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly who\u2019s fired?\u201d asked a voice behind Chuck. Chuck gulped and turned to see Helena glaring down at him. \u201cHelena,\u201d he said nervously. \u201cI wasn\u2019t saying anything? Who\u2019s fired? Certainly not Stanley.\u201d \u201cI should hope not,\u201d said Helena. \u201cIf I check you picking on my man again, manager or no manager, I\u2019m going to tear you inside out.\u201d \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d Said Chuck. While Chuck was prone to bullying Stanley, he didn\u2019t dare do anything when his girlfriend (who had several feet and more than 100lbs on him). Helena gave a smug smile. \u201cAnd for the record, I have the utmost faith that Stanley will be able to handle that play in spite of Bededdy\u2019s incompetence as a director. Now run alone and do, whatever it is you do around here.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuck ran off in fear as Helena laughed at him. \u201cThanks, Helena,\u201d said Stanley. \u201cIt looks like you\u2019ve saved me again. I\u2019d be nowhere if it weren\u2019t for you.\u201d Helena let out a scoff and flexed one of her muscles. \u201cNot a problem, Baby,\u201d she said. \u2018I just don\u2019t like Chuck to think that just because he\u2019s the manager means he can dump everything on you. After all, when was the last time he asked you to do anything?\u201d Stanley let out a sigh and then walked up to his own safety deposit box. \u201cThere\u2019s something really wrong with this picture, Helena. I\u2019m the weaker one in our relationship and you\u2019re the one keeping criminals out of this bank.\u201d Helena shrugged her shoulders and felt her large stomach and her muscular limbs. \u201cRight body for the right job, Stanley. This is what happens.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanley then gave a smile that confused Helena. \u201cStanley?\u201d she asked. Stanley then closed his vault before turning around. \u201cHelena,\u201d he said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t find a ring but I\u2019d like you to have this.\u201d Helena then gasped in surprise because Stanley held out something that looked like a silver necklace with bejeweled studs and a dog-like head in the center of it. Helena saw Stanley on his knee and she didn\u2019t need any hints as to what that meant. \u201cYes,\u201d said Helena. \u201cI accept.\u201d Helena turned around and got on her knees for her boyfriend to put her engagement necklace on her. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d said Helena. \u201cSo, do you have a date planned for the ceremony? I have to tell my folks.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Stanley. \u201cWe\u2019ll cross that bridge when we get there.\u201d Helena then bent down to kiss her boyfriend, now fianc\u00e9. However, as Helena put on the necklace, it was revealed that there was a strange writing underneath the decoration. The writing was in ancient Greek language but when translated it read \u201cCerberus\u201d. From the looks of it, neither Helena nor Stanley was aware of this.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That night after Stanley had left, Helena was watching the monitors to make sure that nobody broke into the bank. She was scratching at her necklace and was panting. \u201cI love this necklace that Stanley gave me,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it feels a little hot. Ugh. My shoulders are killing me. As soon as I get out of work, I\u2019m heading to a chiropractor. Helena didn\u2019t notice it, but her breasts had gotten bigger and her ass was ballooning as well. She was sweating heavily and tried to drink a mug of water but as soon as her lips touched the water, it started to boil and she gagged. \u201cWhat the?\u201d asked Helena. \u201cGee. I must be coming down with a fever. Don\u2019t think about the pain, Helena. You\u2019re the watchdog around here and this dog is on duty.\u201d Helena started to pant again when she spotted something on one of the screens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028\u2028There were two men in masks. One man was wearing a clown mask and the other man was wearing a Darth Vader mask. \u201cOh no,\u201d said Helena with a sigh. \u201cMen in masks. Never a good sign. Looks like I\u2019m getting some action tonight.\u201d Helena held out her flashlight and gun and walked off to deal with the criminals, not realizing that the back of her pants was ripping at the seat. Helena then held her head and begun to growl not realizing that there was bright violet-red fur growing all over her body and two growths appearing on her shoulders. Her stomach was also stretching out several feet. She also sprouted a silver whip-like tail that ended in an arrow-like point. The security guard let out a yawn as she revealed her teeth had turned into sharp fangs. Then, Helena gave a grunt. \u201cUgh,\u201d she said. \u201cDarn shoes.\u201d What Helena failed to realize was that she was sprouting claws on her feet and they were tearing through the shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thieves at that point had managed to break into the vault. \u201cHa,\u201d said the thief in the Darth Vader mask. \u201cWhat did I tell you? Easy money.\u201d \u201cWhat about the guard?\u201d asked the criminal in the clown mask. The Darth Vader masked crook gave a scoff. \"The guard is a skirt. We can easily get past her.\" The criminals then both heard loud barking. \"What was that?\" asked the one in the clown's mask. \"Oh no. You don't think we woke up the guard dog do you?\" \"I used to work at this bank. There is no guard dog. This bank doesn't use dogs.\" \"I swear that I distinctively heard some kind of guard dog. I think we better give up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe criminal in the Darth Vader mask didn't heed his friend's warning and then walked into the vault to try and load a bag full of cash. Of course, there was no guard dog because it was Helena who was growling. An angry grimace formed underneath her glasses as she got bigger and heavier with each step. Fur had grown all over her body, her new tail dragged across the ground and two sets of spikes sprouted on her back. Her uniform was in shambles as she dragged her belly across the ground. She briefly stopped and felt her shoulders in pain and then suddenly those two growths had fully emerged into a second and third head and let out a growl as they showed their razor sharp teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point, the bank robbers had loaded up a bag of cash and were trying to drag it out. \"I think we took too much.\" Said the clown mask. \"Shut up. We've got just enough. Now let's get the heck out of here before...\" Suddenly there was a loud growl. The criminals held out their guns and then the ground begun to shake. The floor was even cracking as a large shadow came out and the bank robbers fired their guns. But the bullets harmlessly fell to the ground, having absolutely no effect on their target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelena came out and showed what she had become. She was now a 20ft tall and morbidly obese three-headed dog with purple-red fur all over her body, a devil's tail and spikes on her back. Each head had long black hair and razor sharp teeth, though only the middle head wore glasses. Helena's belly hung out 10 feet and was 25ft wide with a 20ft wide butt that destroyed her pants and revealed her panties underneath and a pair of E-cup breasts that devoured her shirt and reduced her to only a bra. Helena's three heads snarled and drooled as the bank robbers screamed. They both shot at Helena but their bullets did nothing to the Cerberus giantess's skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelena growled and then grabbed the criminals as they struggled in her grip. Helena then noticed her reflection in the window and gasped. \"Oh my goodness.\" said her left head. \"What happened to me?\" asked her center head. Then her right head gasped. \"Stanley's necklace!\" Helena then shoved the criminals in the back of her panties and saw down to immobilize them before she took out her cell phone. \"I have a few calls to make about this situation.\" Groaned the center head to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho does Helena contact first?</span></div></div>",

Brooke turned her head as Holt pulled out the rather large and jagged lure. \u201cThis is my best lure, Brooke. Hooks them from the inside so they can\u2019t escape.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s cruel.\u201d Moaned Brooke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Holt just ignored his wife and continued to fish, catching a large number of fish into a net. \u201cAlright,\u201d said Holt. \u201cWe\u2019re heading to shore. Brooke, get rid of the garbage.\u201d Brooke tried to put the empty beer bottles into a bag but then Holt struck her. \u201cNot like that, stupid. Like this.\u201d Holt then proceeded to toss every last bottle into the lake as Brooke could only watch helplessly. It wasn\u2019t long until they were back at shore and Holt put several of the fish into the cooler. \u201cTrout,\u201d he said. \u201cThis should make a pretty penny when I sell them to John\u2019s.\u201d \u201cBut Holt,\u201d said Brooke. \u201cNot all those fish will fit in the cooler.\u201d Holt then cut the net and poured the rest of the fish out on the beach before walking away as Brooke looked in horror at such a wasteful action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one could understand why Brooke married Holt Rivers. The man was less than an animal who had zero regard for life. This was just one of the many ways that he disrespected nature. This fishing trip, if you could even call it that, was one of many that was ruining the lake for everyone and everything and Brooke knew it. She wished that it would stop, but there was just no reasoning with Holt. The two of them had entered the bait shop to restock and the shopkeeper seemed like he wasn\u2019t happy to see them. \u201cYou\u2019re killing my business, Holt,\u201d said the shopkeeper. \u201cAs well as everything in the lake.\u201d \u201cShut up,\u201d said Holt. \u201cThe customer\u2019s always right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear at this point that Brooke had married a brute. She was begin to seriously rethink her marriage. Especially considering that Holt barely treated her any better than the fish he caught. She even lowered her sunglasses to show a blackeye that she got from Holt who at this time was arguing with the bait vendor. \u201cYou dirty crook. Charging this much for mealworms? I know a drug dealer who doesn\u2019t charge as much as you. Say, that\u2019s an idea.\u201d The vendor gasped. \u201cAre you kidding? You can\u2019t use crack to catch fish. That\u2019s beyond cruel.\u201d \u201cWho cares?\u201d asked Holt. \u201cI don\u2019t even like fish. They\u2019ve got no feelings anyway.\u201d Brooke couldn\u2019t help but cry at what Holt was even saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke gasped as she saw that inside the shop appeared to be a zombified Greek soldier with missing heels washing windows while a minotaur skull sat on the table. She had heard of this particular magic shop and ran out of the bait shop across the street in order to buy whatever it was selling. Inside the shop, the door flung open and Brooke accidentally knocked over the zombie before she confronted the skull. She put her hand to its mouth before it had the chance to speak. \u201cDon\u2019t say a thing,\u201d she said. \u201cJust hear me out. I am Brooke Kim Rivers and I am married to an abusive and wasteful fisherman. I want to intimidate him into giving it up. I heard rumors that this store caused women to turn into giant monsters. In Greece, a young woman turned into a giant swan. A pair of alligator shoes from this store turned a hippie girl into an actual alligator. I want to become the most powerful creature under the water.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke\u2019s determination actually intimidated the skull who himself seemed very uneasy about that request. \u201cListen, lady,\u201d said the skull. \u201cI\u2019m going to level with you. Everything in this shop is cursed. You\u2019ll be turned into a giant with very little hope of ever turning back.\u201d Brooke just gave a stern look. \u201cHolt won\u2019t stop until the ocean is one big liquid wasteland,\u201d she said. \u201cIt would take a giant in order to stop him. Please. I\u2019m willing to trade my humanity in to get my husband to stop his destructive behavior.\u201d The skull let out a sigh. \u201cAnother customer who wants to punish the wicked,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this doesn\u2019t sound like revenge. Are you see that you\u2019re willing to go through with it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke just got on her hands and knees. \u201cPlease,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the destruction of nature\u2019s resources and I want to fight back.\u201d The skull then turned to his zombie assistant. \u201cAchilles,\u201d he said. \u201cGet the tub of enchanted Loch Ness water.\u201d The zombie nodded his head and then walked off. When he returned, he brought with him what looked like a large washtub filled with a glowing greenish-blue water as Brooke looked at the water. \u201cClimb in,\u201d said the skull. \u201cTake a bath in this mystical water and then in 12 hours, you will become the monster you wish. Achilles, take me into the next room. We don\u2019t want to be rude.\u201d As the zombie picked up the skull to walk away, Brooke gave a glare and then she started to soak into the water as its magical essence filled her body. A great transformation was about to begin.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Transformations take time to work. It\u2019s rare that we come across somebody who wants to transform. We\u2019ve been traveling around and this has happened a lot. This is precisely why this shop never stays too long in one place. Everywhere we go, we find fools who seek the cursed treasure of this shop. I remember one young man who took a ring from this store to give to his fianc\u00e9e and turned her into the world\u2019s largest and most powerful pegasus. I also remember in Greece, how a selfish man tried to steal a young woman\u2019s heart by turning her into a giant swan by buying a curse. There is also a story I can tell you about a man who bought his wife a pair of alligator shoes from this store and turned her into an actual alligator. So many people cursed and transformed without being able to return to their human forms. Yet you want to become a titan. Is your husband so vile that you would resort to drastic means?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke nodded her head and then took off her sunglasses to reveal her black eye again. \u201cHe gave me this black eye for arguing with him. He claims to be a great fisherman but is completely wasteful and abusive. I feel sorry for the fishes he catches. Holt doesn\u2019t even eat fish.\u201d The skull let out a growl. \u201cIt is amazing that humans are better at being monsters than actual monsters. Do with him as you wish, but know this, you have little to no hope of ever becoming a human again after you bath in these cursed waters. \u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d said Brooke. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that I\u2019ve married somebody who does nothing but make everyone around him miserable.\u201d \u201cThen why on Earth did you marry such an obvious louse.\u201d Brooke gave a look of sorrow. \u201cMy father was gravely injured in an accident and we didn\u2019t have a car at the time. I had no choice but to rely on a stranger for a ride. There I found Holt. He would get us to the hospital but I had to agree to..\u201d \u201cI see where this is going,\u201d said the skull. \u201cTo do something so awful, to drive his own wife to these extremes. I take back what I said. Your husband deserves the monster that you are about to unleash upon him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeak of the devil, Holt was yelling outside. \u201cBrooke!\u201d he yelled. \u201cWhere are you, you wandering bitch!? How many times do I have to tell you to stay where I can see you?!\u201d Brooke gasped and got out of the tub before she put back on her shirt, skirt and lifejacket, not even waiting until she was dry and then ran out of the shop. Achilles took the skull back out into the shop\u2019s main room. \u201cPay close attention, Achilles. Karma can be a very powerful and dangerous thing.\u201d The skull\u2019s zombie assistant nodded his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke ran out and was panting as Holt glared at her. \u201cWhere were you woman?!\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Holt. I was just...\u201d Holt then realized that Brooke was wet. \u201cWhy the hell are you so wet?\u201d asked Holt. \u201cWell,\u201d said Brooke. \u201cYou see...\u201d Holt let out a laugh. \u201cI know what happened. You fell in. You\u2019re such a child, Brooke. Now come on. I\u2019ve got some bait to get.\" Brooke gave a look of confusion. \"Bait?\" she asked. \"You didn't get any at the bait shop.\" Holt smirked evilly. \"I have a much better idea. One that's guaranteed to catch a fish.\u201d Brooke then gasped and as she was following Holt, she saw that her butt appeared to have gotten slightly bigger and her breasts looked like they were sticking out of her lifejacket. \u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s working. Just have to wait until tonight.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Holt was still up to no good. After a few hours, Holt had met with a man who handed him a suitcase. \u201cThere you are,\u201d said the dealer. \u201cI gotta say, the idea of using it as fish bait, it sort of reminds me of King of the Hill.\u201d Holt let out a scoff. \u201cThe difference is, I know what it is.\u201d Brooke looked in horror because that case contained drugs. \u201cHolt,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t fish with that stuff. It\u2019s dangerous to humans and poisonous to animals.\u201d But then Brooke yelled because Holt struck her. \u201cKnow your place, Brooke,\u201d said Holt. \u201cI do what I do.\u201d Brooke rubbed her face in pain as she and Holt were walking away and then Holt noticed how big Brooke's butt was on her skirt and smirked as he struck it and made Brooke scream. \"Got a lot more junk in the trunk than you usually do, don't you honey?\" Brooke was mumbling in pain. She growled. \"You can laugh all you want now, you horrible man. Because in a few more hours, I'm going to give you just what you deserve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke was about to get in the driver's seat and Holt threw her into the passenger seat as she grunted. \"What are you doing?\" asked Holt. \"It's illegal for women to drive. It's three hours from here back home and I ain't getting a ticket.\" \"It is so NOT illegal for women to drive, Holt,\" said Brooke angrily. \"I'm getting really sick of...\" Holt gave an angry glare. \"You want another shiner? Just keep quiet and know your place.\" On the drive home, Brooke's anger with Holt was growing and Brooke rubbed her stomach because it was getting bigger. \"That spell must be working,\" thought the young woman to herself. \"And soon Holt will...\" Brooke gasped because Holt was going too fast. \"Holt!\" yelled Brooke. \"This is a school zone!\" Brooke then screamed because she saw several young students about to pass a crosswalk only to gasp and run back to avoid being run over by Holt. \"Keep off of the road, brats!\" yelled Holt. Brooke was quickly losing her patience with her jerk of a husband and she couldn't wait any longer for the mystic waters to take their effect as her eyes were glowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, back home, Brooke was on the phone with her father. \"You don't have to worry about me anymore, Daddy. I'm finally going to divorce Holt. He's kept me like a prisoner and I've watched him commit atrocity after atrocity for far too long. What's he gonna do to me. I know he'd probably kill me before he agrees to a divorce but I'm not changing my mind.\" With that, Brooke hung up because she heard Holt coming. Brooke looked and saw that she had gotten slightly taller but she was also much fatter, she looked like she weighed 600lbs. \"Okay,\" said Brooke. \"It's going to be murder on my figure, but it will be worth it to get away from...\" \"Where's my dinner!?\" Holt came in and then saw Brooke. \"What the hell, Brooke! What happened to you? You look like you swallowed a hippopotamus.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke looked at her watch and smirked because it was almost past the 12 hours. She would soon be able to break away from her husband's tyranny. \"Well,\" said Holt. \"If you can get yourself monstrously fat, you can make yourself useful and get in the kitchen.\" \"Get your own dinner, bully.\" Holt gave a glare. \"What was that?\" \"You heard me. You're a bully and a fake fisherman and you're an misogynistic idiot. You see me as nothing more than a trophy. But no more, I want out of this farce you dare to call a marriage.\" Holt was now very enraged. \"Know your place, Brooke. You are still my wife. It's time I reminded you of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it looked like Holt would beat Brooke, Brooke\u2019s eyes glowed and she saw that her black hair turned dark green and that her skin was changing to a bright green color while her underbelly turned white with purple highlights and her stomach begun to expand. Brooke looked at her hands to see that they had sprouted webs. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?!\u201d asked Holt accusingly. Brooke just gave a very evil looking smirk as she wiggled her webbed fingers. \u201cYour bad karma.\u201d Brooke shook off her sandals to reveal that her toes were webbed as well as her thighs were expanding and she sprouted a rather long tail. Brooke\u2019s face then stretched into a snout and her teeth became razor sharp as she let out a dinosaur-like growl and her neck was stretching out as she let out a laugh. Holt became really afraid and took out a gun to try and shoot Brooke but Brooke snatched the gun with her teeth and crushed it as she growled and her clothes tore apart as she got bigger. In minutes, Brooke was a Loch Ness Monster and a big fat one. She was 18ft tall (28ft if you counted her neck), had a 26ft wide stomach and ass and huge E-cup breasts. She let out a roar and Holt screamed. Brooke stared down and growled. \u201cI\u2019ve put up with your abuse of me and of the fish for long enough, you bastard! You blackmailed me into marrying you and you\u2019ve been making my life a misery ever since.\" \"N-Now calm down, Brooke,\" said a clearly terrified Holt. \"Please. I can change, Baby. Just spare me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Brooke stared down at her husband, she was pondering what to do. He was begging for mercy. Brooke let out a scoff at the irony of a merciless and sadistic fish killer fearing for his own life and wanting mercy despite the fact that he himself would never consider showing mercy. If anything, he deserved to be eaten for his crimes. But Brooke was beginning to wonder. While the Loch Ness Monster has been around for thousands of years, there was no mention of whether or not she ate humans. Then again, Brook felt her new Loch Ness Monster teeth and realized that they were clearly the teeth of a carnivore. But the diet of the creature she had morphed into wasn\u2019t the only factor. Would it really be okay if Brooke ate the man who abused her and harmed nature for so long. Would it make her as bad as him? While Brooke was busy thinking the matter over, Holt tried to inch towards the door as the Loch Ness giantess was distracted. However, Brooke wrapped her tail around Holt and then glared at him as she was preparing to make her decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, the Loch Ness Monster woman decides to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Holt looked up in pure fear as Brooke was trying to decide what to do with him. Then he remembered that he had a knife and gave a smirk. He took out the knife and was going to try and slash his wife\u2019s tail. However, Brooke lowered her neck and destroyed the tip of the blade with her sharp teeth. Holt let out a scream. \u201cSo,\u201d says Brooke. \u201cYou\u2019d really stab your own wife. You\u2019ll never change, Holt. You\u2019ll always be a heartless monster who needlessly preys on the weak. You\u2019re worse than an animal because you do it for fun. But now you\u2019re on the bottom of the food chain. You\u2019re about to get what you deserve. And it\u2019s going to be delicious.\u201d Brooke opened her mouth filled with deceptively sharp teeth that people would not expect the Loch Ness Monster to have and Holt looked in pure fear at what his wife had planned for him. \u201cDon\u2019t do this, Brooke! This is cannibalism! I\u2019m a human being!\u201d \u201cFunny,\u201d said Brooke sadistically. \u201cThen why didn\u2019t you ever act like one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke let out a growl and lowered her head as Holt let out a final scream at her mouth opened wide. Brooke grabbed her husband head first with her jaws before lifting him up into the air for him to slide screaming down her throat. Because of how fat Brooke\u2019s neck was, there was barely even a bulge to signify Holt\u2019s trip down his wife\u2019s 10ft long esophagus. Once Brooke had successfully swallowed her husband, the Loch Ness Monster woman let out a loud belch. \u201cFigures you\u2019d give me gas, Holt,\u201d said Brooke as she punched her own 26ft wide stomach. \u201cYou made me miserable throughout our marriage so now you\u2019ll make it up by becoming assimilated into my body. Oh, I love karma.\u201d Brooke let out a laugh. \u201cIt was a good thing I found that magic shop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly something occurred to Brooke. \u201cOh my,\u201d she said. \u201cThe skull! He said this transformation would be permanent. Huh, I guess I didn\u2019t think this through.\u201d Brooke then let out another loud belch and held her stomach before letting out a slight fart that knocked over the table. \u201cUgh,\u201d she said. \u201cShould\u2019ve known the bastard would give me an upset stomach. But I can\u2019t think about him anymore. He\u2019s over and done.\u201d Brooke\u2019s stomach grumbled as the Loch Ness giantess tried to squeeze herself through the doorway. In the process she tore it off the hinges. Brooke let out a groan but then heard the phone ringing and stretched out her tail to pick it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello,\u201d she said nervously. \u201cOh. Hi, Daddy. Well, I didn\u2019t exactly go as planned with the divorce. I kind of swallowed him. No, you heard that right. I found a magic shop and willingly allowed myself to be turned into the Loch Ness Monster to... wait, you believe that? Wait, when did you see somebody turn into the Jersey Devil? Okay, not the time. Listen, what do I...? I got it, I need to return to the lake to get used to this new body. Hey, what\u2019s that about me saving you the trouble. Never mind. Thanks. I\u2019ll talk to you later.\u201d Brooke hung up and then started to walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDaddy\u2019s never steered me wrong before,\u201d she said to herself. \u201cMaybe I wouldn\u2019t have had resorted to such drastic measures if I had listened to him about marrying a creep.\u201d Brooke was sweating as she waddled and panted. She moved rather clumsily, accidentally stepping on a few bikes in the process as she was making her way towards the lake. \u201cOuch. You know, maybe I should\u2019ve tried to turn myself into a creature more suited to land and water. Live and learn, Brooke.\u201d As Brooke was walking she was getting bigger and at this point, her body was 30ft high, her stomach expanded to 45ft wide, her ass expanded to 40ft wide and her neck elongated to 30ft long. She was breathing heavily and paused to take a slight rest, albeit accidentally stepping on a car and setting off the alarm in the process. Panicked, the Loch Ness giantess ran clumsily away before anyone could see her. \u201cI definitely need to get the better hang of being on land in this new body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Brooke had managed to reach the lake and breathed out a sigh of relief as her enormous body touched the water. She took a deep breath and swam underneath the lake as she waved her tail and enormous neck back and forth. \u201cNow,\u201d she said. \u201cThis feels more natural. I better lay low here for a while. I don\u2019t want any unwanted attention.\u201d Brooke then poked her head out of the water and saw the shop in the distance but then it mysteriously disappeared and she looked in surprise. \u201cWell,\u201d she said as she rolled her eyes. \u201cI guess that\u2019s perfectly normal. After all, it\u2019s a magic shop. I can\u2019t expect it to stay in one place. Maybe they\u2019ll be helping another girl with her problems.\u201d Brooke then took a deep breathe before diving down into the water again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, while she got rid of one problem, the Loch Ness Monster giantess\u2019s newfound size and weight would attract other problems. At that moment....</span></div></div>",

She was busy lifting weights. Given how big her body was, she didn\u2019t really need it. But she was that obsessed. She even slammed her hand into the table to shatter it. \u201cI\u2019m not changing my mind, Garth,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m going to make it so in case that creep ever comes back, I\u2019ll rip him apart.\u201d\u2028\u2028Garth rolled his eyes as he sat down. Last week, Katherine was mugged and her grandmother\u2019s necklace was stolen from her. Garth was busy picking up their son from school and was unable to prevent what happened and was horrified that Katherine would be attacked in broad daylight. While the police assured Katherine that her identification of the crook would allow them to catch him in no time, Katherine was so paranoid that she decided to take action into her own hands. She bought a lot of gym equipment and currently she bulked herself up to She-Hulk size. However, that wasn\u2019t enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKath,\u201d said Garth. \u201cAll of this is going to wake up Milo and he has that spelling test to worry about tomorrow. He needs his sleep.\u201d Katherine let out a sigh. \u201cI\u2019ll try not to wake up Milo, but what if I was attacked and he was with me. I need to be ready in case of another mugging. Just check out these guns.\u201d Katherine held out her muscles. \u201cThose look pretty good.\u201d \u201cNot good enough,\u201d said Katherine. \u201cI need to be twice as big as I am now.\u201d With that, Katherine went to work out on the treadmill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarth was wondering what to do when he looked out the window and saw a homeless man in green rags and a metal face mask feeding pigeons and figured that with the stress Katherine was going through making her unapproachable, Garth needed somebody to talk to and then went out to meet with the rather strange man. \u201cI\u2019ll bet you don\u2019t have to worry about muggers, sir,\u201d said Garth. \u201cYou don\u2019t have anything worth stealing.\u201d The man in green then grunted slightly before he woke up. \u201cGot a moment?\u201d asked Garth as he held up a bottle of wine.\u201d The man in green raised an eyebrow. \u201cWhat do you seek from Erlking?\u201d Garth let out a sigh. \u201cI just need somebody to talk to. It\u2019s my wife, Catherine.\u201d \u201cHoo boy,\u201d groaned Erlking. \u201cMarital trouble?\u201d \u201cYou might say that. My wife was mugged last week and is obsessed with making sure it doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d \u201cThis is Chicago.\u201d Said Erlking. Garth let out a groan. \u201cShe\u2019s obsessed with becoming invincible and is working herself into a frenzy trying to make her body stronger.\u201d Erlking took out a pair of binoculars and saw the bodybuilder that was Katherine working on a treadmill and his jaw dropped. \u201cHoly cow,\u201d he said. \u201cShe looks like she could give Hercules a run for his money.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarth shook his head. \u201cBut it\u2019s still not enough. She\u2019s gonna work until her body breaks. I wish that she was the strongest wrestler there was so she could forget about this nonsense.\u201d This gave Erlking an idea. \u201cDid I hear the word \u201cwish\u201d? That\u2019s my specialty.\u201d Garth raised an eyebrow. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Erlking gave a smile. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t look it, but I\u2019m a wish granter. I don\u2019t want anything in return but to grant your wish.\u201d Garth was even more confused. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me that you can make Katherine as strong as she\u2019ll ever need to be? Is that true?\u201d Erlking smiled. \u201cWhat do you want to believe?\u201d Garth didn\u2019t know what to say, but the way he saw it, he didn\u2019t have much to lose. \u201cOkay, Erlking. Release the magic.\u201d Suddenly wind filled the air as Erlking was getting ready to cast a spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI say, 1, 2, spell me do,\u201d chanted Erlking. \u201cLet this young man\u2019s wish come true. Here me high, hear me well, let me be this spell.\u201d As Erlking worked his magic, a spell enveloped Katherine just as she was busy lifting a couple of weights and there was suddenly the roar of a lion ringing in her ears as she grunted. However, she just shrugged it off and then she went back to lifting weights, not noticing her hair was turning a brighter shade of gold and she sprouted what looked like a lion\u2019s tail. At one point, Katherine accidentally dropped a dumbbell on her bare foot and to her surprise, the dumbbell bounced harmlessly off her skin. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d asked the female bodybuilder, not noticing that her belly seemed to be getting larger as it glowed bright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Erlking gave a smile as he spoke with Garth. \u201cGarth,\u201d he said. \u201cHave you heard of the Nemean lion?\u201d \u201cUh,\u201d said Garth. \u201cNo. Why do you ask?\u201d Erlking let out a laugh and then faded away as Garth gave a look of confusion. \u201cI hope I didn\u2019t do anything I\u2019m going to regret later.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day, early in the morning, Katherine made a startling discovery as she looked at herself in her mirror in her yellow leotard, her leg warmers and martial arts headband. \u201cGarth!\u201d she shouted. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with this mirror!?\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with the mirror, Dear.\u201d Said Garth. \u201cThen how come I need three of them to see myself.\u201d Garth gave a look of confusion and then turned and looked in surprise at his wife. All of Katherine\u2019s muscles had been replaced with a massive hunk of fat. She even had a triple chin. She also looked like she was taller than she was yesterday. Katherine gave an angry look as she turned around and slapped her chunky butt. \u201cHow did you gain so much weight so fast?\u201d asked Garth. \u201cYou were like the Incredible Hulk last night! Come to think about it, I didn\u2019t see you eat anything since dinner last night and all you had to eat was a salad.\u201d Katherine grit her teeth. \u201cHow the heck am I supposed to scare a mugger looking like this.\u201d \u201cLook at the bright side,\u201d said Garth as he clutched part of his wife\u2019s enormous belly. \"A gut that size must be bullet proof. Besides, it's not like your granny's necklace could fit on you if you got it back. Look at that thick neck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatherine gave a glare at her husband. \"Look,\" said Garth. \"I have to go to work early this morning. You can work off that flab taking Milo to school.\" Katherine grunted as her husband kissed her goodbye and left. On his way to work, Garth was wondering how his wife became so huge and then he realized something. \"Oh my,\" he said. \"That wish. I wonder.\" Back home, Katherine walked on the treadmill and turned it on as her stomach pressed against the controls. She ran frantically on the treadmill and set it to full power. But no matter how much Katherine ran and sweated, she didn't lose any of the weight she gained. By the time she was done, she stepped on the bathroom scale and it read that she weighed 1/2 a ton right before it broke beneath her weight. \"Are you kidding me?\" asked Katherine. \"How did I gain this much weight?\" \"Mom?\" asked a voice. Katherine walked out and saw her son Milo climbing down the stairs to go to school. He looked in surprise at his mom's weight gain but said nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatherine escorted Milo out the door, albeit breaking the door frame in the process and was soon walking Milo to school. Milo then noticed something strange. \"Mom,\" he said. \"How long have you had a tail?\" Katherine looked in confusion, not noticing the lion's tail she sprouted. \"What tail? Milo, don't give me a hard time today. This massive weight gain is too much. I still can't believe that...\" Suddenly, Katherine had to stop as somebody held a knife dangerously close to her neck. Katherine and Milo had walked right up to another mugger. \"Nice earrings, Garfield,\" said the hoodlum mocking Katherine's weight. \"I'll be taking them.\" Katherine turned her head to face Milo. \"Stay back, Milo,\" she told her son before she turned to face the mugger again. \"Listen, buster. One of your jackasses already stole my grandmother's necklace. I've been working hard to prepare myself for punks like you, so if you don't get out of my way, you're toast.\" The mugger let out a laugh. \"It looks like you've had enough toast already, land whale.\" Katherine grit her teeth. \"Don't say that I didn't...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Katherine\u2019s voice turned into a growl that evolved into a loud roar. \u201cWhat the?!\u201d yelled the mugger. \u201cMom?\u201d asked Milo. Katherine\u2019s teeth became rather sharp as her pink fingernails turned into sharp claws. She also increased in weight again to the point where her leg warmings were being torn apart and her leotard was stretching out, letting her breasts free. That was when bright platinum fur grew all over her body as her fold hair begun to reach down to her butt that was now bigger than it was before. Katherine\u2019s ears became more feline in appearance as she started to grow larger and larger. Milo quickly moved out of the way as his mother stepped back and crushed a car under her massive foot. Finally, Katherine\u2019s eyes became bloodshot and feline like in appearance as her chin and underbelly turned white and she sprouted whiskers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mugger looked up and muttered in fear as he looked up. The woman he had tried to mug had transmogrified into a 60ft tall Nemean lioness. Her butt and belly were both 80ft wide and her breasts had expanded to H-cup size. The lioness let out a loud roar into the air once the transformation was complete. She then looked around her new form. She was now an lioness as big as Godzilla and as fat as 5 sumo wrestlers in a tattered yellow leotard and a martial arts headband. \u201cM-Mom,\u201d said Milo nervously. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d Katherine looked at her reflection in an office building, ignoring the horrified workers inside and then gave a satisfied smirk. She let out a purring laugh right before she looked down on the terrified mugger. The mugger tried to stab Katherine in the toe but the knife broke against Katherine\u2019s indestructible skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028This only made the rather large lioness purr even more. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened,\u201d said Katherine in a much deeper voice. \u201cBut I LOVE the results.\u201d Katherine then grabbed the mugger and squeezed him tight before she brought him to her face and smirked. The mugger was scared to death as he was sure that the lion giantess\u2019s plans weren\u2019t good. Even Milo was scared at his mother\u2019s sinister expression. \u201cMom,\u201d says Milo. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to eat him are you?\u201d Katherine let out a laugh. \u201cCome on, Milo,\u201d said the lioness to her son as she put him on her shoulder. \u201cWhat do I look like? An animal? I\u2019m just going to take this punk downtown.\u201d With that, the gigantic cat woman stomped down the street as everybody looked in surprise and horror at the enormous feline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatherine arrived outside of the police station and dropped off the mugger as the cops looked in surprise. Katherine gave a purr. \u201cThis little creep tried to mug me as I was bringing my son to school,\u201d said the giant lioness. \u201cCould you do me a favor and put him away for me. Thanks.\u201d The lion giantess waddled away down the street as the police looked on in surprise. In the process, she accidentally bumped her butt against a condemned building and made it collapse. It wasn\u2019t long before Katherine dropped her son off at school and everyone in the area stared at the lioness giantess. One of the teachers even cleaned his glasses while another one threw out a cup of coffee she was drinking. \u201cHey,\u201d said Katherine to Milo. \u201cGood luck on the test. I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d \u201cBye, Mom.\u201d Said Milo nervously as the gigantic lioness stomped away. The principal saw Katherine walking away and gave an angry look. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I bet a certain red-haired scientist had something to do with it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatherine looked at her reflection in another office building and let out a sigh. She noticed that she looked even fatter than she was earlier. \u201cDamn,\u201d said the lioness. \u201cI\u2019m a blimp. There\u2019s no way I could shake off this much meat. Oh well. Just because I can\u2019t lose this weight doesn\u2019t mean that I gotta be slothful. I better make sure I can get used to carrying this much weight.\" With that, the skyscraper-sized lion decided to go...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Katherine decided to take a jog around the city and immediately took off as much as her car-crushing fat feet could take her. The obese feline smiled as she ran down the street, being careful not to step on anybody. But everywhere she went, everyone stared at the fat Godzilla-sized lioness in leg warmers. The sun shined on Katherine's platinum fur as she stopped at a \"Don't Walk\" sign. Down below the people waiting at the stop looked in surprise and moved out of the way as Katherine was jogging in place, waiting for the light to change. \"Wait a minute,\" said the feline. \"What am I doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatherine simply stepped over to the other side of the street, knowing that she was too big to have to wait for the light to change. She giggled to herself right as the light changed. As the lioness jogged, she looked into the side of a skyscraper and saw how big her belly and butt were. She at first was distressed but felt her arms and legs to discover there was still muscle buried under tons of flab and then jogged around the skyscraper, accidentally crushing several streetlights in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Katherine realized something. \"Hmm,\" she said. \"The building Garth works at is nearby. Maybe I should have some fun with that little husband of mine.\" The lioness knew that her husband was a reporter for the Daily Papyrus and realized that he was going to find out about her transformation sooner or later, so she decided to go for sooner.\" At that moment, Garth had been called into his boss's office. \"You wanted to see me, Sir?\" asked Garth. The editor snuffed out his cigar before he spoke with Garth. \"Reed,\" he said. \"I just got several calls from people who claim to have seen a lion jogging down the street.\" \"Impossible. There isn't a zoo for miles.\" \"This isn't an ordinary lion, Reed. The lion was jogging down the street. And that's not all. Eyewitness accounts say that this lion is 60ft tall and built like a sumo wrestler.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarth lets out a laugh. \"You're kidding, Chief. A lion that big? That's not possible.\" \"I'm only telling you what I was told. A giant lion in leg warmers was jogging down the street. She stepped on several street lamps.\" \"She? Okay, Boss. Let's say that this giant lion is real. How do they know it's a girl?\" Garth's boss slapped himself in the face. \"You honestly can't tell the difference between a male and female lion?! It probably didn't have mane. This is news. I'm asking you to find out more about this mysterious feline.\" But Garth was uninterested. \"I'm not going on a wild goose chase. What makes you so sure this lion exists.\" Garth's boss dropped his jaw and pointed to the window behind Garth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarth turned around and looked in disbelief as he saw Katherine staring in at him. At first he didn't know the 60ft lioness was his wife and stepped back in fear before Katherine smiled. \"Hey, Garth.\" Garth dropped his jaw as he recognized his wife's voice. \"Katherine!? Is that you?\" Katherine gave a purr. \"I'll see you at dinner, Honey.\" Katherine then extended her football field sized tongue into the window to lick her husband as he screamed and then walked away. Garth could not believe it. \"My wife is a Nemean lion,\" he muttered. \"My wife is a Nemean lion.\" Garth's boss was just as surprised. \"This is the first I've heard of this, Reed. Why didn't you tell me you married a giant lion!?\" \"Because she <i>wasn't</i> a giant lion when I married her!\" Garth then gasped. \"Oh my gosh. Yesterday, I wished to a strange old hobo in green rags that Katherine would be as strong as she needed to be and this must be the result.\" Garth's boss couldn't believe it. \"A wish granter? Now that's a story I'd pay a million bucks to read. I'm going to need you to keep an eye on that feline wife of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatherine at this point kept walking and from the looks of it, she was getting bigger and fatter as she walked by and it was at that point the giant lioness...</span></div></div>",

She\u2019s been a magician ever since he met her, but sometimes he wondered how much of it was stage magic or if she was a real sorceress. He remembered that on their honeymoon, he took him for a walk in the air, without the plane. Suddenly, Deborah realized something. \u201cOh dang,\u201d she said. \u201cBruce. I almost forgot. I can\u2019t go on stage without my hat and it\u2019s being repaired.\u201d \u201cWhat? You go on in half an hour and you forget about it now?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t judge me,\u201d said Deborah. \u201cBruce, could you be a dear and pick up my hat.\u201d Bruce shrugged his shoulders. \u201cSure thing, Deborah. I\u2019ll go get it.\u201d \u201cLove you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, down the street from the haberdasher at the exact moment was something that definitely wasn\u2019t something to take at all lightly. Down the street, there was a strange curio shop with a minotaur skull in the center and from the looks of it, a zombie dressed up as a Greek soldier was sweeping up while there was an open window with wind blowing in. \u201cAchilles,\u201d said the skull. \u201cWould you please shut that window. That wind is driving me crazy.\u201d The zombie heeded the bidding of the skull but it was too late because the wind picked up a top hat that looked similar to Deborah\u2019s own hat and blew it out the window. It was flying towards the haberdasher shop where the haberdasher put Deborah\u2019s real hat on the table. The moment his back was turned, the wind took the other hat and blew it onto the table where it knocked Deborah\u2019s real hat onto the floor, not that the shopkeeper noticed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Bruce came in. \u201cHello,\u201d he said. \u201cAnybody here.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d said the shopkeeper. \u201cBruce. I trust you\u2019ve come to pick up Deborah\u2019s hat.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Bruce paid for what he thought was Deborah\u2019s hat and took it to get his magician wife ready for the show. However, what he didn\u2019t know was that the hat he bought was in fact a real magic hat and it was going to make quite a show that even the great Deborah Dazzle couldn\u2019t dream of putting on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the show was about to begin and Bruce had brought Deborah that hat. \u201cHmm,\u201d she said. \u201cIt feels differently than I remember. I wonder what they used to patch it up.\u201d \u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry about it, Deb,\u201d said Bruce. \u201cThe crowd is waiting, the stage is light.\u201d Deborah kissed Bruce before taking out her wand. \u201cWish me luck, Baby.\u201d She said. However, as Deborah was looking away, she failed to notice magical energy radiating from her hat. Bruce noticed this and gasped. \u201cUh, Deborah?\u201d Deborah turned her head. \u201cWhat is it, Bruce?\u201d \u201cUh, nothing.\u201d Bruce noticed that Deborah\u2019s thighs looked thicker than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, jazz music was playing and Deborah appeared on the stage in a burst of smoke as the crowd cheered. \u201cLadies and Gentlemen,\u201d said the female magician as she smiled. \u201cBoys and Girls. Let me take you on a trip to wicked wonderland.\u201d Deborah held up her hat and summoned several doves and crows from it as the audience cheered. Then, Deborah cast another spell and conjured up a dragon made of smoke and made it roar loudly. The crowd cheered at that but Bruce noticed something. Deborah had done several realistic magic tricks before but these looked too realistic. Deborah\u2019s next trick caused her hand to fall off and appear in her hat as she held it out. The dismembered hand even snapped its fingers to make a deck of cards appear in the air. The hand tossed the queen of hearts up into the air to make orchids fly into the air and even land in one girl\u2019s hand in the audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeborah herself was noticing something off. \u201cThat\u2019s odd,\u201d she thought to herself. \u201cI could\u2019ve sworn I used way less orchids than that.\u201d Then Deborah gave a cough. \u201cAnd now,\u201d she said. \u201cFor my next trick...\u201d Deborah conjured up a snake from her hat that danced as Deborah turned her wand into a recorder before the snake completely turned invisible, all except for its eyes and the patterns on its body as it wrapped around the magician master and then vanished up her sleeve before confetti flew out of the other sleeve. Deborah then started to wiggle her nose as the crowd continued to cheer and clap. \u201cAlright,\u201d said Deborah. \u201cMy next trick calls for something that\u2019s out of this world. What happens next will be totally unexpected.\u201d The audience looked in anticipation at that claim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before Deborah could go on with the act, strange magical energy exited out of her hat and enveloped in smoke as she gave a look of surprise. However, the crowd gasped in awe because they thought that it was part of the act. \u201cDeborah?\u201d asked Preston. The smoke enveloped Deborah as her nose begun to wiggle. Deborah realized that her nose had turned pink and bright white fur was growing all over her body. She then grabbed her cheeks to find they were expanding and she felt creaking because she appeared to be getting bigger and heavily. Her feet slipped out of her stilettos to reveal that they had turned into paws and then Deborah saw her butt expanding as a round and fluffy tail the size of a medicine ball sprouted above her fleshy white-furred nylon-covered massive butt cheeks. Deborah then felt her ears stretching out and gasped to see that she sprouted buckteeth. Then she saw that silver antlers had sprouted on her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDumbfounded, the female magician put her hat back on and then the smoke cleared as the audience looked in surprise at what had become of the magician that was entertaining them. Bruce looked at his wife himself and gasped because Deborah had transformed into a 45ft high jackalope with a 50ft wide belly and 60ft wide butt. She looked back in surprise herself. \u201cHow exactly did she do that?\u201d asked Bruce. Deborah looked in fear but then she heard cheering and looked to see that her audience liked the transformation and mistook it for part of the act, prompting the mutated magician to smile rather nervously.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And now, for the big finale.\" Deborah gave a smile and took off her hat before looking into it. \"This isn't my hat,\" thought the rabbit giantess to herself. \"This is a cursed magic hat. But where did it come from? Oh well.\" Deborah then reached into her hat as Bruce looked in confusion from backstage. \"What is Deborah doing?\" he asked. \"I never saw that trick b...\" Before Bruce could finish his sentence, he was yanked up. On the stage, Deborah pulled Bruce by the shirt out of the hat as he gasped and the audience looked in awe. Deborah smiled as she held her husband in the air. \"It's a new twist on an old trick.\" The audience cheered loudly as Deborah smiled and wiggled her nose. \"Thank you. I'll be here all night.\" Deborah then snapped her fingers and she and her husband vanished backstage as the crowd was clapping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBackstage, Deborah laid Bruce on her nose and stared at him. \"That was amazing, Deborah,\" said Bruce. \"Why didn't you tell me that you were going to turn yourself into a giant jackalope? Okay, Deborah, you can change back now.\" Deborah stared at her husband and frowned. \"No, Bruce. I can't.\" \"You can't? What do you mean you can't?\" Deborah held up her hat and gave a glare. \"This hat you brought back from the haberdasher wasn't my magician hat. It was some kind of cursed magic hat that turned me into a big fat bunny.\" Bruce's jaw dropped as he slipped and fell into the rabbit's enormously bloated cleavage. \"You're kidding me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeborah crossed her arms. \"Bruce,\" she said. \"I'm a sorceress. I know a curse when I see one and I don't think that this curse is reversible. Which means from now on, you're sleeping in my panties.\" Bruce let out a groan but then he realized something. \"Wait, Deborah. This might not be such a bad thing. The crowd loved it when you turned into a jackalope.\" Deborah realized her husband had a point, the crowd did love the sight of a giant bunny on the stage, especially the children. The rabbit giantess held up the cursed hat and cast a spell to make popcorn explode out of the hat. Each piece of popcorn was as big as a wrecking ball. Deborah took a handful and shoveled it in. \"You know, Bruce,\" said the obese rabbit giantess. \"You might be onto something.\" Deborah handed her husband a piece of the popcorn and he nearly was crushed by it before he maintained his footing. \"I can see it now,\" said Bruce. \"Deborah Dazzle, the world's biggest magician.\" Deborah let out a laugh but then grunted in pain. Her nylons were now very tight on her enormous butt cheeks. \"I think I need bigger stockings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce had to plug his nose to prevent it from bleeding as he saw his wife's enormous butt murdering the floor beneath her hulk and then Deborah lifted Bruce in the air again. \"We're going to need to rethink our act, but first thing is first.\" Deborah placed Bruce on her shoulder before she started to walk away. The rabbit giantess walked down the street as everyone looked up at her. \"There she is.\" \"Deborah Dazzle?\" \"Now that's a magic trick.\" \"Loved your show, Ms. Dazzle.\" Deborah smiled nervously and waved. \"Say, Mrs. Dazzle,\" said a young girl. \"Why don't you turn back now. The show is over.\" Deborah laughed nervously. \"As embarrassing as it is, Little Girl,\" said Deborah. \"I don't know the spell to turn back. Magic can be very fickle.\" Deborah tipped the hat and then she noticed the strange magic shop with the skull. \"Aha,\" she said. \"That must be where this naughty hat came from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeborah then lifted up the shop, causing the minotaur skull to fall to the floor and grunt. \"What the? Achilles! What is going on!?\" The skull say Deborah's car-sized eye in the wild and gasped. Deborah took off the cursed hat and made it shrink back to normal size before tossing it into the store where it landed on one of the skull's horns. \"I believe this is yours.\" Deborah then placed the store on top of a skyscraper and gave a laugh before walking away to get her real hat. The skull let out a groan. \"That's the first time one of the giantesses created by our merchandise actually retaliated. Achilles, let's get out of here before we get into any more trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeborah and Bruce arrived at the haberdasher's shop and the shopkeeper nervously stepped outside with Deborah's hat. \"I'm really sorry, Mrs. Dazzle. It was an honest mistake. Deborah put the hat on but realized it was too small for her, so she snapped her fingers to make it the correct size for a 45ft jackalope who would weigh 2 tons if she was human sized.\" At that moment, Deborah heard a phone ringing and Bruce took his cellphone out. \"Hello? Oh, how's you like the show. Oh, sure, we'll be there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce hung up and Deborah lifted her tiny husband up to her head as she sat her fat ass on three office buildings at the same time. \"What was that about, Bruce?\" asked the enormous rabbit. \"That was a client,\" said Bruce. \"And good news.

I made the character a cyborg Frankenstein in order to avoid breaking that rule)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Internet is a dangerous place (lately all the fun websites have been plagued with viruses due to idiot hackers, this is coming from somebody who had to have his own computer debugged). You could be walking right into a website filled with dangerous bugs. Of course, one young woman found herself dealing with a different kind of computer virus that proved to be a real hassle. It happened in a caf\u00e9 where a young black-haired girl with thin glasses was sitting at a table with her boyfriend and was looking at her computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl was laughing to herself. \u201cCome on, Don, look at this. Somebody posted a video of a cat jumping around in a bounce house.\u201d Don let out a groan. \u201cCome on, May,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s different entertainment from the internet.\u201d However, May shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d May then shifted to an online chatroom and there was an image of what looked like a giant flamingo in Italy. \u201cGiant flamingo spotted in Italy?\u201d May then opened another file that showed an ostrich giantess doing parkour with the Eiffel tower. \u201cGiant ostrich spotted in Paris?\u201d May then let out a laugh because she then saw an image that depicted a giant tyrannosaurus rex with glasses on and a girlish haircut walking around a college campus. \u201cGive me a break, May,\u201d said Don. \u201cThose images are clearly fake. They put a lot of weird stuff on the Internet. To say nothing about how they twist even the most harmless things. Heck, I can\u2019t even find a website without a new TV on it being talked about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Don. Check it out. I found an awesome website for female monsters.\u201d Don shook his head. He knew he was wasting his time trying to speak with his girlfriend about her internet addiction.\u201d Suddenly, May received a notification. \u201cOh, look at this, Don. I\u2019ve got a new e-mail.\u201d \u201cNew e-mail?\u201d he asked. \u201cFrom who?\u201d \u201cIt doesn\u2019t say. There\u2019s no e-mail address.\u201d But Don was skeptical. \u201cNo e-mail address?\u201d he asked. \u201cThat\u2019s impossible. How can an e-mail not have a sender address? What\u2019s the subject?\u201d May adjusted her glasses in order to get a good look at what was posted. \u201cFrankenstein XY.\u201d May then opened the e-mail and saw nothing but gobbledygook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe email read \u201cR2D4, 6191141219 11710226.\u201d \u201cWhat the heck is this?\u201d asked Don. \u201cI can\u2019t even read it? Hold on, May, this looks like the kind of e-mails that offshore casinos send you.\u201d \u201cYou mean a virus e-mail, Don. That\u2019s\u2026\u201d Suddenly something appeared on May\u2019s computer. \u201cCaution, Unknown Software.\u201d \u201cOh no,\u201d said May. \u201cA virus. I\u2019ll show them.\u201d May inserted a flashdrive with an anti-virus in it and smiled. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s drop a train on them.\u201d However, the computer just spat out the flashdrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d asked May in surprise. Don let out a gulp. \u201cSomething tells me that is not an ordinary computer virus.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Don. I\u2019m just going to take it to the repair shop.\u201d May put the computer in her purse and walked away. \u201cAre you sure you shouldn\u2019t put that laptop in a case made out of lead, May?\u201d asked Don to his girlfriend. \u201cMay! Wait!\u201d May was at this point far away and she felt her computer letting loose strange electrical currents. \u201cGeez,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is one really bad tempered virus.\u201d Then May screamed because she suddenly felt a very nasty electric shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay grunted and while she didn\u2019t notice at the time, she had grown to 13ft tall and she appeared to have been getting fatter. Currently she looked like she weighed a ton. But that wasn\u2019t the only thing wrong with her. Her skin was changing colors in different places and looked like it was patchwork and a white streak appeared in her black hair as bolts sprouted in her neck.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>May could not even begin to think about the possibility that her body was being transmogrified. Instead, she was focused on her computer issue. She was trying to recover from the electric shock. \u201cThe sooner that I get this thing to the repair shop, the better. I\u2019m surprised that electric shock didn\u2019t kill me. At this point, May\u2019s body was mysteriously sprouting mechanical stitches that separated parts of her body that looked like they were mismatched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst her head was divided with her chin and mouth area being pure white while her much chubbier cheeks had turned bright purple and her forehead turned light blue Her neck itself had become completely mechanical with a pair of large bolts keeping it together with electrical wires coming from the back of her neck into her back. May\u2019s breasts that were showing as they were quickly outgrowing her shirt looked as though thy were stitched to her upper chest that was as pure white as her chin. Each breast was vertically split-colored so that one side was red and the other side was yellow whereas her large stomach was bright green. Her arms were mechanical at the shoulders and were a more metallic shade of green with bolts sticking out like shoulder decorations. Her upper arms were purple white her lower arms were light blue with metal hands that had wires connecting them to her fat back that was pure white with numerous rolls. May\u2019s enormous hips were bright green with white and yellow split colored ankles and metal knees. It was unknown about her feet as they had swelled up that her shoes were stuck to them. Finally, the girl\u2019s butt cheeks were split colored to be green at the sides but purple in the center. May\u2019s black hair with its new white highlights was stretched down and acted as a cape over her ass as she was quickly outgrowing her clothes. May then grunted and blinked as her eyes turned into electronic eyes. She was human once but now she was a mountain of flesh and metal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time May reached the bus stop she was an 18ft tall Frankenstein\u2019s monster woman with a 20ft wide booty and 25ft wide stomach and large E-Cup breasts. However, May had no idea how big she had gotten and didn\u2019t notice that at the bus stop sitting at the bench was a young man who was listening to a boom box. The young man lifted his glasses and gasped at the sight of the green and purple split-colored ass of the Frankenstein giantess descending upon him and then had to move out of the way right before May sat down and smashed the bench to pieces as she yelled pain. \u201cWhat the?\u201d she asked. \u201cDamn. What kind of cheap defective benches are they building these days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Frankenstein giantess, still very unaware of her condition was pouting as she sat down on the street and passersby stared at her in surprise. \u201cWhat on Earth is that?\u201d asked one middle-aged man. \u201cIt looks like Frankenstein\u2019s monster.\u201d \u201cNo way, it looks like his bride.\u201d \u201cLook at how fat she is though.\u201d \u201cWell, you know how all brides let themselves go.\u201d \u201cMaybe it\u2019s a prop. That\u2019s it. I heard they were going to be shooting a monster movie here in town. The things they\u2019re doing with antimatronics these days.\u201d May however, was paying no heed and was still waiting for the bus. However, May soon grew tired and shut her eyes as she held her hand to her patchwork face and let out a yawn. She was going into sleep mode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028A few hours later, Don was still at the cyber cafe but was looking at his cell phone with a puzzled expression. \u201cThat\u2019s very strange,\u201d he said. \u201cMay should\u2019ve called by now. And the computer repair store is closed by now. I better go look for her.\u201d The moment Don stepped outside, it had begun to rain and and thunderclouds were in the air. Don had to hold up an umbrella as he was on his way to find his girlfriend. \u201cMay?!\u201d he yelled. \u201cMay?!\u201d Don then resorted to trying to call May on her phone but he didn\u2019t get an answer. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a good sign,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere could she be in this bad weather with that bad computer. Oh my gosh, what if she electrocuted herself? That computer was spitting out electric bolts. I\u2019m coming May! Maybe I\u2019m not too late!\u201d Don ran down the street as the rain came down faster. \u201cMay! May! May! Where are you!?\u201d Eventually Don bumped into something rather large and let out a loud moan. \u201cOh!\u201d he yelled. \u201cWhat the hell?!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon then looked up and screamed. He spotted May in her Frankenstein form, catatonic and asleep. However, she had gotten much bigger than before. She was exactly 60ft tall with a 95ft stomach and 80ft wide ass and huge H-Cup breasts. Don stepped back as he looked at the patchwork and partially mechanical giantess with wires sticking out of her arms and back. He then saw the computer wedged in her navel and recognized it as May\u2019s computer right before it sparked again and exploded to bits. Don rubbed his eyes in disbelief. \u201cMay?!\u201d he yelled. \u201cThat titan is May!? What the?! Oh no, the virus! I can\u2019t believe it. A computer virus that can turn you into Frankenstein\u2019s monster? May! Wake up!\u201d However, May didn\u2019t respond as the rain kept beating down on her titanic body. \u201cMay!\u201d yelled Don. \u201cPlease wake up now! Please wake up!\u201d May still didn\u2019t respond. Don then tapped on May\u2019s metallic knee and then tried kicking her on her large fleshy hip but nothing could wake her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the sky rumbled and a bolt of lightning came down and landed next to Don who let out a loud scream. The lightning then struck again and hit May. However, the lightning didn\u2019t harm the Frankenstein monster giantess and instead, make her eyes open and glow bright. \u201cAha,\u201d said Don. \u201cSo that was it. She needed to be recharged.\u201d May let out a yawn and then stood up, her fleshy ass leaving a large dent in the sidewalk and smashing a brick wall to pieces in the process. May then popped her metal neck as she stood up high. \u201cOh geez,\u201d she said. \u201cI must\u2019ve dozed off. I hope nobody stole my computer while I was gone. May then felt the rain coming down and looked up. \u201cOh damn! Don\u2019t tell me I fell asleep in the rain. My computer\u2019s probably ruined by now.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay looked up again into the sky and then looked in surprise because she could see a mountain in the distance. \u201cHuh?\u201d Several birds flew by and May looked to see one perched on her nose. May looked at her hands to see that they were made of metal and felt around her metallic neck to find the bolts. \u201cOh my gosh!\u201d she yelled. \u201cIs this some kind of a dream! What happened?\u201d As May was trying to figure out what happened, she almost stepped on Don who rolled out of the way and then looked up to see his girlfriend\u2019s skirt was in tatters and revealing her purple, electrical wire print panties. He couldn\u2019t believe it. Parts of May were multi-colored flesh while other parts were mechanical and yet she was titanically obese either way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMay!\u201d yelled Don. \u201cDown here!\u201d \u201cDon?\u201d asked May. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d May bent over, giving Don a good view of her patchwork ass, momentarily hypnotizing him before May called for him again. \u201cDon?!\u201d Don quickly ran around his ginormously obese girlfriend\u2019s body and appeared in front of her face as May gasped. \u201cDon!? Is that you?\u201d Don couldn\u2019t believe it either. The voice coming from the giant sumo-sized Frankenstein\u2019s monster was clearly May\u2019s, but for what reason would a virus be able to do something like that. \u201cUh, yes,\u201d said Don. \u201cIt\u2019s me, May. But I think that you should be much more concerned about yourself at the moment. Look at you, May, you're a giant Frankenstein woman the size of a building.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay looked all over her body and felt her shirt getting smaller to the point where it had been demoted to a bra at this moment. May flickered with electricity as she tried to figure out what was going on. \"Don?\" asked the giantess. \"What happened to my computer?\" Don rolled his eyes because that stupid computer was at this moment the very least of May's concerns. \"Seriously, May?\" asked Don. \"You're worried about that stupid computer? It blew up. You should be more concerned with that computer virus. I'd bet a mountain of steel that the virus is what transmogrified you into a skyscraper sized patchwork metal fatso. Not sure how that's possible at the moment, though.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay tried to walk around and think but grunted because her shoes were much too tight on her giant patchwork feet. The giant woman had to sit down on top of a nearby garage, flattening it in the process as she took off her shoes and pulled her fat feet out of them, revealing that her feet were pure green. May gave a sigh of relief and twitched her toes. One of her feet was close to Don and Don gagged and held his neck as he coughed because the stench of his giant patchwork girlfriend's feet was otherworldly. \"Son of a gun, May! Your feet could kill a herd of elephants. \"Well excuse me!\" yelled the Frankenstein titaness. \"It's not as if there's any place in town that sells shoes to giant Frankenstein girls fat enough to deflect meteors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay stood up and looked at her new body as she tore her shirt slightly so it would be less tight on her patchwork breasts. \"Ah,\" she said. \"Now that's much better.\" Don just looked up at the giant, obese, patchwork goddess that was his girlfriend and although it was impossible at his level to see May's face past her titanic girth, he could swear that she was smiling because he heard her giggling. \"You know, Don,\" said the giantess. \"This might not be so bad. This is too cool. Like a video game, but even better. You have no idea how powerful I feel. I feel like I could conquer the world.\" May let out a laugh and Don was slightly concerned at that thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was just a joke, wasn't it?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>What May just said about taking over the world made Don uneasy as he looked up at the 60ft tall morbidly obese Frankenstein woman holding up her own enormous belly. She just announced that she could conquer the world and with her turned into a gigantic patchwork girl, such a thing happening was all too possible as she was now utterly huge and powerful. Her skin was now made up of stitched mismatched flesh and steel. Of course, she was just kidding about the idea of taking over the world. Wasn\u2019t she? Don noticed May was still laughing and laughed nervously himself, believing as best he could that his girlfriend was only joking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Don then stopped laughing as May\u2019s laughing took on a sinister tone and her smile turned into a smirk as her eyes formed into a scowl. She finished her laugh with a rather malicious looking smile from purple cheek to purple cheek plastered on her several white chins. Her eyes then begun to glow with lightning as her black and white striped hair blew in the wind. She then started to rub her big green belly with her metal hands as the patchwork flesh jiggled. \u201cIn fact,\u201d said May as the then rubbed the bottom of her obese face. \u201cThat isn\u2019t exactly a bad idea.\u201d Don gave a look of fear right before May stomped across the street. \u201cMay?\u201d asked the young man to his skyscraper-sized Frankenstein girlfriend. \u201cAre you feeling alright?\u201d May just let out a laugh as she lifted up her enormous patchwork foot and held it over a truck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay then stomped down and flattened the truck under her foot as she twisted her step and gave a satisfied smile. Don gave a look of pure fear as his face turned pale white. \u201cMay!\u201d he yelled. \u201cBe careful! What if there were people in there!?\u201d May then looked down on her boyfriend and gave an evil laugh. \u201cOh,\u201d said May. \u201cOh, Donny, don\u2019t you see.\u201d May stepped forward and then lifted up a telephone pole and tore it right off of the wires. \u201cI\u2019m bigger than a mountain. I\u2019m Frankenstein\u2019s monster reincarnated through new technology. I\u2019m a cyborg giantess that gets bigger, wider and stronger with every second I exist. So why should I care about the bugs with my feet. With a single stomp I can flatten a truck.\u201d The gigantic Frankenstein woman then held up her butt over a bowling alley and then brought it down to smash the building as Don looked back in fear. \u201cGood grief.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven my butt is powerful enough to destroy buildings,\u201d smirked May. \u201cDon\u2019t you get it, Don? I\u2019m invincible! Nothing will stop me! Empress May. I love the sound of that.\u201d The Frankenstein giantess let out a wicked laugh and then made electricity surge through her body as lightning cracked from the sky and her breast, belly and butt all jiggled violently. A bolt of lightning even hit May's hair and caused it to stand up in a 40ft high beehive style.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon could not believe this was happening. The sweet girl he knew had transformed into a giant patchwork monstrosity and then transformed into a megalomaniacal monster with a massive superiority complex. Don knew that he had to stop May somehow and tried to run to see what he could do. \u201cI need to get far away enough,\u201d thought Don to himself. \u201cMaybe the army will be able to bring May down before she can do any more damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, May saw her boyfriend running off and gave an evil smirk. She reached down and grabbed Don as he yelled. May saw the obese patchwork face of his enormous girlfriend with eyes bigger than cars and teeth big enough to crush cars as she smiled. \u201cGoing somewhere, Don? You wouldn\u2019t be against your girlfriend\u2019s conquest would you?\u201d Don was sweating as May was pondering what to do with her tiny boyfriend who would threaten her megalomaniacal plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What to do with you?\" asked May with a malicious tone. \"What to do?\" May then hears her patchwork stomach rumbling and she rubs it with a metal hand and then smiles fiendishly at Don who is now afraid for his life. \"You know, Don,\" said May. \"You could've been my emperor. I wonder if that's still a possibility. Let me think.\"</span></div></div>",

The Native American woman was outside of the monkey cage at the local zoo in a jungle woman\u2019s loincloth and bra as a monkey grabbed her by the hair. \u201cThey don\u2019t nearly pay me enough for this.\u201d She thought. Delilah yelled as the photographer took photographs of her. \u201cNo, no, it\u2019s all wrong, Delilah. The zoo needs this just right for the postcards.\u201d Delilah groaned. She really didn\u2019t like her job as a model but did it to make ends meet. \u201cNo offense, Finn,\u201d said Delilah. \u201cBut this is worse than the shot for Britannia\u2019s Secret.\u201d \u201cCome on, Delilah,\u201d said Finn in a very sleazy tone. \u201cThink about Jake.\u201d Elisa let out a groan and relented. Delilah had actually been raising her child brother after their parents were killed in an accident. This was also why she lowered herself to such a level.\u201d Fortunately, Delilah and Jake had little to no trouble getting along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Delilah was done with the shoot and was getting ready to drive home. \u201cDon\u2019t forget, Delilah,\u201d said Finn. \u201cTomorrow we do another spot. It will be a surprise.\u201d Delilah let out a groan. \u201cI\u2019ll bet.\u201d \u201cBy the way,\u201d said Finn. \u201cWhat are your brother and boyfriend doing tonight.\u201d Delilah didn\u2019t answer and instead walked away from the scene. Delilah was not alone in raising Jake. Her boyfriend Gabe helped her out and looked after Jake while she was at work. Of course, one wonders what a model like her saw in someone who was such an obvious geek. Like Jake, Gabe was a fan of tabletop games and from his latest text, he found a new game from a strange store. Delilah pulled into the driveway and opened the front door to find her kid brother and boyfriend just opening a box for the game. \u201cHi, Sis,\u201d said Jake. \u201cJust in time.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d said Gabe in embarrassment. \u201cThere you are. You\u2019re home early.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelilah let out a sigh. \u201cHard night at work. I blame you for recommending that job, Gabe.\u201d But Gabe let out a laugh. \u201cCome on, Delilah. You\u2019re perfect. You got the right body for the job.\u201d Delilah gave a laugh and then kissed her boyfriend before she spotted something surprising. It was the game on the table. It depicted a ruby city setting and there were figures resembling different character classes. \u201cWhat kind of game is that?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a new and really weird game that Gabe found,\u201d said Jake. \u201cIt\u2019s weird. All the event cards are blank until you roll the dice.\u201d Delilah rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, Delilah,\u201d said Jake. \u201cJoin us. This game requires three players.\u201d Delilah let out a sigh. \u201cSorry, Bro,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not a gamer.\u201d \u201cCome on, Baby,\u201d said Gabe. \u201cJust one game. I may be his babysitter but you\u2019re his sister. Play a game once in a while, you might like it.\u201d Delilah thought it over and then let out a sigh before she smiled. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said. \u201cYou guys win. I\u2019ll do it.\u201d \u201cAwesome,\u201d said Jake. \u201cFighter, Mage or Thief.\u201d Delilah scoffed. \u201cWell I\u2019d never be the thief.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelilah, Jake and Gabe sat down to play Ruby City and Delilah rolled the dice. \u201cAlright,\u201d she said. \u201cFirst round\u2019s on me.\u201d \u201cRoll the dice already, Sis.\u201d Said Jake. Delilah rolled the dice and moved her fighter figure and then she drew a card. As she was told the card was blank. \u201cGabe?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhere did you get this strange game? How do the\u2026?\u201d Suddenly the card flashed in light and caught Delilah by surprise. \u201cWow.\u201d She said. \u201cDon\u2019t keep us in suspense, Delilah,\u201d said Jake. \u201cWhat\u2019s on the card?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Delilah held up the card, she read it and something puzzled her. \u201cIs it a good event, Delilah?\u201d asked Gabe. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d The young model read the card but for some reason, it didn\u2019t seem to make any sense to her. \u201cThe gods have taken note of your righteous and protective heart and have chosen you to be the Bahamut defender of the Ruby City. Quest Over.\u201d \u201cLooks like you\u2019re out of the game, Big Sister,\u201d said Jake with a laugh. \u201cAnd on the first round too. Talk about bad luck.\u201d However, Delilah was confused with her fortune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the heck is a Bahamut?\u201d asked Delilah. Gabe was going to answer that but he couldn\u2019t think of the right answer. \u201cThat\u2019s actually a very good question, Delilah,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t ask me.\u201d Gabe then took out his iPhone in order to answer his girlfriend\u2019s question. \u201cBahamut, Bahamut. Ah, here it is; Bahamut, Definition 1: A giant fish in Arabian mythology said to support the world and have the head of a hippopotamus.\u201d \u201cSay what?\u201d asked Delilah. \u201cDefinition 2,\u201d said Gabe. \u201cA platinum dragon deity.\u201d \u201cThat sounds\u2026 slightly more flattering\u2026 but come on. A dragon.\u201d \u201cDelilah,\u201d said Jake. \u201cIt\u2019s just a game, big sister. A rather weird game.\u201d However, what none of them noticed was that Delilah\u2019s game card was glowing in her hand. Something was seriously up with that strange game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Delilah was preparing breakfast when she suddenly felt something strange in her stomach. She absentmindedly started to eat the pancake dough without bothering to finish cooking it first. However, she eventually stopped herself and saw that she was surprisingly low on dough and blushed in embarrassment. By the time breakfast was ready, Jake was staring at pancakes with holes in them and Delilah looked in embarrassment. \u201cSorry, Bro,\u201d she said. \u201cThis modeling job must be getting to me.\u201d Jake then noticed something that Delilah herself failed to notice. There appeared to be platinum-colored scales on Delilah\u2019s neck. \u201cUh,\u201d he said. \u201cDelilah. What\u2019s that on your neck?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelilah turned her head and noticed the scales, but simply plucked them off. \u201cHuh?\u201d she asked. Jake was very afraid and was sure something was wrong with his sister. Then he remembered the game from last night. \u201cGabe\u2019s tabletop game? The Bahamut.\u201d \u201cExcuse me?\u201d asked Delilah. \u201cJake. You\u2019re not making any sense. Oh. I better get you to school.\u201d Delilah was soon walking her brother to school but along the way, she kept scratching herself. \u201cSomething wrong, Sis?\u201d asked Jake. Delilah then gave a snort that sounded suspiciously like a combination of a hippo\u2019s grunt and a dragon\u2019s growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll admit,\u201d said Delilah. \u201cMy skin feels a little dry. It was hot yesterday and I was modeling in a less than heat-worthy outfit. Oh, we\u2019re almost there. Huh, we\u2019re early for a change.\u201d Jake then heard a ripping sound. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d he asked. Delilah turned around and saw her butt had somehow gotten bigger. She then glared at her brother. \u201cNot one word, Jake.\u201d \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to say anything, Delilah. Honest.\u201d Delilah let out a groan. \u201cOh great. That jerkhole photographer is going to have a field day with\u2026\u201d Delilah then gasped because her fingernails looked surprisingly sharp. \u201cOh no.\u201d She said. \u201cWhat next?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Jake begun to realize something. \u201cUh, Delilah,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you think that maybe that board game Gabe found was actually cursed.\u201d Delilah was trying to hold her pants together before she spoke with her kid brother. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. Who would curse a...?\u201d Before Delilah could finish her sentence, her pants had completely torn apart from her enormous booty and then she saw her feet turn into flat feet like those of a pachyderm. She looked back and saw a pair of leather wings growing out of her back and she even started to sprout a hippopotamus\u2019s tail. \u201cOh no.\u201d Muttered Delilah. Delilah then saw that she was getting taller and in seconds, she was as tall as a water tower. \u201cJake!\u201d yelled Delilah. \u201cOut of the way!\u201d Jake ran back to avoid being crushed under his sister\u2019s foot right before Delilah\u2019s stomach bulged out and she opened her mouth and let out a hiss, revealing her teeth were turning into long fangs like those of a hippopotamus. Then she grunted as she sprouted gills and her face stretched into a snout as her skin turned scaly and platinum and her wings expanded until the wingspan reached 250ft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake looked up at his sister as her transformation was complete. Delilah had become a giant and rather strange looking monstrous resembling a large hippopotamus with clawed nails, dragon wings, a long neck, gills and a scaly underbelly. She was 150ft tall with a 175ft belly and 200ft wide butt and large H-Cup breasts. Delilah looked all over herself and saw her reflection in her own platinum skin. \u201cOh,\u201d said Delilah. \u201cSo this is what a Bahamut is. Wish they would\u2019ve told me. Stupid game.\u201d Jake looked up in shock at his transformed sister just as Delilah was looking at herself in the reflection in a skyscraper. \u201cDelilah,\u201d said Jake. \u201cI am really sorry. I\u2026\u201d \u201cJake,\u201d said Delilah. \u201cRelax. It wasn\u2019t you who bought the game, remember? Besides, the game said that I was now the defender of the Ruby City? This is going to take some getting used to.\u201d Suddenly there was a ringing sound and it sounded like Delilah\u2019s phone. \u201cCrud.\u201d The transmogrified model thought to herself.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Delilah reached down and tried to pick her cell phone out of the pocket of her jeans that were now struggling to hold back all of her dragon/hippopotamus ass, but her phone was so small compared to her giant and very obese fingers that just touching it would probably press all the apps at once or even shatter her screen. \u201cCrud!\u201d yelled Delilah. \u201cMy fingers are too big.\u201d Delilah yelled and then the phone slipped right out of her hands. Before it could hit the floor and crash, Jake grabbed it. \u201cGot it, big sister.\u201d \u201cExcuse me?\u201d asked Delilah angrily as she was now literally much bigger than her brother in every sense of the word. The child let out a nervous laugh as he looked at the hippopotamus-like face of the Bahamut giantess and then gasped as he checked the caller I.D. \u201cIt\u2019s that turkey, Finn.\u201d Delilah groaned. Her idiot agent chose the worst possible time to call her but she couldn\u2019t just ignore the phone ringing. She then had an idea. The bahamut let out a snort and then picked Jake up. \u201cHuh?\u201d asked Jake. \u201cSis, what are you... ugh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelilah placed her kid brother inside her ear with the phone. \u201cI can hear it ringing now, Jake,\u201d said the bahamut giantess. \u201cI can hear the phone loud and clear. Turn it on and I should be able to speak with Finn.\u201d \u2018Hello?\u201d asked Delilah. \u201cDelilah,\u201d said the giant mutated model\u2019s agent on the phone. \u201cBaby. Have I got something that should make your name a household word.\u201d Delilah let out a groan as she could hear Finn from the phone inside her ear. \u201cFinn,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is REALLY not a good time for a shoot.\u201d \u201cNot a good time? Oh, I get it, you were dropping off Jack at school.\u201d \u201cJake.\u201d Said Delilah correcting her pompous agent. \u201cWhatever, D-La. You work for me, girl and I need your beautiful body by the wharf A.S.A.P.\u201d \u201cFinn,\u201d said Delilah. \u201cWhatever you want me to wear, I doubt that it will fit me at all.\u201d \u201cWHAT?! Are you telling me you\u2019re putting on weight.\u201d Delilah looks to see a plane nearly touching her huge snout and then hears beeping and has to step out of the road so cars can pass by. \u201cSomething like that.\u201d The bahamut girl said to herself. \u201cYou better explain what\u2019s going on, Delilah.\u201d Delilah let out a sigh. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe me if I told you,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I\u2019m going to show you. Goodbye.\u201d Jake hung up on the phone right before his sister pulled him out of her ear. \u201cSorry about that, Jake.\u201d Said Delilah. Jake shivered. \u201cYou have seriously got to use stronger q-tips, Sis. There was enough wax in there to open a museum.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got bigger problems than that, Jake. That jerk Finn just called me to a job and I can\u2019t come to a photoshoot looking like this.\u201d \u201cWhy not?\u201d asked Jake. \u201cI think you look more awesome like this.\u201d Delilah glared at her brother who looked up in fear and backed up. But then the titanic bahamut shook her head because there was no way of getting herself out of this situation. \u201cI\u2019ll be back to pick you up later,\u201d said Delilah. \u201cSomething tells me that I\u2019ll be home sooner than I thought. Have a good day at school, because I\u2019m dreading this day of work.\u201d The bahamut giantess then started to stomp away being extremely careful as not to step on anyone as her kid brother looked up and noticed that her jeans and black shirt were both appearing to come apart at the seams. \u201cUh, Delilah,\u201d said Jake. \u201cYour pants are dying on you.\u201d \u201cI know.\u201d Said the amphibious hippopotamus/dragon giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelilah was soon grumbling to herself as she was trying to step over the traffic. \u201cSorry. Sorry.\u201d \u201cWatch where you\u2019re going, Hyacinth!? Get your chunky butt off the road.\u201d Delilah gave a snort of frustration. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to be nasty about it, I happen to be a model.\u201d \u201cModel for what!\u201d yelled an obnoxious young man in a Porsche by her toes. \u201cPlay Kaiju Magazine?\u201d Delilah was quickly getting more stressed out when she realized she still had dragon\u2019s wings. The bahamut creature let out a grunt as she flapped her wings. \u201cI\u2019m not 100% sure that this is going to work with how fat I am, but nothing ventured, that\u2019s what they say.\u201d Delilah flapped her wings and by some miracle, she managed to fly up into the sky. The hippo-faced dragoness couldn\u2019t believe it herself. \"Well I'll be a big ass hippo,\" she thought to herself. \"At least I can fly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelilah flew up into the air to avoid the traffic and looked down to see how utterly small Ruby Town looked, not that it wasn't small before, especially to a 150ft high bahamut, but it was completely minuscule from Delilah's position in the air. \"Oh great,\" thought Delilah. \"As if I didn't feel colossal enough as it was. Well, as soon as Finn sees me like this, it's safe to say that I'll be out of a job. Oh well, I'm a hybrid of a dragon, a hippopotamus and a flying fish who happens to be as big as a skyscraper, I'm sure I'll find a job somewhere. Maybe they're making a new monster movie in Japan.\" Delilah suddenly stopped and grunted because a bird had flown into one of her huge nostrils and she was flying more clumsily before she started to fly towards the ground. \"Oh no!\" she yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearby, Gabriel was driving past the mountains in the area when he heard a loud crash. \"What the heck was that?!\" he yelled. Gabe parked his car to the side of the rode and saw that something huge had crashed into a mountain and caused it to collapse to pieces. \"O.M.G.! What happened? It looks like a meteor struck.\" Gabe heard coughing and then he gasped in surprise. Delilah had risen unharmed from the wreckage and seemed bigger than before. She had grown to 200ft high with a 300ft wide butt, 350ft wide wingspan and 245ft stomach. The bahamut girl let out a cough and accidentally blew steam from her mouth as she flapped her wings to make sure they weren't too terribly injured. She then gave a snort. \"Okay,\" she said. \"Definitely have to work on the landings there.\" Gabe could not believe the sight of the titanic creature in front of him, but what he found especially unbelievable was that the bahamut had spoken in his girlfriend's voice and had long shiny bluish black hair that Gabe recognized as Delilah's own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Delilah?\" asked Gabe. \"Is that you?\" Delilah gave a look of surprise and then turned around to see her much smaller boyfriend below her. He was at level with her belly button from where he was standing and even walked up and tapped it. Delilah let out a sigh and accidentally horrified Gabe with her long and sharp hippopotamus teeth and long forked dragon's tongue. \"Hi, Gabriel. It's me, lover boy. Just a little bit... ginormous today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabe had to clean his glasses to make sure what he was seeing was not a hallucination. \"Oh my gosh! Delilah, what are you?\" Delilah gave an angry snort. \"What does it look like?\" she asked. \"I'm a bahamut.\" \"A bahamut?\" asked Gabe. Gabriel took out his iPhone to do an image search and found that one image of a bahamut didn't match Delilah's appearance as it resembled a giant, demonic dragon. Gabe decided to check again but then he found an image that depicted a bahamut as an enormous fish with a hippo's head and an entire continent on it's back. \"B-But, you don't look like the web images of a bahamut. You look more like several depictions of a bahamut and different interpretations mixed together. How is that?\" Delilah gave a snort and scratched her enormous butt. \"I'm pretty sure that artistic license is at work here.\" \"How did this happen?\" asked Gabe. \"Did you get bitten by a radioactive hippo? Slimed by nuclear waste? struck by lightning.\" Delilah gave an angry roar down at her boyfriend. \"It was that stupid Ruby City tabletop game you brought in. That card I drew told me this was going to happen and then made it happen.\" Gabe just gave a nervous look right before he grunted because Delilah picked him right up off the ground and gave him a slight stair as she held him in front of one of her eyes that looked like it was the size of a moon. Gabe flinched because he was sure that Delilah was mad at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Delilah just let out a deep sigh and then she let go of Gabe. Gabe yelled as he was plummeted but landed softly on one of Delilah's humongous D-cup breasts before slipping into her cleavage that was at this point being held back by a rather stressed out black tank top that was reduced to only covering up her nipples since she was now so enormous and obese. \"Comfy, Gabe?\" asked Delilah. Gabe just blushed. \"Yes. Very.\" Delilah was then stomping away again as Gabe had to hold on tight. \"Delilah,\" said Gabriel. \"I am terribly sorry about turning you into...\" \"Shut up,\" said Delilah. \"Don't worry. It's not as if you knew this was going to happen. I'd like to know at what kind of store you found this game.\" \"It didn't have a name. There was just some strange bull's skull on the main table.\" Delilah let out a sigh. \"That sounds like a red flag right there. Well, better go find Finn.\" Gabe gave a look of surprise. \"Finn is calling you to work in your condition? Why didn't you...?\" Delilah snorted. \"You think that he'd believe that his supermodel cash cow mysteriously transformed into a hybrid of a fish, dragon and hippopotamus because of a cursed board game? All I know is that I'm gonna get fired when...\" Gabe let out a scoff. \"Excuse me, Delilah, but who in the right mind would fire a hippopotamus woman with the wings of a dragon who just happens to be 40 times bigger than them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the wharf at the time, Finn was waiting impatiently. \"Where is she? Don't tell me she's taking this long just to drop off one kid at school. This is a very important job that will put us on....\" Suddenly there were vibrations and the wharf was shaking up and then Finn looked up to see Delilah. \"Looking for me?\" asked the mutated model to her agent. \"Delilah?\" asked Finn. \"What?\" \"You wouldn't believe me if I told you?\" Finn was dumbfounded but then had an idea for publicity and smiled. \"Change of plans. I have the perfect modeling job for someone of your... size.\" Delilah gave a gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat exactly is Finn's idea?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Our story begins in the suburbs where a bespectacled African American woman with brown-reddish hair was reading a book when she decided to stop and get a drink out of the fridge. She walked into the kitchen and opened the fridge only to let out a scream as a giant inflatable clown came out. The woman slammed the fridge shut and panted before she grit her teeth. \u201cPeter.\u201d She muttered angrily. The woman\u2019s husband gave a laugh before walking up. \u201cSo, did I finally make you laugh, Summer?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer just glared at Peter. \u201cIf by laugh, you mean scream, then yes. Peter, I am really getting sick of these stupid pranks.\u201d Peter let out a groan. \u201cCome on, Summer. Where is your sense of humor?\u201d Summer rolled her eyes. It had been this way for a while. Peter was an amateur comedian and yet his wife was as stone-faced as they came. Even before their marriage, Summer had never so much as uttered even a chuckle. It made one wonder how the two of them managed to get together in the first place. \u201cCome on, Summer,\u201d said Peter. \u201cHave a heart. I\u2019m just trying to make you laugh.\u201d Summer shook her head. \u201cI wish you would grow up, Peter. Not everybody is going to laugh at your stupid jokes. Now, I\u2019m going to be busy reading but I don\u2019t want to be disturbed. I\u2019m going to be upstairs if you need me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter let out a sigh as his wife walked upstairs. He then waved his arm and let out a groan. \u201cThere\u2019s gotta be some way to make her laugh. I\u2019ve tried everything. Whoopie cushions, plastic snakes, squirting flowers. I need some new material.\u201d Peter soon was driving down the street trying to figure out what he was going to do. \u201cThere\u2019s gotta be a joke shop around here. Someplace that will make even Summer laugh out loud.\u201d Peter then saw a strange shop up ahead, one with a Minotaur\u2019s skull inside and gave a smile. \u201cThat place should work.\u201d Peter then opened the door and saw nobody around. \u201cAnyone home?\u201d he asked. The skull then turned to face him. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Peter was surprised but let out a laugh. \u201cOh, so the shopkeeper is a ventriloquist? This is obviously the right place.\u201d \u201cHuh?!\u201d asked the skull. \u201cIt\u2019s my wife,\u201d said Peter. \u201cShe\u2019s as stone-faced as they get. In all the years we\u2019ve been married, I haven\u2019t been able to make her laugh even once. What I need is something that can sweeten even the sourest of puss.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, the skull was not amused. \u201cWhat do I look like?! This isn\u2019t a comedy shop! This store sells cursed magical objects, not jokes!\u201d \u201cBut don\u2019t you have anything that can give my wife a sense of humor?\u201d asked Peter. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t laughed once ever since I met her. It\u2019s kind of depressing. Please, there has to be something in this store that will make her laugh.\u201d The skull grumbled and spun around. \u201cThey\u2019re always choosing to learn their lesson the hard way aren\u2019t they? Fine. I\u2019ll relent.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minotaur skull opened up and revealed what looked like a pack of a glowing blue gum. \u201cGum?\u201d asked Peter. \u201cWhat do you want me to do with the gum?\u201d \u201cThat gum is made from the saliva of a werehyena. Anyone who chews it will be able to laugh like a hyena.\u201d Said the skull. Of course, Peter was still skeptical and sniffed around the gum. He knew for a fact that Summer had a weakness for sweats and wouldn\u2019t be able to resist bubblegum. \u201cAre you sure that this gum will work?\u201d asked Peter. \u201cBelieve me,\u201d said the skull. \u201cThe moment your wife bites into that gum, she\u2019ll laugh like a hyena.\u201d The shop then faded away in a flash. Peter gulped in fear and he was really hoping that he could make Summer laugh.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's a good thing for him I love a man who's persistent and knows how to smile.\" At that moment, the door opened up and Summer realized her husband was home. She let out a sigh. \"Here we go again.\" Summer put down her book to face her husband. \"What's the joke this time, Peter?\" Peter however, wasn't cheerful or jovial at that moment. He decided that if he was going to get Summer to laugh, he had to be subtle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter let out a sigh. \"Look, Summer. I'm sorry about all those jokes and pranks. I was just trying to make you laugh.\" Summer let out a sigh. \"Peter,\" she said. \"You knew when you married me that I wasn't a laugher. That just isn't my personality.\" \"I know,\" said Peter. \"And I understand. I'm going to stop trying so hard and driving you crazy. I even brought a peace offering.\" Peter held up the special werehyena-saliva gum and Summer adjusted her glasses and took a look at the gum. \"Thanks, Peter,\" she said with a smirk as she took the gum. \"I love chewing gum. Huh, I don't recognize this particular brand. It doesn't even say what's in it.\" Summer's eyes then popped and she gave a glare. \"If this is spicy gum or something that will turn my mouth blue, I swear...\" \"It's nothing like that, Summer,\" said Peter. \"I swear.\" Summer shrugged her shoulders, unwrapped the gum and then started to chew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" she said right before blowing and popping a bubble. \"This is interesting gum, Peter. Can't quite figure out the flavor.\" Suddenly, Summer started to giggle and hold her chest. \"Oh, sorry about that. I don't know what...\" Summer laughed more erratically as she stood up. \"Oh my. What's gotten into me?\" Peter gave a smile. \"I can't believe it,\" he said to himself. \"It actually worked.\" Summer held onto her stomach and then she took a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peter,\" she said between laughs. \"You're impossible. I knew this was some kind of a trick.\" \"Well, it worked. It made you laugh.\" Summer had to agree to that. She was laughing so hard that she couldn't be mad with her husband. \"That's true.\" She said. But suddenly, as Summer was laughing, something came over her. Her belly was bulging out and the button popped off of the front of her blue jeans, exposing her orange underwear. \"Huh?\" asked Peter in confusion. Summer's breasts expanded as well and were tearing apart her undershirt and stretching out her orange jacket. Then she got on her knees and her butt got bigger to the point where her jeans looked like a tattoo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Summer started to get bigger to the point where Peter only reached up to her butt crack and then golden-brown fur with black spots sprouted all over her growing body. Her fingers turned to claws and her toes did the same thing, tearing through her shoes as a canid-like tail grew over her butt crack. Her ears grew pointing and as she was laughing, her mouth stretched into a snout filled with teeth as sharp as knives. Peter gave a gasp as Summer paused laughing. \"Peter?\" she asked as she tried to fight the urge to giggle. \"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer then looked in the mirror and saw that she was a 15ft tall werehyena. She had a 15ft stomach, H-cup breasts and a 25ft wide booty. \"Oh my,\" said Summer as she continued to smile and adjusted her glasses. \"Peter, what did you do?\" Peter then gasped. \"Oh no,\" he said. \"That gum was made out of werehyena saliva. This must be a side-effect.\" Summer smirked and glared at the same time as she looked over her obese body. \"Peter,\" she said. \"You are just impossible. Well, you won't have any trouble making me laugh.\" Summer then let out a laugh and then heard her stomach rumbling. She then turned to her husband and smirked from both of her puffy cheeks and then licked her chops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter looked up in worry. \"Summer? Why are you looking at me like that.\" \"well,\" said Summer. \"It looks like my tummy wants some company.\" Peter was seriously afraid because he knew that Summer was considering eating him. \"Now don't do anything rash, Summer! I'm your husband. There's some leftover chocolate cake in the fridge. I'll get that for you.\" Summer just drooled uncontrollably as she laughed. \"Better hurry, Peter. I'm starving.\" Peter went into the kitchen and brought out the cake that Summer quickly swallowed with one bite. Knowing full well that one chocolate cake wouldn't hold off a 5 ton hyena for long and brought out everything in the refrigerator as Summer devoured entire handfuls of food, mostly sweets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn 20 minutes, Summer had devoured everything in the kitchen and let out a belch. Peter let out a sigh of relief. \"I really hope she doesn't have room for me.\" Summer licked her lips and then rubbed her stomach. \"That was an amazing meal.\" Unfortunately, Summer's stomach rumbled again and the obese hyena got up and moved her hulk to the door as she smirked. \"Uh, Summer,\" said Peter. \"Where are you going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer burst into an uncontrolled cackle. \"Isn't it obvious, Honey?\" she asked. \"I'm still hungry and now I've got a massive craving for...\"</span></div></div>",

No. I\u2019m Brad Dashing. I saved this studio from\u2026 I understand.\u201d Brad let out a sigh as his wife, dressed as a Greek goddess, walked by. \u201cThe network president said no, huh, Brad?\u201d asked Bianca. Brad let out a groan. \u201cThere\u2019s no room for good shows on these days. No room for game shows like this anymore.\u201d Bianca let out a sigh. \u201cPeople have bad taste these days. Hench a station that once had very good television now has nothing but crappy sitcoms. If I see one more sitcom, I\u2019m going to barf in my coffee.\u201d<br>\r\n\u2028However, Brad kissed Bianca and then lowered his head. \u201cUnfortunately, Bianca,\u201d he said to his wife. \u201cWe might have to find work on a sitcom. Daedalus or Alive is dead. I thought that making an ancient Greece themed quiz show would make our careers but now\u2026\u201d Bianca let out a groan. \u201cJust goes to show you that everything is going to you-know-where these days. So much for good television. If only there was a way to save the show.\u201d Brad let out a scoff. \u201cYes. It would be great. But that\u2019s show\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Brad could finish his sentence, he heard a sound that sounded like somebody chewing on popcorn. Both of them turned their heads and looked in surprise at a man in green rags and a metal face mask eating popcorn right in front of them. \u201cIs this a bad time?\u201d The man asked. \u201cWho are you?\u201d asked Brad. \u201cWait a minute, how did you manage to get in here?\u201d The man just kept eating popcorn before he answered. \u201cI\u2019m Erlking. And your door was open.\u201d \u201cErlking?\u201d asked Bianca. \u201cYou look like you walked out of a bad Shakespeare production. What\u2019s with the outfit? It doesn\u2019t look like anything I\u2019d see on any homeless men I\u2019ve seen and you clearly look homeless.\u201d Erlking shrugged his shoulders and bit into more popcorn. \u201cI prefer to think of myself as shelter challenged. So, what would I be watching if I had gotten here earlier?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad gave a nervous smile. \u201cWell, you\u2019re late for the party on more than one occasion. Daedalus or Alive is almost dead. We\u2019re being cancelled. I\u2019ve did everything to save it. I even got my beautiful wife to dress like a Greek goddess in order to attract viewers and ratings. But nothing\u2019s working.\u201d \u201cDaedalus or Alive,\u201d said Erlking. \u201cI like the pun. I take it it\u2019s a Greek mythology themed game show.\u201d \u201cIt was a Greek mythology themed quiz show,\u201d said Bianca. \u201cThe last episode airs tomorrow.\u201d \u201cLast episode?\u201d asked Erlking. \u201cSounds like you\u2019re in trouble.\u201d \u201cI wish that there was a way to save it,\u201d said Bianca. \u201cBut oh well. Looks like we\u2019ll have to find work somewhere else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, at that moment, Erlking had finished his popcorn and wiped off his mouth before he popped his neck. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Erlking has you covered. 1, 2, spell me do, let this couples\u2019 wish come true. Hear me high, hear me well. Let me be this spell!\u201d Erlking then cast his spell and disappeared. Bianca gave a cough. \u201cBrad,\u201d she said. \u201cExactly who was that kook?\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said Brad. \u201cWhoever he is, he has great special effects. Maybe they oughta hire him for the studio. Come on. We have to prepare for doomsday.\u201d While the Dashings were walking away, they had completely failed to realize that Bianca\u2019s shadow had turned into that of an obese sphinx walking on all fours and Bianca herself was getting pudgier as her eyes turned into cat\u2019s eyes.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A wish granter? More like a crazy homeless guy with access to good special effects.\u201d Bianca was for some reason licking her hand as she followed her husband and her stomach was getting much pudgier than it was before. \u201cYou know,\u201d said Bianca. \u201cThat Erlking ought to have his own TV show. Maybe we should call Mr. Warabino and tell him that the guy would be good for the preschool block. He looks like he\u2019d be great with kids. What does Erlking even mean?\u201d \u201cI remember,\u201d said Brad. \u201cOn <i>Daedalus or Alive</i>, I asked a contestant a question and the answer was the Erlking. The king of the fairies in Danish and German legend.\u201d Bianca\u2019s eyes became even more cat-like and shined bright blue as she let out a strange purring sound. \u201cI thought Oberon was the king of the fairies.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s in Greek.\u201d Said Brad. Brad let out a groan as he took out his car keys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d the soon to be former game show host said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have plenty of time to figure out what is what because after tomorrow, <i>Daedalus or Alive</i> is dead.\u201d Brad and his wife entered the car but Bianca dropped one of her earrings and bent over to get it off the ground. As she did this, Brad saw that Bianca\u2019s butt had mysteriously gotten bigger. \u201cBianca?\u201d asked Brad. \u201cAre you putting on weight?\u201d Bianca gave a scoff. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d she asked her husband. Bianca then grunted because Brad grabbed one of her butt cheeks to determine how much softer it had become. \u201cJust as I thought,\u201dsaid Brad. \u201cCellulite. I warned you to be careful with those Oreos. Hey, maybe a chubbier sex magnet might save the show.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca gave a glare at her husband and hissed, not realizing that her teeth were turning into cat-like fangs. Brad raised an eyebrow in surprise. \u201cDid you just hiss at me?\u201d Bianca seemed confused at her husband\u2019s words.<br>\r\n \"Hiss at you? What do I look like, a cat?\" Bianca just sat in her seat and tried to put on her seatbelt, but had trouble getting it over her much larger belly as Brad was staring at her. \"Not one word, Brad.\" Warned Bianca to her husband. The couple was driving down town and didn't notice it at the time, but Bianca had sprouted a long tail that looked like that of a lions and her ears were slowly becoming pointed like that of a feline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" said Brad. \"I'm feeling like a going out of business dinner. Since Daedalus or Alive ends tomorrow night, we better eat like Zeus and Hera tonight. What sounds good, Bianca?\" Bianca let out a purr and gave a smile just like a cat's and licked her lips. \"I'm feeling like fresh fish tonight. Better yet. Raw.\" Brad gave a look of disgust. \"Sushi for a last meal? Well, whatever you say, Baby.\" Bianca then begun to cough a few times. \"I hope they've got plenty of water,\" said Bianca to her husband. \"My tongue feels a lot like sandpaper.\" Brad raised an eyebrow but he didn't seem to see anything wrong with his wife at the exact moment as they pulled into a Japanese restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the restaurant, Bianca was stuffing her face with sushi and eating ferociously and even licking away at her drink as everyone looked in disgust with judgmental looks. \"What are you doing, Bianca?\" asked Brad. \"Geez. Did you skip lunch today or something?\" Bianca let out a slight belch before answering her husband. \"I'm sorry, Brad,\" said Bianca. \"For some reason I'm insanely hungry and I can't figure out why.\" Bianca then begun to cough slightly. \"Excuse me, Brad. I need to use the sand box, uh, I mean, the water closet.\" Bianca got up and Brad looked in surprise because not only did he finally notice her tail swinging around, but her ass had gotten so big that it knocked over several tables and chairs as she shook it and made her way to the bathroom. Of course, Brad didn't seem to notice at all that small feathers were growing on his wife's upper back in a shape that resembled tiny wings. Brad rubbed his eyes as he turned his head away. \"I must be tired,\" he said. \"And stressed. I wonder if all hosts go through this when their hit show is cancelled.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the bathroom, Bianca was in front of the sink and was panting heavily and sweating as she held her chest. \"What is going on?\" she asked to herself. \"What is happening to me...ow!\" Bianca gave a hiss and put her hands on the bathroom sink as her fingers turned into rather sharp claws and the wings that were growing on her back had expanded as she felt fur growing on her body. Her ass and stomach were getting so big that they were tearing holes in her dress. One young woman entered the bathroom and gasped as she saw Bianca transforming into something monstrous in front of her. Bianca at this point had passed 8ft tall and her eyes were glowing as her nose became more feline-like in appearance. \"Help.... me.\" Muttered Bianca. But the young woman took one look at the mutating Bianca and let out a scream before running the other way in pure fear. Bianca just kept hissing as she was forced to stand on all fours just like an animal as she kept getting bigger and swelling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the main dining area, Brad was shaking his head. \"Gee,\" he said. \"Bianca sure is taking a long time to use the bathroom. Like that's anything new.\" Brad was about to drink a glass of sake but then he heard loud screaming and people were running into the main dining area. \"Everybody run! There's a monster in the restaurant!\" \"Monster?\" asked Brad. Several customers in their seats turned their hands as a large feline shadow was coming out from the restroom area. The customers screamed and ran away, leaving Brad in utter surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad was confused as to why everyone was running away, but then he gasped because Bianca came out of the bathroom and was stomping the ground as she walked on all fours. She was now a colossal 15ft tall (while walking on all fours) sphinx with an enormously fat 20ft wide stomach, 15ft wide ass and a pair of E-cup breasts. She had bright blue fur and aquamarine-colored feathered wings that had a span of 40ft as she came forward. The lioness beast let out a roar of distress as she was walking down the front of the restaurant and looked at Brad who was in utter fear. \"N-N-Nice kitty.\" Said Brad rather uneasily. Bianca was filled in absolute dread at the fact that her husband seemed to believe that she was now a rather titanic monster that clearly looked like a man-eater. \"Brad,\" said Bianca. \"It's me.\" Brad could not believe it because the sphinx clearly had his wife's voice. \"B-B-Bianca?\" Bianca nodded her head and gave a look of distress. \"Good grief.\" Said Brad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long until Bianca was devouring an entire tuna provided by the restaurant staff who were too scared to move with such an enormous sphinx in the vicinity. Brad still could not believe what had become of his wife and poked her in the stomach, prompting her to growl at him. \"Sorry, honey!\" yelled Brad very quickly. Bianca then returned to her meal as Brad could only stare at her tail that was minuscule on the sphinx's colossal butt cheeks. \"What happened to you, Bianca?\" asked Brad. \"This definitely isn't something that happens everyday.\" Bianca swallowed a mouthful of fish before she gasped and remembered Erlking casting his spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erlking!\" she yelled. \"He did this!\" \"That's impossible,\" said Brad. \"Are you telling me that vagrant was actually a real spell caster.\" \"Evidently so,\" said Bianca. \"I did say that I wished for something that would save the show from being canceled. The way he saw it, any game show, especially an ancient Greece-themed quiz show, would be more interesting with a real life monster from Greek mythology. This is what I get for not being specific.\" Brad let out a groan. \"This is clearly what I did <i>not</i> have in mind. Sure it might save <i>Daedalus or Alive</i>, but at the price that I'll be married to a sphinx for the rest of my life?! And why are you so fat? What does this have to do with anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca turned around and snapped her jaws as Brad screamed. \"You never mention a woman's weight, Brad!\" yelled Bianca. \"So maybe I'll never be able to fit into a size six again. But I\u2019m a giant carnivorous feline. That\u2019s the least of our problems.\u201d Brad then begun to think to himself and Bianca looked at him with a rather confused look on her face. \u201cBrad?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhat are you getting at?\u201d Brad gave a smile and then rubbed his titanic wife in her side. \"Don't you see,\" he said. \"This will save <i>Daedalus or Alive</i>. Tomorrow night's game show features a titanic sphinx.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Bianca had finished her meal, the titanic sphinx was flying through the air with her husband riding on her back. \"Okay,\" said Brad. \"Theres's no way Mr. Warabino won't be impressed by this. He'll have to clear us for another season.\" \"I just hope my sphinx transformation doesn't get the best of me,\" said Bianca. \"I don't want to eat any of the contestants that fail.\" Bianca had landed right on the Channel 7 building and shook it up. Fortunately, Mr. Warabino was in his office at the time and felt it. \"What was that?!\" yelled the station head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Mr. Warabino could even think of what happened, Brad walked in. \"Hello, Mr. Warabino.\" \"Brad Dashing? What are you doing here? You should be getting ready for the last episode of <i>Daedalus or Alive</i>.\" Brad gave a smile. \"Oh,\" he said. \"It won't be the last episode. I just found something to spice things up.\" Mr. Warabino was confused but then gasped as Bianca stomped into the room and smirked. \"Ta da,\" said Brad. \"We'll be the only game show with an actual sphinx.\" Mr. Warabino was horrified. \"Where did that sphinx come from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, can Brad tell his boss that the sphinx is Bianca?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Our story begins in an observatory where a redheaded and freckle-faced women with a ponytail was on the phone with her husband as she was looking at a photograph of herself with said husband and their young son. \u201cThanks for picking me up while my car\u2019s in the shop, Robert. I really appreciate it.\u201d \u201cHey,\u201d said Robert\u2019s voice on the phone. \u201cI knew you were a terrible driver when I married you. It\u2019s rare you get out of work early, especially when you\u2019re working for NASA. I\u2019ll just pick you up and we\u2019ll both pick up Adrian from school. No problem, Susan.\u201d Susan jus tlet out a sigh. \u201cI really wish that those kids would leave him alone.\u201d \u201cUnfortunately it\u2019s the smart kids that often get bullied. I\u2019ll see you in half an hour.\u201d \u201cLove you, Robert. See you there.\u201d Susan gave a smile as she hung up but let out a sigh right before she had to get to work. \u201cThis is Susan Potts calling the Riskier 2.0. You are clear for reentry.\u201d \u201cRoger, Mrs. Potts,\u201d said one of the astronauts. \u201cWe\u2019re coming back.\u201d Susan let out a sigh.  Her job was to act as mission control and call for astronauts and mere hours ago, the Risktaker 2.0 had gotten past a cosmic storm. She had to come in early just to help the motley crew return safely that day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Susan got another call from the astronaut in charge. \"Mrs. Potts. We picked up something strange from the trip.\" \"Something strange?\" asked Susan. \"It was a simple trip to deflect a meteor. What could you have possibly...\" \"I'll bring it to you and you can see for yourself, Mrs. Potts. You'll see.\" Susan let out a sigh as the rocket landed. She soon heard footprints and then turned around to see the captain of the Riskier 2.0 and he was carrying a rather long container. \"Check it out, ma'am,\" said the man to Susan. \"This is literally out of this world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan took the container and saw that it was filled with some form of glowing pinkish red ooze. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d she asked. \u201cWe don\u2019t know for sure, Mrs. Potts,\u201d said the astronaut. \u201cWe found it floating in a cosmic storm.\u201d Susan took a closer look. \u201cIt appears to be some kind of ooze that is made up of cosmic radiation. I\u2019ll take it down to the lab when I leave.\u201d The astronaut then walked away as he nodded his head. Susan held up the vial of ooze and scratched her head slightly because the ooze appeared to be bubbling. \u201cNow this isn\u2019t your average everyday slime. It almost looks like cosmic clay. I better get a closer look at it.\u201d Susan held up the vial filled with the cosmic ooze and saw that in the bright light it seemed to bubble. \u201cInteresting.\u201d However, as the technician continued to look up at the ooze, she accidentally leaned back in her chair and fell over, in the process dropping the vial as it shattered and splattered the ooze on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the ooze hit Susan, she accidentally swallowed some and gagged. \u201cYuck! Oh my gosh! I swallowed it!\u201d Susan groaned and spat a few times before she ran to the phone to call a hospital. As she did so, she had no idea that her butt and belly were expanding and her skin was turning a dark burgundy color as she gasped. Susan was sweating heavily as she held up the phone and failed to notice that her body appeared to be melting. \u201cCome on,\u201d she said nervously. \u201cCome on. I might have just been poisoned!\u201d Susan coughed into her hand as she waited and then she saw that her hand looked fatter than usual and from the looks of it, it appeared to be turning burgundy. The redhead heard a ripping sound and saw that back of her pure white pants tearing apart and her panties looked like they were coming apart as her body kept turning color. Susan in shock dropped the phone and her ponytail came apart as she grabbed her head and she sprouted a few extra chins as her fingers kept expanding and her stomach was bulging out. Her breasts had outgrown her shirt and Susan saw just how red she had become. \u201cOh no,\u201d she said. \u201cGood grief! How is this happening?! I thought cosmic ooze was only supposed to do this in comic books!\u201d Susan then saw that she appeared to be getting taller as she got fatter and she also appeared to be turning into liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan then heard a knock on the door and turned around, her body turning into slime as she walked up to the door, her burgundy body picking up tones of dark black as her eyes were turning pitch white. As she continued to walk towards the door, she gained a ton and got even bigger. \u201cWho\u2019s there?!\u201d yelled Susan in a stressed out tone given what was happening to her. \u201cSusan?\u201d asked Robert on the side of the door. \u201cIs everything okay in there!?\u201d Susan let out a groan. \u201cGreat,\u201d she thought to herself. \u201cI definitely can\u2019t let my own husband see me like this. What the hell is happening to me? That ooze must\u2019ve had mutagenic properties.\u201d Susan coughed a few more times as she continued to bloat out. Robert heard Susan coughing and was greatly worried and then opened the door and looked in absolute shock at the giant blob of ooze in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slime rose up and Robert saw Susan\u2019s face and was shocked to see his wife in such a state. \u201cOh my gosh!\u201d yelled Robert. \u201cSusan?!\u201d Susan just blushed as her slimy body was bubbling as four chins formed on her face. Susan was now truly huge. She was a 25ft tall blob who would weigh 4 tons if she was normal sized. She had a 25ft wide stomach and a large 35ft ass, though because of her slimy body, she was more than flexible enough to reposition herself. \u201cSlight accident with something the boys brought back from the meteor,\u201d said the blob woman to her husband. \u201cLet\u2019s just say mutagenic ooze isn\u2019t just restricted to Mirage Comics.\u201d Robert just poked at his wife\u2019s slimy stomach and looked in surprise and then disgust. \u201cNow this is going to take some getting used to. But I think we can make it work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan let out a groan as she tried to pull her liquid red body together. \u201cI hope so. This day isn\u2019t going at all well. And now I\u2019m starving.\u201d Susan oozed out of the lab and then was moving her body across the hall, as she tried to keep her ooze body together. \u201cSusan?\u201d asked Robert. \u201cWhere are you going now?\u201d \u201cWhere does it look like?\u201d asked the blob woman. \u201cTo the kitchen. I feel like I could eat a dinosaur.\u201d Robert could only let out a sigh as he followed his wife. \u201cWhat am I going to tell Adrian?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I could just walk up to our son and tell him that his mother is now a giant creature made out of cosmic ooze.\u201d Robert then gagged in disgust as he stepped on a loose piece of slime that appeared to have come off of his wife. \u201cNow this is definitely going to take some getting used to.\"</span></div></div>",

The glob was shaking in place right before it retreated to reattach to Susan. \u201cYech,\u201d groaned Robert. \u201cThat\u2019s even more repulsive than that mother in law of mine.\u201d Robert then heard a ravenous eating sound and then walked down the hall to investigate and then looked in disgust because his now gigantic and amorphous wife was emptying out an entire vending machine. She was shoving the contents of her wallet (just don\u2019t ask me where a slime creature would keep a wallet) into the slot and jamming the buttons before shoving candies, chips and snack cakes into her body where they appeared to dissolve and fizzle into her body. \u201cOh my gosh! Susan! That is totally disgusting! Ugh! You don\u2019t have to worry about getting me dinner for the next... five weeks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blob creature then raised her hand before taking a good look at her husband. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Robert. But I\u2019ve got a hunger that I can\u2019t control. I feel like a black hole just opened up in my stomach. I\u2019m a 25ft high pile of cosmic ooze for crying out loud! You think I planned on something so bizarre happening to me.\u201d That\u2019s when Susan heard a jamming noise and saw that a bag of chips got stuck in the vending machine. The slime woman let out a grunt and oozed herself into the machine where she proceeded to devour and absorb everything that she had yet to consume from the machine. Robert gagged and held his mouth as Susan\u2019s slimy body oozed in pieces out of the machine and then reassembled into his gelatinous wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan rubbed her stomach and realized that it expanded and she had grown 10ft higher. \u201cOh geez.\u201d She said. Robert gave a gulp. \u201cYou know something, Susan,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe you better stop stuffing yourself. You\u2019re gonna get as big as a house if you keep that up.\u201d Susan thought about that and smiled. \u201cCool!\u201d she yelled. Robert gave a look of worry and this prompted his giant slime wife to look rather nervous. \u201cOh come on,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t enjoy being a titanic blob?\u201d \u201cSusan,\u201d said Robert to his glob of a wife. \u201cYou seriously look like something out of a 1940s horror movie. And burgundy, that\u2019s definitely not your color.\u201d Susan then lowered her head. \u201cCome on, Robert,\u201d she said. \u201cI may look different on the outside. Okay, so I\u2019m a gelatinous giant and a bottomless pit, but I am still human. I think. What do you say? Open to a new experience with an old wife.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert gave a nervous smile and then walked up to his wife to kiss her on the lips to let her know that it didn\u2019t matter that she was a giant pile of slime. Of course, as he was doing this, it took all his willpower not to groan in disgust from the slime that got in his mouth. \u201cOh,\u201d thought Robert to himself. \u201cGross. She tastes horrible. And her kiss. I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s force feeding me her slime or trying to swallow me whole. She\u2019s never been this aggressive before. Calm down, Robert. This is your wife. I just wish that the preacher knew what to say for a situation like this. At last Susan let go of her husband's lips and Robert turned his head and shivered. The slime giantess still felt empty inside and then she turned to see a water cooler up ahead and smiled as she licked her lips. Susan unscrewed the water cooler and then chugged the contents before swallowing the entire cooler as Robert looked in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blob giantess then let out a thunderous belch before covering her mouth. \u201cOops,\u201d she said. \u201cExcuse me. Oh my gosh. We better pick up Adrian from school.\u201d Of course, Robert was very worried about that decision. \u201cAre you sure that that\u2019s such a good idea, Susan?\u201d asked Robert to his giant slime of a wife. \u201cWhat would Adrian think if he saw that his mom was a titanic creature made out of alien ooze.\u201d Susan just lowered her head to kiss her husband and cover his head in slime. \u201cYou worry too much, honey,\u201d she said. \u201cNow let\u2019s come on.\u201d Robert let out a sigh and then walked up to the car but then realized something. Robert looked at his car and then he looked at his wife and then he realized that there was no way Susan would be able to fit in the car. Fortunately, Susan broke herself down into smaller bits that followed the car as the part with her personality inside of it clung to the front of Robert\u2019s car. Robert saw the slimy chunks of Susan following after him while the piece that had Susan\u2019s mind was stuck to the front of his car. \u201cI really hope we don\u2019t attract any stares, Susan.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said Susan. \u201cAdrian\u2019s school is up ahead. We\u2019re almost there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as the Pottses reached the school, they saw their son being pushed against a chain link fence by two bullies. \u201cWhat\u2019s the deal, Potts!? That report you wrote for me was bad.\u201d \u201cIf you want something done right, do it yourself. It wasn\u2019t MY homework.\u201d However, the lead bully just punched Adrian again. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna pay for your insubordinate Adrian. Let\u2019s see how attached you are to that hair.\u201d Needless to say, Robert and Susan didn\u2019t take it kindly that their son was being bullied in front of them. However, before Robert could say a word, Susan pulled her blobby body together and then slinked her way up behind the two malcontents. When they were about to attack Adrian, Susan let out a growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bullies turned and looked in fear as the 30ft blob creature made a ghoulish face at them and roared like a kaiju. The bullies screamed and ran as they pushed Adrian towards the creature, not knowing it was Adrian's mother. Adrian himself looked in fear only for the slime to smile at him. Adrian stepped back and backed up into Robert who grabbed his son by the shoulders to calm him down. \"Whoa. Easy there, kiddo. No need to get excited.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDad!\u201d yelled Adrian. \u201cWhat on Earth is that disgusting thing!\u201d Susan seemed to take offense at her son\u2019s comment but since he didn\u2019t know it was her, she decided not to get mad at him. \u201cI\u2019m choosing not to punish you for that comment since there\u2019s no way you would know,\u201d said Robert. \u201cAdrian. That disgusting thing is your mother.\u201d Adrian saw the slime form into Susan\u2019s obese and gigantic form but with her recognizable face staring down at her son. \u201cHi, Sweetie.\u201d Adrian could not believe what he was seeing and took off his glasses before rubbing them and putting them back on. \u201cNo way,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat happened? Did she get into a lab accident or something!?\u201d \u201cUh,\u201d said Susan. \u201cSomething like that. Let\u2019s just say I learned that there is some credit to the term \u201cSecrets of the Ooze\u201d. Please don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrian was more baffled than actually afraid and picked up a stick. He would\u2019ve poked his mother, but her slimy body grabbed the stick and threw it to the side before Susan growled slightly. \u201cAlready tried that, kid,\u201d said Robert. \u201cI don\u2019t think she likes it.\u201d Adrian stepped back in fear before Susan broke her slimy body into pieces that were each the size of a dog. The pieces of the amorphous SSBBW passed by her husband and son who could only look in dumbfounded shock. \u201cI\u2019ll see you boys at home.\u201d One of the pieces said. Adrian gagged in disgust and Robert tapped him on the back. \u201cBelieve me, son,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s only going to get weirder and weirder from here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan\u2019s slimy body was in pieces but the fragments of the blob goddess had gathered in groups and entered through gaps in pipes throughout the city in order to find the quickest route to the Potts Residence. Along the way, several of the globs absorbed more and more water, making some pieces of the slime woman much bigger than others, with the main piece of Susan ballooning to the size of a cow. One sewer maintenance worker was walking by a corridor when he gasped upon seeing the cow-sized chunk of slime form into a small version of the main body and rub her chin. Susan let out a mumble. \u201cHmmm,\u201d she said. \u201cAha. Home should be this way.\u201d With that, the slime Susan turned back to ooze and scurried off as the rest of the chunks of her followed. The maintenance worker could not believe what he saw and went to take out his phone to call his superiors to report on what he just saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Robert and Adrian had arrived home way before Susan did. \u201cWhere\u2019s Mom?\u201d asked Adrian. \u201cShe said she was going to meet us here.\u201d Robert then let out a sigh. \u201cSomething tells me she found an alternative and much more revolting means of travel than we did.\u201d Robert then made his way up to the kitchen sink and turned on the nozzle. This caused the sink to sputter slightly and then burgundy slime came out and Adrian screamed at the sight of his oozy blob of a mother coming out of the kitchen faucet. The slime then overflowed into the kitchen floor and Robert yelled as he had to run out of the kitchen as his enormous wife reformed. Susan had reformed so fast that her body was leaking into three rooms. She had indeed gotten much bigger and had to weigh 20 tons by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan's head finally formed and she accidentally coughed up some of her own slime all over her husband as her son looked in disgust. \"Oops,\" said Susan. \"Sorry about that, honey.\" Robert groaned and shook off Susan's slime. \"Now this is the kind of sticky that I'll never be able to get used to. Ugh.\" Susan just laughed nervously. \"Don't worry, honey. We'll make it work.\" \"I hope you both do,\" said Adrian in disgust. \"Because there is no way I'll be able to get used to having a mom made out of goo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Susan realized something and gasped. \"Oh my gosh!\" yelled the blimpish blob behemoth. \"Oh my good golly gosh. Robert, I forgot to tell you.\" Robert looked at Susan in worry. \"Forgot to tell me what?\" Susan gave a nervous look. \"Well,\" said the slime being to her husband. \"I meant to tell you earlier that...\"</span></div></div>",

'Revealing what?' She thought. 'Come on, think!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena was a screenwriter for McBelico Studios. In particular, she was one of the many writers for the popular horror anthology series, <i>The Fair of Fear</i>. Currently, she was writing the 15th Episode, <i>Revenge of the Witch</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena certainly looked the part of a horror writer. Selena stood at 5'10'', had long, raven black hair, and black eyes. She had a fair build, with C cup breasts, fair hips, and a decent butt. As a Goth, she wore dark clothing all the time. Today, it was a long, black skirt, a black t-shirt, and black boots. She also had black lipstick and black eyeliner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena was just about to start smashing her head against the keyboard in anger when she heard the door open. Turning, she saw her husband, Eddie, walk in. He was holding a bag. Eddie was an inch shorter then Selena, had dirty blonde hair and green eyes, and a skinny build. He was actually an actor at McBelico Studios, which is how the two of them met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey hun.\" He said as he walked up and kissed her. \"How's the episode coming? There a part for me in it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I though you were due for a beer ad shoot?\" Selena asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It got pushed back. Apparently the director ate some bad lobster.\" Eddie replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Well, I would find you a part if I could figure out what kind of monster Calinda will summon.\" Selena told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe this will help.\" Eddie said as he pulled something out of the bag. It was a solid black book. \"I got this at a small curio shop. It was pretty interesting. They even had an animatronic skull. It glowed and said \"I would advise against buying that book.\" It was incredible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. I'll have to visit sometime.\" Selena said. She then took the book and read the cover \"Hm, 'The Book of 10,000 Creatures.' Maybe this can help.\"<br>\r\nSelena then began flipping through the book. Suddenly, she stopped on a page. \"There! That's it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pointed at a picture of a succubus. It had red skin, raven black hair, red eyes, horns, a spade tail, and hooves for feet. It was also incredibly obese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena looked up at Eddie. \"There's what Calinda will summon. A succubus to devour her enemies.\" Unknown to her, while she and Eddie weren't looking, a glow travelled from the picture up Selena's finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Eddie said. \"I need to go practice my lines for the ad. Good luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Eddie walked off.

Her spade tail had fully formed, her feet had turned into hooves, her eyes had turned red, and she had grown horns on her head. Now her skin had started to change to red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also seemed to be getting taller and fatter. Her shirt was getting tighter as her belly and breasts blew up slowly, her hips began to press against the armrests of the chair, her butt sank into the chair as it grew, and her arms and legs were getting thicker as well. She was even starting to form a second chin. But she was so engrosed in her writing that she didn't notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And as the succubus was pulled back into the vortex,\" Selena said to herself as she typed. \"The village people sighed in relief, knowing that the witch and her demon were banished forever.\" She then grinned as she put in the last sentence. \"Finally! Story's done! Now to email it to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't get a chance to finish as the chair collapsed under her increasing weight. She landed hard on the floor, her new flab jiggling. She sat up and rubbed her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! Stupid chair.\" She mutted. \"I told Eddie-\" She stopped when she felt her new horns. She then looked at her hands and saw they were blood red and still getting fatter. She stood up and felt her horns brush the ceiling. She was speechless. Eventually, she stopped growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard footsteps coming down the stairs. Eddie raced into the living room. \"I heard a crash! What-\" He stopped when he saw Selena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena was now 9 feet tall. Her breasts had grown into G cups, her belly was 8 feet wide, her butt was now 7 feet wide, and her arms and legs were twice as thick as before. She had a second chin and the beginnings of a third one. Her shirt and skirt were barely holding on. Her skin and eyes were blood red, she had curving horns on top of her head, a long spade tail stuck out behind her, and she had hooves for feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Selena?\" Eddie asked, surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena looked at herself. \"Um, before you ask, no I don't know what happened. And that crash was the chair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look like a succubus.\" Eddie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena's eyes lit up. \"Wait, a succubus...\" She turned back to her screen and read her story again. \"I look like the succubus I wrote in my story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You made yourself like this by writing?\" Eddie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so. Maybe it was that book.\" Selena said. \"Didn't you say you bought it at a weird shop?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I don't see-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair of Fear, episode 4. The Strange Shop. In it, a man buys a book from a shop that traps him in it's pages.

Maybe I can get some acting gigs like this.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, let's not get hasty. First, we should find out if this is reversable. Let's go to that shop.\" Eddie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That shops not going anywhere. Let's swing by the studio first.

However, once her belly was through the door, the succubus's ass had gotten stuck and Selena grunted. Eddie could only stare at his mutated wife's bright scarlet ass that was swallowing her jeans whole and her spade tail that was waving. \"Uh, Ediie,\" said Selena. \"Would you mind.\" Eddie simply poked his wife's 7ft wide ass before he gave it a swift kick and pushed the big succubus out of the door. However, in the process, Selena's huge stomach flattened their car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn.\" Grunted Selena as she got up. Eddie yelled in horror at what happened to the car. If Selena's skin wasn't already red, she would be blushing. Then, Selena saw that she had sprouted a pair of leather wings and opened the blue wings wide to show that her wingspan was 15ft. This gave the writer an idea and was soon flying through the sky with Eddie holding onto her horns as he rode on his wife\u2019s back. \u201cThis is amazing,\u201d said Eddie. \u201cWho needs the car when you can fly.\u201d Selena gave a laugh. \u201cThis should get everyone\u2019s attention at McBelico Studios.\" Eddie's eyes popped. \"The studio? What about that shop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena let out a scoff before she landed on another car in the studio parking lot and inadvertently squashed it under her big butt. \"Relax, Eddie. It's not as if the store is going anywhere. Oh darn. I guess that I better get used to having two car crushers attached to me.\" Selena walked towards the studio with a piece of the car stuck to her big red butt. The guard on duty was laughing as he was reading the newspaper. \"I hate mondays too. Preaching to the choir, fat cat.\" The guard noticed a shadow over him and then gasped as he looked at Selena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Ralph,\" said Selena. \"It's just me. Selena.\" Ralph lowered his newspaper and was surprised. \"Duh,\" he muttered. \"That is one hell of a good makeup job, Mrs. Bell. You can now enter the studio.\u201d Selena smiled but then grunted because her thunder thighs got stuck in the turnstile. She let out a sigh and then she tore the turnstile off as she walked in with Eddie walking behind. At that time in the studio, there was an animatronic creature resembling a stack of pancakes with teeth that resembled maple syrup and blueberries for eyes. It gave a hiss before sputtering out smoke. \u201cDang it, Rita,\u201d said the director. \u201cWe need that Pancakesaurus ready for episode 14 of Fair of Fear.\u201d The dark-skinned and brown-haired technician let out a sigh. \u201cWhen Pancakes Attack. I got it. You know, these animatronics can be difficult to manage, Paul.\u201d That episode is supposed to air in 2 weeks. Speaking of which, where is Selena with the script for episode 15.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment Selena stomped in and Paul and Rita both gasped. Selena smiled as she looked down at the two. She actually seemed to have gotten slightly taller and fatter. \u201cHey, Paul. Hi Rita.\u201d \u201cSelena?\u201d asked Rita. \u201cDamn. I knew you were stuck on an idea but to apply so much makeup just for inspiration.\u201d Selena let out a laugh. \u201cThis isn\u2019t makeup.\u201d \u201cNot makeup?\u201d asked Paul. \u201cIt\u2019s realistic, I\u2019ll give you that, but I don\u2019t...\u201d Suddenly Selena broke into a coughing fit and breathed fire from her mouth that spooked Paul and Rita. Selena let out a nervous laugh. \u201cGood grief!\u201d yelled Rita. \u201cYou\u2019re a real succubus?! What happened.\u201d Eddie nervously came forward. \u201cIt\u2019s a long story involving a magic book.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena panted and stuck out her forked tongue. \u201cWell,\u201d she said. \u201cIt does so happens that my latest episode for Fair of Fear involves a succubus. I came up with the idea when suddenly I turned into one and it made me realize that I could play the succubus myself.\u201d Selena gave a laugh as the director and the effects woman looked in surprise.</span></div></div>",

I didn\u2019t think you were running a ponzi scheme.\u201d \u201cIs it my fault they invested in a company stationed in a country that they didn\u2019t know wasn\u2019t real? Come on, I\u2019ll bet that Abigail\u2019s been waiting for me.\u201d Jacqueline gave a glare on the other side of the phone. \u201cListen. You are not to step 100ft within radius of our daughter. She was only a baby when you were taken to prison and she doesn\u2019t have any idea that her father committed the crime of the decade. I intend to keep it that way. Good bye, Horace!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Jacqueline slammed down her phone and left her ex-husband fuming mad. \u201cThat stuck up bitch!\u201d yelled Horace. \u201cLike she never made a single mistake in her life!

What do you want?\u201d Horace looked at the skull in pure shock and horror. He then bit his lip and tapped on the skull as it gave a grunt. The skull then retaliated by biting Horace. Horace let out a yell of pain. \u201cOh, a wise guy.\u201d Horace would\u2019ve pounded the skull but the zombie grabbed him by the hands and restrained him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know,\u201d said the skull. \u201cIt\u2019s unwise to pick a fight with the supernatural.\u201d Horace let out a sigh. \u201cLook,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not here to\u2026\u201d \u201cWait,\u201d said the skull. \u201cI recognize you.

I don\u2019t think that I should sell you anything.\u201d \u201cListen, bonehead,\u201d said Horace. \u201cI\u2019ve had a rough day and I assure you, I\u2019ve gone straight.\u201d \u201cThen why do I detect malicious thoughts emanating from you?\u201d Horace let out a groan. \u201cIt\u2019s that stupid ex-wife of mine. She won\u2019t even let me see my own daughter.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t imagine why.\u201d Said the skull sarcastically. \u201cThis is a magic shop, isn\u2019t it? I\u2019d like to place a curse on Jacqueline.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skull let out a sigh. \u201cWhy do I even bother?\u201d he asked himself. \u201cWhy do I allow things like this to happen? I know that there is no way this will end well. But then again, nothing ever changes.\u201d The skull opened his mouth and revealed a strange necklace of some kind with a charm shaped like a jackal\u2019s head with a blue sapphire in the mouth. Horace held up the necklace and gave a look of confusion. \u201cA necklace?\u201d \u201cThat necklace contains an amulet associated with the Egyptian god of mummification, Anubis. Once your ex-wife puts on the necklace, the effects can never be reversed.\u201d Horace gave an evil smirk. \u201cThat\u2019s just the kind of thing that I love to hear.\u201d Horace then walked out with the necklace as the skull realized something. \u201cHey!\u201d the skull yelled. \u201cWait a minute! He didn\u2019t pay!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long before Horace went to work. At that moment, Jacqueline was getting her coat as she prepared to pick up her daughter Abigail from school. However, as she opened the door, she found a strange package. Jacqueline looked down in confusion before she picked up and opened the box. Inside the box was the amulet and a note. Jacqueline opened the note and read it loud and clear. \u201cConsider this a peace offering. Horace.\u201d Jacqueline held up the necklace and looked at it in curiosity. \u201cHuh,\u201d said Jacqueline. \u201cIt looks nice.\u201d Jacqueline put on the necklace and it let out a flash of light. \u201cI have to say,\u201d said Jacqueline to herself. \u201cHorace has good taste. He might finally be doing something right. I just hope this necklace wasn\u2019t stolen. As Jacqueline walked away, her shadow briefly turned into that of an obese laughing humanoid jackal that gave a sinister cackle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Jacqueline was blissfully unaware as she got into her car to run and pick up her daughter.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cMedusa was one of the three gorgon sisters. She was the only mortal gorgon of the sister. She was originally a beautiful woman who made the grave mistake of having sex with the ocean god Poseidon in the temple of Athena. The enraged goddess transformed Medusa into a horrible creature, a creature with poisonous snakes for hair who would turn anyone who looked her in the eye into stone. A hero called Perseus was sent by the wicked King Polydectes to fetch the head of this beast. Perseus used Athena\u2019s mirrored shield to be able to face the gorgon without being petrified and lopped off Medusa\u2019s head. Oh my. What a horrifying story.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Barbara closed the book on Greek mythology that she was reading and put it to the side as she continued to soak in the tub. The 6\u2019 10\u201d blonde had been resorting to a medicinal bath to cure cramps in her legs she had been developing lately. She had recently found out that she had Greek ancestry and had been brushing up on Greek mythology. However, the myths that the young woman read had her slightly curious. \u201cI wonder,\u201d she said as she added some more bath salts. \u201cMaybe there\u2019s some truth to these myths. I wonder if the monsters of mythology actually existed at one point.\u201d Barbara was a deep thinker. She was always asking questions. Something that drove her husband up the wall. Barbara\u2019s husband, Andy was at work that moment and told her ahead of time that he was going to be late that night and wouldn\u2019t be home for dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara let out a sigh. \u201cI\u2019m bored,\u201d she said. \u201cI wonder if Andy is working overtime on purpose to avoid me. I feel like our marriage has been on the rocks lately. Not that I blame him. I took a few days off from work just to see if we could save our marriage and he has to work late. There just hasn\u2019t been any excitement lately. If only real life was as interesting as mythology. Maybe he\u2019s been avoiding me because my legs have been sore. Come to think about it, my eyes have been killing me lately as well. I might just have to see the eye doctor.\u201d Barbara just let out a yawn, but what she didn\u2019t notice was that her tongue was forked, just like that of a snake. Barbara then drained the water in the tub and then got out. She held her head because her eyes were bothering her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was the least of her worries. For one, she was now 11\u2019 tall and she was now very obese, she would likely weigh 900lbs. But that was nothing compared to below her waist. Her feet had transformed into the tail of a puff adder, a type of poisonous African snake. The mirror was too fogged up for Barbara to see herself but she shrugged it off and then put a towel through her hair as she hummed to herself. At that moment, she heard the doorbell ring downstairs. \u201cOh!\u201d yelled Barbara as she removed the towel from her hair. \u201cThat must be the pizza I ordered.\u201d Barbara then tossed the towel to the side, not realizing that her hair had turned into puff adders that gave a hiss and her eyes had turned into those of a snake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara was unaware of the transformation as she slithered down the hallway and down the stairs. With every inch, she became bigger and more obese, to the point that the floor was cracking underneath her serpentine tail, all while she was completely unaware of what was happening with her body.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The normal curator was sick, so Chris's girlfriend, Roxanne was in charge of putting the exhibit together. \"Be careful, Chris,\" said Roxanne as Chris used a forklift to carry a statue resembling an Egyptian hippopotamus goddess. \"That is the idol of Tawaret.\" \"Ta-what?\" asked Chris. \"Baby, I'm sorry I didn't take Egyptology class back at the University with you, but even I never heard of a hippopotamus god.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxanne sighed as the hippo statue was put in place. \"Goddess. Tawaret, meaning \"she who is great\" was the ancient Egyptian goddess of childbirth and fertility. She was depicted as a hippopotamus with prominent human breasts and a pregnant stomach. As well as the hippo, her symbol was the ivory dagger. Did you know that hippopotami inhabited ancient Egypt's Nile before the dawn of dynastic Egypt? While male hippos were thought to be manifestations of chaos, females were revered as manifestations of apotropaic deities due to how fiercely they protected their young. Tawaret is closely grouped with several other hippo goddesses such as Ipet \"the Nurse\", Reret \"The Sow\" and Hedjet \"The White One\".\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris shook his head before turning his attention back to Roxanne. \"I don't think I like my girlfriend's unhealthy fascinations with hippos. I'll bet sometimes you wish you were a hippo.\" The redhead adjusted her glasses and shook her head at her boyfriend's joke as he laughed at it. \"Not all hippo goddesses were as nurturing. Ammit devoured the souls of the unjust.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there was a loud thump that shook the room. Chris held out his hands to stop the Taweret Statue from falling. However, what neither of them noticed was that there was a bejeweled crown on the top of the statue that fell and landed on Roxanne's hand before letting out a glow. Roxanne however hadn't realized that the crown was on her head. \"Be careful with that!\" she yelled to the other staff of the museum. \"That storage chamber to the pharaoh could contain fragile artifacts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris saw Roxanne walking forward and then stopped her. \"Uh, Roxanne, look up.\" Roxanne looked up and saw that the crown of Tawaret was around her head. \"Uh-oh,\" she said. \"It must've fallen off of the statue when those meatheads mishandled the tomb.\" Roxanne tried to pull off the crown but it was no use. \"Oh, great,\" she moaned. \"It's stuck. I'll have to get some lubricant. I don't think the goddess would appreciate me wearing her crown.\" However, that crown was about to become a more colossal problem than Roxanne realized because what Chris saw that she didn't was that her eyes were now glowing.</span></div></div>",

However, the crown was stuck too tight. \"Come on,\" groaned the substitute curator. \"I've got a degree in Egyptology and I can't get a stupid crown off my head.\" Roxanne then screamed in pain because when she tried to grease her head, it only seemed to make the crown on her head all the more tighter. \"Well this is a fine mess. The museum opens tomorrow. I need to get this crown off for the exhibit. Ouch!\" \"Everything okay in there baby?\" asked Chris. Roxanne let out a sigh. \"It won't budge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxanne grumbled and then decided to walk out of the restroom, in the process, she seemed to get stuck in the door and grunted as she pushed her way through and accidentally knocked her boyfriend to the ground. Of course, the crown was still stuck to her head and she was not too happy about it as she got up. \"I'm beginning to think that this crown had some sort of ancient glue attached to it.\" Said Roxanne. Chris gave a smile to try and reassure his girlfriend. \"Why don't you just keep it on, Roxanne?\" he asked. \"It makes you look sexy.\" Roxanne gave an embarrassed smile. \"Who knows?\" asked Chris with a laugh. \"Maybe that means you're the new Egyptian goddess of pregnancy and childbirth.\" Roxanne let out a sigh. \"We better lock up.\" As Roxanne was walking ahead of him, Chris noticed that his girlfriend's ass appeared to have gotten bigger. \"Roxanne?\" he asked. \"Have you been putting on weight?\" Roxanne turned and glared at her boyfriend with her eyes mysteriously glowing red. \"Excuse me?\" Chris looked in fear at his girlfriend's red eyes. \"Uh, Roxanne,\" he said. \"Have you been getting enough sleep, your eyes look a little red.\" Roxanne ignored her boyfriend and soon, the two of them had locked up the museum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxanne let out a deep sigh and Chris noticed that two of her incisors looked like they were sharper than they were before. Also, Roxanne appeared to be two heads taller than him. He even rubbed his eyes before Roxanne turned around. \"Well,\" said Roxanne. \"Maybe the exhibit can survive without the crown.\" Roxanne felt the crown on her head before she and Chris were walking away. \"Honestly,\" she said. \"I don't know what Harold was thinking hiring those goons to handle... or should I say... manhandle the new Egyptian wing. Cutting corners. It's a good thing he got sick so I can minimalize the damage. And yet the crown is still on my head.\" \"Roxanne,\" said Chris. \"Relax. I'll just get my dad's crowbar.\" \"You'll damage the crown, Chris. No thanks.\" Suddenly, Roxanne let out a groan and felt her hips.\" \"What's wrong?\" Chris asked his girlfriend. Roxanne scratched her hips and grunted. \"I just bought these pants and they already feel a little tight... ugh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxanne then heard a loud ripping noise and both she and Chris looked back to see that Roxanne's ass had expanded and was now wider than she was tall. \"What the?\" asked Roxanne. The crown on Roxanne's head begun to glow, as did Roxanne's eyes as she gasped. \"Rox?\" asked Chris uneasily. The bun in Roxanne's hair came undone and Roxanne's butt got even bigger as her ears started to change shape and she appeared to be getting taller. A small tail sprouted right above Roxanne's butt crack as Roxanne looked down and saw her belly getting larger as well. Roxanne felt her rolls and then mumbled in pain as her shoes were aching her. Roxanne took off her shoes to reveal her feet had turned into large and flat ungulate-like feet with large toes. \"Oh no.\" She said as her pants were further coming apart. \"Roxanne?\" asked Chris. \"What's happening?\" \"I don't know!\" yelled Roxanne as her glasses fell off and shattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxanne then grabbed her head as her teeth all turned sharp and her canine teeth enlarged into long and sharp tusks as her face stretched out into a large snout. Roxanne also started to grow bigger and fatter and then her skin turned a pale pink color as her eyes continued to glow red. Roxanne let out a scream as the transformation was completed. Chris looked up in shock as Roxanne had turned into a 20ft tall and 17 ton pear-shaped anthropomorphic hippopotamus with glowing red eyes. \"Oh my gosh!\" yelled Chris. \"Roxanne? Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxanne then feels her head and lets out a series of hippo style grunts as the tiara on her head continued to glow.</span></div></div>",

Chris looked in fear at his girlfriend and noticed her eyes were still red. \"Roxanne?\" asked Chris in uncertainty. The archaeologist turned hippopotamus looked around at her new form and was in utter shock. She then twitched and started to grow bigger. As she stood up, Roxanne saw that she had had a growth spurt that made her reach 40ft tall with a 50ft stomach and 60ft ass along with a pair of H-cup breasts that bounced on her big belly. Roxanne's shirt and pants were reduced to tears and Chris had to cover his eyes as he looked up and saw Roxanne's privates in view from her torn up underwear. \"Oh geez.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxanne was surprised and decided that she should take a seat to try and think this situation over. In the process, she sat right down on top of a large truck and flattened the 16 wheeler until it was like a piece of paper stuck to her huge hippopotamus booty. \"Well this is an interesting situation,\" said Roxanne. \"When I was a little girl, I had fantasies of becoming a unicorn, but I never thought I'd turn into a hippopotamus.\" Roxanne grunted and then noticed the tiara still stuck to her head. It was the only article of clothing that grew with her when she turned into a big hippo. Chris walked forward and poked his girlfriend in her calves big enough to be used as wrecking balls and then took a seat on one of the hippo giantess's enormous toes. \"Roxanne,\" he said. \"How could this...\" \"Isn't it obvious?\" asked Roxanne. \"The tiara of Tawaret must be cursed somehow. It turned me into an enormous hippopotamus, just like the goddess herself. That must've been why I couldn't take it off. From the looks of it, the tiara was looking for a girl to wear it in order to transform them into an avatar; somewhat of a new incarnation of Tawaret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris was very uneasy with this predicament. From the looks of it, his girlfriend was now a huge and obese hippopotamus goddess. He wasn't sure of it. Roxanne had to lift her massive stomach in order to get a better look at her small boyfriend. \"Well,\" Roxanne said. \"Maybe this isn't that terrible a situation. The exhibit in the Egyptian wing did need the crown for the exhibit, but to see an actual Egyptian goddess up close...\" But then, Roxanne grunted because Chris was climbing up her leg. The hippo woman got up as her boyfriend was grabbing hold of the mutated archaeologist's soft, fleshy, obese, pink-colored flesh and then Roxanne bent over with her stomach touching the ground as Chris tried to climb up the hippo woman's enormous ass. Roxanne felt Chris climbing up but Chris kept slipping because of how soft and sweaty the hippo's booty was and was forced to grab the end of Roxanne's stubby tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris pressed his feet into the big fat hippo booty and made Roxanne grunt as she climbed up her crack and onto her back. Because Roxanne was bent over, Chris was easily able to walk to the end of Roxanne's back and climb onto her head through the bun in her abode-colored hair. Once Chris was on her scalp, Roxanne stood back up. \"Chris?\" the giant hippopotamus woman asked of her boyfriend. Chris grunted and grabbed the backside of the crown and tried to pull it off. \"Maybe if I can get this tiara off,\" he said. \"I can reverse the...\" Chris then yelled as more magical energy came out of the crown and bathed Roxanne as she yelled and grunted. The energy pulsed into Roxanne and caused Roxanne's hair to not only turn a bright golden color but for her bun to come undone and let her hair down. \"Oh my.\" Said Roxanne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxanne then begun to glow and grow up to 75ft in heigh with an 85ft belly and 100ft wide ass. Chris stood in the center of Roxanne's head as more magic filled Roxanne's body and Roxanne's pink skin turned a brighter shade as Egyptian hieroglyphic tattoos appeared all over her body and glowed bright. Then the magic manifested clothes on Roxanne that better fit an Egyptian goddess; even if said Egyptian goddess was in fact a titanically obese hippopotamus. First she obtained a pair of golden scarab earrings. Then she obtained a regal amulet that resembled an Egyptian eye. Finally, Roxanne obtained a regal blue dress that looked like it belonged on Cleopatra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris looked down at his enormous hippo goddess girlfriend and saw her eyes were now glowing gold instead of red as his jaw dropped and nose bled. Roxanne was now so titanically huge, obese and heavy that even her slightest movements created small earthquakes. \"That was a bad idea, Chris.\" She said. The hippo giantess then plucks off her boyfriend from her hair and places him on her snout. \"What do we do now?\" asked Chris.</span></div></div>",

Whoa! What\u2019s going on, Roxanne? An earthquake.\u201d Roxanne held her stomach as her glowing eyes became brighter. The hippo shook her head. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t an earthquake, Chris. I\u2019m starving. Since I got turned into a hippo goddess, I guess this goddess needs food badly.\u201d Roxanne stomped down the street, creating huge craters in the process as she looked for anything remotely edible. Chris became very worried. \u201cI really hope that the gods of ancient Egypt weren\u2019t into human sacrifice.\u201d He thought to himself. During Roxanne\u2019s search for food, the 75ft hippopotamus noticed a fruit cart that was unattended down below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello,\u201d thought the hippopotamus to herself. \u201cThat looks tasty.\u201d Roxanne bent down and picked up the fruit cart. She held up the cart and opened her mouth wide, showing her sharp teeth. She proceeded to dump all the bananas, melons, apples and grapes left in the cart into her awaiting mouth before swallowing everything. Roxanne heard her stomach rumble again and let out a sigh. \u201cFigures a small handful of fruit wouldn\u2019t do it for me.\u201d \u201cWell, duh,\u201d said Chris as he tried to stand up on Roxanne\u2019s nipple. \u201cYou\u2019re a hippo. How much do hippos eat a day.\u201d Roxanne turned around and shrugged her shoulders. \u201cIronically, hippos only eat 1-1.5% their body weight a day. But since I\u2019m as big as a building, 1% of my body weight is still enormous. Ack!\u201d Roxanne tried to walk away but they she turned her head to see that her ass was now stuck between two large skyscrapers. \u201cOh no,\u201d said the hippopotamus giantess to herself. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that my ass got bigger.\u201d Roxanne wiggled her big hippo booty to tip the buildings slightly right before she squeezed her big rear out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh,\u201d said the giantess goddess. \u201cThat\u2019s better.\u201d Roxanne\u2019s stomach growled again to remind her of her hunger and then she walked down the street looking for something else to eat. She looked ahead to see a closed donut shop with a large donut decoration on the top of it and licked her lips. Chris held on tight to his girlfriend\u2019s nipple as the hippopotamus giantess stomped down the street. \u201cRoxanne, no. That\u2019s not a real donut. It\u2019s made of styrofoam.\u201d Roxanne picked the donut up and tore it off its foundation before chewing it to bits and swallowing. \u201cI know,\u201d said Roxanne. \u201cBut I\u2019m 75ft tall and would weight 3 tons if I was human-sized. I need what I can get.\u201d Roxanne turned around, accidentally stomping on and flattening an entire parking lot in the process as she continued to move down the street. Eventually, she stubbed her toe on something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxanne was about to yell but covered her mouth. She definitely didn\u2019t want to alarm anyone to the sight of a hippopotamus as big as an entire office building. Roxanne then looked down and saw that she stubbed her toe against a truck that was lugging frozen meats. \u201cOh yeah,\u2019 said Roxanne as her mouth watered. \u201cThat\u2019s what I need.\u201d \u201cUh, Roxy,\u201d said Chris. \u201cThat\u2019s a meat truck.\u201d Roxanne lifted up the truck and held out her tongue. \u201cHere\u2019s a fun fact, Honey,\u201d she said to her tiny boyfriend. \u201cHippos are mostly herbivores but in rare occasions, such as famine, they\u2019ll eat meat and insects.\u201d Chris gave a look of horror at that thought just as Roxy emptied out the meat from the truck into her mouth and slurped it down. The Egyptologist turned Godzilla-sized Egyptian hippo goddess let out a belch and then crushed the truck like a beer can against her large booty. \u201cThat was a good meal.\u201d Suddenly, Roxanne held her stomach again and groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh man,\u201d groaned Chris. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re sick. Whoa!\u201d Roxanne begun to stomp much faster, shaking up the entire street as she was running outside of city limits. In the process, Chris is knocked off the hippo\u2019s breasts and yells as he it forced to grab hold of the tip of her tail. As he climbed the tail and felt Roxanne\u2019s fleshy butt, he realized that it was bigger than it was earlier and then he looked down to see that he appeared to be getting higher. No, Roxanne was getting bigger. Chris knew now why his hippo girlfriend was running out of town limits. Soon, Roxanne reached the wharf and after crushing several boats under her feet, she stepped foot into the water where she felt her stomach in pain and grew bigger and fatter. Her tiara and dress getting bigger to accommodate her growing body as the hippo let out a bellow. The commotion alerted several people out of their homes who gasped at the sight of what for all they knew was an Egyptian goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the obese hippo woman stopped growing bigger and fatter she was...</span></div></div>",

All the band members were in the back putting away their equipment. The lead guitarist, Eric was playing one last note on his guitar right before the bassist came in and pushed him in the back. \"Yo!' yelled Eric. \"Matt, what was that for!?\" \"That was for dooming the band, Eric! It's that girlfriend of yours.\" \"What's wrong with Kelly?\" asked Eric. Matt let out a scoff. \"I can't believe you made her the manager. What does she know about heavy metal anyway. You spend more time with that bitch than you do with the band.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Matt and Eric didn't know was that Kelly was listening and the Asian girl with bright green reptile like eyes did not like what she heard. \"Leave her alone, Matt,\" said Eric. \"I mean, you never liked Kelly. But she's been hooking us up with some good gigs.\" \"That you're always late for. I'm just thinking about the good of Toxic Nightshade.\" The drummer walked up to Kelly as she was listening in and getting angrier. \"That jerk,\" said Kelly. \"He's one to talk since he shows up wasted before every performance.\" \"Don't let Matt get to you, Kelly,\" said the drummer, Nick. \"I mean, he's just jealous that his girlfriend doesn't get to ride with us.\" Kelly smiled smugly but then she heard Matt screaming again. \"Face it, Eric! The bitch is dead weight! She's holding us back! She doesn't even look the part.\" \"She's the manager, Matt!\" yelled Eric. \"She's not...\" \"How are we going to be taken serious as a rock band with that pig on the tour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly now was madder than ever as she looked at her chubby stomach and she was going to go after Matt but Nick stopped her. \"Don't. He's not worth it. Besides, your man Eric is defending you.\" \"I don't need my boyfriend to defend me, all the time,\" snapped Kelly back. \"I'll prove to that idiot that I belong in this band.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, when everyone else was asleep, Kelly walked downtown. \"I know what,\" she said. \"I'll get a tattoo. A big one that says I'm all about heavy metal.\" Kelly looked down and saw a strange shop that looked like a tattoo parlor but on the top of the building looked like a witch's hat. As Kelly walked inside, she saw that the artist appeared to have tattoos of bones painted all over his body and appeared to be wearing nothing but a white speedo and a pair of dark glasses as he was watching a ballgame on the television. The skeleton man turned to see Kelly and adjusted his glasses slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me,\" said Kelly. \"Are you open.\" The skeleton man walked up towards Kelly and rubbed his chin. He pressed his hands against the chubby manager's cheeks and then let out a deep breath. \"I can hear your thoughts,\" he said. \"There is somebody who plagues you like a demon.\" \"That's kinds strong,\" said Kelly. \"I mean Matt is a jerk and all but I wouldn't call him a demon. Look, I'd like a tattoo. Something that yells out \"heavy metal\". The skeleton man nodded his head. \"You have three choices tonight,\" he said. \"Bat, spider or cobra.\" \"Cobra,\" said Kelly. \"Definitely cobra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skeleton man took out his needles and ink as Kelly laid down on her back. \"First,\" said the skeleton tattooed man. \"The tail.\" The skeleton man worked his needles as her etched the tail of the snake into Kelly's leg, belly and shoulder. Kelly grunted in pain from the needles but she swallowed her pain. \"And now,\" said the skeleton man as he continued to paint the scales. \"The head.\" The skeleton etched the head of the cobra tattooed and its bloody fangs on Kelly's back. Once the tattooing process was over, Kelly looked all over her body in the mirror. \"Oh my gosh,\" she said. \"It almost looks alive. You're awesome, dude. How much do I owe you.\" The skeleton man shook his head. \"You don't have to pay. This demon that plagues you will pay, soon enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly had no idea what the man meant but she didn't think much of it and then she walked away out of the shop. What she didn't know was that the tattoo parlor seemed to be slowly vanishing away. Once Kelly had left, the man with the skeleton tattoos took off his sunglasses and revealed that beneath there wasn't a pair of eyes. What Kelly didn't know was that the cobra tattoo was hissing on her back as its eyes glowed and scales were growing all over her back.</span></div></div>",

With each step she took, her stomach jiggled slightly as it puffed out further than before, and to boot she'd gained a few inches in height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, guys, I'm back!\" She announced loudly as she stepped back into their room, Matt cringing at her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, babe. Where'd you go off to?\" Eric asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I just felt that my presence here on the band wasn't really 'metal' enough for our style, so I just ran a quick errand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately a guilty look passed Eric's face as he stood up from the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Kelly, listen. You're just fine for the band, we don't want you to change for us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Kelly, you're cool just the way you are!\" Nick added. Matt, of course, remained silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, thanks, guys! But still, I thought what I got might really give us an edge we need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'd you get?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A tattoo!\" She announced, which caught Matt's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got inked?\" Matt snickered. \"Damn, whad'ya get!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Check it!\" She boasted a she lifted her shirt for Matt to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT\u2026THE\u2026FUCK\u2026\" He stammered, a look of pure horror on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? It's just a\u2026\" But as Kelly looked down at her (still growing) stomach, she was dead silent as she saw that her tattoo was gone, in its place an array of light tan scales. Her pants button finally burst apart as her stomach bulged out, now over 300 pounds heavy and quickly growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other three watched in stupefied horror as the scales grew along the rest of Kelly's body, her head stretching until it formed a snake-like anatomy, sharp flaps of brown-scaled skin stretching out from either side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly's body continued to inflate like a balloon, her clothing torn apart as they stretched beyond their limit around her expanding girth. Her legs grew so wide that they started to fuse together, and even started to recede as a gigantic, fat tale began to sprout from her behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also grew in height, stretching upwards foot by foot as she blossomed with fat. As she grew larger and fatter, her tale grew longer and fatter, laying behind her like an overinflated blimp. With her growth she looked less human and more like the serpent that had been imprinted on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, as her growth slowly spurted to a stop, Kelly reached over ten feet in height, reaching the ceiling. Her giant, tan belly was so huge that it was almost as wide and stuck out eight feet from her, her balloon-like breasts laying on top. The tail that laid behind her was almost twenty feet long as it was folded against the room behind her, and over eight feet wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDazed, but still conscious, Kelly looked down her fat arm and the scales it was adorned with, slowly taking in her transformation. Its scales were dark brown as the rest of her back was, painted with intricate black markings traveling down her body.</span></div></div>",

She felt her large stomach and then heard it growl loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't sound good.\" Said Nick. Kelly then let out a malicious sounding laugh. \"Well, well, a gal could get used to a body like this. There's just one problem. I'm starving.\" Kelly let out a hiss and licked her fangs before turning to the band. \"Uh, Nick,\" said Matt as he stepped back, noticing that Kelly was smiling at him menacingly. \"What do cobras eat?\" Kelly slithered up to Matt as she patted her stomach. \"Anything smaller than they are,\" said Nick in fear. \"From her markings, she's a king cobra.\" \"<i>Queen</i> cobra.\" Said Kelly correcting him. \"They'll even eat other cobras.\" Said Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly let out an evil laugh as she cornered Matt. \"Kelly,\" said Eric in worry. \"Baby.

What\u2019s with the lisp.\u201d \u201cNevermind that,\u201d said Kelly as she flickered her snake\u2019s tongue. \u201cToxic Nightshade just got a new act, one that is going to knock the crowds dead. As Kelly was speaking, there was a fly buzzing overhead that she then chomped on and swallowed before resuming speaking. \u201cThanks. Don\u2019t worry. They\u2019ll be there.\u201d The band then walked in and Kelly smiled and flickered her tongue. \u201cGood news,\u201d she said. \u201cI just got us a gig.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Interpol was hot on his trail but nobody ever succeeded in capturing him, especially because most of the items that he stole were rather bizarre. This very night, he was meeting with his fence girlfriend, Tiffany.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde was wearing her white coat as she poured a bottle of red wine. She was waiting for Ronan because she heard that he had captured something rather interesting. Before Tiffany could drink a single sip, she heard a knock at her door. Tiffany took out a gun as she approached the door, just in case it was the cops knocking. She opened the door to see Ronan's smiling face. \"Tiffany, baby, have I got a score for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany let out a sigh and let her boyfriend in. \"The master thief returns.\" She said. \"Try, king of thieves,\" said Ronan. \"And I've got something your customers in the underworld will pay through the nose for.\" Tiffany shook her head. \"I hope you're right. I barely got anything from that painting you stole.\" \"What? It was the Mona Freakin' Lisa.\" \"It was a counterfeit copy, Ronan. Somebody else beat you to the punch. What you stole was a knockoff. \"Pick, pick, pick,\" said Ronan. \"The last few prizes made up for it. I stole the Klopman Diamond and you turned it into the Klopman Diamonds, plural. No way to trace them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany let out a sigh. While Ronan was a screwup he did provide her with merchandise to auction off to the highest paying bidder, illegally of course. \"Alright, Ronan, what's on the market this time.\" Ronan reached out of his pocket and took the protective wrapping off his prize to reveal that it was the paw of some manner of monkey. Tiffany could only look in disbelief. \"A monkey's paw? Are you serious.\" \"Mandrill's paw actually,\" said Ronan. \"It was a big monkey. The shopkeeper said it had magic powers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany just slapped herself in the face, pretty sure that the mandrill's paw was worthless. \"Sorry, dear,\" she said. \"The loins sleep tonight.\" Ronan shrugged his shoulders and walked away as Tiffany took the paw into the next room to get a closer look at it. \"Master thief,\" she said with a scoff. \"If I didn't have such a bad heel, I'd accompany him and show him how it's done. Ouch!\" Tiffany dropped the paw because she could've sworn that one of the fingernails hurt her. \"He could've at least cut the nails before he handed it to me.\" She said. Oh, well. Better hit the sack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tiffany put down the paw and took off her clothes, she failed to see that her rear end was not only expanding but it was turning bright blue and pink as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Note: In case you're wondering, lwut, this is a mandrill <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://wierdnwildcreatures.wikia.com/wiki/Mandrill\" target=\"_blank\">http://wierdnwildcreatures.wikia.com/wik...</a>)</span></div></div>",

In Tiffany's dream, she imagined herself as a fat giantess climbing the Empire State building as planes shot at her. Tiffany shrieked in her nightmare as bullets pierced her skirt and made her bleed slightly. \"No!\" she yelled. \"No! Leave me alone! I can't die like this! No!\" As Tiffany was yelling, her screaming quickly turned into monkey-like shrieks. She was even forced to grab herself by the throat before she was shot in the foot and yelled right before she fell off the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next scene in the nightmare depicted Tiffany chained by her limbs as she tried to shake free. Then she saw several monkeys and apes the size of ants come and take a look at her and some even took photographs as she screamed. There was even one mandrill wearing a circus barker's outfit. \"Here she is,\" said the barker mandrill. \"The 8th Wonder of the world.\" Tiffany screamed and tried to shake free as monkeys took photographs of her and one orangutan even threw a banana peel at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that moment, Tiffany woke up panting and held her chest. She spotted the mandrill's paw that Ronan gave her to sell and grunted. She then took out a knife and used it to destroy the paw before throwing it in the trash. \"Ugly thing,\" she muttered. \"Ronan and his weird junk.\" Tiffany hadn't noticed it as she walked into the bathroom, but she had gotten much fatter and had to weigh at least 300lbs and her butt cheeks were glowing an even brighter shade of pink than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde fence took severals handfuls of water from the sink and splashed the water in her face. \"Damn Ronan,\" she said. \"I used to think he was a master thief but he keeps bringing back worthless junk. First he stole a ruby lightbulb and then he tried to steal an ammonite fossil and that so-called readymade work of art. It was a damned urinal with somebody's name written on it for crying out loud! It's been a downhill spiral ever since, but this is the straw that broke the camel's back. I'm really glad I got rid of that mandrill's paw. Who in their right mind would want to buy that? I couldn't even give that thing away at the auction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany then sighed and she then threw a couple of aspirins into her mouth before she drank a glass of water in order to swallow the aspirins more easily before she let out a gasp and then wiped her mouth. \"Look at me,\" she said. \"Here I am, selling stolen goods for a living. Being a fence in Boston only gets you so far. I wish I could be a real crime lord. Then everyone will give me the respect I deserve.\" Tiffany clenched her hand into a fist. \"But alas, here I am, relying on the so-called master thief. I'd give anything to...\" Suddenly Tiffany clutched her chest and yelled in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tiffany panted, she looked into the mirror to see that her teeth had turned into sharp fangs and then gasped because her nose tun turned bright red while the sides of her face turned bright blue. Her blonde hair grew longer as blondish brown fur started to grow all over her body. Tiffany turned around and then saw that her butt had grown to be 8-feet wide and was bright red. Tiffany shrieked in a surprising monkey tone and then she felt her feet twitching as they turned into a pair of hands. \"Oh my!\" yelled the blonde criminal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany shouted and then tried to run out of the bathroom, only for her butt to get stuck in the doorway. Tiffany grunted and then pushed her way out, tearing off the wall in the process. This was when Tiffany looked around and saw that she had transformed into a 18ft tall and very obese mandrill, a type of large West African Baboon. She had huge D-cup breasts, a 20ft wide booty, a 17ft wide belly and three chins. Tiffany felt around her body and was shocked at the animal she had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after she got over the initial shock of turning into a large baboon with a colorful butt, she gave a scowl and a very evil smile. \"This might not be so bad,\" she said. \"For some reason, I feel stronger. Guess that mandrill's paw wasn't so useless after all.\" Tiffany gave an evil laugh. \"Say, if I play my cards right, I could be the Queen Kong crime boss of Boston.\" Tiffany let out a laugh as she shook her booty and showed her sharp teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would appear that the criminal blonde has found the power to become a feared criminal mastermind. But should she let Ronan in on this? After all, he was the one who found the paw that mutated her.</span></div></div>",

She was pouring some kind of strange chemical into a syringe. \"Now,\" she said. \"If this succeeds, the navy will have the ultimate soldiers.

Without even thinking, Grace took out the syringe and put it in the fridge, failing to notice that it already injected her with everything inside of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace went to the window to see that her fianc\u00e9 Todd was waiting for her in his truck. \"Hey, beautiful, you off work yet?\" Grace just smiled. \"I'm just putting something away Todd.

But she couldn't even think about it at the time, because she and Todd had a date for the movie. Grace got into her fianc\u00e9's car as she then kissed Todd in the face before they were driving off to the matinee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how's the project coming along, Gracey?\" asked Todd. Grace then let out a sigh. \"I think perhaps maybe I've reached the surface.\" \"What is it you're working on?\" Grace then looked around to make sure that nobody was there to overhear before whispering into Todd's ear. \"What I'm trying to do,\" she said. \"Is to create a steroid that will bring life to the ultimate naval soldier. Soldiers that can swim through the water like they were designed that way by nature, soldiers with superhuman strength, soldiers that could survive the most bitter of cold. So I decided to use estrogen of the most powerful sea animal of them all. <i>Orcinus Orca</i>, the killer whale. I think I might've gotten the formula right this time.\" Todd then bit his lip. \"Have you found a test subject yet to make sure that your formula works?\" the young man asked his future wife. \"Not yet,\" said Grace. \"I haven't contacted the admiral yet. But I have a feeling I've gotten it right this time. So, what movie are we seeing.\" \"The poster is in the back, Grace.\" Said Todd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace reached into the back and saw that the movie poster appeared to depict dark red colored viperfish swimming in waters filled with blood. The bottom half of the viperfish monster resembled that of a lizard. \"Fishlizard 3D?\" asked Grace. \"A remake. Oh, Todd.\" \"Fishlizard is my favorite movie,\" said Todd. \"The giant fish mutant from the deep.\" \"I thought they killed him off.\" \"They did,\" said Todd. \"But this is a new Fishlizard. Come on. We can't be late for the movie.\" Grace let out a sigh before she followed her future husband into the cinema. However, she had some slight trouble getting out the door and then she saw that her stomach seemed to have gotten bigger. \"Geez,\" said the female scientist. \"I must've been eating like a whale lately. If I'm not careful someone might try to harpoon me.\" With that, Grace shrugged her shoulders and entered the cinema.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTodd was getting ready to buy the tickets. \"Two tickets for Fishlizard 3D.\" Todd paid for the tickets and the vendor gave him two tickets and two pairs of 3D glasses.\" After Todd and Grave put on their glasses, their next step was to get snacks. \"Two large Cokes.\" Said Todd. \"And two large popcorns.\" Todd looked at his girlfriend in surprise and soon they had entered the feature and Grace was carrying what looked like two large pails of popcorn. \"What were you thinking, Grace?\" asked Todd. \"Nobody could possibly eat one of those large popcorns, let alone eat two of them. Grace shrugged her shoulders. What Grace didn't notice (not that Todd seemed to notice either) was that Grace had gotten taller and fatter. She had to be 9-feet tall and weight 800lbs. In fact, when Grace and Todd took their seats in the theater, Grace took up three entire seats. Grace took in a handful of popcorn and then grunted because some jerk from behind her tossed a candy wrapper at her. \"Back of the row, Moby Dick!\" Grace let out a grunt and Todd turned to face the aggressor. \"What's the problem, jerk?\" \"Your big fat girlfriend is blocking the screen.\" Grace gave an angry grunt. \"I am NOT fat. I have the body of a ballerina.\" \"Yeah, Hyacinth the hippo!\" \"Ignore him, Gracey,\" said Todd. \"He isn't worth it. Now the movie's starting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace and Todd looked up at the screen and it showed what looked like a very large and very deep ocean and there appeared to be a decayed corpse of a monster that looked similar to the creature in the movie poacher. However, the heart appeared to still be in tact and it was throbbing as it begun to grow. The heart leaked some blood into the air and the blood soaked what looked like a roe of fish eggs. In the movie, the blood then caused the eggs to crack and throb. While most of the fish eggs decayed, the last one got bigger and bigger and hatched into Fishlizard who let out a loud roar and held out his claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Grace and Todd were watching the movie, Grace was getting bigger and bigger and fatter and her skin was turning pitch white with black highlights and then she sprouted a large black dorsal fin. She continued to shovel in popcorn as she was oblivious to the transformation and her teeth became sharp. She then sprouted a large finned tail as her pants were tearing apart from the butt crack. Behind her, several patrons gasped and moved back, except the jerk from before he pounded on her back. \"Hey you fat bitch! We're missing the good parts here.\" Todd heard the clamoring that Grace was ignoring and then turned and gasp. His fianc\u00e9e had transformed into a 30ft tall killer whale woman who had a 50ft wide belly and 45ft wide butt with H-Cup breasts and four chins. She took up the entire front half of the movie because the people in front had fled to avoid being buried by blubber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Grace herself had surprisingly not realized her transformation into a colossal obese cetacean and was continuing to eat popcorn and watch the movie.

We\u2019re obviously not welcome here.\u201d Grace stomped away and the usher looked up to see Todd stuck between his giant fianc\u00e9e\u2019s ass cheeks.

Do I look like a whale to you. Todd?\u201d Grace then felt a tingling in her rear and grunted because something was moving around in the back of her pants. She then reached into her panties and fished Todd out as Todd took a deep breath. \u201cTodd?\u201d asked Grace accusingly. \u201cWhat were you doing in my panties?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrace,\u201d said Todd. \u201cThere\u2019s something you should know.\u201d \u201cYou can tell it to me when we get into the...\u201d Before Grace could say another word, she heard a crunching sound.

Let\u2019s just say I was a fan of a certain TV show when I was a kid.\u201d Havoc was dumbfounded by that reveal. \u201cYou mean to tell me that you based our whole criminal organization off of a cartoon?\u201d \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a cartoon.\u201d Havoc let out a sigh. \u201cWhatever, the bombs will go off in exactly twenty-five minutes minus...\u201d Before Havoc could finish her sentence, there was stomping. \u201cWhat was that?! An earthquake?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was most definitely not an earthquake that was shaking up the entire area but it was Grace who was walking out on the beach towards the ocean. The other beachgoers all screamed and ran off as the whale giantess was stomping out into the water. The orca woman was now 50ft tall with a 70ft wide belly and 65ft wide butt and her flesh was jiggling as her clothes were completely ripped to shreds. Grace was slightly embarrassed as everyone was terrified of her. \u201cNo need to panic,\u201d said Grace. \u201cI\u2019m just here to enjoy the beach, just like the rest of you. I just happen to be bigger than all of you.\u201d One man actually dropped his popsicle as he stared at the ass of the giantess orca. \"Smooth,\" said Todd. \"Real smooth, honey. You know how to clear a beach but good.\" Grace gave an angry snort and blew air from her blowhole before she gave a grunt and held up her foot as she blew on her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again?\" asked Todd. \"Looks like you're not the most graceful of giant women.\" \"Bug...\" Suddenly, Grace looked down and saw something that really freaked her out. Namely it was those bomb buoys. \"What are so many buoys doing out here in one place?\" asked Todd. Grace just picked up the buoys one by one and observed them. \"I recognize these chemicals,\" said Grace. \"They're very flammable and extremely destructive.\" Todd gave a gasp and then Grace looked down to see the bombs counting down. \"Oh no!\" Grace gave a snort and hurled the bombs in her hands away before grabbing the rest of the bombs to toss them in the distance. She turned to everyone on the beach who was looking at her in pure fear and then let out a roar. \"Everyone! Get back!\" The people on the beach were frozen with fear but Grace roared at them again to force them to run and then shoved Todd down her cleavage as he grunted right before ducking in cover herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BOOM!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery last one of the explosives blew up at the same time, but because they were so far out into the ocean, that the only damage that could be done was several unusually large ways that hit the beach and splashed the whale titaness and her boyfriend. Todd nearly fell out of the sumo-sized giant's boobs before she poked him back in. \"Geez.\" He said. From Todd's position he could see everybody at the beach all staring at Grace in surprise. He was certain they were more terrified of her than ever now. However they all cheered and ran forward at her. \"The whale is a hero!\" \"She's not dangerous after all.\" Several children even started to climb Grace's thighs as she blushed and some surfers took selfies with the whale giantess. Todd gave a smile as he hugged one of Grace's chins. \"Looks like you don't have to worry about anyone seeing you as a giant monster, now.\" Grace gave a nervous laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearby, Commander Havoc could only look dumbfounded as the explosives had exploded harmlessly out into the water. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d asked Grand Maestro. \u201cDid the bomb go off, Commander Havoc?\u201d \u201cYes, Grand Maestro,\u201d said Havoc. \u201cBut I\u2019m afraid that it blew off out into the water.\u201d \u201cWhat?! How is that possible? Just one of those bombs is far too heavy to be moved by a normal person?\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said Havoc. \u201cJust see for yourself, Grand Maestro. It appears that Zapper has an enemy.\u201d Havoc took a photograph of Grace as the killer whale giantess was entering the water and sent the image to Grand Maestro. However, Grand Maestro seemed more curious and impressed than angry at such an unexpected development and rubbed his chin as he looked on at the giantess whale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that\u2019s the navy\u2019s newest super soldier formula at work?\u201d asked Grand Maestro as he observed Grace on the communications link. \u201cCommander Havoc, return to the base. I\u2019ve decided that we\u2019re going to fight fire with fire.\u201d Commander Havoc didn\u2019t fully understand what her boss meant but she nodded her head. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that I don\u2019t follow, Sir.\u201d Grand Maestro at the base, opened up a case containing a syringe. \u201cSo sorry that our head scientist was caught and executed by the police last week. But by combining what we know about the enemy with what the bad doctor left behind, we should be able to create a creature what could face a killer whale of such an immense magnitude. Grand Maestro laughed to himself. However, Havoc didn\u2019t seem too trusting of her boss. \u201cOne of these days,\u201d she thought to herself. \u201cWe won\u2019t have to worry about an idiot being in charge of our organization. One of these days, they\u2019ll be calling me the Grand Maestro.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, both Todd and Grace were blissfully unaware of the intentions of Zapper or even the existence of such an evil organization. Todd was laying in his whale fianc\u00e9e\u2019s enormous belly button as the cetacean blob was floating out in the water. \u201cOh yes,\u201d said Todd. \u201cI could get used to this. Just think. It won\u2019t be long until I\u2019m the only groom known to a killer whale.\u201d Todd laughed to himself but Grace wasn\u2019t laughing at all. Todd gave a smirk and then rubbed all around Grace\u2019s large navel. \u201cGrace, honey,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat are you worried about. Okay, so those bombs were a big surprise and caught us off guard but it\u2019s all cool. You threw those explosives far away and nobody got hurt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Grace just blew water out of her blowhole as the whale woman scratched her belly and Todd had to duck to avoid her pudgy fingers. \u201cYes, Todd,\u201d she said. \u201cBut somebody had to have set those explosives. They don't just come out of thin air. I think that Admiral Sturgeon ought to hear about what happened. Bombs are nothing to sneeze at.\" Todd let out a sigh and was walking on his whale fianc\u00e9e's belly that could now be easily mistaken for an island. Then he saw a fog up ahead. \"Gee,\" he said. \"It sure got foggy all of a sudden.\" Grace let out a sigh and blew water out of her blowhole to clear the fog.\" \"Baby,\" said Todd. \"For the rest of my life, I want to take my showers in your head.\" Grace let out a high squeaky laugh like that of a dolphin (because a killer whale is actually a type of dolphin and then she rubbed her stomach around in order to shake up the ground and make Todd laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that's when Todd noticed something coming. \"Grace?\" he asked. \"What exactly is that?\" Grace adjusted her glasses but even then, there was a fog that was obscuring the object coming forward. But what she did see was that the approaching object was somewhat very large and was heading right towards her. Sure enough the object that was coming revealed itself to be....</span></div></div>",

She was covered in grey scales, had no hair, and her eyes were solid grey. She had a giant grey tail, a blowhole on top of her head, and sharp teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, who are you?\" Grace asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Havoc. And I'm here to get rid of you.\" The giant woman said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, what?\" Grace said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHavoc didn't say anything and just tackled Grace, sending Todd flying into the water. Grace got back up, now angry, and grabbed Havoc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two struggled, Todd swam back to the surface. \"Geez, what was that?\" He asked. Before he could realize it, a boat came up behind him and suddenly a net flew over him. He felt the net being lifted up to the boat. When it got onto the deck, he saw a man in a purple ghost costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Todd asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am the Grand Maestro. And you are my prisoner.\" The Grand Maestro answered. Then he laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Grace and Havoc were still grappling with each other in a style similar to sumo wrestling.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Day 21, the search for Owlman, the legendary cryptid has gotten more headway as we take you to Mawnan, in the English county of Cornwall. This creature first seen in 1976, during the same time as Morgawr, the sea serpent is believed to be a large eagle owl that escaped from the zoo. But we all know there is more to it than that. This creature while intimidating, has yet to actually attack anyone. It's time people knew the truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's what Harriet Rowling said in her video blog right before turning her head to her husband, Devon. \"I'm not sure why we're doing this, Harriet,\" said Devon. \"This sounds like we're going on a wild goose chase, or more accurately, a wild owl chase.\" \"Devon,\" said Harriet. \"Nobody knows just how long Owlman has really been around or whether or not he is or isn't a malicious being. I intend to find the truth.\" Devon held his wife in an embrace and lifted her into the air. \"Why chase after an Owlman when there's a real man in the RV with you.\" Harriet let out a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you,\" she said. \"But think about it. This is one of the mysteries that has eluded man for a long time. I'm pretty sure that owl man is watching us as we speak.\" Devon let out a laugh at that fact, but he wouldn't be laughing long. His wife was right, the terrifying cryptid, Owlman in truth had been watching them. Specifically, the tan skinned British girl with brown-reddish hair and sexy glasses. The owl monster used his fingers to frame Harriet's face before he let out a hoot. Just as Harriet was looking for Owlman, she was the one the owl was looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were just too problems. She was too small. The monster would've liked his potential mate to dwarf him. The other problem, she wasn't an owl. But Owlman knew a way to solve both problems. He rubbed his hands and squawked and then he flew off to his lair where he begun to concoct a strange potion out of herbs and magic spices and even some of his own feathers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the concoction was ready, the bird creature let out a hooting laugh as he rubbed his taloned and winged hands.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Harriet was speaking into her microphone as Devon continued to drive the RV to go after Owlman. \"The sun is setting and like any owl, Owlman will be up any minute and with any luck, we will find the creature and determine what kind of being the Owlman is. Is he truly a man-sized owl? Is he Jack the Ripper come back with a new motif? Is he an escaped lab animal or is he a demon or some sort? Is Owlman really supernatural. Hopefully, after 21 days, we will be able to put this mystery to bed once and for all.\" Devon rolled his eyes at his wife's words. He knew that marrying a cryptozoologist would come with many new and very weird experiences, but this one was a new one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The reason we bring cameras with us,\" said Harriet. \"Is because it is said that although Owlman doesn't appear to be malicious, it's a known fact that encounters with this beast leave the victims unable to speak for days out of pure fear. Of course, I am not afraid of Owlman. Though, a cryptozoologist never takes any chances.\" Harriet then saw something flying through the air that looked like it could've been Owlman and let out a gasp. \"There he is! Devon! Stop the car!\" Devon stopped the car near a woodland area and the two of them went out to find Owlman. Devon held up a large camera that had a flashlight attached to it to scan for Owlman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is said that Owlman is named after a villain who appeared in DC comics only a little more than a decade before this creature was discovered. While the Owlman in DC comics was a ruthless villain from another world, we do not yet know whether or not this Owlman is malicious as well. Since nobody has ever reported a homicide committed by this very being, it's entirely possible that Owlman is a frightening but misunderstood creature, not unlike the gentle Nessie.\" Of course, Harriet was soon about to see exactly what dark intentions Owlman had in store for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove, Owlman was looking down and drooled lecherously at Harriet from above. He then held up something strange in his talons and gave a sinister laugh as he held it up. It appeared to be a bright blue orb with a strange liquid mixing around inside of it. It was a magic potion of some kind and Owlman was getting ready to release it, just as Harriet was walking around looking for any sign of the flying cryptid. Devon heard Owlman\u2019s hooting and looked up, but Owlman flew away before Devon could even see him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevon then shook his head, assuming that he saw absolutely nothing. \"I don't like the look of these woods, Harriet. Maybe we should turn back.\" \"Turn back?\" asked Harriet. \"Perish the thought, Devon Honey, we are on the breakthrough of the century. After tonight, we'll finally know whether or not Owlman exists.\" \"This also brings up the Owl and the Pussycat,\" said Devon. \"Speaking of which, we know who curiosity killed.\" \"That's not the Owl and the Pussycat goes, Pussycat. Didn't you hear that curiosity is a sign of intelligence.\" Devon grunted. \"Whoever said that is probably dead by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when the Rowlings both heard a loud flapping noise and looked up to see feathers coming down. Harriet gasped. \"He's here! We're actually going to see him. Owlman is real!\" Devon shook as he heard deep hooting. \"Now, now, Harriet. It can't be. The largest owl in the world is the great gray owl and even then, its length's maximum isn't even three feet large.\" There was another loud hoot and Harriet gave a smile. \"Quick, the camera!\" Devon held up the camera and screamed because all he saw was a pair of talons coming down to assault him. \"Devon!\" yelled Harriet to her husband. \"What's happening?!\" Then Owlman appeared in front of Harriet and hooted loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Harriet could even scream, Owlman tossed his orb filled with magic potion and it struck Harriet as it exploded and filled her body with magic dust. Harriet coughed a few times and then spotted Owlman. \"There he is,\" said Harriet in excitement. \"Owlman is real! This I...\" Harriet reached out for her cellphone to take a photograph of Owlman but then begun to cough loudly and even felt her eyes turning bright gold in color as her tan skin turned gray. Devon got up and saw his wife and was horrified as Owlman flew away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet continued to cough as she started to grow taller and her stomach begun to expand along with her breasts that made her jacket explode and come undo. Then she felt her face being flattened as her mouth stretched out into a large and sharp beak. Harriet's head then spun all around her body as gray feathers grew all over her body and she even felt her face turning white with brown highlights around her eyes as her hips got bigger. Harriet held out her arms and screamed as long feathers grew on the sides of her head in the shape of horns. Harriet held out her arms which stretched into long white, black and gray feathered wings as she managed to get off of the air. She then sprouted a long feathered tail between her now-enormous butt cheeks and then her feet turned into talons that tore through her sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the transformation was over, Harriet was a 45ft great-horned owl with a 45ft wide butt, huge hips, a 55ft wide stomach, C-Cup breasts and three chins as she hooted loudly. Even Owlman was surprised and from his hooting, he didn't expect Harriet to get <b>that</b> big. Harriet was in distress and hooted loudly at the bird giantess she had become and Devon was speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

As she did this, the bun in her hair undid itself and her glasses fell to the ground and shattered. \u201cHarriet?\u201d asked Devon. Harriet let out another scream that devolved into a hoot right before the owl woman started to cough a few times. She then held onto her ears as she heard hooting, shrieking and other various animal noises in the night. Since she now how the auditory system of an owl, there was so much more that she could hear and it was terrifying her. \u201cNo,\u201d yelled Harriet. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t supposed to happen! The search for Owlman has gone horribly, horribly...\u201d Harriet then gagged and held her throat. \u201cHarriet?\u201d asked Devon to his giant owl wife. \u201cHarriet, are you alright honey?\u201d Harriet tried to answer her husband but all that came out of her mouth was a rather loud hoot. Harriet grabbed her head in pure surprise. \u201c<span class=\"clgrey\">No</span>!\u201d she thought to herself. \u201c<span class=\"clgrey\">I\u2019ve... I\u2019ve lost my voice! I've lost my voice! This is a nightmare</span>!\u201d That was the last straw for Harriet and the big enormously obese owl woman swung her hips and belly, finally destroying what was left of her shirt, scarf and skirt as she spread her wings and flew up into the sky with a loud shriek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevon looked in surprise as Harriet flew further and further up into the air and continued to hoot. Had Harriet been a normal-sized human, based on her appearance right now, she would no doubt weigh as much as an adult bull elephant.There should not have been any logical way for something so monstrously big and bulky to be able to reach the air. And yet, Harriet flew into the sky with seemingly no effort. \u201cAmazing.\u201d Said Devon in shock. But then Devon gasped as Harriet opened her wings further and was starting to fly further and further away from the forest and screamed in absolute distress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harriet!\" yelled Devon as his wife was flying away. \"Harriet!\" Devon saw Harriet flying away as she hissed loudly and gave a resonating hoot. \"Don't worry, Harriet! Devon's coming!\" Devon immediately ran to his RV in order to better follow after his ginormous mutated wife. \"I can't believe it,\" said Devon. \"Looks as though Harriet wasn't completely out of her mind about the existence of Owlman after all. Who would've thought that a half human and half bird cryptid actually existed? But now he's turned my wife into a giant version of himself that looks like she ought to be wrestling in an arena in Tokyo Japan. This could end in disaster. What if somebody sees her in this state. Oh bloody...\" Before Devon could finish his sentence, suddenly the glass broke on his RV because the Owlman from earlier had let out a loud hoot and shattered the window with his talons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevon screamed as the owl monster stared at him and made his eyes glow bright yellow. The owl tried to reach for Devon's neck with his long claws and forced Devon to drive in a zigzag pattern as he moved his hands that were still on the wheel in order to protect himself from the cryptid that meant him harm. \"Get your claws off me you deranged and perverted bird!\" Owlman kept trying to dig into Devon with his claws but Devon held up his foot to block. Unfortunately, this also meant that Devon had absolutely no way of knowing or seeing exactly where he was going, at one point, blindly running over a large tree stump. This dislodged the wheels in his car and caused the vehicle to drive rather clumsily until it crashed into a tree and Devon was tossed out screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Devon was on the ground, Owlman swooped down and shrieked again as he attempted to assault the British man with his claws. Devon crawled across the ground right before Owlman stomped on him and made him yell. Owlman would've dug his claws right into Devon but while Devon was on the ground, he spotted a flashlight that got tossed out of the car when it crashed and had an idea. Devon picked up the flashlight, pointed it right into Owlman's face and then turned the light on. As the light shined in Owlman's eyes, the nocturnal bird monster shrieked and held out his wings in an attempt to protect his eyes that were extremely sensitive to the bright light. This gave Devon the chance to tackle Owlman into a tree and wound him. Owlman grunted and Devon shined the light on him again. \"You don't like it when you're on the losing side do you, you bloody apparition?\" asked Devon mockingly. \"Now get lost and stay away from my wife before I decide to get <i>really</i> nasty. Owlman held himself in pain and then gave a hiss before weakly flapping his wings and flying further and further up into the air, albeit weakly due to his wings being damaged in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Devon was walking away, he could've sworn that he heard Owlman cursing him as he was flapping away and growling underneath his bread. \"She will be mine. My spell may have erred, but the transformation is complete. I'm the one who will have her in the end.\" A chill ran down Devon's spine and he was in pure horror. \"Okay,\" he said. \"That is hands down, a dozen kinds of creepy. I have seriously got to find my wife. Harriet, where are you.\u201d Devon was about to run back to the RV in order to continue his search for his giant owl wife but then he saw the completely damaged car up ahead and realized that he seriously needed to rethink his options. \u201cBlast. Looks like I\u2019m going on foot. I just hope my wife is alright.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet at this point was flying over the countryside of Cornwall and was flapping her wings so heavily that the foliage was blown off of several trees. She was panting as well from flapping too hard and panicking. \"<span class=\"clgrey\">I need to rest,</span>\" thought Harriet to herself, having lost her ability to speak. \"<span class=\"clgrey\">I have to find a place to roost</span>.\" The owl woman hooted again and then looked to see that down on the ground, there was a rather large castle left over from the ancient days, completely abandoned. \"<span class=\"clgrey\">Perfect</span>.\" That's what the titanic bird thought, but the moment she flew down to perch on the building, she discovered it was too small to hold her big ass and it easily collapsed from her weight as she sat right down. The owl woman gasped as she collapsed, her big ass hitting the ground and creating a large shockwave that created fissures that reached the nearby forest and even caused pieces of the cliff that she was sitting on to fall out into the ocean. The owl woman blushed and even begun to cry as she held her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\">I should never have tried to probe the secrets of the Owlman or gone to find that bloody avian terror. Now I've been turned into an owl woman big enough to be used as a jumbo-sized jumbo jet and fat enough that it makes the people on the other side of the ocean look like a country of anorexics. And what's worse is that my speech has been severely limited to the language of birds. Oh what am I to do. What is Devon going to... oh good grief, Devon! How thoughtless of me back there! I left Devon alone to deal with that Owlman monster</span>.\" Harriet flew up into the sky again, causing the rest of the cliff to collapse from the rapid movements of such an immensely heavy and obese creature. \"<span class=\"clgrey\">I'm going to go back and look for Devon</span>,\" thought the owl giantess. \"<span class=\"clgrey\">It's too dangerous to walk around the forest at night. There are adders and wolves and other unpleasant animals out...</span>\" But before the owl woman could further worry about her missing husband, she heard a loud and very violent rumbling noise. \"<span class=\"clgrey\">What was that? An earthquake?! Can't be. I'm too high up in the air to feel any kind of earthquake. Unless...</span>\" Harriet felt the rumbling again and looked down at her big bulging gut that at this point was obscuring her thunderous thighs that in turn made her feet look unearthly small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\">So that's it. I'm starving. I need something in my tummy. Come to think about it, I haven't had anything to devour since breakfast. I definitely need to find something to eat. Thank goodness owls aren't that picky about what they eat. Oh, my stomach feels like it\u2019s on fire. I need a meal</span>.\" The owl woman hooted again and then zoomed away, hoping to find something she could use to satisfy her monstrous hunger. As she was flying away, she shed feathers that were as big as canoes and these feathers dropped down into the ocean as she flew over the seaside. However, food wasn\u2019t the only thing that was on Harriet\u2019s mind at that moment. She grunted because there was a ringing in her ears, something that was very painful for a creature with sensitive hearing like that of an owl. \u201cYou will be mine. You will be mine. There is no fighting it. I knew it from the moment I saw you. It is destiny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe owl titaness could not take this any longer and then shook her head as she shrieked. \"<span class=\"clgrey\">Harriet</span>,\" thought the giant woman to herself. \"<span class=\"clgrey\">Don't you dare think about that. You just need to get something to eat, find your husband and get out of the woods before something worse happens</span>.\" Speaking of Devon, Harriet's husband at the time was looking around for his ginormous mutated wife. \"Harriet!\" he yelled. \"Harriet! Where are you!?\" Devon held his flashlight into the air and he saw nothing. He let out a moan because he was becoming very worried. \"Exactly how does an owl as big as a jumbo jet just disappear?

Something that belongs in a museum.\" It was always like this. Elisabeth's husband worked at the museum of natural history and was always looking for something that could fit in with the rest of the museum. He was the type of person who would see giants when there were only windmills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElisabeth was used to this by now and took it with a grain of salt but she could tell from Puck's excitement that he had found something that was simply amazing. Puck led his wife deep into the forest to what looked like a cave. Puck could run in easily but his seven-foot tall wife let out a grunt because she had to get on all fours to come in. \"This is why my parents warned me against marrying somebody less than half my height.\" Once both husband and wife were in the cave, Puck led Elisabeth to something that made her eyes pop out of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt appeared to be a graveyard of bones of elephants from the shapes of the tusk. But some bones looked strange. There was one elephant skull with buck teeth, a long snout and barely a trunk at all, while another had tusks on the chin rather than in the mouth and another skull still had four tusks. \"What is this place?\" asked Elisabeth as she stood up. \"Isn't it obvious?\" asked Puck with a laugh. The fair skinned dwarf even walked up towards a skeleton that was perfectly in tact. \"It's an elephant graveyard. There's nothing else that it could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's impossible,\" said Elisabeth as she picked up one of the bones. \"Elephants aren't even indigenous to America.\" \"But their ancestors are,\" said Puck. \"This is the find of the century. Maybe prehistoric pachyderms went to die in cemeteries just like modern elephants do.\" Elisabeth picked up her husband and then shook her head. \"You're getting in over your head again, Puck,\" she said. \"I don't think disturbing an elephant graveyard is such a good idea. What if there's a curse.\" Puck rolled his eyes. \"There you go again, Elisabeth,\" he said. \"Why must you always look at the dark side. There's no such thing as curses.\" \"Even still,\" said Elisabeth. \"We probably shouldn't be here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Puck and Elisabeth were leaving the cave, Elisabeth suddenly twitched. She didn't see it but there was supernatural energy coming out of the elephant bones. \"Something wrong honey?\" asked Puck. \"Uh,\" said Elisabeth. \"No, I'm perfectly fine.\" That's what she thought, but what Elisabeth didn't see was the spectral energy from the bones was entering her body.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All those bones.\" \"You can't put a graveyard in the museum, Love,\" said Elisabeth. \"It just sounds disrespectful to me. My ancestors believed that it was bad luck to desecrate an elephant graveyard. Oh, my stomach hurts. I'm gonna go get some water for the tea kettle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElisabeth went out to the lake as she held up the tea kettle. As she walked away, Puck could only stare at her. Puck knew that his wife had always towered over him what with her having gigantism and him being a dwarf but for some reason, Elisabeth seemed bigger than usual as she was as tall as a tree that she passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Elisabeth reached the lake, she looked into the water and felt her face. \"Oh my gosh,\" she said. \"Is my nose getting bigger?\" Elisabeth started to refuel the tea kettle but then she started to directly drink the water as if she was some kind of animal. Puck walked behind and noticed that Elisabeth's pants looked tight on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elisabeth?\" asked Puck. \"Are you putting on weight?\" \"What was that?\" asked Elisabeth. Elisabeth looked back and heard a ripping noise and as she got up, her pants were ripping clean off and exposing her panties. She felt her rear to learn it had expanded to seven feet wide and was still growing to saw nothing of her hips and her belly. Elisabeth then felt her face and it wasn't long until she felt her ears getting wider and wider. She even felt what looked like tusks forming at the sides of her mouth. \"Oh no!\" she yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElisabeth was not only getting fatter, but bigger. As she was transforming, she had passed the 25 foot margin and looked down at Puck as her nose started to turn into a trunk. \"Puck,\" she said. \"I really think we should've left that elephant graveyard alone.\" Puck could only watch as his wife turned into a 40-foot tall....</span></div></div>",

She let out a trumpet as her feet became flat pachyderm-style feet. It was there, Elisabeth had fully transformed into a 40-foot tall, anthropomorphic elephant, an African elephant to be precise because she had a pair of really long tusks. Once the transformation was complete, Elisabeth was left in her underwear and a tattered shirt that was acting as an improvised bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck looked up at his giant elephant wife and gasped. \"Elisabeth?\" he asked. Elisabeth gave a trumpet as she walked around, each of her steps creating a slight earthquake. She was as big as the trees and she looked back to see how large her ass had swelled up to. \"Oh my.\" She said. \"Elisabeth!?\" yelled Puck. \"Elisabeth!\" \"You don't have to shout!\" yelled Elisabeth at her husband. \"Elephant ears, remember?\" Elisabeth lowered her head and used her trunk to lift her dwarf husband up into the air. \"Elisabeth,\" said Puck as he was placed next to his giant wife's ear. \"I am so sorry. I was the one who found that elephant graveyard. It must've been cursed! I'm such an idiot! Boy, is your dad going to skin me alive. He hates me enough as it is.\" \"Puck,\" says Elisabeth. \"This isn't your fault. Who on Earth could've predicted something like this happening?\" Elisabeth then accidentally bumped a tree with her rear and knocked it down before blushing in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Although,\" said the giant pachyderm woman. \"I really don't like this predicament. You were already less than a third of my height before. Now look at me. I could handle being an elephant, but why am I...\" Suddenly, Elisabeth realized that she was slightly taller than the trees. \"What?\" she asked. \"I thought I was only 40-feet high. Don't tell me I grew again?\" Puck then gasped. \"There must've been ghosts of elephants past in that graveyard and they all entered your body and mutated you.\" \"Holy Joseph Merrick,\" said Elisabeth. \"How the hell big am I going to get.\" \"I don't know, but we'll get through this baby,\" said Puck as he stroked one of his wife's tusks. \"I promise you. Worse comes to worse, we'll find jobs in the circus. Don't worry your pachydermic head over this.\" Elisabeth just let out a trumpet and a sigh as she sat down and flattened a few trees in the process. \"My mother told me there would be days like this.\" \"She did?\" \"Well, not <i>exactly</i> like this, Puck. That would be ridiculous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there was a rumbling sound and Puck had to return into his wife's ear, stepping in some wax in the process as he grunted. \"What the heck was that?\" asked Puck.

Elisabeth was moving through the forest, being extra careful not to step on anyone or anything and being extra careful in case there are other campers in the area. They might not be so understanding about seeing a 70ft high and still growing, massively obese pachyderm lady. The elephant woman spotted a lake nearby and then removed what was left of her clothes as the naked pachyderm entered the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElisabeth was up to her knees in the water before she lowered her trunk into the water. Puck at that moment had managed to crawl out of her ear as Elisabeth inhaled water into her trunk and then lifted it up to spray water into her mouth. Puck gagged and looked in disgust at how his wife was drinking out of her nose. \"Elisabeth,\" he groaned. \"Have some class.\" The elephant giantess then stuck her nose into her mouth and was sucking the rest of the water out before she let out a cough. \"What's wrong?\" asked Puck. Elisabeth just coughed again. \"I think I just swallowed a fish.\" Puck shivered. \"I hope it was a fish and not a swimmer.\" Elisabeth just kept on drinking more and more of the water. \"Hey, Honey,\" said Puck. \"Save some of the river for the rest of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElisabeth then saw Puck covered in elephant earwax and raised her trunk to spray him clean. Puck coughed as he was drenched and Elisabeth let out a laugh. \"Real funny, Elisabeth,\" said Puck rather sarcastically. \"Real mature.\" Then Puck felt an inhaling sound and before he knew it, Elisabeth used her trunk to vacuum off his clothes until her was in his skivvies and then sprayed water up into the air to give herself and her husband a shower. Elisabeth let out a laugh and Puck let out a sigh and a smile before Elisabeth grabbed him with her trunk and made him grunt as she submerged into the water and used her husband to scrub her breasts right down to the nipples.\" Puck just laughed in sensual bliss before Elisabeth moved on to other sensitive areas and let out a moan. After that was over, she swam completely under the water with Puck on top of the tip of her trunk that was above the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" said Puck. \"At least she's making the most out of her transformation.\" Elisabeth surfaced out of the water and shook herself off before laughed and shifting her ear and hairs.

That's impossible. We were the only ones who found that elephant graveyard and even if that was so, there couldn't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Puck was about to be proven wrong.

Puck held on tight and sat down in his wife's earring as Elisabeth trumpeted her trunk in caution.

She was 40ft tall with a 60ft wide stomach and 80ft wide ass that was eating her jeans alive as bluish black fur, the same color as Elisabeth\u2019s hair had grown all over the young woman\u2019s body. Her nose had stretched out into a 50ft long and 10ft wide trunk and she grew two large and curved tusks. The mammoth woman let out a trumpet as she looked at her new body. Puck looked up at his mutated and ginormous wife in absolute surprise and horror. \u201cWhat have we done?! Wait! How could this have happened?!\u201d Elisabeth let out a trumpet that blew Puck right off of his feet. \u201cThis is exactly why we should\u2019ve left that elephant graveyard alone! My ancestors were right about the desecration being bad luck.\u201d \u201cWhat desecration, Elisabeth!?\u201d yelled Puck. \u201cAll we did was walk inside and... what am I saying. This is not good. Elisabeth, I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s any way to get you back to normal.\u201d Elisabeth trumpeted angrily and then uprooted a tree with her trunk as Puck looked up in fear and screamed. \u201cNow take it, easy, Elisabeth! I may have hurt you, but that was an accident! I\u2019m your husband for crying out....\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Puck could finish his sentence, Elisabeth stuffed the tree into her big mouth in order to chew off the leaves before she let out a sigh. \u201cI know this isn\u2019t your fault, Puck. But for some reason the graveyard chose to transmogrify me and me alone. If we just stay calm then...\u201d Suddenly, Elisabeth\u2019s stomach begun to rumble again and she started to devour a few more trees. Puck let out a sigh. \u201cAs if you didn\u2019t tower over me already.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t flatter yourself, Puck,\u201d said Elisabeth. \u201cI still can\u2019t believe this is happening. Ugh. And I\u2019m so hungry that it\u2019s making me sick.\u201d Puck could only watch as his wife stripped tree after tree of its foliage. However, some of the foliage wound up getting stuck in the mammoth giantess\u2019s nose and then she sniffled and grunted. Puck looked up in horror because he knew that his giantess wife was about to sneeze. \u201cOh no! Oh no! Oh no! Elisabeth! Don\u2019t even think about it! Whatever you do, don\u2019t blow your....!\u201d But it was too late because Elisabeth let out a mighty sneeze that blew Puck across the forest screaming. \u201cOh no!\u201d yelled Elisabeth. \u201cPuck!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Puck landed softly in an oak tree on the other side of the forest. The dwarf let out a sigh. \u201cThat is one deadly nose that Elisabeth has on her.\u201d Puck then struggled because he was trying in vain to untangle himself from the tree. \u201cWell, this is just great.\u201d As Puck was trying to get free, a young forest ranger walked underneath the tree and noticed him. \u201cUh,\u201d said Puck. \u201cHello.\u201d The forest ranger looked in surprise but then climbed up and freed Puck from the vines. \u201cThanks,\u201d said the dwarf reading the ranger\u2019s uniform. \u201cUh, Ronald.\u201d \u201cNot a problem. But one question though; What on Earth were you doing up there so late at night?\u201d asked the ranger. Puck didn\u2019t really know how to explain what happened. \u201cWell, my wife sneezed me up here.\u201d \u201cYour wife?\u201d asked Ronald. \u201cShe must have serious allergies.\u201d Puck then looked around and saw that he was on the other side of the forest. \u201cUh-oh,\u201d he said. \u201cUh, you wouldn\u2019t have happened to see my wife, have you?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Ronald. \u201cWhat does your wife look like?\u201d Puck bit his lip. \u201cA woolly mammoth.\u201d He said under his lip. Ronald raised an eyebrow. \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cMy wife is a woolly mammoth,\u201d said Puck. \u201cWe found an ancient mammoth graveyard in a cave and it cursed her into a giant mammoth with a big appetite.\u201d \u201cI see,\u201d said the forest ranger twirling his finger at the side of his head. \u201cYou\u2019ve obviously been in that tree longer than I thought. I better take you back to the station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the other side of the forest, animals were moving out of the way as the ground was violently shaking with every step that Elisabeth took. She sniffed the air with her long trunk and trumpeted. From the looks of it, Elisabeth was twice as big as she was before and had gotten just as fat as well to the point that her jacket had torn off, leaving her wearing a tank top that only covered the tops of her breasts and her jeans had split in the back, revealing her bright red panties. But Elisabeth didn\u2019t seem to notice how much bigger she had become because she had to find her husband. \u201cOkay, Elisabeth,\u201d the woolly mammoth giantess thought to herself. \u201cYou sneezed Puck out around here. He should be up ahead. I sure hope he didn\u2019t run into a bear or a wolf first though. Elisabeth continued to walk down the forest, accidentally knocking down a few trees with her enormous booty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Elisabeth had other problems to deal with because back at the campsite where she and Puck were relaxing, there was a man who was wearing a scarf, top hat and a pair of steampunk goggles as well as a trench coat. The strange man was polishing what looked like a rifle as he looked at the tracks left by Elisabeth. \"These are clearly elephant footprints,\" said the hunter. \"I was not aware pachyderms were indigenous to this area.\" The man then looked down to see that a piece of Elisabeth's fur had gotten stuck to a log. \"Fur?\" asked the hunter. \"Elephants don't have fur. But it can't be. Woolly mammoths have been extinct since the Ice Age. Hmm. This will be an interesting target. I wonder how much they'll pay for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the ranger station, Ronald had brought Puck to his superior. \"For the last time,\" said the head ranger. \"Tell me this again, straight. You're telling me that your wife is a woolly mammoth as big as a house?\" \"Yeah,\" said Puck getting annoyed. \"That\u2019s exactly what I said.\u201d The head ranger pounded his fist on the table. \u201cAre you some kind of nut? You\u2019re telling me that your wife somehow got mutated into a giant prehistoric elephant. I think all that hot air on the ground is effecting your brain.\u201d Puck suddenly got defensive. \u201cAre you discriminating against the vertically impaired?\u201d Ronald let out a sigh. \u201cMr. Barker, take it easy on him. I think he stayed up in that tree longer than he should\u2019ve.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m telling you the truth!\u201d yelled Puck. \u201cWhat\u2019s it going to take for you to believe me!\u201d Mr. Barker just looked down at Puck, intimidating him in the process. \u201cListen here, freak. We have bigger problems to deal with than a delusional dwarf! We just got word that Tin Punk is in the area.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuck just raised an eyebrow. \u201cTin Punk?\u201d he asked. Puck then turned his head and gasped in fear because he saw a wanted poster that depicted the face of the man in the steampunk goggles and hat. \u201cThat\u2019s one mean looking customer.\u201d Said Puck. \u201cYou don\u2019t know the half of it,\u201d said Ronald. \u201cHe\u2019s wanted for poaching rare animals. A lot of which he sells on the black market.\u201d It didn\u2019t take Puck too much thought to realize that Elisabeth could be in danger if that hunter managed to find her. \"Oh no! Oh no! Oh no!\" Puck immediately ran out of the ranger station as Ronald looked at him in surprise. \"Wait! It's dangerous to go alone at...\" \"Leave him be,\" said Mr. Barker. \"We have enough cretins to worry about as it is.\" That was when the telephone rang at the station and Ronald grabbed the phone. What the man on the phone said made the young forest ranger very surprised. \"What is it?\" asked Mr. barker. Ronald turned his head and looked in disbelief. \"A camper claims to have spotted a large elephant roaming through the forest.\" \"But that doesn't mean that it's that idiot's alleged mammoth wife. It's probably an escaped zoo animal.\" Ronald shook his head. \"I don't think so. The zoo in this area doesn't have an elephant exhibit. And from the sounds of it, this \"elephant\" is bigger than it should be. Perhaps that kook wasn't as crazy as we thought. I'm going after him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Elisabeth was by a nearby lake sucking up the water with her long trunk before spraying it into her mouth and then sniffed the air again. \"The ranger station is up ahead. Looks like Puck's safe for now.\" Elisabeth was about to step forward but then realized something. \"Wait a minute,\" said the mammoth giantess. \"Exactly what am I doing? What are those rangers going to think if they see an enormous woolly mammoth with boobs. If I was transformed into a modern elephant, I'd be easier to hide, but no, I had to be turned into a creature that's been extinct for thousands of years.\" Elisabeth then begun to pant and sweat. \"Geez,\" she said. \"How did it get so hot all of a sudden. Ugh. All this fur is definitely going to take some getting used to.\" Elisabeth then started to suck up water with her trunk again and then spray it up into the air in an attempt to cool her obese and very furry body down. In the process, she stripped her jeans right off in order to beat the heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad is not going to be happy when he hears about this. He'll probably use it as another excuse to pick on Puck. Speaking of which, this will take some getting used to. Well, I could always try to find work in a circus. It's not like I can keep my job at the bank in this condition.\" As Elisabeth was laughing to herself and trying to get a clear idea of the situation, her elephantine ears twitched and she let out a trumpet. \"What was that.\" Elisabeth turned her head a few times because she was certain that she heard something. The mammoth giant stood up and looked around the forest but she was so large that the trees were obscuring her view of the area. Elisabeth moved slowly, being absolutely careful not to further damage the forest with her large body and that's when she heard something distressing and turned her head to see...</span></div></div>",

Unless...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hunter then took out a syringe of some kind and jabbed it into Elisabeth\u2019s foot, causing the mammoth woman to trumpet in pain. What Tin Punk had done was suck a little bit of blood out of Elisabeth\u2019s enormous body and then placed it into a scanner of some sort and realized exactly what he was doing. \u201cOh my. Mammuthus Primigenius. The woolly mammoth. I\u2019ll bet your fur should be worth a pretty penny.\u201d Elisabeth rubbed her leg in pain from the wound but then her eyes popped because the hunter had pointed a high-tech looking elephant gun towards her head. Elisabeth gasped and stepped back, pushing down several trees with her large rear in the process. \u201cThen again,\u201d said Tin Punk. \u201cMaybe I could sell you to a collector or a zoo or somewhere. I\u2019ll bet that there are several uses for a mammoth.\u201d Tin Punk laughed evilly and pulled the trigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, despite Elisabeth\u2019s massive size, she managed to dodge the shot and then trumpeted out loud. The hunter shot a large net and managed to tangle both of the mammoth giantess\u2019s legs and make her land on the ground with a crash as she yelled. The loud crash from Elisabeth\u2019s landing caused the entire forest to shake and deers, rabbits, squirrels and all other forms of woodland creatures were scurrying away. Nearby, the resulting earthquake had shaken up the campgrounds and the ranger station was starting to cave in. Ronald let out a scream as a bit of the ceiling came down. \u201cWhat was that?! An earthquake.\u201d \u201cImpossible,\u201d said Mr. Barker. \u201cWe\u2019re nowhere near a major fault line. What\u2019s going on?!\u201d Up the hill, Puck was running into the forest looking for his transmogrified wife when he noticed the animals scurrying away. \u201cOh no.\u201d He said. The fair-skinned dwarf ran into the woods knowing that his mammoth wife was in danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028Elisabeth at the time was trying to stand but the net fired by Tin Punk made it difficult for her to so much as move without falling flat on her enormous rear. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that you won\u2019t be getting away anytime soon,\u201d said Tin Punk as he pointed his gun to the mammoth yet again. \u201cI always catch my mark. There isn\u2019t a beast alive that can get the best of old Tin Punk. Even if that beast was once a woman.\u201d Tin Punk fired a laser and greatly wounded Elisabeth, causing the mammoth woman to trumpet in pain. \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d said Tin Punk. \u201cI wonder how much mammoth steaks would go.. auth!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028Before Tin Punk could finish his sentence, the poacher took a rock to the head and fell back before he turned around, revealing his mask was cracking up. It was there, he saw Puck struggling to hold up another rock. \u201cPuck!\u201d yelled Elisabeth. Tin Punk focused his cracking goggles on Puck this time. \u201cGet away from my wife you rat!\u201d yelled Puck. Tin Punk however, was not in the mood for compromise and grabbed Puck by the throat. Puck gagged as the villain attempted to choke him and Elisabeth spotted this and the mammoth giantess trumpeted in horror before she finally managed to shake off the net around her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTin Punk was just about ready to shoot Puck but then heard a loud angry trumpet and looked up to see Elisabeth fuming with rage. The obese pachyderm giantess stomped her enormous foot to shake the ground and force the poacher to drop Puck. Tin Punk reached for his gun but Elisabeth blew a gust of wind from her trunk to move the weapon out of reach. She then seized Tin Punk with her trunk and made him grunt. Puck was panting and then looked up to see his wife holding onto her antagonist. \u201cOh my gosh.\u201d Elisabeth trumpeted and squeezed Tin Punk and noticed that he seemed to be at least partially mechanical under his coat. \u201cHuh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Elisabeth or Puck could think any further on the matter....</span></div></div>",

Kagura?\u201d Yusuke looked forward and saw that the school girl was doing the one thing she always did after school, watching tokusatsu on her computer. \u201cGo! Sock it to them Rider! Another one bites the dust.\u201d Kagura cheered as she watched images of tokusatsu on her video. It looked like the hero would deal a finishing move to a villain but then the screen stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d yelled Kagura right before she turned to see Yusuke who paused the video. \u201cStill watching Tokusatsu I see,\u201d said Yusuke. \u201cKagura, you just turned 20. Don\u2019t you think you\u2019re getting too old for this stuff.\u201d \u201cBut, Yusuke, it\u2019s heroes like Kamen Rider and Ultraman who made me what I am, today.\u201d Yusuke just shook his head. \u201cMan, you like two types of Tokusatsu. Motorcycle martial artists and kaiju killing giants. I\u2019ll bet you wish that both of them would combine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagura got up and gasped in excitement. \u201cWouldn\u2019t that be awesome?\u201d she asked. \u201cYusuke, that\u2019s brilliant.\u201d Yusuke held out a pencil. \u201cThis pencil is reality, get a grip, Kagura. I\u2019ll see you back at the dorm.\u201d Kagura just put away her computer and scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kagura was walking towards the woodland area of the college, there was a strange meteor that was glowing on the ground. A grasshopper jumped on it and then begun to glow. As the glowing grasshopper jumped away, it begun to burn up before it landed on Kagura\u2019s sock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know,\u201d said Kagura as she was walking. \u201cIt would be great to be a giant bug-themed superhero. Combining the traits of the Rider and the Ultra. Why didn\u2019t they ever think of\u2026 ow.\u201d Kagura rubbed her leg, not realizing that the grasshopper bit her and stopped glowing. The veins in Kagura\u2019s leg however, were already glowing. Not that the schoolgirl noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she was about to get a big, fat, super surprise.</span></div></div>",

But as the Japanese school girl was dialing the buttons on her phone, she failed to notice that with every single spring in her step, she appeared to be getting higher and higher up in the air. At one point she actually jumped across the street over the traffic as she finally got a signal on her cell phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Yusuke was reading a book on different types of insects, no doubt studying for an exam, at a cafe right before his phone rung loudly. The young man checked the caller I.D. to see that it was Kagura on the phone. \u201cKagura,\u201d he said. \u201cI wonder what she wants now?\u201d Yusuke pressed on the phone and then he let out a sigh as he prepared to talk with Kagura. \u201cYes, Kagura,\u201d said Yusuke. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d \u201cYusuke!\u201d yelled Kagura. \u201cI just remembered. There is a superhero who combines Kamen Rider with Ultraman. Kamen Rider J!\u201d Yusuke let out a sigh. \u201cThat figures,\u201d said Yusuke. \u201cMost of the time when they show him, the only thing they really emphasize is his ability to turn into a giant. Besides, Kamen Rider J was a one-shot movie, like ZO and ZX.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s pronounced \u201cZet Cross\u201d, Yusuke. Did you see the new series.\u201d Yusuke let out a sigh. \u201cYou know, I miss the old days when Kamen Rider\u2019s main motif was an insect. I wonder why they chose to model the original rider after a grasshopper.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagura let out a slight moan. \u201cYeah,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you got to admit, the franchise is more than 40 years old now. It\u2019s too bad I was born too late to see the Showa Riders in their prime. I wonder what would\u2019ve happened if they continued the style of that era.\u201d \u201cMaybe they would\u2019ve had a lot more insect-based critters. Who knows, maybe they\u2019d make a female J.\u201d Kagura was giggling to herself right before she unconsciously landed on the roof of a skyscraper. \u201cIt\u2019s too bad superheroes only exist in manga and television. I would make an awesome crime fighter.\u201d Kagura tried to do a superhero pose but her legs were much thicker than before and she mumbled right before she slipped and fell to the ground. \u201cOuch!\u201d Kagura moaned as she tried to stand up. Yusuke let out a sigh as he put his phone n speaker on the other end. \u201cYou never really grew up, did you, Kagura? You always have your head buried in one of those idiotic comic books. Let\u2019s hope you don\u2019t forget we have a report due next week. Which insect did you choose?\u201d Kagura let out a laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s easy. I\u2019m choosing mine on the elegant grasshopper. It\u2019s a creature from southern Africa that eats posionous plants in order to keep itself safe from predators.\u201d Yusuke just shook his head on the other side. \u201cA grasshopper,\u201d he said. \u201cJust like Kamen Rider. What are the odds? You just be careful. I\u2019m sick of helping you with your homework all the time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Yusuke hung up and Kagura was finally able to stand up. Kagura let out a sigh. \u201cThat Yusuke,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s always so dead serious. I mean, he used to like Tokusatsu once too. I guess college has jaded him.\u201d Kagura then looked back and saw that she was on top of a skyscraper. \u201cHow did I get up here?\u201d she asked. Kagura then looked down to see how much fatter her thighs were. They looked at thick as tree trunks. \u201cWhoa,\u201d said Kagura as she felt the flab on her enormous legs. \u201cWhat thunder thighs. I need to seriously cut down on the pocky.\u201d Kagura then gasped and realized something. The schoolgirl rubbed her chin and on impulse she jumped 100ft into the air before landing back down on her feet. \u201cOh my gosh,\u201d she said in delight. \u201cThis is so cool.\u201d Kagura let out a laugh and jumped from building to building to get used to her newfound powers. All while the grasshopper bright was glowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is amazing,\u201d said Kagura. \u201cI\u2019ve got superpowers. I must be turning into a superhero. This is so epic. Wait until Yusuke sees what has happened to...\u201d Before Kagura could say another word, her butt suddenly expanded and caused her skirt to explode off of her body. Kagura gasped and felt her butt as her panties begun to rip. The schoolgirl then proceeded to land on her butt instead of on her feet. The sheer weight of her larger backside caused the street beneath her to crack apart. Kagura grumbled and then she rubbed her rear in pain before looking at it in a mirror. \u201cWhat the heck? My butt is enormous. What kind of superpower is?\u201d Kagura then yelled in pain because something was taking place. She ran down the street and saw that she was as tall as the street lamps. The schoolgirl then jumped again and managed to leap over all of Tokyo right before landing on the top of a mountain. \u201cWhat am I turning into?\u201d she asked. \u201cAm I becoming a hero or one of the monsters?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagura then let out a hiccup and noticed that her skin was changing color. She was turning bright blue with yellow-orange highlights and her hair turned into a crimson and red-orange shade as it grew longer. Kagura then looked back to see her butt expand into a long and huge segmented abdomen just like an insect of some sort. Kagura then saw her legs expand and sprout spikes, becoming more insect-like as wings formed on her back as her eyes turned pitch black. Kagura then held her head in pain right before she sprouted a pair of antennae and begun to pant. \"This is so unreal,\" said Kagura as she held herself in pain and her mouth turned into a pair of insect-like mandibles. \"If I didn't know better, I'd say that I was turning into a... ugh! I'd swear that I was turning into a bug!\" Kagura let out a scream right before she sprouted an extra pair of arms and flittered her wings. At that moment, her belly bulged out and her breasts got slightly bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that wasn't the only thing Kagura had to worry about, for she was getting bigger and bigger. Kagura clumsily wobbled and then jumped up into a tree branch only for the branch to break under her weight. The Japanese college girl grunted to herself right before she landed on her feet again. Her clothes tore off as she hopped over several trees. \"Good grief! When will it stop?\" At that moment, Kagura had finally stopped getting bigger (for now) and then she noticed that she was now a 50ft tall grasshopper woman with a 60ft wide belly, 75ft wide and 100ft long abdomen and H-cup breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagura was in stunned silence as she looked around her newly transmogrified body and even rubbed her legs together and shook her abdomen before she fluttered her wings slightly. \"Good heavens,\" said Kagura. \"I'm a giant grasshopper. I look as big as Ultraman or Kamen Rider J.\" Suddenly Kagura realized something. \"Wait a minute. I'm a grasshopper, the same type of animal used to design the original Kamen Riders 1 and 2 and I'm big enough to go toe to toe with the biggest of kaiju.\" Kagura then felt around her flabby and doughy insectoid belly as she let out a sigh before she pat her big bug booty with her four arms. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe I could\u2019ve gone without becoming so monstrously fat, but on the other hand, this is too awesome to pass up. Maybe I can be a superhero like...\u201d The grasshopper giantess then let out a squee. \"Golly gee! I'm going to be a big superhero. Look out evil forces, Tokyo has a new protector.\" Kagura then jumped across several mountains and laughed to herself. \"I have got to show this to Yusuke. He's going to flip when he sees that I've gone ginormous grasshopper on him.\" Kagura hopped so high into the air that she reached the clouds before landing in the ocean outside of Japan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Yusuke was looking over his book on insects. \"This looks like the perfect specimen for my report. The Japanese Rhinoceros Beetle. Kabutomushi. The beetle lives most of its life underground as larva and then for four months as...\" Before Yusuke could study any more, he heard a pounding sound. \"What's going on?\" asked Yusuke. \"That sounded like an explosion. Yusuke then looked out his window and screamed at the sight of a giant grasshopper eye right outside of his window.\" The young man was so surprised at what he had seen that he fell over in his chair. \"Kaiju!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusuke then heard girly laughter that he recognized as the voice of his girlfriend. \"Oh no,\" he muttered. \"It can't be. Can it?\" \"Guess who!\" yelled Kagura in a teasing tone. Yusuke looked out his window and could not believe the sight of the enormous grasshopper woman right outside of his window. \"What the heck?! Kagura!\" Kagura giggled and then rubbed her tummy. \"Like what happened to me?\" \"WHAT did happen to you?! You're a grasshopper as big as Gojira!\" \"I know!\" yelled Kagura. \"Isn't it amazing. Now I've got insect power and titanic size. I'm huge. This means I can be a tokusatsu hero myself.\" Yusuke just blinked in surprise. \"You're not serious are you? You're a monster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagura let out a slight insect noise. \"Who says that monsters can't be heroes? I'm going to make the most of this transformation. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got to go see where there's trouble. Sayonara.\" \"Kagura!\" yelled Yusuke. \"Wait!\" But it was too late, Kagura hopped off into Tokyo and was making people scream as they saw such an enormous bug. \"Don't worry, everyone!\" yelled Kagura. \"I'm here to say the day! Grasshopper Kagura is on the scene! Okay, I still need to come up with a good hero name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kagura was hopping, she saw her first major crisis to deal with as a giant grasshopper and it was...</span></div></div>",

A young newlywed couple was at a cajun restaurant looking outside as jesters were setting everything up. The new wife of the couple looked out and shook her head. However, her husband let out a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Tuesday,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s our honeymoon and it\u2019s Mardis Gras.\u201d Tuesday let out a laugh. \u201cI understand that, Reuben,\u201d she said. \u201cBut do they have to start so dang early. Save the music, beads and booze for the parade tonight. And speaking of which, I\u2019ve already picked up the perfect costume for you.\u201d Tuesday smirked and tapped her husband\u2019s nose with a laugh. \u201cUh-oh.\u201d Joked Reuben.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReuben saw a waiter go by with a dish full of gumbo and sniffed the air. \u201cGotta love that Cajun cooking? You know why I love Cajun cooking, Tuesday? It\u2019s nice and hot and spicy, just the way I like it. Come on, what\u2019s taking our gumbo?\u201d Tuesday just stuck out her tongue. \u201cIf it\u2019s all the same with you, dear, I think it would be safer for me to drink some nice hot lobster bisque.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, Tuesday, where\u2019s your sense of adventure? Try the spice, it\u2019ll blow your head off.\u201d At that moment, the waiter twirled in and from the look of it, he was dressed like a firefly. \u201cHere y\u2019all are, specialties of the ol\u2019 house. Gumbo for the gumbo and jumbo mudbug for the lady.\u201d Immediately Rueben was putting hot sauce into his gumbo but Tuesday was feeling a little less adventurous. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna burn your tongue off one of these days, Reuben,\u201d said Tuesday to her husband. \u201cI\u2019m warning you. But I\u2019ll humor you, just this once.\u201d Tuesday poured some pepper into her lobster bisque.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sampled it, she gagged slightly. \u201cUgh,\u201d she said. \u201cEven the lobster is spicy around these parts.\u201d What Tuesday didn\u2019t know was that the reason for her lobster\u2019s spiciness was a factor that the restaurant staff didn\u2019t even know. The lobster that Ruby ate was tainted. A nuclear power plant irresponsibly disposing of hazardous waste was responsible for that one particular lobster being irradiated with strange chemicals that would soon cause Ruby to turn into something huge and monstrous.</span></div></div>",

It was Mardi Gras and they was loud music playing as there was a parade down the street. Tuesday and Reuben had even dressed up in outfits that made them look like jesters. Reuben had dressed in a red and white checkered outfit like that of a traditional jester while Tuesday was dressed in a bright green domino mask with a large white collar, a split blue and white covered pair of pants with a red vest and a hoop skirt and mismatched shoes. They watched as dancers dressed up as skeletons moved down the street and confetti filled the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love Mardi Gras,\" said Tuesday. \"This was the perfect place for the honeymoon.\" Reuben let out a laugh as he spotted several people holding up a giant flag in the shape of a shape that glowed and let out a hiss as it moved down the street. \"Never a dull moment in New Orleans, Tuesday Baby,\" said Reuben. \"This should more than make up for the spicy lobster.\" Tuesday just gave a nervous smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Tuesday felt her head because she was feeling surprisingly hot and from the looks of it, her skin was turning bright red. Reuben looked at his new wife and was concerned. \"Tuesday?\" asked Reuben. \"Are you feeling alright.\" Tuesday felt her stomach rumble. \"I'm fine, Sweetie,\" she said. \"Just had some really bad lobster.\" \"Are you sure about that, Ruby Tuesday?\" asked Reuben as he put his arms around Tuesday's waist. \"You look a little red. Have you been getting too much sun.\" Tuesday rubbed her head and Reuben noticed that something didn't seem right. Tuesday's fingers were getting stubbier and stubbier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before Reuben could think any more on the matter, there was a louder sound of trumpeting and then a man in an alligator costume was tossing beads. Several of which landed around Reuben's neck. Tuesday laughed at her husband but then she saw that her skin appeared to be growing thicker, almost armor-like and her stomach was getting bigger as well. She even saw her fishnets getting tighter as she stood fully up. Reuben noticed that Tuesday was now twice as tall as he was. \"Uh, Tuesday?\" Tuesday kept on moaning and even held onto her head as she stepped out, in front of a fire eater, who had narrowly missed her and made her scream. The fire breather was wearing a strange demon mask that he took off before he smiled and winked at Tuesday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then Tuesday stepped back and was twitching. She heard slightly demonic laughter before she looked up and saw another of the performers and from the looks of it, he was wearing a Baron Samedi costume with a demonic looking skull mask as he held up a staff and pressed a button in it to create illusions of ghosts and ghouls. \"Be careful where you are treading,\" said the man in the skull mask. \"There are spirits out tonight. Some of them have dark intentions as the ill winds blow through the sky. Be wary as you venture out tonight.\" The man in the skull mask just continued laughing as Tuesday begun to sweat and her skin turned blue. \"Tuesday!\" yelled Reuben in fear for his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd looked on as something overcame Tuesday. First she started to grow larger in height and girth. Her face contorted in shape as her stomach continued to expand and her breasts were ripping as they shook and begun to expand. Tuesday was coughing as armor started to appear on her skin, withe a carapace on her face right before she sprouted a segmented tail. Several legs they sprouted out of her sides as she then sprouted antennae. Reuben looked in fear as spikes appeared on the carapace and Tuesday held out her arms right before her hands changed shape into large meaty claws, with the right claw being several times as large as the left claw as she shrieked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looked up and Reuben looked in horror as Tuesday had been transmogrified into a 50ft tall and 65ft wide lobster woman, albeit one with her jester outfit on, surprisingly intact. Reuben was horrified, but how did everyone else take it?</span></div></div>",

Not at all helped by the fact that her fianc\u00e9, Niles was working late and had brought home a statue of an actual raven that looked as though it was staring her in the face. Raven stared at the bird statue and could almost hear it cawing. \"Why on Earth would Niles bring home something that creepy. Ugh. Focus Raven. You have to work on your story. I know.

She laid the statue of the bird and took out a hammer. \"I'm sorry, Niles,\" she said. \"But this thing is giving me the creeps.\" Raven slammed the hammer down on the statue until it was powder and hastily buried the pieces before running back inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know where he got that statue but I'm glad that I got rid of it. Okay, Raven. The story begins in London on a dark night...\" As Raven was typing away, she didn't notice her ass was starting to not only expand but grow black feathers.</span></div></div>",

Our female subject goes to bed after a night on the town, only to be awoken by a thunderstorm and seeing that she has turned into a giant bird. She is so spooked by the dilemma that she tries to hide the transformation from her own husband. That's good... ow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven grunted. \"My feet are killing me. Ouch. What's wrong with these shoes.\" Raven then looked down and saw that her thighs were twenty times thicker than she remembered. \"Holy cow,\" she said. \"What happened to me? Guess the sedentary life of a writer finally took its toll on my figure.\" Raven then yelled as her chair broke to pieces beneath her enlarged ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven grunted and stood up to see her foot slipping out of her shoe and then gasped. Her feet had turned into big black talons like that of an actual Raven. Raven let out a caw and then covered her mouth and looked in horror before she realized that her hands had turned into the giant black wings of a raven. Raven stood up and grunted as she banged her head on the ceiling. She then grunted before her mouth stretched out and turned into a large gray beak. Her stomach then bulged out as her breasts expanded and her clothes started to rip and reveal her undergarments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Raven knew it, she was a literal raven but not just any raven. She was now an enormous anthropomorphic bird woman who stood 17 feet tall and had to weight three tons based on her over the top pear body shape. \"Just like in my story,\" said Raven in horror. \"Now I'm a real raven and a big raven. But how...\" Raven then remembered the raven statue that Niles bought, the one she hated enough to destroy. \"Niles's raven statue,\" she said to herself with a caw. \"It must've been cursed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Niles, Raven heard a knocking on the door that was no doubt her fianc\u00e9 returning home. \"Raven,\" he said. \"Raven, are you awake baby?\" Raven let out a gasp.

You sound surprisingly loud.\" \"Niles,\" said Raven. \"Remember that gaudy statue of an actual raven that you bought?\" \"Yeah,\" said Niles with a laugh. \"Pretty awesome isn't it.

I bought it with you in mind. After all, your name <i>is</i> Raven.\" Raven then let out a caw. \"I'm really sorry Niles. But it would seem that breaking that statue had instant karma. I think it was cursed.\" \"Cursed? You mean it was cursed to possess you to break it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another shifting and a rumbling as Niles nearly fell to the ground. \"Come in and see for yourself.\" Said Raven. Niles had no idea what Raven was talking about, but nonetheless, Raven was his fianc\u00e9e and he could just shrug his shoulders as he opened the door. \"Okay, Raven, what's the big bad curse.\" Niles then felt something fall on his shoulder and turned his head to see that it was a large black feather the size of a pillow and then he bumped into a big fleshy wall of black feathers. The young man looked up and gasped to see his girlfriend transformed into a 17 foot tall, 3-ton raven as she lowered her beak and cawed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raven.... you're a.... raven.\" Raven let out a squawk and flapped her wings. \"See?! That statue put a curse on me. It's one thing to make me fat, but to turn me into a bird.\" Niles just looked in awe as his future wife flapped her new wings frantically. \"Personally,\" said Niles as he felt Raven's bulging belly. \"I don't think you've ever looked better.\" Raven gave a glare and pointed her beak at Niles. \"Take this seriously,\" said Raven. \"Or I swear, I will sit on you. Where did you get that statue anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" said Niles. \"It was a strange shop with a creepy looking skull on display. I didn't even see the shopkeeper. It's as if he wasn't even there. But he did say that the shop would be moving to Venice.\" Raven let out a squawk and grabbed her head before burying it in her now E-cup sized breasts just as her clothes were about to completely rip off. \"I'm going to be a giant raven forever.\" The corvid titans groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Raven squawked as her belly was bulging, as were her thighs. Niles yelled and had to climb up Raven's belly as the bird woman grew bigger and bigger as she started to break through the root.

Raven at this point was so gargantuan that Niles had to wrap around her ankle as if it was a tree trunk just as Raven was flapping her wings in order to fly in the air as she continued to squawk. She managed to get her obese and growing corvid body off the ground as she kept getting bigger and bigger. \u201cWhat did I do to deserve this?\u201d thought Raven to herself. \u201cI\u2019m not a bad person. Sure I broke that statue, but how was I supposed to know it was cursed.\u201d Raven then squawked as her wings just kept getting and bigger and the crow woman felt her belly and booty continuing to expand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNiles watched as Raven continued to get bigger and bigger and drooled as he climbed up his transmogrified fianc\u00e9e\u2019s leg and coped a feel on Raven\u2019s bird booty as she grunted. Eventually Raven stopped growing and Niles looked around in surprise. Raven had grown into a 650ft tall raven with a 700ft wide stomach and a 850ft butt as well as a 1000ft wide wingspan to allow her obese body to fly. Raven squawked as she looked down and landed one feet in a nearby parking lot, crunching the cars beneath her massive talons. Raven was shocked. \u201cOh my gosh,\u201d she said. \u201cThis can\u2019t be happening. I\u2019ve gone from a horror writer to the Godzilla of the crow world. Thanks a lot, Niles. Niles?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven lifted up her stomach and looked through her rolls to try and find Niles. \u201cOh, please don\u2019t be dead, Niles. Please tell me that I didn\u2019t crush you.\u201d As Raven was moving about, Niles was holding onto the raven giantess\u2019s right butt cheek and was looking around to see that each feather on the bird woman\u2019s body was even taller than he was. Niles couldn\u2019t help but rub and squeeze Raven\u2019s soft obsidian flesh, prompting the corvid giantess to caw rather loudly. Then Raven realized that her future husband was on her ass and grit her beak as she moved her feathered fingers all around her booty to look for Niles. She had to back up and look into the side of a building at her reflection to see where Niles was and picked him up between her clawed bus-sized and sausage shaped fingers.\u2028\u2028Raven plucked out Niles and held her up in front of her beak. Niles looked down in awe at how high he was. From what he could see past Raven\u2019s stomach, Niles saw cars that looked like ants from how high up he was. \u201cOh my gosh,\u201d said Niles. \u201cRaven, you\u2019re HUGE.\u201d Raven gave an angry caw. \u201cWell, this just means you\u2019ll have to do my writing for me. I\u2019d strain my eyes looking at the computer screen and with these fingers, I\u2019d crush the keyboard. You should not have bought that statue.\u201d \u201cN-Now,\u201d said Niles. \u201cCalm down, Raven. No need to get nasty. Please don\u2019t call off the engagement.\u201d Raven let out a sigh. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m still going to marry you in a few months. You had just better get used to the idea that your wife will be a raven as big as a skyscraper. And don\u2019t expect any kids out of me. There isn\u2019t enough hemorrhoid cream in the world for this rear.\u201d Raven slapped her butt as it rippled and large feathers fell off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay, Raven,\u201d said Niles. \u201cBirds are my favorite animals. Part of me even wished that you were a bird yourself. Heck, the main reason I fell for you was because your name was Raven.\u201d \u201cAnd now I\u2019m <i>a</i> raven.\u201d Good luck in bed getting past all this black bird hide.\u201d Raven held up several of her rolls of fat on her belly and then she perched on the building right behind her. She then let out a sigh. \u201cBoy, wait until my folks see this. They\u2019ll be out of their minds.\u201d Niles let out a laugh. \u201cYeah, they\u2019ll think that you became part of one of your own horror novels.\u201d Raven smiled and then held out the end of her beak for Niles to kiss it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Raven\u2019s stomach begun to growl. The bird giantess held her stomach in pain. \u201cOh my gosh,\u201d groaned Raven. \u201cI am starving. Niles, by any chance, what do ravens eat?\u201d \u201cWell, mainly they eat meat, small animals and especially carrion.\u201d \u201cUgh!\u201d yelled Raven. \u201cThat\u2019s disgusting. I am not eating carrion. No way!\u201d Raven then placed her fianc\u00e9e on top of her head before flying through the air. \u201cI need something to fill my stomach,\u201d said Raven. \u201cAh, that looks like a good place to find food.\u201d With that, Raven dived down to find food...</span></div></div>",

She landed with a boom due to her large weight and the 650ft raven looked back to see that the earthquake knocked down several trees behind her. She blushed slightly but then she looked down and licked her beak before she lowered her head to start plucking apples out of the trees and swallowing them. \u201cOh man,\u201d said the titanic bird. \u201cI love apples.\u201d Raven kept plucking at a tree until it was stripped of all vegetation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the bird giantess was lowering her head to eat, Niles decided to walk down his transmogrified fianc\u00e9e\u2019s neck. Along the way, his feet kept sinking in the quicksand-like back fat. \u201cUgh. Whoa!\u201d Niles tripped and landed on Raven\u2019s large booty where he was holding on to her tail feathers. \u201cUh, Raven,\u201d said Niles. \u201cAre you sure that you should be doing this? These apples aren\u2019t ours.\u201d Raven scoffed as she showed a beak filled with half-chewed apples. \u201cDon\u2019t be a worrywart, Niles. I\u2019ll reimburse the farmers.\u201d Niles tried to maintain his footing on the bird booty and wound up accidentally pulling off a tail feather as big as a sailboat\u2019s sail. He gasped as he looked at the feather. His future wife didn\u2019t seem to feel it, so Niles simply dropped the feather hoping she wouldn\u2019t be too mad about it being plucked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just that, Baby. What if somebody sees you.\u201d Raven let out a sigh. \u201cKind of hard to hide a bird as big as a mountain, isn\u2019t it, Sug? Somebody is going to see me eventually.\u201d Raven then plucked an apple and threw it at Niles. Niles grabbed the apple but then slipped and fell to the ground with a grunt. He looked up and saw nothing but black-feathered bird booty. He couldn\u2019t help but poke the 850ft ass as Raven kept chomping on apples. \u201cI definitely should\u2019ve bought a cursed statue earlier,\u201d thought Niles to himself. \u201cOh my.\u201d As Raven was eating, she felt her future husband putting his hands through her large feathery ass. She smirked to herself. \u201cOh,\u201d she thought. \u201cYou\u2019re asking for it. Oh, that\u2019s it.\u201d Raven then noticed that there was a scarecrow between two of her talons and groaned. \u201cGive me a break,\u201d the giant raven said to herself. \u201cI mean, seriously?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that\u2019s when Raven heard movement. \u201cWhat happened here?!\u201d yelled a voice taking note of all the trees Raven stripped of apples. \u201cIt looks like a storm struck.\u201d Raven gave a gulp as an apple core fell out of her nose. On the ground, there was a young man in overalls in glasses who no doubt was in charge of the apple orchard. The young farmer noticed one of the apple cores that Raven dropped and then he looked up and gasped at the sight of Raven. The giant bird looked down on the farmer and the huge black bird let out a nervous laugh as she inched forward. The farm boy was in utter shock of a giant raven (in name and species) in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven let out a squawk and coughed into her mouth as she gave a nervous look. \u201cIt\u2019s okay! I mean you no harm!\u201d Raven cawed a few times before a look of pure surprise appeared on the young man\u2019s face. \u201cWait,\u201d he said. \u201cThat voice. I heard that voice on the radio. You\u2019re that author, Raven Barrymore ain\u2019t you?\u201d Raven bit her beak slightly. \u201cI expected you to be, I dunno, human!\u201d Raven gave a nervous smile. \u201cWould you believe that I\u2019m in the middle of writing a story where a young woman wakes up as a bird.\u201d The farm boy gave a look of uneasiness. \u201cI\u2019d say that  you\u2019re living it.\u201d Raven held her head in embarrassment. \u201cI promise I\u2019ll reimburse you for the apples.\u201d The farm boy just let out a sigh. \u201cDon\u2019t bother. I\u2019ll just blow it on having my head examined.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028The farm boy walked away and then Raven let out a sigh and got up. \u201cI\u2019ve eaten enough apples for today. Better fly for now, Niles. Niles? Now where is that fianc\u00e9e of mine?\u201d Raven gets up and begins to fly, unaware that Niles is holding onto the feathers on her left butt cheek and he\u2019s starting to lose his grip. Niles grunted as he held on tight. He looked down over the trees and grew nervous about his unstable grip. Does he manage to hold on to the giant bird?</span></div></div>",

It's not the end of the world that you lost your shoe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrent patiently waited on the path as his girlfriend waded through the thick grass between the trees against the edge, his back facing the river. He'd been standing around for about ten minutes after Irma tried running, only to by some skill toss it from her foot and somewhere into the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't unusual for Irma, but thankfully Trent always had a strong tolerance for her accident-proneness. She was always very sweet and chipper, always willing to give him a hand when necessary. Even then, something about her klutziness was actually pretty fascinating in just how far she could go to get into some kind of accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you\u2026found it!\" She cheered, triumphantly holding the shoe above her head. She pushed through the grass and set her shoe back on, putting her glasses back on and fitting a wool cap back onto her long, black hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, everything in order?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup! Just need to\u2026what's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrma glanced to a tree nearby, which had a small, fuzzy yellow spot in its bark. Curious as to what it was,s he walked up to the tree and smiled to see that it was a very plump, fuzzy moth, its wings yellow and black. \"Come here, look at this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a moth! I don't think I've ever seen this one's species before!\" Another strange thing about Irma was that she was fascinated by bugs, completely unafraid of them whereas many others would either kill them or run on first sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heavy insect leapt from its perch and flapped about in front of Irma's face, who gently lifted her hand raised one finger for the moth to land on. Almost obediently it flew to her hand and landed on her finger, looking at her almost curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, it's so cute! I don't think I've ever seen a moth so-YEOUCH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrma shook her hand in pain, the moth quickly flying back into the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, Irma, you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm fine\u2026but I think he moth bit me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gonna be alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on a minute\u2026\" She took a close look at her finger, the spot where she'd been bitten a small red bump. \"Well\u2026I don't think there's any immediate signs of fatal venom, so I think I'll survive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just keep going for a while and try not to stop, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that'd be a good idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrent and Irma continued on their hike, going as quick as they could to get back to their cabin as soon as possible. But the two were unaware of a change occurring in Irma, changing her very being. Her stomach began to puff out a bit more than usual, and her rear end also began to thicken out, gently straining against the seams of her jeans... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She saw that the back of her jeans had torn slightly and revealed her underwear. She then let out a gasp as her jeans appeared to be slipping off. Irma yelled and then jumped right out of her jeans before she slipped and noticed that her butt had to be as wide as she was tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrma blushed and then she realized she needed to find the map. She looked through her jeans as she sat her now very fat butt onto the ground. In the process, Irma was looking through her jeans only to find out that the map was missing. She then looked back to see that the map had gotten stuck in her huge butt crack. As Irma was tried to reach for the map, she heard a cracking sound and got up to see she sat on and crushed her cellphone. Irma gasped and then turned around before she saw her belly was now as wide as her butt and as she tried to hold it, she accidentally knocked down a tree with her ass and it made a crashing sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the?!\" yelled Trent. Trent looked and saw the destroyed tree and Irma's big butt. \"Franz Kafka on the bend, Irma!\" yelled Trent. \"What did you do? Sit in poison oak or something?! Your butt is enormous!\" Irma bit her lip. \"So it is, noticeable.\" \"Oh,\" said Trip. \"There's the map.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrent pulled the map out of Irma's butt crack and read it but saw that the map appeared to have been faded. \"Oh great,\" said Trent. \"You must've ruined the map when you fell in the river earlier. You can be a total klutz at times, Irma.\" Irma blushed and turned around and Trent gasped. Irma was now 12ft tall and 15ft wide. Trent looked up at his huge girlfriend and couldn't find the right words to describe what he was looking at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Irma?\" asked Trent. \"What happened?\" \"I don't know. I...\" Irma then grunted as her stomach rumbled and she took off her wool hat to eat it and Trent dropped his jaw. \"Irma?\" Trent asked his huge and obese girlfriend in worry. \"Are you alright?\" Irma begun to twitch and then heard a ripping noise and looked down to see that not only were her arms and legs as thick as tree trunks, but the nerdy girl now had a second pair of arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrma then grunted before purplish brown hair grew around her neck and then started to spread through her body as she was getting bigger and bigger. Irma stepped back in fear and accidentally knocked down several more trees. One of the trees almost hit Trent as Trent yelled. \"Irma?\" Irma grunted and then her butt stretched out into a thorax that shredded her underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrma then saw pinkish brown fur growing around her arms and legs as her fingers on each hand fused into three digits and her toes did the same. She screamed as the eyes behind her glasses turned into bug eyes and she sprouted yellow antennae. Finally, she sprouted a pair of wings that were purplish brown with yellow-green highlights. Irma's breasts then expanded as did her belly and butt as her wings were growing. Trent screamed as Irma almost stepped on him and he found himself wedged between her girlfriend's toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrma saw that she was now a giant slug moth who stood 80ft tall with a 95ft belly, H-cup breasts and a 115ft wide thorax that was just as long. Irma's wings appeared to be 150ft wide as she held them up and she blushed because several more trees collapsed as she opened her wings. Trent's jaw dropped as he saw what his girlfriend had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Irma was very happy and let out a squee as she held her face and stomach with all four of her arms. \"This is amazing. I'm a giant moth!

The wife of the couple, Kim was a paleontology teacher at the school and was holding a box of some sort that had an eerie light coming from it. \u201cSo today begins the new semester?\u201d Tom asked his wife. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna be swamped with a bunch of rowdy kids right out of high school, Kim. I\u2019m warning you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Kim seemed confident enough as she held up her box. \u201cI know that they  can be a handful. No longer teenagers but still with plenty of attitude. Most of my first class of the year is going to consist of 18-year olds.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a bad sign, Kim,\u201d said Tom. \u201cAnd another bad sign is that thing that you ordered through the male. I heard that decades ago, there was a nuclear accident where that skull was found. I don\u2019t think it was a good idea for you to be touching it. \u201cThat\u2019s why it was cased in lead, Tom,\u201d said Kim. \u201cAnd besides, after so many years, there should\u2019ve been considerably less radiation in the ground. Don\u2019t worry, I know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom parked the car and Kim gave her husband a kiss as she walked out of the car. \u201cI\u2019ll see you after noon,\u201d said Kim. \u201cI get out early on the first day.\u201d Tom just gave a smile at his wife and it wasn\u2019t long before Kim had arrived at her classroom. She unlocked the door and laid the box on her desk. She had arrived before any of her students. Then she decided to open the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside of it was the skull of a tyrannosaurus rex and from the looks of it, it had a blue tint that almost looked radioactive. Kim rubbed the skull and let out a scoff. \u201cIt looks perfectly fine,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why that husband of mine was worried.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as Kim stroked the skull, a small blue glow seemed to enter her wrist.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once Kim\u2019s classroom was set up she held up the tyrannosaurus skull. \u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what Tom was so worried about, I can handle anything.\u201d It was there, the first class of the day came in and the Professor looked rather confident. \u201cGood morning, class, I am Professor Kimberly Frank. I really appreciate everyone for coming out. I don\u2019t know if this is anyone here\u2019s first day as a student, but this is my first day as a teacher and I fully intend to...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that was when something happened that caused Kim to stop. There were two late arrivals. One was a blonde haired and dark skinned girl with her cell phone and she was with a fair-skinned brunette young man. \u201cLooks like we have a couple of late arrivals.\u201d The girl just let out a sigh. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that you\u2019re the Professor. You look as young as us. Come on, Brad. We had better take our seats and get this boring class over with.\u201d Kim let out a scoff. \u201cYou must be Bonnie Lang. You know, you\u2019re not making a good first impression.\u201d \u201cWhatever. The only reason I\u2019m taking this useless class is to fulfill my science requirement.\u201d Kim was irked by that troublesome student, but decided to get it over with and continued with her lecture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright class,\u201d said Kim. \u201cThe dinosaurs existed during a time we call the Mesozoic era. The Mesozoic era was split into three different periods. The first of which...\u201d Kim turned to see Bonnie appeared to be texting and while mildly irked, she decided to resume class. \u201cWas the Triassic Period that took place between 251-199 million years ago. This period followed the great mass extinction at the end of the Permian Period. During this time, most of the continents were converged into Pangaea and the climate was generally very dry with the occasional seasonal monsoon near the coastal regions. Generally it was warmer than today and lacked the polar icecaps. During this era, the oceans have been massively depopulated due to high carbon dioxide level. However, the Triassic is best known as the age of reptiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kim was writing on the board, she didn\u2019t notice that her skin appeared to be turning light blue and that white stripes were appearing on her back. One of the students, an African American boy with glasses who looked younger than his classmates saw what was happening and adjusted his glasses. He could even see that Kim\u2019s rear end seemed to be expanding and tearing apart her jeans. \u201cProfessor Frank,\u201d he said. \u201cAre you feeling alright?\u201d Kim at first was confused but then she saw that her fingernails had turned into bright red claws and gasped. She quickly cleaned her glasses and then looked at her compact mirror to see that her teeth had turned razor sharp. \u201cOh no.\u201d She groaned. Then she remembered the tyrannosaurus skull that was glowing earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim then muttered in pain as her shoes came apart as her feet turned into clawed talons. Bonnie looked at Kim in fear as she got on her knees and her thighs became as thick as tree trunks as she sprouted a long tail and then Kim let out a scream that turned into a roar. Kim stood up and saw that she was rapidly growing and even hit her head on the ceiling and growled. She also saw that her stomach had expanded and was now as wide as she was tall, to say nothing of her butt and thighs that completely destroyed her pants. The students looked at their professor in pure fear as her transformation was becoming complete. Her hands turned into two-fingered claws and her head turned into a large reptilian snout. Kim had completely turned into a large and obese tyrannosaurus rex as her class looked in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kim was looking around in shock of her transformation, Brad whispered into Bonnie\u2019s ear. \u201cI really hope she isn\u2019t mad with you.\u201d He said. Kim let out a growl and held her head as she tried to process the transformation. Will she be alright?</span></div></div>",

That dinosaur skull must've been radioactive. It turned me into a Tyrannosaurus Re... no, make that a Tyrannosaurus <i>Regina</i></span>.\" The enormous blue tyrannosaurus woman then looked to see that her ass was wider than she was tall and she felt her stomach. \"<span class=\"cblue\">So much for my diet. Damn. Guess I can say goodbye to bikinis. Then again, they'd look awkward on a skinny dinosaur.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim then realized that her class was looking at her in fear, especially Bonnie. Kim realized that Bonnie knew how she had gotten on the former's bad side as soon as she came into class and then stomped up to Bonnie who screamed and took out perfume to spray her in the face. Kim coughed on the perfume and then saw Bonnie backing away into a corner. \"<span class=\"cblue\">Easy, Bonnie. You may be far from the best student, but I'm not going to eat you. Heck, you'd probably give me indigestion if I did</span>.\" But Bonnie was still afraid and several of the students feared the worst. \"Bonnie,\" whispered Brad. \"Don't move. She can't see you if you don't move.\" Kim let out a scoff. \"<span class=\"cblue\">That's a very easy way to get yourself eaten, Mr. Asher. You're not showing a lot of promise. I better tell them I'm not hostile</span>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim turned to face her fearful class and then tried to speak with them to ease their fears but all that came out of her mouth was a dinosaur roar. She realized this and tried to speak again but only let out a few growls. \"<span class=\"cblue\">Oh shit. It's bad enough I've turned into a sumo tyrannosaurus, but now I can't even talk. The mutation must've destroyed my vocal chords. That's great. This will make teaching class a whole lot more difficult</span>.\" Kim stomped in place to get everyone's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's she doing?\" asked a redheaded freckled girl. \"She sure is taking her sweet time eating us.\" The nerd from earlier however, realized Kim's intention. \"I don't think she wants to eat us.\" Kim nodded her head. \"<span class=\"cblue\">Good boy, Byron</span>,\" thought the mutated professor as she adjusted her glasses. \"<span class=\"cblue\">At least somebody isn't afraid of me.</span>\" Kim stomped up to the blackboard with her class moving out of the way to avoid being crushed. With each step, the tyrannosaurus woman appeared to be getting bigger. \"<span class=\"cblue\">Something tells me that I haven't stopped growing. Great. At this rate, I'll be the size of Godzilla before I know it. I have to make this face</span>.\" Kim tried to reach for the chalk but had some difficulty with her multi-ton stomach and breasts combined with her tiny arms. \"<span class=\"cblue\">Dammit! How did T-Rex survive with these useless arms. Looks like I need to improvise</span>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dinosaur woman picked up her chalk with her mouth and then gagged in disgust. \"<span class=\"cblue\">Blech</span>!\" But she fought through it and wrote a message on the board. \"CLASS POSTPONED UNTIL WEDNESDAY. PLEASE TELL THE DEAN WHAT HAPPENED.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that time, Kim's husband, Tom, was working at his job in a garage when he heard his cellphone ring and he grunted and tried to get up, only to hit his head because he was underneath the car.\" Tom rubbed his head in pain and then got out from under the car before answering the phone. \"Hello?\" \"Hello, Mr. Frank.\" \"Dean Chaplain? What's up?\" \"Mr. Frank. It appears that something has happened with your wife?\" \"My wife?\" asked Tom in worry. \"Is Kim okay? Is she hurt?\" \"Not exactly. Uh, you might want to sit down for this. It appears that Professor Frank has turned into a Tyrannosaurus Rex.\" \"What?!\" yelled Frank in disbelief. \"Is this some kind of a joke. It isn't funny. That's impossible.\" \"I'm serious, Mr. Frank. Your wife is a gigantic and very obese dinosaur. We need you to come right away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom was driving to the college and didn't believe that his wife had turned into a tyrannosaurus. \"Dean Chaplain must take me for an idiot. I may not have gone to college like Kim, but I'm not stupid enough to believe my wife could turn into a dinosaur. I'm going to give him a piece of my mind.\" Suddenly Frank felt tremors and heard loud rumbling noises. \"What was that? An Earthquake. Impossible. We're not on a fault line.\" Tom parked his car and continued to hear stomping noises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked out of the car to investigate and then yelled because he slipped into a hole of some sort. Tom got up and gasped because the hole was actually a tyrannosaurus footprint. Before Tom knew, he heard a snort and felt hot wind on his back. He then turned around and screamed as he saw the transmogrified Kim right behind him. At this point, Kim was 60ft tall with E-cup breasts, a 70ft belly and a 90ft wide butt as well as three chins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"<span class=\"cblue\">Hi, Tom. Well, this is awkward</span>.\" Tom was frozen in fear at the sight of an actually Tyrannosaurus Rex but then he saw the tyrannosaurus's glasses, coat and wedding ring and realized that this was his wife. \"Kimberly?!\" he asked in a dumbfounded tone.</span></div></div>",

Man, this is hell</span>.\" Tom then jumped back because Kim tried to grab him by the shirt collar but her arms were too small so she resorted to trying to pick him up with her mouth. \"Have you gone mental!?\" yelled Tom at his wife.

I've lost my voice</span>!\" But all Tom heard was Kim roaring at him before Byron ran up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Frank,\" he said. \"She can't speak at all.

I hope that new couch we bought is <i>very</i> comfortable</span>.\" Kim let out another snort and then sat down on the ground with a big thump.

She can't speak, she's as big as a building and her arms are too tiny to hold chalk. How can my wife do her job when she's a tyrannosaurus with breasts.\" Kim snorted on Tom in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't panic, Mr. Frank. Our engineering and design lab is already developing a machine that will allow us to hear Kimberly's thoughts and a harness that will allow her to get around her handicap with her small arms.\" \"<span class=\"cblue\">Hey, Dean. How about getting me around my handicap of a large butt. This thing looks like it's the same size as the comet that wiped out the dinosaurs in the first place</span>.\" \"Of course, it won't be ready until Wednesday so your wife is just going to have to be patient. I'm going to have to ask you both to leave campus until then. Good day, Mr. Frank and Professor Frank.\" Tom shook hands with the dean and then climbed on top of Kim's head before Kim stomped away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kim was walking away, several students ran in fear to avoid being stepped on by the giant mutated professor. \"The preacher said, \"Together forever for better or worse\", Kim. And things don't get any worse than this.\" \"<span class=\"cblue\">That was so funny, I forgot to laugh</span>.\" Thought Kim sarcastically. \"Do I detect a hint of sarcasm, Kim?\" asked Tom. \"You know, it's gonna be hard communicating until this is over. But don't worry baby, I'm with you all the way.\" \"You better. I guess it's clear who wears the pants in this household. Though even the world's biggest pair of pants won't fit on my dinosaur sized tush.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim then walked out into town and people saw her and screamed. \"Where are you going?\" asked Tom. \"<span class=\"cblue\">Where does it look like</span>?\" asked Kim. \"<span class=\"cblue\">I'm hungry</span>.\" Kim saw a hotdog cart up ahead and the vendor ran off screaming as Kim sniffed the cart and then lifted it up in her mouth to devour the wieners inside before chewing the cart itself to bits. Then Kim opened her mouth wide to swallow an entire row of fruit carts before letting out a loud belch. \"<span class=\"cblue\">Excuse me</span>,\" thought Kim. \"<span class=\"cblue\">Melons always did give me gas. Great, now I'm thirsty</span>.\" Kim then noticed a water tower and chomped into it in order to suck all the water inside down into her obese dinosaur belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom could only watch and hold on as his wife stomped off for...</span></div></div>",

Tyrannosaurus Rex!\" Several people who were tanning immediately got up and ran away screaming as Kim stepped her massive and obese dinosaur body towards their direction. \"<span class=\"cblue\">Okay</span>,\" thought the dinosaur giantess to herself. \"<span class=\"cblue\">That's going to get annoying real fast</span>.\" One little boy ran to the lifeguard tower and banged on the door. \"Dinosaur!\" he yelled. \"There's a dinosaur on the beach! A big giant dinosaur with glasses!\" The lifeguard predictably didn't believe the boy. \"Young man,\" he said. \"Lying to a lifeguard is a serious offense. I'd have real emergencies to deal with.\" \"But it's not a lie, look!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lifeguard looked up and took off his sunglasses as he looked in pure fear at Kim looking down at him as she held up a two-fingered hand. \"<span class=\"cblue\">Peace</span>.\" The lifeguard dropped to the ground screaming as Kim lowered her head and snorted on him. While Kim had no intention of eating humans, that didn't mean she couldn't smirk smugly at the much smaller man's fear. Of course, Tom wasn't that impressed. \"Kim,\" he said. \"Don't tease the lifeguard.\" Kim just let out a grumble at her husband. \"<span class=\"cblue\">Killjoy. I'm a giant tyrannosaurus regina. I gotta have some fun</span>.\" The obese dinosaur giantess then gave a snort. and turned around as she lowered her tail for Tom to climb down her huge ass right before the dinosaur stomped towards the ocean. \"I'm really sorry about my wife, pal.\" Said Tom to the lifeguard. The lifeguard was dumbfounded. \"Wife?! You married a dinosaur?!\" Tom gave a glare. \"She wasn't a dinosaur when I married her, okay.\" Then Tom realized something. \"Kim?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim was walking towards the water for reasons known only to the skyscraper sized sumo tyrannosaurus. As she walked out to the water, all the swimmers and surfers ran out and screamed. \"<span class=\"cblue\">This is not boding well for my self-esteem. It's bad enough that I'm fat</span>.\" But Kim ignored the crowd and lowered her head underneath the water as she adjusted her glasses. As Kim's head was underwater, her massive booty was in the air and several seagulls flew down to perch on the dinosaur giantess's fleshy rear. \"<span class=\"cblue\">Now</span>,\" thought Kim to herself. \"<span class=\"cblue\">It's gotta be around here somewhere. I wanted to bring it to my class but it was too deep to reach and too heavy to carry back. At least back when I was human. Now, that cheater has to be around here somewhere</span>?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom saw his giant tyrannosaurus wife rooting around in the water as more seagulls flew and perched on her behind. This eventually annoyed Kim and provoked the fat dinosaur lady to stick her head back out of the water and snap her jaws at the seagulls to scare them off. She wound up swallowing one by accident and groaned. Kim rubbed her stomach because she felt that seagull she ate flaying around in her stomach as she grumbled. As for Tom, he was really confused. \"What is that wife of mine doing? If only I could understand what she was saying.\" Tom took out his cell phone in order to call the dean. \"Dean Chaplain,\" he said. \"How goes the project.\" \"Oh, Mr. Frank. I've talked to the engineering department. They're currently constructing a harness for your wife that will not only be able to translate her roars into English but it will come with a set of mechanical arms. You don't expect her to be able to do anything with those puny dinosaur arms do you? Where is she now?\" Tom looked out to look further at his wife. \"She's out in the ocean,\" said Tom. \"If she's not careful, someone might think she's Godzilla.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly something happened and Tom's jaw dropped. It was at that moment, Kim had undergone another growth spurt. She was now 150ft tall. Her breasts were now F-cup, her ass was now 185ft wide and her stomach was now 170ft wide. Kim herself was shocked with how much bigger she was. \"<span class=\"cblue\">Okay</span>,\" thought the dinosaur giantess. \"<span class=\"cblue\">I'm going to have to teach all my classes outside</span>.\" Tom could only stare at his enormous wife's even more enormous ass and tail. \"Good grief,\" said Tom. \"Looks like I'm going to need to take aerobics classes.\" Kim let out a grumble but then she grunted. \"<span class=\"cblue\">Wait</span>,\" she thought. \"<span class=\"cblue\">Is that. Yes</span>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tyrannosaurus rex giantess lowered her head down into the water again where she saw a skeleton of an elasmosaurus, a giant marine reptile that lived at the same time as the dinosaurs. The fossil was 46ft long and given how big Kim was, she was huge enough for it to fit into her mouth. Using her newfound and monstrous strength, Kim was able to pull the fossil right out of the seabed held it up. She stomped back to the beach and laid it on the ground right at Tom's feet as Tom let out a scream. But then Tom saw his tyrannosaurus's enormous, chubby and smiling face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Tom</span>!\" thought Kim. \"<span class=\"cblue\">Isn't this great. This is a real specimen of an elasmosaurus from the Cretaceous era. Meaning \"thin plate lizard\" this creature was a plesiosaur that lived 80.5 million years ago. And its throat is filled with stones. Some scholars saw that this creature swallowed stones to digest tough meals much like chickens do and also to act as a ballast much like a submarine? Look at that neck. 75 cervical bones. Humans only have 7. From the wounds on the bones, it must've been attacked by a mosasaur, it's natural predator. That's why it died. Wait until my class gets a hold of this</span>.\" However, as Kimberly was speaking, Tom could only hear roaring because she was a tyrannosaurus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kim,\" said Tom. \"I can't understand you right now.\" Kim gave a rather embarrassed look at her tiny husband. \"<span class=\"cblue\">Dammit! I forgot. I guess that means I can't warn him about my mother coming this weekend either.</span>\" Kim let out a groaning roar. \"Now, don't worry, Kimberly,\" said Tom. \"We'll get through this. Sure, this isn't exactly the best thing that could happen to us, but we'll think of something. They're already building something to help you speak again.\" Kim let out a snort. \u201c<span class=\"cblue\">I hope they can make something that can fit this prehistoric hips. My butt could put those out of control celebrity girls to shame right now</span>.\u201d To emphasize this, Kim spanked her own enormous booty and made it ripple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she realized something. \"<span class=\"cblue\">Good grief. I just realized I'm naked. Why my glasses grew with me, I'll never know</span>. I need something to wear.\" It was there Kim saw a billboard up ahead that was advertising a new dinosaur movie. One that depicted dinosaurs in a circus of some kind. \"<span class=\"cblue\">Triassic Wonderland</span>?\" Kim ripped off the billboard and wrapped it around her upper body in order to resemble a shirt and jacket. However, she looked down to notice that she wasn't wearing any pants. She looked down at her big booty and then she heard laughing. It was coming from Tom who was laughing at the fact that his wife was now forced to wear a billboard for clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Kim gave a smirk and rose her large butt over her husband and wagged her tail as she smiled smugly. \"Now, now, now, Kim,\" said Tom. \"Don't do anything rash.\" But it was too late because Tom found himself lightly underneath Kim's rear end as he was struggling. \"<span class=\"cblue\">Aw. I thought that my booty was your favorite part of me, Dear</span>.\" \"Okay,\" said Tom. \"I'll admit. I shouldn't have laughed at you.\" Kim gave a laugh as she rose off of her tiny husband and Tom inhaled deeply. \"You know, maybe you're onto something. Maybe dinosaurs should wear pants. Or at least a thong.\" Kim gave a snort.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, before Kim could do anything else, a low flying advertisement plane flew by her head and the pilot panicked and swerved by Kim's head as Kim grunted.

She was leading a tour of the famous dinosaur wing of the museum. \"This creature is know as Archaeopteryx lithographica. Archaeopteryx is believed to be the bridge between birds and dinosaurs. Fossils of these strange wonders have been found in the forests of Southern Europe. From these fossilized remains, we can tell that the archaeopteryx's feathers shared much in common with modern birds. Archaeopteryx lived during the Jurassic period alongside such dinosaurs as stegosaurus, diplodocus and the ever popular allosaurus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as Morgan was walking, she saw her live-in boyfriend, Bruno, sleeping on his job as a janitor again. \"Excuse me, folks,\" said Morgan with a sigh. \"This will only take a moment.\" Morgan walked up to Bruno and slapped him awake. Bruno mumbled and Morgan gave him a glare. \"Come on, Morgan,\" said Bruno. \"I was just resting my eyes.\" \"Dammit, Bruno,\" whispered Morgan. \"I got you this job because I thought you could handle it.\" Bruno let out a scoff. \"Come on, Morgan. I am totally serious.\" Morgan just let out a sigh and slapped herself in the face. \"Just make sure this place is spotless and don't damage anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan may have been very smart when it came to dinosaurs and paleontology but she had poor taste when it came to boyfriends. The fact was that Bruno was a total deadbeat. He couldn't hold a job and was very lazy. It was a wonder what she saw in him. Morgan walked away as her boyfriend was muttering to himself. \"Some girlfriend,\" he muttered to himself. \"You would think the museum curator would get me a better job than janitor. I'll never make it big by sweeping up after a bunch of million year old skeletons. There's gotta be an easier way to make a living.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when Bruno overheard a conversation. In the next room was Maya, one of Morgan's coworkers. She was working in the back room with a vial of a strange pink liquid. \"If Morgan knew what I was putting together, she would can me for sure. The museum isn't getting the attendance that it used to. Which is why this vial will be the key to creating an actual living breathing dinosaur.\" Bruno's eyes popped upon hearing it. From the looks of it, Maya was working on creating a dinosaur from DNA. \"Overnight,\" said Maya. \"This will turn into a dinosaur egg, if undisturbed that is. Of course, I know how to avoid any unnecessary trouble.\" Maya held up what looked like the skull of a baby triceratops. She then heard a strange noise and went to investigate, leaving the vial unguarded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruno smirked and seizing opportunity, ran off and took the vial of the pink liquid and gave a laugh. \"Maya,\" he said. \"Your triceratops in a bottle is going to make me very rich.\" Bruno laughed as he held the vial and when Morgan wasn't looking, he ran off the museum premises and back to their house. Well, more accurately it was Morgan's house. Bruno however, moved in after being evicted from his own apartment. He smiled and put the vial in the fridge. \"An actual triceratops. That should be worth a fortune. Now, should I sell it to a zoo or a circus once it's ready.\" Of course, you would realize that by putting the vial in the refrigerator, Bruno wasn't that smart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat also wasn't smart was that he didn't lock the door and Morgan found that out as she took her break. She saw the door unlocked and gave an annoyed look. \"Bruno,\" she grunted. \"He skipped work again. If he weren't my boyfriend, he'd be so fired.\" Morgan let out a sigh. \"Now calm down. Maybe one day he'll grow up. Yeah right, fat chance Morgan.\" Morgan fixed herself a sandwich before she noticed the vial of pink triceratops DNA. Of course, Morgan didn't know what it was. \"I thought we were all out of pink lemonade.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any idea of what that pink slime would turn her into, the bespectacled blonde museum curator drank the vial with her lunch and then returned to her post at the museum, not noticing purplish pink scales that were growing on her now expanding backside. Morgan then felt something on her nose. \"Is that a pimple?\" she asked. It was too early to tell, but what was growing on Morgan's nose was not a pimple, because two more of that exact same growth were growing on both sides of her forehead.</span></div></div>",

Morgan failed to notice that as she was walking down the hallway of the museum, she appeared to be slowly growing taller and her ass appeared to be getting bigger, to the point where her underwear was clearly visible. It was there Bruno came by and realized something. \"Hey, Morgan,\" he said. \"I think your butt is getting bigger.\" Morgan glared at her boyfriend and then slapped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jerk,\" said Morgan. \"I'm beginning to wonder why I don't just dump him.\" Then Morgan saw Maya looking around. \"Where is it?\" asked Maya. \"Where is it?\" \"Where is what?\" asked Morgan. Maya froze and turned to see Morgan and at this point, the \"pimple\" on Morgan's nose had turned into a horn and Maya's skin was turning a light pink color. Maya gasped and then looked to see Morgan had doubled in weight and her jeans were coming apart. Maya then bit her lips. \"Oh, nothing Morgan, nothing.\" Morgan just walked away and scratched her head and grunted because she pricked her fingers. Those two other \"pimples\" on her forehead appeared to have turned into long horns and Morgan's body had completely turned pink and scaly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan scratched her head again and then walked past an allosaurus skeleton but then gasped because she was actually taller than the skeleton. \"That's odd,\" she said. \"That skeleton is 16ft tall, how could I...\" Morgan realized she was 20-feet tall and then looked down but couldn't see her feet past her large 22-foot wide belly. Speaking of which, her feet burst out of her shoes to reveal that her feet had become large flat feet like a prehistoric herbivore. She then saw she had a large tail and that her butt was 24-feet wide. Morgan gasped and looked into a mirrored window to see that she was now a gigantic and obese pink-skinned triceratops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then bit her lip that had turned into a beak as her face had fully turned into a triceratops face. \"This has Bruno written all over it.\" She mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

She saw the next tour group and for the most part, they were surprised to see such a large anthropomorphic dinosaur right in front of them. Morgan bit her beaked lips rather nervously. \u201cTerrific.\u201d She moaned to herself. The crowd had mixed opinions. Several children were looking in awe at the huge dinosaur lady while one woman looked in distress to see her son looking at Morgan. \u201cRiley,\u201d said the woman. \u201cStand back from that creature. It could be dangerous.\u201d However, a couple of teenagers took photographs of Morgan with their cell phone while one middle-aged man let out a scoff. \u201cAre you kidding me. That has got to be the cheesiest looking costume I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d The man stomped up to Morgan and pulled on her beak as Morgan grunted in pain. \u201cSee, it\u2019s just a mask. I can see the leather and everything.\u201d However, the man was having a hard time trying to pull off Morgan\u2019s nose horn, prompting Morgan to snort him into the ground. The man was now convinced that Morgan was a real<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t panic,\u201d said Morgan nervously. \u201cI mean you no harm. I just for some reason was transformed into a dinosaur because of something that probably has to do with my soon-to-be ex-boyfriend. In case anyone is concerned, the dinosaurs I\u2019ve turned into is the triceratops, scientific name <i>Triceratops Horridus</i>, an herbivore.\u201d Morgan smiled nervously before thinking to herself. \u201cAlthough I am currently thinking of swallowing Bruno whole after he mutated me. \u201cThe name, Triceratops translates to \u201cthree-horned face\u201d. In fact, this will be a perfect way to start our tour. Follow me.\u201d Morgan stomped down the museum hallway and although some members of the crowd were reluctant, they all followed after the triceratops curator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe triceratops was a very massive dinosaur that reached a length of up to 30ft and a weight of up to 19,000lbs.\u201d \u201cLady,\u201d said one teenager in the crowd. \u201cYou definitely look more than 19,000lbs.\u201d Morgan gave the young man a glare to force him to be quiet before she continued. \u201cThe horns of the triceratops are made out of keratin, the same substance that makes up our finger and toenails and the triceratops\u2019s heavy head required its tail to be just as heavy as the skull. To demonstrate this, Morgan slammed her new tail on the ground to shake the floor, with one teenage girl spilling her soda all over herself. \u201cOkay,\u201d thought Morgan to herself. \u201cSo I\u2019m a giant fat triceratops. Maybe I can get used to it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe triceratops giantess cleared her throat as she walked up towards several skeletons that looked similar to herself (albeit without human DNA to make them walk upright. \u201cThe triceratops belonged to the suborder, Ceratopsia, a suborder of dinosaurs known for their large and horned heads with beaked noses. Here are a few of the triceratops\u2019s relatives.\u201d As Morgan was explaining, a little girl and boy in the crowd noticed her tail moving back and forth and let out a laugh as they decided to have some fun. \u201cFirst,\u201d said Morgan. \u201cThis specimen is called Chasmosaurus, name meaning \u201copening lizard\u201d for chasms on its forehead. Chasmosaurus males used their large frilled heads to attract mates and fight for dominance, much like modern hippopotami or stag beetles.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan then walked up towards the next skeleton as the girl and boy climbed up her tail. \u201cThis creature is called Styracosaurus, \u201cspiked lizard\u201d because its head had more spiked armor than other ceratopsians. Notice the protective spikes over the eyes. Also notice the tyrannosaurus-killing horn at the front of the nose. At 3ft long, the Styracosaurus\u2019s nose horn was the longest of any dinosaur.\u201d \u201cAnd your butt is the largest of any dinosaur.\u201d Said that same teenager from earlier. Morgan then stomped the ground and roared at the heckler to make him back off. \u201cIt is believed that Styracosaurus lived in herds like modern mammals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan then walked up to a third skeleton as the girl and boy had climbed up to her neck area. \u201cShe sure is big.\u201d Said the girl. \u201cWhat do you expect?\u201d asked the boy. \u201cShe\u2019s a dinosaur. And a very funny one.\u201d \u201cNow,\u201d said Morgan as she held up a rather small skeleton that looked liked it had a parrot-like face. \u201cFinally, this oddball is called Psittacosaurus, \u201cparrot lizard\u201d, a runt compared of its larger cousins but it was a more early creature that gave rise to giants. The creatures beak was used to snap through branches and because it was so small, it was said to walk on its hindlegs. These creatures were very common in what is now Asia and it\u2019s believed that they only lived for 10 years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Morgan grunted. \u201cWhat the?!\u201d muttered the triceratops girl as she felt a slight pain in her back. The girl and boy from early had climbed over the giantess\u2019s head and and were giggling as each grabbed one of the horns on Morgan\u2019s forehead as Morgan shook her head about. \u201cCool. I can see the whole museum from here.\u201d \u201cMs. Triceratops, are there any other creatures like you?\u201d \u201cThat I doubt.\u201d Muttered a very annoyed Morgan. The kids\u2019 mother spotted them on Morgan\u2019s head and gasped. \u201cRiley! Kira! Get down from there! You\u2019re going to get hurt!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan just let out a sigh as the kids kept riding on her swaying head. \u201cNote to self,\u201d thought the huge triceratops to herself. \u201cWhat to do later: Step 1) Dump Bruno, Step 2) Fire Bruo, Step 3) <i>Eat</i> Bruno.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Of course, she was more than happy that the children playing on her head had left and let out a sigh as she shook her head and walked down the hallway, the ground echoing with every step of her massive feet. \u201cI need something to eat.\u201d She said. Morgan remembered a nearby vending machine and because she couldn\u2019t reach her wallet over her titanic ass, she decided to screw it and smash the snack machine open with her large head before stuffing herself with candy bars and potato chips. As the triceratops was snacking, she noticed that she had another growth spurt. She was now 35ft tall with a 40ft wide belly and 45ft wide ass and a pair of H-cup breasts. \u201cThis is not happening,\u201d said Morgan. \u201cThis definitely cannot be happening. It has to be a nightmare. I\u2019m sure that this is the result of one of Bruno\u2019s get-rich-quick schemes but how. I know there\u2019s no way he has the brains to be able to do something like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Morgan was trying to figure out what was going on, she heard the sound of somebody dropping something and then turned around to see that Maya was looking up at her and staring. \u201cOh my gosh!\u201d yelled Maya. \u201cMorgan? Is that you?\u201d Morgan was at this point so big that one of her toenails was slightly bigger than Maya. The triceratops stared down at her friend who looked more astonished than afraid of her. \u201cMaya,\u201d said Morgan. \u201cI... I can\u2019t explain. Look. I don\u2019t know how, but I\u2019ve been transmogrified into a mutated triceratops and not only am I gradually getting bigger, I\u2019m also gaining a rather large amount of weight. I look more like a Thanksgiving balloon than a dinosaur. I don\u2019t know how it happened. Is this one of those Franz Kafka stories? Because it isn\u2019t funny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya of course realized that something was very wrong with her boss and knew exactly what could\u2019ve caused such a strange transformation. \u201cMorgan,\u201d said Maya nervously. \u201cDid you eat or drink anything unusual earlier?\u201d \u201cI just had my usual lunch; bacon, lettuce and turkey. Okay, so maybe I went overboard with the lettuce but that probably had to do with my new herbivorous DNA. I washed it down with some pink lemonade I found in the fridge.\u201d \u201cPink lemonade?!\u201d yelled Maya. \u201cOh no. That wasn\u2019t lemonade, Morgan. It was the culture fluid I was using to try and create a dinosaur egg cloned from triceratops DNA.\u201d \u201cWhat?!\u201d yelled Morgan. \u201cYou were trying to clone a dinosaur. How stupid can you be. Didn\u2019t you watch Jurassic Park!?\u201d \u201cI did. That\u2019s why I used an herbivorous dinosaur. I\u2019m not stupid.\u201d \u201cWhy were you trying to do an irresponsible thing like that? You know, I really don\u2019t want to know. I\u2019m guessing since I drank your serum before it could turn into a dinosaur egg, it turned me into a dinosaur.\u201d \u201cBut how did it get into your fridge?\u201d asked Maya. Morgan grit her beak. \u201cBruno,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sure of it. Obviously he saw an opportunity to get rich and seized it. This is worse than the time I had to bail him out of jail for selling the neighbor\u2019s cats as baby manticores.\u201d Morgan was so mad that she stomped her foot on the ground and cracked the floor. \u201cI\u2019m through dealing with Bruno\u2019s screw ups this time. This time I\u2019m going to dump him.... once my stomach acids have finished breaking him down!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya was really horrified at that threat. \u201cMorgan. You\u2019re an herbivore, remember.\u201d Morgan then lowered her head and snorted into Maya\u2019s face. \u201cDon\u2019t think that I\u2019ve forgotten that you\u2019re partially to blame for this. I\u2019ll give you 30 seconds to give me a damn good reason why I shouldn\u2019t fire your tiny ass. 29... 28... 27...\u201d Maya knew that she was in hot water. She had her colossal mutated triceratops boss staring down at her menacingly. Not only was she in danger of being fired, but Morgan was so big at this point she could swallow her whole without even feeling it. \u201cThink of the benefits of being a dinosaur. You won\u2019t have to take the car to work. You won\u2019t even need a car anymore.\u201d \u201c26... 25... 24.\u201d Counted Morgan more menacingly than before. \u201cMorgan! Be reasonable! Nobody will try to mug you anymore! Maybe you can get a job on P...\u201d \u201c23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18.\u201d Counted Morgan quicker than before as she then proceeded to grab Maya and hold her like a doll. She even opened her mouth to give Maya a view of her humongous teeth. Sure, they were herbivorous teeth, but Maya was legitimately afraid that Morgan would eat her just to calm her nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12!\u201d \u201cMorgan!\u201d \u201c10... 9... 8.... 7....\u201d \u201cWhat about the museum!\u201d yelled Maya. \u201cI did it for the museum.\u201d \u201c6,\u201d muttered a now very interested Morgan. \u201c5...\u201d \u201cThink about it,\u201d said Morgan. \u201cThis is just what we need to increase our number of visitors. What better way to get people hooked on dinosaurs. They loved you back there as a prehistoric tour guide. This way you can be the museum\u2019s curator and mascot at the same time.\u201d Now, Morgan didn\u2019t necessarily like that idea but Maya did have a point. People couldn\u2019t help but stop and stare at a real life dinosaur in the museum and while the kids climbing up on her irked her, the giant mutated curator realized that the museum had nothing left to lose.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan put Maya down on the ground and let out a snort. \u201cThis idea of yours had better work, Maya,\u201d said the triceratops giantess. \u201cI really don\u2019t like any plan that makes me a spectacle but if it double attendance, I guess I can make it work. Just don\u2019t you dare try to make any more homegrown dinosaurs. I don\u2019t feel like having more giants like me roaming a....\u201d Before Morgan could finish her sentence, she heard a rather loud ripping sound and then she turned her head around to see that her jeans had fallen off of her giant prehistoric rear and her panties appeared to be falling apart as well. The ceratopsian colossus blushed before she tried to cover her rear with her hands in case anybody saw her. \"Maya!\" shouted Morgan. \"Now, now, now, Morgan,\" said Maya. \"Don't panic.\" \"Don't panic? I'm a triceratops, I'm the size of a house and I'm fat, I can't walk around naked. Then people will <i>really</i> be staring at me.\" \"I have an idea.\" However, Morgan gave a snort as she lowered her horned nose in front of her friend. \"If it involves a Power Rangers costume, you can already start looking for another job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Maya had dressed Morgan up in a skin-tight leotard designed to look like dinosaur bones. the black and white skeletal design contrasted with her purplish pink scaly skin. \u201cSo?\u201d asked Maya. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Morgan let out a sigh. \u201cWell at least my naked pink ass isn\u2019t showing... too much. I really hope this is worth the utter embarrassment. I mean, a 35ft tall sumo-sized blonde triceratops in glasses is not something you see everyday.\u201d That was when Morgan heard a loud crash and turned around to see Bruno had slipped on one of the dents left into the floor by Morgan\u2019s enormous footsteps. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d asked Bruno. \u201cDarn kids. I really hope that Morgan doesn\u2019t expect me to clean up this mess.\u201d Morgan was instantly filled with rage at the sight of her boyfriend, having recently learned that her transformation was completely his fault. \u201cBruno!\u201d yelled the triceratops rather angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruno then looked up and was at first horrified but then he recognized the giant fat triceratops lady as Morgan. \u201cOh,\u201d said Bruno. \u201cMorgan. You look... different. Did you do something with your hair.\u201d \u201cYOU did something with my body! What kind of idiot leaves mutagenic primordial ooze in the fridge!\u201d \u201cWhat?! You drank my dinosaur? I was going to sell it to a zoo.\u201d Maya gave a glare Bruno\u2019s way and Bruno realized that he was in big trouble. The scoundrel tried to get away but Morgan kept placing her enormous feet in the way of his escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Morgan stared down at Bruno and wagged her tail. \"You will be extremely lucky if I just decide to dump you after this. I've dealt with your screwups before, Bruno, but this time you've gone too far. Thanks to your irresponsibility I am going to be a triceratops for the rest of my life.\" \"Now don't blow your top, Morgan,\" said Bruno. \"You make a very sexy triceratops. And with how big the rest of your body is, it makes that fat ass you always had a lot less noticeable.\" Bruno chose the wrong choice of words and Morgan let out an angry growl before grabbing her boyfriend and making him yell. She snorted in his face and then gave a smirk. \"I'll decide whether or not I'll dump you later, but I have another tour to give in three hours. Until then, you're going to spend those hours....\"</span></div></div>",

The old man adjusts his glasses to study the formula more closely. \"For thirteen long years they've mocked me,\" the man said. \"For too long have I have been shunned for my beliefs, they all thought I was insane. The university, my employers and even my stupid ex-wife! But I'm going to show them. I, Dr. Dwight Harbinger, will resurrect the long extinct.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before Dr. Harbinger could say another word, he heard a knock at the door. The mad doctor let out a grunt and walked out. \"Idiot, neighbors,\" he said. \"Do they not understand I am making history. Keep your shorts on! I'm coming.\" Dr. Harbinger opened the door to see a taller young man with pale strawberry blonde hair and glasses. The sight of this young man somewhat irked the doctor. \"What are you dong here, Jerry?\" \"I see you've been working without sleep in that lab of yours again, Dad,\" said Jerry. \"You're going to blow yourself up one day with those crazy experiments.\" \"Fool!\" yelled Dr. Harbinger. \"I have been making history.\" \"I know, I know. Trying to resurrect dead species through DNA experiments. Dad, you've been cooped up in that lab for thirteen years and you haven't had much success. I hope you've been remembering to pay the bills. Your landlord is going to kill you.\" But Harbinger shrugged his son's comment off. \"What are you doing here anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" said Jerry. \"My wife and I were in town and we thought we should...\" \"Wife?! Since when are you married?\" \"Since six months ago. You were invited to the wedding. Burgess! You haven't been reading your mail have you.\" \"Why should I?\" asked Dr. Harbinger. \"Nothing but junk anyway.\" \"Wow,\" said a female voice. \"You were right, he is uptight.\" Dr. Harbinger turned his head to see that his daughter-in-law was an African American woman with long black hair that had crimson highlights and had a tattoo of a talon of some sort on her shoulder. Dr. Harbinger looked in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad,\" said Jerry. \"This is Sora. It's about time you caught up with current events.\" Dr. Harbinger grumbled as he inspected Sora. Sora just looked in concern. \"You look absolutely terrible. When was the last time you got any sunlight?\" \"That stuff is bad for you,\" said Dr. Harbinger. \"You're just asking for skin cancer.\" \"I was just saying. Ugh, what smells like sulfur and primordial ooze.\" \"If you must know,\" said Dr. Harbinger. \"I am moments away from my greatest triumph ever. I would appreciate it, if you two would leave me alone.\" The mad scientist stomped back into his lab as Jerry let out a sigh. \"He's at it again.\" \"At what again?\" asked Sora. \"Well,\" said Jerry. \"For thirteen years, Dad has been trying to find a way to use DNA to resurrect extinct animal species.\" Sora actually seemed curious at that. \"You're kidding. That sounds amazing. You mean like dinosaurs.\" \"Not exactly,\" said Jerry. \"He's been probing at a pterodactyl's egg for some time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora was confused. \"I thought pterodactyls were...\" \"No, pterosaurs are not the same as dinosaurs. Dad told me that a long time ago. That was before he lost his mind.\" Sora nodded her head. At that time, in Dr. Harbinger's lab, he had finished his formula. \"Yes,\" he said. \"Yes. I've done it. I've created an egg cell that will actually bring life to a new pterodactyl. All I need is the right female body to act as an incubator.\" That's when Dr. Harbinger looked into the next room at his daughter-in-law as a fiendish idea cracked in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, when Jerry and Sora were asleep, Dr. Harbinger snuck into the guest room and had placed the egg cell into a syringe as he walked up to the sleeping Sora. He uncovered her and saw her naked form and his chance to put his experiment in action. He inoculated Sora and then walked away knowing that she carried the egg cell that he hoped would resurrect the pterodactyl from extinction. However, as Sora was asleep, the egg cell that her father-in-law placed inside of her, suddenly popped and broke. You would think that it was a sign that the experiment failed. You'd be correct. However, it would still give way to resurrection of the most terrifying kind.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Inside of Sora's body, the broken eggshell leaked primordial ooze throughout her cells and her DNA strands were glowing as her heart was beating faster and her skeleton started to throb and sprouting strange veins. As this was going on, Sora was having night terrors and the dark-skinned woman was sweating heavily in her sleep before she burst up and gasped as she held her chest. She saw the vials and blueprints and equations littered all over the walls and even saw smoke leaking out in the hallways. While her husband was used to Dr. Harbinger's strange experiments, she could not get used to staying with her mad scientist father-in-law and got up to walk into the halls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora was panting and even coughed as the smoke was filling the air. She could barely breathe and held her neck before making her way, still naked, into the kitchen. \"Drink,\" she said. \"I need something to drink.\" But when Sora opened Dwight's fridge, she saw various vials that were filled with strange liquids and one bottle that even appeared to have a lump of dinosaur flesh inside it. She gagged at what she saw. \"This stuff doesn't look fit for human consumption. Ugh. Now calm down, Sora. You've been living with Jerry for six months and everything has been fine. It's just that your new father-in-law is a total FREAK! I wouldn't be too surprised if he conducted experiments on me in my sleep.\" Sora then coughed again and held her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really need to get something to drink,\" the African American girl said to herself. \"But I'm not taking my chances with Dwight's poisons. I saw a vending machine down the street. Maybe a good Coke will calm my nerves.\" Sora was just out the door when she realized she was naked and covered herself. Sora then spotted her coat and put it on before she ran out down the street before she approached the vending machine. She reached into her coat for her wallet and took out a dollar but then she realized that her fingernails looked really sharp. \"Geez,\" she said. \"I need a manicure worst than I thought.\" But Sora didn't notice anything out of the ordinary, not even the fact that she was currently standing 8ft tall and her butt had expanded to six feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Sora had her soda, she begun to drink it and was going to walk away but then heard a crashing sound. She turned around in shock at both how huge her butt had grown and at the fact that it had broken the vending machine and made bottles of soda fall out.\" Sora then felt her coat coming apart and gasped. She was frantically running down the street. \"Oh man,\" said Sora. \"The last thing I need is to be arrested for streaking. But what's going on. How come I'm getting so... ugh!\" Sora held her stomach and felt that it was getting bigger because it was now 10ft wide as her breasts became D-cups. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora then gasped and then felt her head in pain because it was changing shape. She sprouted a large yellow horn in the center of her head as her mouth stretched out into a large yellow beak and her skin turned as crimson as the streaks in her hair. Then she sprouted large light purple membranes under her arms that revealed themselves to be wings as her feet turned into talons and her fingers turned into claws. \"What is happening to me?\" asked Sora as white stripes appeared on her thick legs. Sora then flapped her new wings and was flying in the air as she continued to grow and grow. With how monstrously obese she was getting, Sora was surprised to know that she was actually capable of flight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Sora's transformation was complete, she was a 45ft tall pterodactyl with a 75ft belly, a 55ft butt, thick thighs that looked ten times thicker than any drumstick and a 150ft wingspan. Sora let out a shriek as she hovered in the air. \"I am a giant, fat, reptile,\" she said to herself. \"The only consolation is that I can fly. That's a plus, right. How did this.\" That's when Sora realized something and was filled with rage. \"Dwight! That sick freak mutated me! I am going to have a long and vicious talk with my husband about this father-in-law of mine. I'm going to...\" Sora's stomach rumbled and she let out a roar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant sumo-sized pterodactyl girl then flew off in order to find...</span></div></div>",

As she was flying, there was a college-aged stoner looking out of a convenience store when he looked up and gasped at the pterodactyl flying overhead. The young man hesitated but he took out his iPhone to take a photograph of Sora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Sora didn't even have time to think about whether or not somebody saw her in her transmogrified form. She was hungry and she needed food. \"There's gotta be something yummy nearby. I have a sudden craving for meat. Hmm, maybe when this is over, I'll eat Dwight. Hmm, don't be hasty, Sora. You might be able to coerce him to undo the damage.\" Sora then spotted something in the distance. It looked like a farmhouse and as she flew overhead, she spotted several sheep bleating and licked her lips before she flew down. The sheep all spotted her and bleated in shock before they begun to run. However, the pterosaur giantess flapped her wings and shattered the fence that held the sheep in. As the sheep were trying to retreat, Sora swooped down with an open beak to swallow as many of the livestock as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was done, Sora was rubbing her stomach and then held it in pain. \"Next time,\" she said as she felt her huge, bloated, pulsating gut. \"Chew and then swallow. Ugh. Why did it have to be sheep. Mouton always did give me gas. But I guess giant mutated reptiles that can fly can't be choosers.\" Sora felt her stomach again and then groaned before she flew off again. \"I better find a truck filled with antacids to swallow.\" Sora flew back into city limits and then spotted a large truck carrying seltzer when she decided to swoop down and separate the load from the truck using her claws. The truck driver grunted and gasped because he saw the pterodactyl in his side mirror and immediately hit the gas to drive away for his life as Sora made off with the seltzer. \"Okay,\" said Sora. \"Once my stomach isn't throwing a tantrum anymore, I am going to tell Jerry exactly what that father of his did to me. Ugh. You stupid sheep calm down in there or I'm going to swallow a wolf!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at Dwight's house, Jerry had woken up and was looking for Sora while Dwight was in front of the television working on some strange machine. \"Dad,\" said Jerry. \"Have you seen Sora? I suddenly woke up and she wasn't in bed with me.\" \"How do you know she's not in the bathroom?\" asked Dwight. \"I checked. She might've gone across the street for some reason or another. Doesn't she realize how dangerous the city can be at.... night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the television there was a report on that concerned Sora's activities as a pterodactyl. \"Attention all listeners,\" said the newswoman. \"We have just heard reports of a giant flying monster soaring over our big city.\" On the screen appeared the photograph of Sora that the stoner took earlier.\" \"This photograph taken by an on-the-spot witness reveals our creature to potentially be a rather overweight and voluptuous pterodactyl.\" Jerry gasped at the news report, not realizing that the pterodactyl was actually his wife. However, Dwight seemed more surprised than anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the television, the farmer whose flock was attacked appeared on the screen. \"I saw that critter. It was awful. It ate my entire flock of sheep.\" Then there was the truck driver whose truckload of seltzer was stolen by Sora. \"I barely got away with my life. That flying reptile took off with my seltzer.\" The anchorwoman nodded her head. \"People of Kansas. Beware. There is a ginormous and obese flying dinosaur with an upset stomach and it's starving.\" \"Uh,\" said the truck driver. \"Technically pterodactyls aren't dinosaurs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack home, Jerry was horrified and then put on his coat. \"Where are you going?\" asked Dwight. \"Are you kidding?!\" yelled Jerry. \"My wife is probably out there with a giant pterodactyl flying around. I gotta find her. That thing might eat her.\" Once Jerry had left, Dwight had put two and two together. \"That pterodactyl won't eat Sora. That pterodactyl was Sora. Something must've gone wrong when I put the pterodactyl egg cell in her womb and it turned into mutagen. This might actually be better than my original plan.\" With that, Dwight gave a sinister smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhose P.O.V. do we continue from?</span></div></div>",

Oh. If anything happens to my wife, I\u2019d never forgive myself.\u201d Jerry got into his car and zoomed away as Dwight was on the veranda and had his binoculars out to look for any sign of Sora. \u201cI\u2019ve been going at this the wrong way. In order to bring back the monsters of the past, I didn\u2019t have to plant a dinosaur egg in my daughter-in-law\u2019s womb. I had to turn her into an actual prehistoric beast. Hmm, this is going to make things really difficult at Thanksgiving and I\u2019ll probably face consequences from Jerry\u2019s in-laws, providing they\u2019re still alive. But it will be worth it. I\u2019ve shown that it\u2019s possible to bring the past back to life.\u201d Dwight let out a maniacal laugh before he coughed and held his chest. \u201cI wish I didn\u2019t work with so many toxic fumes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerry was driving down the street looking all around. \u201cSora! Sora! Where are you!\u201d Jerry feared the worst. Since he did not know that the pterodactyl flying around Kansas was his wife, he assumed that Sora was in danger of being eaten. \u201cWhere did that pterodactyl even come from?\u201d asked Jerry to himself. \u201cGiant flying reptiles don\u2019t just come out of thin air. I wonder. Did Dad play a role in bringing that beast to... no way. Dad may mess with a lot of dinosaur DNA, but there\u2019s no way that he\u2019d be competent enough to create a pterodactyl from scratch. Besides, if he did, it would\u2019ve only been as big as a newborn. That thing is 45ft tall with a 150ft wingspan. Do pterodactyls even get that big? No! There\u2019s no way. But this definitely isn\u2019t an ordinary pterodactyl.\u201d Jerry then stopped his car and looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw Sora flying overhead and she appeared to have gotten bigger and was carrying a truck that appeared to belong to a meat packing plant. Jerry gasped and then drove off faster. He saw that there was nobody on the streets and was growing more and more worried. \u201cI really hope that pterodactyl didn\u2019t already devour Sora. I\u2019m pretty sure if pterodactyls were alive today we\u2019d be at the bottom of the food chain.\u201d Jerry turned on his radio to see if he could find a news update on the pterodactyl that was flying around Kansas. \u201cSo far,\u201d said the voice on the radio. \u201cNo half-eaten corpses or skeletons have turned up in coprolite have turned up, so we know the pterodactyl has yet to add humans to its diet. Still, citizens of the area are advised to stay indoors.\u201d Jerry gave a sigh of relief. \u201cThank goodness. There\u2019s still a chance that I can get to Sora before that creature does.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Sora, the obese pterodactyl giantess had torn open the back of the truck with her beak before she dug out all the meat and scarfed it down her big fat and greedy throat. Sora then let out a loud belch and held herself by the neck. \u201cThank goodness that came out from the attic and not the basement. I hope that greedy tummy of mine can give me a break for now.\u201d Then, Sora shrieked because she looked forward and noticed Jerry\u2019s car. \u201cI recognize that car,\u201d she said. \u201cJerry! Oh my gosh! He must\u2019ve heard that news reporter. He doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m the pterodactyl that\u2019s flying about. I\u2019ve got to stop him.\u201d Sora flapped her wings and panted as she took off again and lifted her hulk up into the air. \u201cFlying isn\u2019t as hard as I thought it would be,\u201d she said to herself. \u201cBut with this girth and ass, takeoff is backbreaking labor.\u201d Sora shrieked and continued to fly towards her husband\u2019s car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerry was looking all around for his wife and bit his lip. He took out his cellphone and shook it. \u201cI know I shouldn\u2019t do this when I\u2019m driving but...\u201d Jerry then gasped. Before he could even think about pushing any buttons on his cell phone, he looked into his side mirror to see the colossal pterodactyl SSBBW flying after him as she shrieked. Jerry screamed and sped up as Sora flew after him. \u201cJerry!\u201d yelled Sora. \u201cWait! It\u2019s me!\u201d But Jerry couldn\u2019t hear Sora from so far away and forced the pterodactyl to fly lower. In the process, Sora\u2019s hips brushed against several buildings and caused them to crack slightly. \u201cJerry!\u201d yelled Sora. \u201cStop the car!\u201d Unfortunately for Sora, Jerry couldn\u2019t hear his wife and kept driving and hit the gas. This provoked the pterodactyl giantess into flying forward and then flapping her wings to tip the car before she swooped down and grabbed it by the trunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerry looked out the window and his jaw dropped upon seeing the pterodactyl he had no idea was his wife as she was shrieking. \u201cNo way!\u201d yelled Jerry. \u201cI\u2019m not on the menu tonight!\u201d Jerry quickly unbuckled his seatbelt and jumped out of the car as Sora turned her head. Jerry landed on his feet and ran off as Sora dropped the car on the ground and then flew in front of her husband and landed on the ground with a boom. Jerry froze in fear as Sora stared down at him. He tried to back away but the enormous sumo-sized flying lizard held out her wings in order to block his path. Jerry took out a can of mace and sprayed Sora in the eye as she shrieked in pain. \"Stay away from me, you monster! I'm not letting you find my wife!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora moaned and held her eye. \"Jerry! It's me! I <i>am</i> your wife!\" Jerry gasped and stepped back. \"You... you... just talked. How could...?\" \"Jerry,\" said Sora. \"I'm Sora.\" \"That's impossible. If you're really Sora, then what is your maiden name.\" \"Shelby.\" \"What date we were married?\" \"February 17th.\" \"Who gave you away?\" \"My grandfather.\" Jerry couldn't believe it. Since those answers were true, he knew that the pterodactyl in fact had to be Sora. \"Sora? What happened to...?\" Jerry then realized exactly what was going on and he was savage. \"Dad! He must've been experimenting on you when you were asleep. I'll ****ing kill him! Using his own daughter-in-law as a lab rat.\" Sora gave a shriek. \"You're gonna have to get in line behind me. If he doesn't have a way to change me back, I'm going to tear him to shreds!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerry then turned to see several overturned food trucks and then stared at Sora who could only blush in embarrassment (no that it was completely visible on her dark reddish skin). \"Don't judge me,\" she said. \"I was hungry.\" Jerry poked his wife in the stomach. \"All brides let themselves go eventually. It's a really good thing that this didn't happen indoors.\" Sora gave a nervous laugh at that and then let out a shriek because she heard sirens. Jerry turned his head and saw several police cars coming forward. \"Oh no.\" He groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut came a S.W.A.T. team that was pointing their weapons at Sora, forcing the pterodactyl to curl up her wings in fear. \"Back away from that dangerous creature, sir,\" said the leader of the S.W.A.T. team. \"We've come to destroy this pterodactyl before it becomes a major threat.\" Sora shrieked in fear but Jerry held out his arms. \"She's not dangerous. This pterodactyl is my wife! She's harmless.\" The S.W.A.T. officers were so confused that they lowered their weapons. \"Your wife? You're not serious are you? She's a dinosaur.\" \"First of all,\" said Jerry. \"She's not a dinosaur, she's a pterodactyl. Second of all, she wasn't a pterodactyl when I married her. My father did this to her. My name is Jerry Harbinger and....\" \"Harbinger?\" asked the S.W.A.T. leader. \"As in Dr. Dwight Harbinger? The disgraced paleontologist? We've got several complaints from his neighbors about the noise from his experiments. We always thought he was a harmless kook, but this, this is just going too far. It's time we had a little talk with Mr. Mad Doctor. As for you, Mr. Harbinger, I'd advise your wife to be more careful about her appetite. This is Kansas. People might not understand a pterodactyl flying around looking for food. Good night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe police drove off and Sora uncurled her wings as she let out a sigh. \"Damn,\" she said. \"I thought for sure I'd wind up extinct all over again. Jerry, what do you think those police are going to do about your father.\" Jerry shook his head. \"I don't know, but I don't think that it will be pleasant. What if he doesn't know how to turn you back?\" Sora shrieked in horror and then flapped her wings. \"Easy, girl!\" yelled Jerry. \"Easy!\" Sora then grabbed her husband by the shirt with her beak and then tossed him onto her back. Jerry had to step on the rolls of lard on the pterodactyl's back right before she started to fly up into the air. Jerry looked down and then grabbed on tight to Sora's hair as the prehistoric giantess flew higher and higher. \"What are you doing?! Oh my. How are you flying? From my position you should be too fat and heavy to get off the....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora glared at her husband. \"One more crack about my weight and I swear that I'm going to drop you.\" Jerry zipped his lips right before Sora flew over the skyscrapers and right over the police vehicles. \"Where are you going... Honey?\" asked Jerry to his monstrous wife. The pterodactyl gave a shriek. \"I'm going to pay that father of yours a visit. Why should the police be the only ones to tear him limb from limb for this atrocity. Don't try and talk me out of this. I'm going to show him why you don't turn beauty into the beast and get away with it.\" Sora flew down and Jerry held on tight as he saw his wife flying. \"Well,\" he said. \"At least we won't need to buy plane tickets to go to Paris.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora flew down in front of Dwight's apartment and bangs on the wall. \"Dwight! I'd like to have a word with you, you old bastard!\"</span></div></div>",

He said so himself.\u201d Victor then heard a loud belch. \u201cHey barkeep!\u201d yelled a female voice. \u201cAnother round here! Victor is paying!\u201d Victor let out a groan. He had made the mistake of bringing his girlfriend Veronica with him. The woman was the biggest alcoholic ever met. In fact, it was a wonder that she hadn\u2019t died of alcohol poisoning by now. Not to mention she was between jobs, so Victor was usually stuck paying for it. Sure, he could avoid it, being the regional manager of a major chemical company, but he still didn\u2019t like it. He had tried time and time again to get her to stop drinking but it was to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when a mysterious man in a white coat encountered Victor. He appeared to have yellow eyes and a completely shadowed out face. \u201cWhat took you so long?\u201d asked Victor. \u201cMy boss wants that... ooze you said it was.\u201d \u201cPrimordial ooze,\u201d said the man in a surprisingly high-pitched voice. \u201cA mysterious slime that existed from the time of dinosaurs, a slime that might hold the keys to evolution itself.\u201d Victor gave a gulp at the dealer. \u201cYou know,\u201d he said. \u201cI really don\u2019t know if that stuff is safe. It\u2019s a million years old and it might be unstable. But I\u2019m just the regional manager and I\u2019m only supposed to do what the boss says.\u201d The dealer then gave a hiss as he held out a bottle of the primordial ooze and Victor looked at it. But then the dealer pulled the ooze away and glared. \u201cYou have the money?\u201d Victor handed the dealer a suitcase and the dealer quickly looked through all the cash. The dealer hissed and then nodded his head. Then he disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictor was actually surprised to see this happen. \u201cI hope I know what I\u2019m getting into.\u201d That was when Victor heard a loud sound that sounded a lot like glass breaking and saw Veronica glaring at a man sipping a drink with a straw as she held her head in pain. \u201cHey, you jerk! Quiet down! My head feels like it's about to blow!\u201d Victor let out a sigh. \"Why did I bring her here, again?\" he asked himself. Veronica then grabbed a jar of pickle juice and drank it before gagging. \"What kind of beer is this?\" \"That's pickle juice,\" said the bartender. \"Not beer.\" \"You trying to poison me?!\" yelled Veronica. \"Ouch! Just get me another glass.\" Victor walked up to Veronica as she held her head. \"Hey, Vick,\" said Veronica. \"Would you believe the gall of these people. I'm here with a painful headache and they're making noise like it's the apocalypse around here.\" Veronica let out a few hiccups and Victor let out a groan. This was something that happened a lot between him and Veronica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVeronica,\u201d said Victor. \u201cYou have got to stop drinking.

However, it turned out to be the primordial ooze that Victor had on the bar counter. Victor gasped as he realized exactly what Veronica was doing. \u201cVeronica! Don\u2019t do it!\u201d But Veronica drank the ooze and didn\u2019t seem to register that it wasn\u2019t alcohol and then she let out a large belch. \u201cThis is good stuff. You think they have any more?\u201d Victor just bit his lip nervously. \u201cI doubt that,\u201d he said. \u201cI really do.\u201d Victor then gave a gulp. He had no idea what that primordial ooze would do to his girlfriend but it didn\u2019t seem to affect her appetite for alcohol. Victor could only bite his fingers.</span></div></div>",

You drank something I don\u2019t think you should\u2019ve. We need to get you to a hospital.\u201d \u201cMy liver is in the best shape of its life, Vick, Go shang a halami.\u201d Veronica hiccuped again and swayed from side to side. \u201cFor some raisin I feel like I could take the Elite Four and Seven Samurai.\u201d Victor shook his head. There was just no reasoning with Veronica when she got this drunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeronica then felt her stomach rumbling. \u201cOh my,\u201d she said. \u201cLooks like vodka and sake are two great tastes that don\u2019t really go well with each other.\u201d Veronica heard her stomach rumble again. \u201cOh,\u201d said Veronica. \u201cWhat did I drink? That new beer really isn\u2019t sitting well.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s because it wasn\u2019t beer, you drunken idiot,\u201d said Victor. \u201cThat was primordial ooze, an untested and mysterious slime from when dinosaurs walked the Earth.\u201d \u201cOh well,\u201d said Veronica with a loud hiccup. \u201cThey say good alcohol gets better with age.\u201d Victor slapped himself in the face and shook his head. Then he heard a crashing sound. Veronica had collapsed to the ground and Victor let out a sigh. \u201cThis is the part that I always hate.\u201d Victor then bent over to try and pick his drunken girlfriend up. Then Victor gave a moan. \u201cGeez,\u201d he said. \u201cHas she been putting on weight or something. What\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Victor held up Veronica, he grunted because she seemed to be getting heavier and heavier. \u201cWhat the?\u201d asked Victor. That was when Victor saw that Veronica\u2019s ass had expanded to the width of a bus and her belly had gotten bigger as well, to the point where Victor had no choice but to drop his girlfriend. Veronica\u2019s skin had changed colors, Her back had become grayish blue and her belly and front neck along with her face had turned bright yellow as a giant red crest sprouted out of her forehead. Veronica moaned and then stood up to reveal she was three times as tall as Victor and her cargo pants had shrunken to a thong and her thighs got bigger. Veronica let out a yawn and then she sprouted a very long tail while her neck stretched out and her face turned into a snout while her teeth turned sharp. Victor stepped back as Veronica stumbled drunkenly down the street and then he looked to see that his girlfriend had somehow mutated into a humanoid brachiosaurus. \u201cThe ooze!\u201d yelled Victor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each step, Veronica got bigger and fatter and would no doubt weigh 1000lbs if she wasn\u2019t currently 80ft high (not counting her neck). \u201cI can\u2019t believe it,\u201d said Victor. \u201cMy girlfriend is a dinosaur.

Besides. I\u2019m sick of being the quiet, stay-at-home housewife. I\u2019m going to be kicking butt and saving lives.\u201d Phillip and Selene\u2019s pet Dalmatian dog came in and barked as he waved his tail and rubbed his head against Selene. Selene smiled and then petted the dog on the head. \u201cDon\u2019t worry Wildfire,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything will be alright. What can happen? And you don\u2019t worry either, Phillip. I\u2019m perfectly capable of taking care of myself.\u201d Of course, Phillip wasn\u2019t one-hundred percent sure of that and gulped. \u201cI hope so.\u201d He said. With that, Selene kissed her husband and went out to walk to the firehouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Selene reached the firehouse, she heard sirens blaring and the fire chief spotted her. \u201cMrs. Strange,\u201d he said. \u201cBetter late than never.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d asked Selene. \u201cA big fire broke out at S.K.Y. Labs. We need everyone we can get.\u201d Selene climbed up the fire truck as it was driving off. Selene knew that S.K.Y. Labs was a hi-tech laboratory that conducted all sorts of strange inventions. If a fire broke out in there, it would no doubt be trouble. She let out a gulp. \u201cI guess my first day is a trial by fire.\u201d Selene gave a nervous laugh at her own joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the fire squad arrived at S.K.Y. labs and immediately held out their hoses to try and put out the fire raging intensely. Selene ran in and used the hatchet to break through the door as she led several of the staff out. \u201cThis way!\u201d she yelled. One female assistant ran forward and up to Selene. \u201cYou have to help us! It\u2019s Professor Blum. He\u2019s trapped in room 13B.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u2019 said Selene. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m here for. As Selene came in, smoke billowed out of the laboratory and she had to duck to avoid breathing it in and crawled across the floor. It was there, she spotted room 13B. The door was stuck so Selene had to kick it down. Professor Blum was barely conscious on the ground and there was smoke in the air with flames all around. \u201cHang on, Professor,\u201d said Selene. \u201cI\u2019ll get you out of there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Selene ran up and grabbed the scientist, a shelf behind her burned to a crisp and dropped several vials that leaked strange chemicals all over the firewoman. However, Selene had to get Professor Blum out of the lab before she could even realize that she had been splashed with unknown substances. Once Selene got the Professor to safety, her fellow firefighters had doused S.K.Y. Labs with their firehoses and had completely put out the fire. Professor Blum woke up and coughed as he looked at Selene. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Professor,\u201d said Selene. \u201cYou\u2019re in good hands.\u201d Professor Blum smiled at Selene. \u201cYou are a very brave firewoman,\u201d he said. \u201cHave you been working at the station long?\u201d Selene shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s my first day.\u201d\u2028\u2028What nobody noticed, (not even Selene herself), was that there were several black spots appearing on the back of Selene\u2019s neck.</span></div></div>",

Selene just let out a sigh. \u201cIt did get rather dirty with all that smoke and dust. You should\u2019ve seen the fire at S.K.Y. Labs. I think some chemicals exploded or maybe an electric wire went haywire.\u201d \u201cOh dear,\u201d said Phillip. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d Selene let out a laugh. \u201cEverything is fine. You are so paranoid, Phillip. I can handle anything. That\u2019s why I signed up for this job in the first place.\u201d Phillip just let out a sigh at his wife\u2019s words. \u201cWell, I knew you were stubborn when I married you.\u201d Selene just let out a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Selene was speaking with Phillip, black spots were appearing all over her body, starting with her hand and then spreading all the way around her body from her face to on her rear. Speaking of which, Selene\u2019s butt started to expand as her pants were coming off. Selene heard the ripping noise and grunted. She then turned around and saw her expanding ass. \u201cWhat the?\u201d she asked. As Selene tried to pull over, she felt her belly growing as well and screamed before she stopped the firetruck and tried to get out of it. However, she instantly got stuck and grunted due to her large behind. \u201cGreat.\u201d Groaned Selene. Then Selene yelled again because from the looks of it, she was growing white fur and had sprouted a tail. She then felt her ears become floppier and her nose stretched into a snout. \u201cSelene?\u201d asked Phillip on the phone. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on there?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d yelled Selene to her husband. Selene then growled as she hear a crashing sound.<br>\r\n\u2028When Selene looked back, she saw that her massive ass had completely destroyed the fire truck from the inside. Selene grunted and then she saw that her pants had shrunk to a thong that might as well have been dental floss on her booty and her boots were coming apart as well as her jacket. Selene\u2019s fire helmet fell off of her head and she accidentally crushed it beneath her foot. Selene let out a yip as what was left of her clothes were completely torn off. The only thing left was the wedding ring on her finger. Selene looked in shock because she had turned into an obese 35ft high anthropomorphic dalmatian. \u201cHoly smokes!\u201d yelled Selene. \u201cI\u2019m huge! What the... how did... Oh my gosh! Something from that lab must\u2019ve mutated me!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Selene could think any further on the issues, she heard a loud smoke detector go off and she saw black smoke in the distance. \u201cDamn!\u201d yelled the Dalmatian giantess. Even in her transformed state, Selene was still a volunteer firefighter and there was absolutely no way that she could just sit back and ignore a fire going on. So, as fast as she could, the titanic dog begun to run and waddle towards the fire, shaking up the city as she went to put it out. \u201cThis is definitely not what I signed up for.\u201d Said Selene as she ran down the street. Down the street at the time, there was a man walking out of his apartment veranda in his underwear. \u201cAt last,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m finally cured of my irrational fear that a Dalmatian will see me in my underwear.\u201d At that moment, Selene ran by and the man looked startled to see her and nervously backed back into his apartment.</span></div></div>",

That's it, I'm calling an ambulance. She might be hurt. Oh, why did she take that volunteer firefighting job.\" As Phillip ran up to the telephone to call the hospital, there was a sudden news report on the television.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We interrupt this program to bring you an emergency news report. Not even half an hour ago, a massive fire broke out at the Free Lark apartment building when an improperly put together furnace blew and set the apartment ablaze.\" Phillip just continued to dial on the telephone as the reporter continued. We have word that the volunteer firefighters will be delayed as their firetruck has mysteriously disappeared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the television there appeared to be earthquakes and Wildfire sensed them and barked at the television. Phillip looked at the television and gasped as he dropped the phone. There was Selene in her transformed Dalmatian state rushing towards the fire on all fours. At this point her mutation had made the Dalmatian giantess 95-feet tall and had she been normal sized, she would no doubt weigh a few thousand pounds. The reporter looked in surprise herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" she yelled. \"Something is rushing up to the apartment building. It appears to be a giant overweight and strangely well-endowed Dalmatian.\" Wildfire pointed to the TV and Phillip looked to see that his dog was pointing to the ring on Selene's finger. Phillip immediately was able to recognize his wife and gasped. \"Selene?!\" he yelled in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the television, Selene spotted the burning building and inhaled deeply before blowing on it to weaken the flames. \"Wait a minute,\" said the reporter. \"From the looks of it, this giant Dalmatian is trying to put out the fire. Selene then tore into the building to reveal several tenants still trapped inside. She then held out her paw. \"Get on!\" yelled Selene. Several of the tenants hesitated, but one young girl with a doll was unafraid and walked into Selene's palm. The rest of the tenants followed before Selene took them to safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelene then smelt the fire and knew it was still burning, but she had an idea. Knowing that she had turned into a giant dog, Selene started to dig into the ground and toss dirt all over the burning apartment. The dirt managed to douse the flames and reduce them to smoke. Once the fire was out, Selene gave a smile of pride as onlookers cheered. Phillip could not believe what he was watching at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female reporter at the scene had to fix her jaw before speaking. \"Normally, giant monsters appear to cause damage and destruction and yet today we just witnessed one such bizarre creature not only refrain from destroying the city but actually save lives. Just what is this giant Dalmatian and where did it come from.\" Back home Wildfire let out a growl. \"It?\" asked Phillip. \"That's not an it, that's my wife. Something must've happened in the lab when Selene went to put out that fire. Something had to have happened. A bizarre accident probably mutated her. Oh my gosh. My wife is a giant Dalmatian. She looks like she'd be a more suitable mate for you, Wildfire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhillip got up to catch his breath and even clutched his heart at this development. \"Okay, Phillip. Calm down. Selene may be a huge and obese dog the size of a building, but she still put out that fire of her own free will. She's still a volunteer firefighter and still my wife. I just need to... oh my gosh. What <i>do</i> I do? This clearly isn't something that happens very often. Calm down, Phillip. Think, think.\"</span></div></div>",

Phillip turned and heard loud rumble before he heard tearing at the roof. \"What the?!\" he yelled. Phillip looked up to see the roof being ripped off the hinges and the next thing he knew, he saw Selene's smiling, spotted face. The Dalmatian giantess wagged her tail as she looked down at her husband. \"Hi, Phillip,\" she said. \"Sorry about the roof.\" Phillip was dumbfounded at the sight of his enormous wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-S-Selene!? You just tore the roof off its hinges! Just look at yourself! You're a giant Dalmatian! And you're also fat!\" Selene gave a scoff. \"Rude.\" She said. But Selene felt her 150ft wide ass and realized that her husband had a point. \"Okay,\" she said. \"So my bones got bigger. Big deal. Speaking of bones, I'm starving.\" Phillip let out a groan as Wildfire followed him into the kitchen. \"This will take a lot of getting used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before Phillip was pouring kibble for two dogs; a normal sized dog bowl for Wildfire and a kiddie pool full of kibble for Selene. Both the normal male Dalmatian and the ginormous obese female Dalmatian immediately dug in. \"Selene,\" said Phillip. \"You do realize that's dog food you're eating, right?\" Selene pulled her head out out of kibble and wiped her chin. \"I'll admit,\" she said. \"It's an acquired taste but it doesn't look like I'm going to turn back to normal anytime soon, so I might as well get used to it.\" Wildfire gave a bark and caused Selene to twitch her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thank you,\" said Selene as she shook her head. \"I'm not rolling around on a dead bird. I'm still human on the inside.\" Phillip gave a look of surprise. \"Hold on. You understood Wildfire?\" \"Well, duh,\" said Selene. \"We're both the same species now. Heck, we're both the same breed.\" Phillip put his hand against his wife's large cold nose and let out a sigh. \"Selene,\" he said. \"Did something unusual happen at S.K.Y. Labs?\" Selene wagged her tail and wiggled her ass as she thought about that. \"Well,\" she said. \"Some strange chemicals spilled on me and I didn't have time to wash them off.\" \"I knew it!\" yelled Phillip. \"And you touched Wildfire before you went to the lab. You must've been splashed with some mutagen of some kind that combined with the dog DNA on you and turned you into a big fat mutate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelene just went back to her kibble before speaking. \"Phillip,\" she said. \"This isn't a comic book. That can't happen?\" \"Says the woman who turned into a Dalmatian as big as a parade float,\" said Phillip as he poked his wife in her enormous hip. The giantess just gave a bark and Wildfire barked as well. \"Oh really?\" asked Selene mockingly as she wiggled her tail. \"Is that so, Wildfire?\" Phillip's eyes popped out of his head. \"What did Wildfire say?\" he asked in worry. Selene just smirked tauntingly as she grinned wide and showed her husband teeth that were as big as he was. \"Oh nothing. Just some interesting information about your web history.\" Phillip begun to sweat as Selene panted and played with her own ginormously fat belly. \"Don't tell me this isn't a wish come true for you.\" Selene barked a few times and held out her tongue before she licked her husband all over and made him groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn seconds, Phillip was soaked with his wife's saliva and was shivering. \"Now I know how Garfield feels.\" He groaned. But then Phillip's knees twitched because he was actually liking it. He could feel himself getting hard looking at the King Kong-sized canine that was his wife. But before he could put any more thought on that, Selene turned her head and then spotted a plane flying over head. Something came over the ginormous Dalmatian and she gave a bark before she ran on all fours to chase the airplane's shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Selene!\" yelled Phillip. \"Selene! What are you doing?!\" Wildfire let out a canine whine and rolled his eyes before Phillip grabbed Selene by the tail and found himself dragged along by his wife. Phillip then begun to climb up Selene's huge ass and grabbed hold of her back fat. \"Selene! Control yourself!\" But Selene didn't pay attention and kept running down the street as the road cracked under her heavy weight. \"No good,\" said Phillip with a sigh. \"I forgot that Dalmatians were hard of hearing.\" Phillip climbed Selene's back only for Selene to stop running and then was tossed into Selene's hair as the Dalmatian girl finally stopped. Selene's white and black-spotted chipmunk-like cheeks turned a shade of pink. \"I'm sorry, Phillip,\" she said. \"I don't know what came over me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhillip let out a groan and held up his wife's ear. \"You're part dog now,\" said Phillip. \"In body and mind.

But do be careful with the corn.\u201d Jorge and Beatrice kissed before going off to do their respective chores. Beatrice let out a laugh, although G\u00e9nesis was slightly worried. \u201cSometimes I wonder about Mama, Diego. She\u2019s so headstrong.\u201d Diego just gestured for his sister not to worry and they both walked off to tend to the sheep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeatrice at the time was in the field picking corn and humming to herself when she heard a hissing sound. Beatrice looked to the ground and gasped because buried behind some reeds, there was a rattlesnake\u2019s rattle. Beatrice immediately froze and decided to wait it out as the rattlesnake was moving out. However, unlike normal rattlesnakes, this one was bright black and appeared to have bright red eyes as it let out a hiss. Beatrice was hoping that by not making any sudden moves, the rattlesnake wouldn\u2019t see her as a threat and leave peacefully. Unfortunately for Beatrice, this was not the case. The black rattlesnake spotted the farmer\u2019s wife and hissed before lunging at her as she screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJorge, Diego and G\u00e9nesis heard the family matriarch scream and were instantly panicked. \u201cBeatrice!\u201d yelled Jorge. \u201cMama!\u201d yeleld Diego. The Valencias ran and saw the snake had bit Beatrice and she was on the ground holding her leg in pain as the snake was going to get ready to bit again. However, Jorge took out a gun and shot the snake in the side. The snake hissed and slithered away as the bullet fell out of its skin. G\u00e9nesis and Diego ran to Beatrice who was weak and panting very heavily from the rattlesnake\u2019s poison. \u201cG\u00e9nesis!\u201d yelled Jorge. \u201cDiego! Quick! We need to get your mother to the doctor.\u201d Both the Valencia twins picked up their poisoned mother and wasted no time rushing to the truck as Jorge started it and they drove off to the hospital. \u201cHold on, Beatrice,\u201d said Jorge. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be alright.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long before the Valencias took Beatrice to the hospital and they were waiting for her to make a recovery in the hospital lobby. Diego was biting his nails. \u201cMama is going to be alright, right Papa?\u201d asked G\u00e9nesis in concern. Jorge gave a nervous smile. \u201cG\u00e9nesis,\u201d he said. \u201cYour mother was been stung by scorpions before we were married and she recovered. I\u2019m sure that she\u2019ll pull through.\u201d Diego gave a concerned smile and crossed his fingers. \u201cBut that was the biggest rattlesnake I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said G\u00e9nesis. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a black rattlesnake before. Oh, I hope Mama is gonna be okay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, Beatrice walked out and her leg was bandaged. Her family was overjoyed and relieved to see her make a recovery. \u201cMama!\u201d yelled G\u00e9nesis as she and her brother hugged their mother. Jorge joined in on the hug. \u201cGracias goodness,\u201d said Jorge. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re okay, Beatrice.\u201d Beatrice let out a scoff. \u201cWhat are you all worried about. One anti-venom later, and I\u2019m as good as new.\u201d That\u2019s what Beatrice thought but what she didn\u2019t know was that there was something dangerous in that particular snake\u2019s bite besides venom.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>What the Valencias didn\u2019t know was that the black rattlesnake that bit Beatrice had crawled further down into the countryside before it mysteriously expired. Dr. Salazar and General Explic\u00edto had drove up in a jeep and then spotted the rattlesnake. The general parked the car before Dr. Salazar ran and picked up the rattlesnake with a stick. \u201cOh no,\u201d said Dr. Salazar. \u201cProject Ophiuchus is dead.\u201d \u201cMust\u2019ve died from the heat.\u201d Said General Explic\u00edto. \u201cNo, idiota!\u201d yelled Dr. Salazar. \u201cThis rattlesnake must\u2019ve bitten somebody.\u201d \u201cOh my,\u201d said the General. \u201cYou want to stop by the morgue to see if we find the unlucky civilian that the snake bit.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s just it. The venom in Project Ophiuchus is a very powerful, very experimental and very irreversible mutagen. My intention was to use Project Ophiuchus to create an army of snake-men. Imagine, soldiers that could survive in extreme heat, move with absolute agility and strike with powerful venom. Unfortunately, I spilled beer all over my notes and can\u2019t recreate the mutagen. Someone bad is going to come of this, something no doubt we\u2019ll be blamed for.\u201d General Explic\u00edto slapped himself in the face. \u201cThis is precisely why I only asked you to build a snake-powered raygun. Something that couldn\u2019t possibly go wrong somehow?\u201d Dr. Salazar let out a groan and tossed the dead Project Ophiuchus to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the Valencia farm the next day, Beatrice was getting ready to collect the eggs from the henhouse when G\u00e9nesis tried to stop her. \u201cMama,\u201d she said. \u201cShould you be really going out? I\u2019ll get the eggs for you.\u201d \u201cI appreciate your concern, G\u00e9nesis,\u201d said Beatrice to her daughter. \u201cBut I\u2019m perfectly fine.\u201d \u201cBut you were bitten by a rattlesnake yesterday. There could\u2019ve been more of those horrible creatures.\u201d Beatrice let out a sigh. \u201cYou ninos are so paranoid,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m perfectly fine. I got the antidote in time.\u201d \u201cBut, Mama,\u201d said G\u00e9nesis. \u201cI have never seen a rattlesnake like the one that bit you before. It could be an unknown species. It could be more poisonous than a normal rattlesnake. Beatrice just knocked her daughter to the side with her backside before walking out of the house. From G\u00e9nesis\u2019s spot on the floor, she saw that Beatrice\u2019s rear appeared to be getting bigger and fuller and then she realized something that unnerved her; Beatrice appeared to be hissing as she walked out towards the henhouse. The farmer\u2019s wife however, didn\u2019t notice her mysterious weight gain or her hissing, or the fact that she appeared to now have a forked tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAye carumba,\u201d she said. \u201cEst la nina loco. I am perfectly fine.\u201d Beatrice walked into the henhouse and noticed that the hens seemed distressed. There was a rat in the henhouse that was trying to steal eggs. Beatrice gasped and grabbed the rat before it could escape. Then something came over Beatrice and she flickered her tongue out at the rat. Diego was walking in to check on his mother and gasped because as Beatrice walked out of the henhouse with the eggs and she appeared to have a rat\u2019s tail sticking out of her mouth right before she sucked it in and apparently swallowed the rat. Beatrice then let out a belch and walked away as Diego gave a look of pure horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the secret military organization base, Dr. Salazar had put together the snake powered raygun for General Explic\u00edto. \u201cSee, Dr. Salazar,\u201d said Explic\u00edto. \u201cHow hard was that?\u201d Dr. Salazar let out a sigh. \u201cI still think this is a waste of my talents. But the snake-powered raygun is put together.\u201d \u201cWell? Is it optional or not?\u201d \u201cUnfortunately, General Explic\u00edto, the raygun doesn\u2019t have a snake to power it up.\u201d \u201cThis is Mexico. We\u2019ve got plenty of snakes.\u201d \u201cSi, General, but in order for the raygun to create so much as a spark, we\u2019ll need a snake that weighs as much as a big rig.\u201d \u201cThen we\u2019ll get an anaconda!\u201d Salazar pulled on his hair. \u201cI specifically designed the raygun to be powered by a rattlesnake.\u201d \u201cYou know, for a genius, you seem to have crippling overspecialization when it comes to snakes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Diego told G\u00e9nesis what he had seen in the hen house. \u201cSwallowed a rat?! Are you sure, Diego?\u201d Diego nodded his head. \u201cCarumba,\u201d said G\u00e9nesis. \u201cNo rattlesnake bite has those kind of side-effects. Something is seriously wrong with Mama.\u201d Speaking of Beatrice, she was holding her head and was busy picking corn as she was hissing again. She actually seemed to have gotten taller and had gotten much fatter as well, mainly in her stomach and breasts. Suddenly, she gave a hiss as she got on her knees and her eyes turned into those of a reptilian. Beatrice opened her mouth to reveal that not only did she still have her forked tongue but she also appeared to have grown fangs. She saw that her fingernails were turning into sharp claws before her skin turned pale lavender with gray diamond spots running on her back. Her thighs then bulged out, as did her stomach and her neck appeared to be getting longer albeit with multiple chins. Then she sprouted a rather long tail with a rattle at the end as her body became more and more scaly. She let out a hiss of despair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that?!\u201d yelled G\u00e9nesis. G\u00e9nesis and Diego ran off to check on their mother and as they ran through the cornfield, they heard loud hissing. The twins stopped in their tracks and they saw a rattlesnake rattle that was bigger than a mailbox in front of them. G\u00e9nesis stepped back in fear and found herself pressed against a large and plush scaly stomach. She turned around and screamed. Beatrice had transformed into a huge 35ft tall and 50ft long anthropomorphic rattlesnake with a 45ft wide butt, a 55ft belly, huge E-cup breasts and three-chins. She was also completely hairless and completely naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeatrice\u2019s children looked up at their mutated mother in fear as she gave a hiss. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll admit it. Maybe G\u00e9nesis was right to worry about the snake bite?\u201d The Valencia twins turned to face each other in pure worry at their mutated mother.</span></div></div>",

But now every part of me is big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Beatrice's stomach gurgled as she put G\u00e9nesis down. The sound of it was loud enough to crack the windows in the house. \"Estoy muy hambriento. Diego, G\u00e9nesis, please bring me as much food as you can find.\" Diego and G\u00e9nesis then watched in worry as Beatrice's stomach growled again and the rattlesnake giantess stretched out her neck to swallow dozens of stalks of corn in one enormous gulp and then let out a thunderous belch that forced her children to cover their ears. Beatrice flickered her tongue and turned to face her twins. \"Andale! I'm starving. I'm so hungry I could eat Texas.\" Diego and G\u00e9nesis then decided that it would be the best idea to run off and find as much food as they could to satisfy their enormous mother's huge appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Jorge, who knew absolutely nothing of his wife's mutation was outside of the supermarket when he heard his cellphone ringing. \"Hola? Oh, G\u00e9nesis. Do we need anything back home.\" G\u00e9nesis at home was emptying the fridge as she spoke to her father. \"Just please buy all the meat that you could.\" \"Que?!\" \"Don't shoot the messenger, Mama's orders.\" \"Carumba, girl! Does she have a tapeworm or something!? I'm gonna have to empty out the cash we needed to fix the tractor.\" Outside the window at home, there was a crash and G\u00e9nesis saw that Beatrice had gotten so hungry that she ate the tractor and then belched out smoke from her mouth. G\u00e9nesis bit her lip. \"That's not gonna be a problem, Papa. Just please get as much raw meat as you can.\" Jorge was confused but G\u00e9nesis hung up before he could question her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJorge groaned as he was picking up several cases of raw venison and several raw geese. Inside the grocery store at the time, Dr. Salazar was taking a soda out of a case behind Jorge when he noticed Jorge buying all the meat. \"Esto es una gran cantidad de carne, amigo.\" Jorge let out a sigh. \"Si. But my wife suddenly has a craving for all the meat she can get. She's already got a large backside. She's going to kill the rest of her figure eating all this raw meat.\" \"Raw meat?\" asked Dr. Salazar. \"That's asking for trouble. By the way, have you seen any rattlesnakes lately.\" \"Uno. One bit my wife yesterday. Thankfully she's made a full recovery.\" \"Si, near death experiences will aggregate one's appetite. Just tell me if you see any 18 ton rattlesnakes in the area.\" Jorge nearly had a heart attack at that idea. \"18 ton rattlesnakes!? Aye, aye, aye. Are you loco in la cabeza? There are no such thing as 18 ton rattlesnakes. At least I certainly hope not. Why do you ask?\" Dr. Salazar bit his lip. \"Uh, no reason.\" The mad scientist definitely couldn't let anyone know about the secret military organization's rattlesnake-powered ray gun. He then decided to make a hasty retreat as Jorge shrugged his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the farm, Beatrice had actually gotten bigger and fatter to the point where she was three times bigger than the farmhouse and the rattlesnake giantess was greedily devouring all the crops that Diego gathered at her feet and belly. Beatrice even swallowed every last pumpkin on the farm in one gulp before eating all the tomatoes and splattering the juice. \"Diego,\" said Beatrice. \"G\u00e9nesis. I need more meat.\" \"Mama,\" said G\u00e9nesis. \"You already ate all of the eggs... and chickens.\" Beatrice downed an entire tank of milk before she belched again. \"Then bring me the fattest pig we have. Andale.\" Beatrice groaned as her stomach continued to gurgle and Diego and G\u00e9nesis walked away to get more food. \"Pity,\" said G\u00e9nesis. \"She was very attached to that pig.\" Diego then spoke in sign language and horrified G\u00e9nesis. \"That's a terrible thought, Diego. And that's not like Mama. She won't go that extreme.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teenage twins then stopped because Jorge returned in his truck with enough meat for a butcher's shop. \"Papa,\" said G\u00e9nesis in shock. \"You're home. Uh, Papa, there's something you should know?\" Jorge gave a stern look. \"Where is your mother?\" Suddenly, Jorge heard a swiping movement and turned to see a good chunk of the meat in his truck disappeared. \"Que?\" then he felt blood from the meat dripping down from the sky and onto his head. Then Jorge looked up and screamed as he saw Beatrice eating the meat. Beatrice smiled at her husband and gave a hiss. \"Hola, honey,\" she said. \"Well, this is awkward.\" \"Beatrice?!\" yelled Jorge recognizing his wife's voice. Beatrice nodded her head and let out a burp. \"Sorry,\" she said. \"I guess being turned into a giant poisonous reptile makes you a little gassy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJorge was too shocked to speak and then turned to face his son and daughter about what happened to Beatrice. \"Calm down, Papa,\" said G\u00e9nesis as Diego made similar gestures to tell the message in sign language. \"That snake bite is probably what did this to Mama. We need to just clam down and think like rational people.\" Of course at that moment, there was loud motion and Beatrice was laying down as she rubbed her huge stomach and let out another belch before curling up and falling asleep. She even leaked out venomous drool as she snoozed. Diego and G\u00e9nesis smiled nervously as Jorge crossed his arms. He was not amused with the fact that his wife had transformed into a titanic and obese rattlesnake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo complicate matters....</span></div></div>",

The snake woman was now 75ft tall, 150ft long with a 115ft wide butt and 125ft wide belly. Of course, this made her all too easy for her to be spotted by a scout for the secret military organization who was surprised to see such a titanic creature and even snapped a photograph of her. \u201cGeneral Explic\u00edto and Dr. Salazar will want to hear about this.\u201d With that, the scout ran off as the Valencios were trying to figure out what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe it,\u201d said Jorge. \u201cMy wife is a rattlesnake the size of a zeppelin.

Not to mention the chickens too.\u201d \u201cWhat?! I guess I shouldn\u2019t be surprised but I can\u2019t believe that she did that. How are we supposed to keep up with an appetite like that? This is a farm, not a buffet.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said G\u00e9nesis. \u201cOn the bright side. We won\u2019t have to worry about rats ever again.\u201d Jorge had to sit down to wrap his head around the situation but wound up sitting on Beatrice\u2019s tail because he heard a shaking noise and turned his head to see right behind him was the rattle on his wife\u2019s tail. \u201cThat is going to take some serious getting used to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the secret military organization, Dr. Salazar was looking at the photograph that his scout took. \u201cCarumba,\u201d said Dr. Salazar. \u201cProject Ophiuchus must\u2019ve bitten that farmer\u2019s wife and mutated her into a titanic snake.\u201d \u201cAye, aye, aye,\u201d said General Explic\u00edto. \u201cShe looks just gigante enough for the rattlesnake-powered raygun.\u201d \u201cMaybe too big,\u201d commented Salazar. \u201cWhat the?! That\u2019s the guy I ran into at the store! Liar! He had an 18-ton... well she\u2019s definitely much heavier than 18 tons at this point, but he was hiding our rattlesnake this whole time! That\u2019s it, I\u2019m going over to get our snake.\u201d General Explic\u00edto was about to say something to try and convince Dr. Salazar otherwise but the mad scientist was already stomping off. \u201cIdiotas!\u201d yelled Dr. Salazar. \u201cEveryone in El Mundo is an idiota. It took me months to design Project Ophiuchus only for some bumpkin\u2019s wife to kill it and become the queen of the rattlesnakes. Well I\u2019ll settle their hash soon enough.\u201d Dr. Salazar got into a jeep in order to drive off and give the Valencias a piece of his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with the Valencias on the farm, Jorge and Diego were busy replacing all the maize that Beatrice devoured. \u201cToss some more seeds over there, son,\u201d said Jorge. \u201cMaybe if we\u2019re lucky they\u2019ll grow back faster.\u201d Diego nodded his head before something fell down from the sky and caught them both by surprise and even made Jorge scream. What fell from the sky was a dead tapir that had puncture holes in its side from a pair of large fangs. They both looked up to see Beatrice\u2019s fat serpentine face hovering overhead and flicking out her tongue. \u201cI felt bad about eating us out of house and home, so I decided to catch dinner for you guys.\u201d \u201cMom,\u201d said G\u00e9nesis. \u201cThat\u2019s a Baird\u2019s tapir. It\u2019s endangered. Besides, it\u2019s poisoned. We can\u2019t eat that until we detox it.\u201d Beatrice let out a scoff. \u201cPick, pick, pick. Alright, I\u2019ll try to find some way of catching dinner without pumping it full of venom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when the Valencias heard a jeep coming and it was Dr. Salazar. \u201cWere you expecting company?\u201d asked Jorge. Diego just shook his head. \u201cOh no,\u201d said G\u00e9nesis. \u201cWe can\u2019t let anyone see Mama like this.\u201d \u201cHow can they NOT see me, chica loca?\u201d asked Beatrice. \u201cI\u2019m as big as a mountain. It\u2019s not like I can find some place to hide.\u201d Beatrice sat up and curled her tail around her serpentine body as she lowered her neck and then Dr. Salazar stormed up to the Valencias. \u201cI have a bone to pick with you!\u201d \u201cWhat did we do?\u201d asked G\u00e9nesis. Then Jorge recognized the man. \u201cHey, wait a minute. You\u2019re the guy from the market.\u201d \u201cAnd you were lying to me about your rattlesnake wife!\u201d \u201cHow can I lie about something I didn\u2019t know about? Wait.... 18 ton rattlesnake. You were looking for an 18 ton rattlesnake.\u201d \u201c18 tons?\u201d asked G\u00e9nesis. \u201cI\u2019d say Mom weighs at least 1800 tons by now.\u201d Beatrice glared at her tiny daughter at that remark about her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat would anyone want with an 18 ton rattlesnake?\u201d asked the massive and mutated matriarch of the Valencia family. Dr. Salazar glared. \u201cIf you must know, my name is Dr. Salazar and the idiota general I work for commissioned me to build a rattlesnake-powered raygun and we need your fat rattlesnake ass to power it.\u201d \u201cAnd what exactly are you going to <i>do</i> with a rattlesnake-powered raygun?\u201d asked G\u00e9nesis. Dr. Salazar\u2019s eyes popped because he literally had no idea what the raygun would be useful for. He was pretty sure that not even General Explic\u00edto and his army knew exactly what they were planning to do with a rattlesnake-powered raygun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the doctor just spazzed out and grabbed himself by the hair. \u201cHow the hell am I supposed to know what to do with a rattlesnake-powered raygun! I only built the thing! I just work here! Why am I arguing with a stupid farmer about his fatass mutated rattlesnake wife. I\u2019m just gonna do what I came here to do and take the giant rattlesnake.\u201d Beatrice just smiled smugly. \u201cOh really, Doc? How do you plan on doing that?\u201d Dr. Salazar realized that he hadn\u2019t brought in reinforcements of any kind and there was no way he could move a morbidly obese rattlesnake as big as a skyscraper by force. Beatrice smugly lowered her head and then licked him with her forked tongue tauntingly as Dr. Salazar screamed. \u201cI\u2019ve been kissed by a rattlesnake! Water! Ayuda!\u201d Dr. Salazar ran to his jeep in order to rush to a hospital out of fear that Beatrice poisoned him. Beatrice and G\u00e9nesis shared a laugh while Diego simply smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Jorge was worried that Dr. Salazar would be back.

It\u2019s all over for those Valencias. I have a plan to catch that rattlesnake.\u201d \u201cHow so?\u201d Dr. Salazar gave a smirk. \u201cHow else do you capture a giant monster? With a giant trap. It couldn\u2019t be simpler. We build a pit trap and then fill it with chains. The dirt will be stable enough that nothing lighter than that snake will fall in and we\u2019ll have our rattlesnake for our rattlesnake-powered raygun. I will not be made a fool of again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028That\u2019s what Dr. Salazar thought, but as you all know, it doesn\u2019t take much for a plan to go horribly wrong in one way or another. But before we get to that, the next day, Beatrice was digging an irrigation tunnel for the crops as Jorge was still trying to wrap his head around the odd situation his family was facing. \"I don't like this,\" said Jorge. \"Something tells me that kook is going to be back. As long as we can't turn you back, Beatrice, we're going to have nothing but headaches from that man.\" Beatrice just surfaced her head out of the ground and gave a smile and a hiss. \"That's funny. You didn't seem to mind where you were sleeping last night.\" Jorge blushed before his wife continued to dig through the ground. \"That has nothing to do with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiego and G\u00e9nesis were planting some new seeds when they saw a gaudy looking car driving down the street rather clumsily. \"Carumba!\" yelled G\u00e9nesis right before she and her brother moved out of the way just as that car blew a tire and stopped. Out of the car walked out three young men that looked like a rock band. \u201cThat\u2019s the last time you drive, Matt,\u201d said the guitarist to the bassist. \u201cI swear.\u201d \u201cGet off my case, Eric. It\u2019s not my fault your girlfriend booked us a gig in Sonra.\u201d The drummer let out a sigh. \u201cAnd so far away from a garage.\u201d G\u00e9nesis and Diego decided to walk up to help the band out. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d said G\u00e9nesis. \u201cWe have a spare tire in our garage.\" Eric smiled at that. \"That is so cool. Thanks.\" Jorge quickly took notice of the band and turned to face his wife. \"Beatrice,\" he said. \"You had better make yourself scarce.\" Beatrice nodded her head and the rattlesnake giantess quickly tunneled away. \"Toxic Nightshade, huh?\" asked G\u00e9nesis as she and Diego were replacing the tire. \"Must be one of those North American bands we've heard of. Unfortunately, our mom doesn't like rock and roll.\" Matt let out a scoff. \"What is she, deaf.\" Matt looked around to make sure there was nobody else and then started to practice with his bass. \"Anyway,\" said Eric. \"Thanks a lot for this assist. By now my girlfriend is already on ahead without us.\" \"Not a problem.\" Said G\u00e9nesis. However, while the trio's back was turned, Diego noticed something surprising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiego spoke to his sister though sign language and G\u00e9nesis looked in shock. \u201cWhat do you mean that animatronic looks too realistic for your tastes.\u201d Diego pointed to the poster and G\u00e9nesis took a closer look. There, she realized that in the poster with the band there appeared to be a giant animatronic cobra that was just as huge and fat as her serpentine mother and had a pair of breasts as well showing that it might be anthropomorphic. Jorge noticed this as well and was shocked. \u201cThat cobra looks like it might be real,\u201d he said. \u201cIt looks like Beatrice isn\u2019t the only serpent goddess in the area.\u201d G\u00e9nesis let out a sigh. \u201cI really hope Mom doesn\u2019t get into a fight with this cobra woman. The last thing we need is too giant obese poisonous snakes that hate each other.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, General Explic\u00edto and Dr. Salazar were waiting by their snake trap for any sign of Beatrice. \"Are you sure this will work, Doc?\" \"Positive, General. A snake that big will get hungry eventually and when she does, we grab her.\" Dr. Salazar let out a laugh right before he heard a crashing sound and a loud hiss. \"Gotcha!\" However, when Dr. Salazar and the general checked their trap, they got a big surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature that got caught was not Beatrice. Instead, she was a giant tan-skinned cobra woman with a long frill around her neck. Like Beatrice, she was 75ft tall but she only had a 100ft wide belly and tail and didn\u2019t have any legs. She appeared to be wearing loud eyeshadow and lipstick and looked somewhat like a young Asian woman and one of her frills looked like it was pierced. Needless to say, the cobra woman was pissed off at the idea of being captured and was shaking in her chains. Dr. Salazar was more than surprised to see such a humungous cobra. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d asked Dr. Salazar. \u201cWhere did that giant cobra come from? I don\u2019t remember creating a mutant cobra. Cobras aren\u2019t even indigenous to South America.\u201d The cobra in the t rap gave an angry hiss. \u201cWhat the hell is going on here?\u201d she asked. \u201cI was just out on a capybara run before meeting up with the guys and this happens! What the ****!?\u201d \u201cDamn it all!\u201d yelled Dr. Salazar. \u201cWe caught the wrong snake!\u201d \"Don't be such a pessimist, Dr. Salazar,\" said General Explic\u00edto. \"We'll just use her for the rattlesnake-powered ray gun.\" The cobra woman was somewhat confused. \"Rattlesnake-powered ray gun? Is this a joke?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Salazar was just as unamused with that idea. \u201cAre you insane, General!? It\u2019s a <i>rattlesnake</i>-powered raygun! We can\u2019t use a king cobra!\u201d \u201cWhy not?\u201d asked the general. \u201cThey both belong to the order squamata.\u201d Dr. Salazar was surprised at those words. \u201cWow, just wow. That\u2019s actually true. I guess you\u2019re not as much of an idiota as I thought.\u201d Kelly just rolled her eyes and hissed before she spat venom at the chains that were binding her and managed to slip out. \u201cWait!\u201d yelled Dr. Salazar. \u201cWhere are you going!? You can\u2019t just slither away!\u201d \u201cNo offense,\u201d said Kelly. \u201cBut I don\u2019t like the idea of being used as a battery. Dr. Salazar would\u2019ve gone after the cobra woman but Kelly spat venom and made the mad scientist jump back in fear of getting poisoned right before Kelly slinked away. \u201cIsn\u2019t anyone going to stop her!?\u201d yelled Dr. Salazar. General Explic\u00edto just twitched his fingers and smiled nervously. \u201cWell, Dr. Salazar, we were so sure the trap would work that we didn\u2019t bring any tanks.\u201d The mad doctor just slapped himself in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly meanwhile gave a hiss as she continued to tunnel and slink away and away. \u201cWhat a bunch of idiots,\u201d she said. \u201cA rattlesnake-powered ray gun. Where the hell are they going to get a... rattlesnake... big... enough... to...?\u201d Kelly then made a startling realization. \u201cO.M.G.! There\u2019s another giant snake out there! I've got to warn the guys! She might be dangerous!\u201d Nearby, Beatrice had slithered up towards a river for a drink and could hear Matt practicing from a few miles away as she groaned. \"Stupid Northern rock and roll,\" she said. \"If I still had ears, they'd be bleeding. How G\u00e9nesis and Diego can torture their ear drums with that noise, I'll never know.\" However, as Beatrice kept swallowing the water, she heard hissing and then turned to see Kelly slithering by. The rattlesnake giantess squeezed out her water as she looked in absolute surprise and accidentally sprayed the water all over Kelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cobra turned around and opened her hood as she gave a hiss and flickered her tongue. In caution, Beatrice shook her large rattle and she stretched her neck down. Beatrice was still surprised to see another serpentine giantess in the vicinity. \"Carumba. Another snake and she's just a much of a gigante gordita as I am.\" Beatrice poked Kelly in the stomach as Kelly slithered back and hissed and then Kelly looked down and noticed Beatrice's clawed feet. \"You still have feet?\" asked Kelly. \"You still have an ass? How is that possible?\" \"How are <i>you</i> possible, chica?\" asked Beatrice. \"Don't tell me that those secret military organization bozos created another mutant snake.\" Kelly gave a hiss. \"Those idiots tried to use me to power their rattlesnake-powered ray gun. Apparently you were the intended battery?\" Beatrice gave a nervous laugh. \"Si. My name is Beatrice Valencia.\" Kelly rolled her eyes. \"I'm Kelly. Just leave it at that. So you're telling me those creeps mutated you.\" \"Not exactly. An escaped lab animal of theirs did. Did they do the same with you?\" Kelly scoffed. \"No. I bought a magic tattoo.\" Beatrice broke down in laughter that made her belly shake. \"Magic?\" she asked. \"That's unbelievable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly got defensive and gave a hiss as she showed her fangs. \"It's true, though! Just look at me. I'm a fat Godzilla-sized queen cobra speaking with a fat Godzilla-sized rattlesnake. What are you doing out here?\" Beatrice gave a hiss before speaking. \"Well, a rock band called Toxic Nightshade had a vehicular breakdown near my family's farm and my husband, son and daughter needed me to make myself scarce so as not to scare them.\" Kelly's eyes poked out of her head. \"Toxic Nightshade? My boyfriend is the band leader and I'm their manager.\" Beatrice then realized something. \"Then that animatronic cobra in the poster?\" \"It's not animatronic,\" said Kelly. \"It's me.\" Beatrice dropped her jaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly then bit her lip slightly. \"I never thought I'd run into another snake lady. Se\u00f1ora Valencia, my friends and I are guests in your country so I'm proposing that we don't get at each other throats. The last thing that the world needs is two giant sumo snakes who hate each other.\" Beatrice let out a laugh. \"Don't worry, child. I better stick around to make sure those clowns don't trap you again. Come on, I'll show you the countryside.\" With that, the rattlesnake giantess waddled off as the rattlesnake giantess followed after her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Our story begins in Moscow, Russia, home of the Pangaea Corporation. This foundation was run by Sasha Zolnerowich, a well-known corporate strategist who at only 26 years of age had saved the company from complete ruin after her father, Boltan Zolnerowich, was imprisoned for taking part in illegal activity. In contrast, Sasha had a strong sense of morals and ran the company in the best way to turn a profit while at the same time, doing all that she could to avoid any kind of trouble with the law. Of course, Sasha was not only brilliant, she was also a good looker. She was a very hourglass shaped woman with long silver hair with a dyed white highlight reaching to her rear. Because of this, she caught the eyes of many a lesser man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of these men were ever as persistent as the weedy and nerdy Peotr Kragoff, a young chemist who could not stop thinking about Sasha no matter how hard he tried. In fact, she was the very reason he chose to work at the silver haired vixen\u2019s company in the first place. He had actually tried to ask her out dozens of time. Unfortunately for him, Sasha was one of those women who was married to her job and would not go out with Peotr until he had created a product that would revolutionize the Pangaea Corporation. He kept trying and while he had a few successes, none brought the stimulation from Sasha that was required for her to give him so much as the time of day. But because of that, Peotr just kept on trying and this very day, the young man held up a tube of a strange rubbing lotion and smiled. \u201cThis will be it.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her office at the time, Sasha was looking over her profiles before she heard her secretary. \u201cPeotr Kragoff to see you, Ms. Zolnerowich.\u201d Sasha let out a sigh and slapped herself in the face because she was sure that she knew exactly why Peotr had come to see her and begun to curse in Russian before speaking with her secretary. \u201cSend him in.\u201d She said. Peotr came in and was nervous, but he gulped and gave a confident look as he was walking out to meet with Sasha. \u201cAlright, Peotr,\u201d said Sasha. \u201cLet\u2019s get this over with. What do you want?\u201d Peotr was going to speak but Sasha then held up her arm. \u201cBesides me that is.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeotr laughed nervously and held out the tube. \u201cI have created a new skin care lotion made from a fossil from the Ice Age I managed to acquire. Sasha then raised an eyebrow. \u201cPeotr, I\u2019ll have you know that we run a cruelty free company.\u201d \u201cSasha, please give me a chance. This bones came from animals that haven\u2019t been around for thousands of years. The way I see it, humans are fragile creatures with fragile skin that gets weak from age, even moreso from outside influences such as sunlight and gravity. But what I have here will make skin last longer, maybe even forever. Which is why this rub on, I\u2019ve dubbed Navsegda*. Maybe this will make our skin virtually bulletproof.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha was skeptic and was looking around the tube as Peotr crossed his fingers. \u201cHas this product been tested?\u201d \u201cUh, neit, Sasha.\u201d Sasha shook her head. \u201cWe can\u2019t release a product that hasn\u2019t been properly tested. For all we know this stuff could be hazardous.\u201d Peotr groaned. \u201cI wanted to test it out, but nobody volunteered. Just please trust me.\u201d Sasha was not sure what to say and put the tube down. \u201cI\u2019ll give you one chance, Peotr. I\u2019ll test it out myself. If it succeeds, we\u2019ll talk.\u201d Peotr nodded his head. \u201cI see. Dasvidaniysa, Sasha. Uh, Ms. Zolnerowich.\u201d As Peotr left his boss\u2019s office, he was hoping that he would succeed. Once he was out of sight, he took out a fossil that looked like the jawbone of a prehistoric rhinoceros of some kind. \u201cPlease,\u201d he said as he stroked the fossil. \u201cPlease work. Your cells are my last chance to get a date with the hottest woman in Russia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* Navsegda is Russian for \u201cforever\u201d.</span></div></div>",

An Elasmotherium is a long extinct ancestor of the rhinoceros endemic to Eurasia during the Late Pliocene era. The name means, \u201cThin Plate Beast\u201d. Here is an image for reference <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/Elasmotherium_cauc1DB.jpg.\" target=\"_blank\">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/c...</a> Now we return to the writing.com chapter already in progress)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha took a look at the tube in front of her and rolled her eyes. She knew this was yet another one of Peotr\u2019s attempts to ask her out on a date, but she figured that maybe he had made a breakthrough. \u201cUsing fossil material to act as a skin rejuvenator? He wants the hardness of bones to be applied to the skin? Well, if he wants it tested, I better give it the run through since everyone else is too chicken. But if that durak\u2019s strange formula causes my skin to fall off, he can start cleaning out his desk. The Russian woman then squeezed out the Navsegda cream from its tube and applied it to her skin. It felt odd and Sasha gagged slightly as she rubbed it on. \u201cUgh,\u201d she said. \u201cHow utterly disgusting. Nobody said eternal beauty was easy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha had finished rubbing on the skin cream and from the looks of it, that was the entire tube. Sasha then tapped herself on the forehead. \u201cI certainly don\u2019t feel like my skin is any cleaner or stronger. Maybe it\u2019s a dud. I\u2019ll have to break it to Peotr easily.\u201d Sasha let out a sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s really a shame,\u201d said the CEO. \u201cIf the slime actually worked, them it would be a great boon to mankind and to the Pangaea Corporation.\u201d Suddenly, Sasha heard her cellphone begun to ring. She immediately grabbed the cellphone to speak into it. \u201cZdravstuyte? Oh, Inga. What?! You know company policy! Deforestation is out of the question. Either you pull the plug or I pull your plug. No, I am not kidding. I will make that happen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sasha was speaking, she failed to notice that something was happening to her. Her rear end was expanding and her skin became rougher as it turned red and she sprouted a small tail. \u201cListen,\u201d said Sasha. \u201cYou may have gotten away with those stunts when my father was in charge, but I am not my father. I do not intend to bring this company back into the mud after I\u2019ve successfully pulled it out.\u201d Sasha was so busy speaking on the phone that she didn\u2019t notice that she was growing a prominent hunchback and her face was stretching out into a snout just like a rhinoceros\u2019s face as a huge light-blue horn that was as thick as a tree trunk burst out of the center of her face and her feet turned into flat feet like those of an ungulate. She had turned into a red-skinned elasmotherium, a prehistoric species of rhinoceros but it didn\u2019t stop there because Sasha was getting bigger as she spoke. Sasha\u2019s height increased to 12 feet tall and had she been normal size she would weigh 1500lbs. She had D-cup breasts, a prominent double-chin, her ass had expanded to 15ft wide and her stomach expanded to 13ft wide. \u201cListen. This is your second strike. If I catch you even thinking about breaking company rules, you\u2019re out of here. Dasvidaniya.\u201d Sasha hung up and let out a sigh as she snorted loudly and erupted air out of her new rhinoceros nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha then heard the cellphone ring again and let out a sigh as she answered the phone. She saw that it was none other than Peotr at the phone. She answered the phone and let out a sigh, still oblivious to the fact that she was a titanically obese and huge prehistoric rhinoceros. \u201cZdravstuyte, Sasha,\u201d said Peotr. \u201cSo, how did it work?\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said Sasha as she drank a bottle of vodka. \u201cI don\u2019t see any immediate results. If there isn\u2019t anything within 24 hours, I\u2019m junking the project. You can waste your own money for a change.\u201d \u201cDrat. In other news, there\u2019s a movie tonight. It\u2019s a new romance film and I was wondering.\u201d \u201cSorry, Peotr. I have a meeting with the board of directors in five. I\u2019ll talk to you later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha walked away getting ready to meet with her top executives. As she was stepping forward, the floor cracked under her heavy feet and she passed a mirror. But does the great Sasha Zolnerowich look into the mirror and discovery her transformation?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Remarkably, despite being turned into a giant obese rhinoceros that was apparently still getting bigger, Sasha completely failed to notice her own transformation as she was walking to the meeting. As she walked out the door, Sasha\u2019s secretary gasped at the sight of her. Sasha however, had no idea why her secretary reacted the way she did. \u201cClose your mouth, Anya,\u201d said Sasha. \u201cYou\u2019ll attract flies that way.\u201d The elasmotherium giantess just walked away, prompting her employees to stare at her as she moved down the hallway and unnoticingly caused the walls to crack as her booty pressed against them with each passing step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside another room, The Pangaea Foundation\u2019s board of directors had met up and were waiting for Sasha. \u201cDurak,\u201d said one of them with a thick beard and a fedora hat. \u201cInga, you are durak.\u201d \u201cHow am I an idiot?\u201d asked a female executive. \u201cYou were the one who broke Sasha\u2019s policy. She\u2019s going to be in a bad mood.\u201d \u201cRassilikov,\u201d said a white-haired executive. \u201cThe only reason you are so anxious is because Ms. Zolnerovich vetoed your last three project proposals. She\u2019s as stone-faced as they come. If she was even more thick-skinned, she\u2019d be a rhinoceros.\u201d Most of the admins laughed before there was a shaking sound and then a crashing sound. They turned and looked in shock because Sasha had smashed her way right through the wall, seeing that she couldn\u2019t possibly have fit through such a tiny door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am going to have to have word with architect,\u201d said Sasha, still oblivious to turning into an elasmotherium. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s more deplorable. Such inhumanly small doors or such fragile walls. Sorry about the mess, everyone.\u201d That was when Sasha realized that her directors were too stunned to speak with her. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d asked Sasha. \u201cSo nobody is in the mood to talk? This meeting was your idea to begin with.\u201d Sasha\u2019s admins still weren\u2019t speaking and prompted Sasha to tap her large foot impatiently and shake up the room while at the same time causing the floor to crack slightly. \u201cI\u2019m waiting for a response.\u201d \u201cSasha,\u201d said the white-haired man. \u201cAre you feeling alright? You look... not you?\u201d \u201cWhat is that supposed to mean?\u201d asked Sasha. \u201cYou seriously can\u2019t be so married to your work that you haven\u2019t noticed that you\u2019ve turned into a rhinoceros the size of a car?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha looked at her executives as if they were insane. \u201cHave you all gone mental?! I know we\u2019ve been working around the clock lately, but not enough to be hallucinating. Me, a rhino?\u201d \u201cBoss,\u201d said Inga. \u201cLook in the mirror.\u201d Sasha grumbled to herself because she was certain that her directors were seeing things and then snorted again. \u201cAlright,\u201d she said. \u201cJust to shut you up and keep the ball rolling.\u201d Sasha took out her makeup mirror and opened it before she screamed and dropped it. She had finally seen what happened. She felt her horn in horror and then turned around to see her butt had just about finished assassinating her skirt and wagged her new tail before she felt her thick elasmotherium stomach and snorted again. Then she realized what caused her transformation. \u201cPeotr.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Peotr was at the water cooler when one of his coworkers tapped him on the back. \u201cPeotr,\u201d he said. \u201cYou look surprisingly chipper for dead man.\u201d \u201cDead man?\u201d asked Peotr. \u201cWhat do you mean, Ivan?\u201d Ivan gave a smug grin. \u201cBoss lady had violent reaction to your skin lotion. It turned Ms. Zolnerovich into a giant obese rhinoceros.\u201d \u201cWhat?!\u201d yelled Peotr in shock. He had absolutely no idea that his lotion would mutate Sasha. \u201cIt can\u2019t be true,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s impossible.\u201d \u201cApparently it is possible. Last I saw, she was as big as a house. I wouldn\u2019t want to be you, comrade.\u201d Peotr was horrified. If the Navsegda transformed his boss into a rhino, not only would it be his job on ice, but even thinking about asking her out on a date was out of the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Sasha called Peotr over the loudspeaker. \u201cPeotr Kragoff. I want you in my office in exactly one minute.\u201d Peotr gulped because he was certain Sasha was mad at him for the fiasco. Ivan decided to taunt Peotr by humming a funeral march as Peotr walked away. \u201cYou are definitely going to be rhino feed, my friend.\u201d As Peotr was making his way up to Sasha\u2019s office, he was thinking to himself. \u201cImpossible. I couldn\u2019t have accidentally created mutagen. It\u2019s impossible. Isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u2028\u2028<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeotr soon came to Sasha\u2019s office where Sasha\u2019s secretary let him right in. \u201cSasha?\u201d asked Peotr. \u201cAre you... good grief!\u201d Peotr looked up to see that Sasha had actually gotten much bigger. She was now 30ft high with a 45ft wide ass and 40ft wide belly and E-Cup breasts. She was so blobbish that she appeared to have four chins. Because her suit had been torn up, she was reduced to wearing a rather large bikini that even with its large size, looked as though it was painted on her body. Peotr couldn\u2019t believe it. He really did turn his boss/crush into a rhinoceros giantess and he was sure he would be lucky if she merely decided to fire him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeotr walked in as Sasha looked down at him with...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"This is getting out of control...\" Rachel muttered to herself as she poured a glass of of orange juice to join a slice turkey sandwich and an apple on a wooden tray. The sight laid out before her had become like a routine for her, driving her insane the longer her husband stayed in his slum, which she ended up being dragged into as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"THAT'S IT!!!\"</i> She could hear a crazed voice cackle with glee through the ceiling above, as with so many other \"ideas\" that would end with him sobbing on the floor in the fetal position. With an exasperated sigh, Rachel rolled her eyes and waltzed to the steps to James' room with the tray in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hesitated with her hand inches from the knob, fearing whatever state the room and her husband would be when she'd open the door, but upon pushing it open could only see darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only light in the room came from a book lamp on the desk where her husband was seated, who was too preoccupied scribbling complex diagrams to notice her enter. Even in the darkness she could see that the room was an absolute wreck: the bed was unmade with clothes haphazardly thrown into the ajar closet and erratically opened drawers of his wardrobe, while the walls were coated with elaborate blueprints of cabinets or structures labeled with secret compartments and trapdoors, many of which were shredded  apart and tossed to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...James?\" She spoke carefully, allowing him to know she was there. \"Everything alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is it, Rachel!\" He spoke confidently, as he had, of course, many times before. \"I've finally found my big break!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned back and presumed his ramblings as Rachel gently approached the desk and set the tray next to him. \"Sweetie, don't you think it'd be a good time to take a break?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about that, dear, I took my fifteen minutes two hours ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James, this isn't some crazy office you're living in, this is your house! You've been going nuts on all this stuff for three weeks! Don't beat on your brainpower this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rachel, please, this is serious!\" He spoke seriously. \"I appreciate your concern, but I've been performing magic too long without putting any effort into making a name for myself amongst magicians everywhere!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James, you're an awesome magician!\" Rachel argued. \"You don't have to go through ghost all this carp with what you've already got!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but all magicians have their icons!\" He argued with a determined posture. \"They all have  the trick painted on their posters as they're lit below whilst hung on the theater, what makes their name the threshold of a genre of styles! By  this!\" He shook a folder stuffed with papers in excitement. \"This is my new routine! Speaking of which, I need your help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My help? For what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here!\" He roads he  a fire ax from beneath the desk, making herself before she caught it with both hands. \"There's an old wardrobe in the attic, and I'd like you to chop it into boards!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The attic?! Hey, wait a minute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, can't explain! Sworn to secrecy!\"  He got up and began guiding her to the door and showed her out, waving goodbye once she was out of the door frame. \"Ta ta!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could argue again, he courtly shut the door in her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">.....</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything in the attic looked like it was covered by a milky blanket of cobwebs, with only vague shapes or structures beneath to discern what everything was. However, a wardrobe was completely untouched as it sat in the corner within a clear circle of floor untouched by web.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that the one he was talking about?\" As Rachel walked closer she could sense a pungent odor from something inside, but opening the door hit her with one of the most foul, rank stenches she could ever imagine as a pile of rotten moth balls sitting on the bottom rolled out onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, GOD!!!\" She gagged as she backed away, a sick pang in her stomach as she coughed out the rancid air. With the blade of the axe she swept aside most of the balls, allowing her to stand near the cabinet without wanting to retch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wardrobe itself had a rather ornate design for its simplistic shape. The edges were bordered with geometric spirals traveling its entire height, with a dark brown finish, complete with a full body mrror inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what? Screw this!\" She spat as swung the axe's blade into the floor. \"I'm not destroying this! It's an antique!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she could also see a lumpy shape hanging behind the left door. She reached in and pulled out a white and black striped wool jacket, with a golden brooch shaped like a moth with a dark black gem in the center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...not bad!\" She whistled as she turned the jacket around, assessing its size. Out of curiosity she slid her arms into its sleeves, and buttoned the front into a perfect fit. She looked at herself in the mirror and smiled at her reflection, turning around, but a faint shimmer shone from the gem caught her eye as her back was to the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave the brooch a tug to undo the pin, but it clung onto the wool in a strange way, as though it was part of the material. But the weirdest part was that it somehow seemed to glow black with what seemed to be an otherworldly energy. She pulled at the brooch to find its seam, but a growing approach of black in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was her own stomach, which stuck out a few inches further than usual. In a brief instance she was gripped by the fear that she'd been living more a lazy life style than she'd thought, but upon rubbing it with her hand it instantly swelled several times it's size and began to hung on top of her belt with all its weight, causing the buckle to tear apart as the front of her black shirt tore open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE HELL?!!?!\" But she looked back at the  reflection to see a large, round growth sprouting  around her rear end that tore through the back of her jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut a powerful itching coarsed through her limbs as the cells beneath her skin started to change, the skin on fattening limbs turning into a sleek black with sharp hairs growing on their undersides. A patch of white hair floofed out of her collar as her chest sprouted a garden of fluff, while the exposed skin of her stomach stiffened into dark ridges of a thigh exoskeleton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind was flooded with her own senses, making he  unable to resist the transformation spreading through her body. Her clothes were completely shredded around the expanding girth of her limbs, but the jacket remained intact around her enormous size. She was becoming obese at a size no human could ever believe was possible, but the human aspects of her form dematerialized beneath her monochromatic exterior. Her head was the last to go, but as the fur stretched over her face her nostrils fused shut before her nose completely flattened into her face, mouth melding into stubby pincers in the corners of her beak whilst her eyes turned a shiny black, which two spindly antennae growing that hung against her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as her transformation wrapped around that her body that her stomachs big enough to stand in the ground, and her butt growth had developed into a large thorax. But she still clutched her head and let out a sick groan as her growth continued, in more ways than one. As every part of her body bloated up, she was also growing taller, giving her ballooning weight as much volume within the now cramped attic as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the blur in her eyes began to clear away she was already over nine feet tall, her head touching the ceiling even as the floor bowed under her mass. Her maw was pressed from either side by both of her gargantuan breasts perched on her stomach, which had ballooned into an almost spherical blob of flesh packed that formed a soft crease around its equator as it poured into a huge mountain the ground, packed within black armor. Her arms and legs hung off her bulk like overstuffed ink blobs, weighing down on her muscles while filled a few feet in width each by drooping fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What...what happened?</i> Her mind was still a mess in the wake of her sensory bombardment, but the feeling and sight of her enormous frame tossed the dirt around even more, like she was waking up from a dream. She looked over her shoulder to see her thorax, which was now the size of a minivan, but with only enough of a chance before physics finally caught up to her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>CRACK</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floor tore apart beneath her, as did the next floor, which she completely obliterated before slamming into the concrete floor of the basement floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove her, she could see the floors above her dissected with two holes covering almost the entire span of the room above, the walls of which were covered with blueprints. At the edge half of he  husband's head peeked over, his eyes wide with horror at the sight of the creature below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-W-W-What... W-What the...\"</span></div></div>",

Rachel held her head and then turned to look in a mirror and screamed very loudly. She had become a huge 25ft tall, black and white striped moth; a silk moth from the looks of it with big black eyes the size of watermelons. She saw that her thorax was the size of a mini-van and was so big that it burst through the wall. Her legs were as thick as tree trunks, to say nothing of her arms. Speaking of which, she now had four arms, just like a bug and had fluffy antennae with a colossal 28ft wide belly. Finally, she had a pair of lavender and pale pink colored wings that looked like they had a wingspan of 50ft and her hair had turned a palish pink color as well. Rachel was in utter horror at what she had become. Also, she was completely stark naked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh!\" shouted the colossal silk moth woman. \"What has happened to me?!\" James backed away in fear of the moth that he didn't realize was his wife. \"James!\" yelled Rachel. \"Don't panic It's till me, James. It's me!\" James then gasped in surprise. \"Rachel?\" asked James. Rachel lowered her head and James looked in shock at his wife. \"What happened to you, Rachel? You're a giant moth.\" Rachel just fluttered her wings. \"You know that wardrobe that you asked me to chop up?\" \"Well did you?\" asked James. \"I need it chopped up for my act.\" Rachel gave a hiss and forced her husband to cower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" said Rachel. \"SURPRISE! There was a black and white jacket inside with a brooch shaped like a moth and when I put it on, POOF! Now, I'm a giant bug. And I think I'm getting bigger.\" Rachel stepped forward and accidentally broke the table while at the same time, flattening the couch beneath her huge stomach. James could only look in surprise at what his wife had transformed into. \"Unbelievable,\" he said. \"This is unbelievable. It shouldn't be possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel then lifted her head and grunted because now her head was in the attic while her body was downstairs. James had to move out of the way as debris fell down from the destroyed attic. \"Well,\" said Rachel. \"For a stage magician, somehow you must've gotten a hold of something that was really magical and it cursed me. Oh, this is just great. My mother warned me not to marry you. If only she knew.\" \"Calm down, Rachel! We'll get through this. Of course, I don't think that I can change you back.\" Rachel let out a scream at that as the moth giantess grabbed her feelers and then shook her head a few times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel would've ranted again over her predicament but then both she and her husband heard a very loud rumbling sound that caused the walls to crack. Rachel then felt her bloated stomach and moaned. \"James!\" she yelled. \"I am starving!\" James knew that having a giant upset wife was not a good situation and it would be even worse with the moth giantess hungry, so he went into the kitchen and emptied out the entire fridge. Rachel wasn't even bothering to chew her food. Instead she swallowed everything whole. An entire roast chicken, several tomatoes, an entire watermelon, a stick of butter, an entire gallon of orange juice, an entire clove of broccoli, a bowl of leftover mashed potatoes, a rib roast... everything disappeared down the black hole that was Rachel's mouth. Rachel then banged her stomach. \"<i>Ja</i>-ames!\" she yelled. \"I'm still hungry.\" \"Calm down, Rachel. Don't get upset.\" James emptied out the Lazy Susan and decided to leave Rachel to her feast, lest she decide to eat him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rachel was eating, she seemed to be getting bigger and James begun to think about it. He looked over his plans for his next act and threw them into the way of Rachel's hungry hands for Rachel to swallow the papers whole. \"<i>This</i> is my big break,\" said James to himself. \"Perhaps Rachel being a moth might not be such a bad thing after all.\" James then had to cover his ears as Rachel paused from eating to let out a rather loud belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames walked up to the phone to make a call. \"Hello, this is Jameson the Great. I have finally found something that will make the audience drop dead in awe. The ultimate magic trick.\" As James was speaking on the phone, Rachel had eaten everything edible in the house and was still hungry, so she tore out and ate the entire fridge. Then she noticed the curtains and licked her lips before slurping them up. The hungry moth even decided that the car would be delicious and picked it up to devour it with a loud crunch. Rachel then pulled out a tire from her mouth and looked at it curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, James hung up on the phone. \"Good news, Rachel.\" \"What's good news?\" James let out a laugh and hugged a large section of his enormous moth wife's titanic tummy. \"I found my big break and its <i>you</i>. I've decided that your moth form will be the act.\" Rachel's jaw dropped at that comment as all four of her arms felt her massive thorax and booty. \"Now,\" said James. \"We need to get you a new outfit. It wouldn't be right for you to show up at the palace naked.\" \"The palace?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames laughed and nodded his head. \"Get ready, Rachel, my giant fat angel, we're going to be performing...\"</span></div></div>",

These days, the secret agent game can really go sour given things don\u2019t go as planned and things rarely do go as planned. Our stories begins in an airport in Brisbane Australia where two characters resembling secret agents dressed in black with dark glasses were waiting. One was a dark skinned aborigine girl while the other was a fair skinned young man with long red hair. The girl was holding up a communications device designed to resemble a violet brooch when a voice came out of it. \u201cAgent Charlie, Agent Delta,\u201d said a voice on the phone. \u201cDo you read me?\u201d \u201cLoud and clear Bravo,\u201d said Agent Charlie, the female agent. \u201cWe expect the courier for Dr. Wafflestomper is about to arrive in Brisbane. The root rat has been conducting weird experiments again.\u201d \u201cKeep your eyes open, Agent Charlie,\u201d said Agent Bravo. \u201cWe have reports that he\u2019s been researching the local venomous animals. Whatever the mad doctor is up to, you can know for sure that it won\u2019t be anything good.\u201d \u201cRoger, Bravo.\u201d Said Charlie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgent Delta let out a scoff. \u201cTeacher\u2019s pet.\u201d \u201cBe quiet, Delta,\u201d said Charlie. \u201cYou heard Bravo, this is a dangerous criminal that we\u2019re dealing with. Who knows what Dr. Wafflestomper is up to.\u201d On a plane arriving in Brisbane, there was a man with a mysterious package. On the man\u2019s neck was a tattoo of a yellow double oblong and the man was then looking at his watch before it beeped. \u201cI\u2019m on my way back to Brisbane right now with the formula. Doc, I don\u2019t mean any offense but perhaps this plan is ill-thought out.\u201d On the watch phone, there was the sound of a goofy voice. \u201cWhat do you mean my plan is ill-thought out? It couldn\u2019t be simpler. I just took a venomous animal from the outback and synthesized its venom in order to create the ultimate super weapon that will take over the Brisbane area!\u201d \u201cYeah, but a platypus?\u201d \u201cPlatypi are venomous.\u201d \u201cOnly the males.\u201d Said the courier under his breath. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d asked Dr. Wafflestomper on the other end of the phone. The courier let out a sigh. \u201cNothing, Doc.\u201d The man with the oblong tattoos then let out a sigh as he hung up with his boss. \u201cI passed up the job in G.H.O.U.L. for this?\u201d The courier then opened up his briefcase and looked at a vial of what appeared to be a strange aqua colored slime inside of it. \u201cI really hope this stuff works like the doc said it will. I\u2019m getting really sick of his idiotic plans.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the airport, Agents Charlie and Delta had bought sodas to pass the time as they waited for the courier to show up. \u201cSo,\u201d said Agent Delta to his partner. \u201cHow are we going to know this courier when we see him.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said Agent Charlie. \u201cFor one, Agent India said that he was carrying a strange briefcase and that he had a double oblong tattoo on his neck. I don\u2019t know what Dr. Wafflestomper is up too, but I know that it\u2019s probably going to be something stupid.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t get me started,\u201d said Agent Delta. \u201cWhen I signed up for Interpol, I had no idea that we\u2019d be dealing with the goofiest mad scientist in the world. His plans are downright moronic.\u201d Charlie lowered her sunglasses to speak with Delta. \u201cIt\u2019s usually idiots who are the more dangerous ones. And speaking of idiots.\u201d<br>\r\n\u2028Charlie pointed to Dr. Wafflestomper\u2019s courier and both agents walked up to him. The courier paused slightly just to look into his briefcase in order to take a good look at the strange vial that he had been carrying with him and then he nodded his head. However, that\u2019s when Agent Charlie and Agent Delta appeared and caught the man by surprise. \u201cWhat\u2019s in the case?\u201d asked Charlie with a smirk. \u201cSomething for us? Or something for the doc.\u201d The courier begun to sweat and then ran away with the secret agents both running after him.</span></div></div>",

He saw a cart carrying various luggage and tossed it at the agents, knocking Delta to the ground. \u201cDelta!\u201d yelled Charlie. Delta grunted. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Get him.\u201d Agent Charlie nodded her head and ran after the man with the oblong tattoo. Charlie took out a soda bottle that turned into a motorcycle in order to chase after the thug as he was driving away in a car. Charlie pursued the courier and the courier shot at her but Charlie moved in a zigzag pattern to avoid the bullets. The man with the oblong tattoo was so busy trying to shoot Agent Charlie that he neglected to realize that he was about to crash into a telephone pole.<br>\r\n\u2028The man yelled and then dove out of the car before rolling to the side in an attempt to get away as Charlie parked her motorcycle and made it turn back into a bottle. Charlie ran after the enemy agent and took out her gun to shoot at him. However, she missed and shot the handles right off of the case that the man was carrying.That case filled with slime fell on the ground and Charlie stepped on it, breaking the case and causing the slime to turn into smoke and envelop her. \u201cCrikey!\u201d she yelled. The man with the oblong tattoo bit his mouth. \u201cOh no,\u201d he groaned. \u201cThe boss will kill me.\u201d Charlie ran out and coughed before she continued to follow after the man. Delta ran forward but didn\u2019t see Charlie anywhere in sight. \u201cWhere did she go?\u201d asked Delta about the whereabouts of his partner. Charlie at the time was continuing to run and she even appeared to be coughing. \u201cOh,\u201d groaned Charlie. \u201cWhat was in that stuff.\u201d Charlie coughing so uncontrollably was what allowed the man with the oblong tattoo to run away and escape. However, Charlie was about to have even bigger problems to worry about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgent Charlie had ran out into the street and was coughing. Since it was dark, she couldn\u2019t find the man who had hid in a telephone booth. \u201cThat super steroid was meant for use on platypuses,\u201d muttered the mysterious man. \u201cNot humans. Who knows what will happen?\u201d Sydney ran down an alleyway and was coughing to herself. \u201cOh,\u201d groaned Charlie. \u201cI don\u2019t feel good.\u201d Charlie begun to feel dizzy and from the looks of it, her skin was changing an aqua green color as her hair turned yellow-green and as she walked forward, she appeared to be getting taller. Charlie held her stomach and suddenly it had become very bloated as she hiccuped. The female agent\u2019s belly expanded to the point where it tore through her uniform and made her belt snap off. Charlie\u2019s pants also slipped off as her thighs expanded and her aqua skin appeared to be turning into fur. Sydney noticed how big her belly was and gasped. \u201cWhat in Blue Billa Bong?!\u201d she yelled. Charlie lifted up her stomach and what she saw of her feet had turned into webbed claws. She looked at her hands and saw they were the same way before she gasped. \u201cOh no.\u201d She said. Charlie then grunted and held her face as she appeared to have sprouted a large duck\u2019s bill. She bent down to see that her ass was the size of a monster truck and in seconds, it had sprouted a beaver\u2019s tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the transformation was over, Charlie looked and saw she had transformed into an enormous and obese anthropomorphic platypus woman. She gave a nervous trill before she shook her head. As Sydney was walking away, she noticed that she was passing by a closed hat store that had a large fedora decoration on top. The giant platypus girl picked up the fedora and then placed it on her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know why,\u201d she said. \u201cBut this seems more natural. Now, I had better find Delta before some other yobbos show up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the enormous platypus begun to walk away.</span></div></div>",

She was a 25-year old Muslim woman who was visiting the gym like she did every Friday while her husband was busy at work. However, after a while, the process had become mundane and Farrah just exhaled and let out a sigh as she walked up towards the treadmill. \u201cWelcome to you life,\u201d thought Farrah to herself. \u201cSo this is what I have to look forward to on Friday.\u201d The woman blew on her hijab as she was wondering what to do next. She was watching the news on a television in the gym but everything was either uninteresting or bad news. \u201cGood grief,\u201d thought Farrah to herself. \u201cI can\u2019t believe somebody would do such a terrible thing, especially a dentist. It\u2019s appalling. Then again, hanging him would probably be going a bit too far.\u201d Farrah then begun to gag and had to stop the treadmill. She was thirsty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt happens every time,\u201d groaned the female athlete to herself as she walked up to a nearby fountain. \u201cI always get tuckered out and have to stop for water.\u201d As Farrah refilled her water bottle, she reflected on how she seemed to always get dehydrated easily. She hated it because it kept her from really getting anything done and she let out a sigh. However, right before Farrah could resume her exercise, she felt somebody tap her in the back. Farrah turned and wound up kicking a man in the waist as he grunted. The man was a middle-aged looking gray-haired man with glasses in a strange suit and grunted in pain before he got on his knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean you no harm.\u201d Grunted the man. However, Farrah just raised an eyebrow. \u201cReally?\u201d she asked. \u201cI\u2019ve heard that from perverts hundreds of time. It\u2019s a good thing I took those self-defense classes. For the record, I\u2019m married.\u201d \u201cWait, wait, wait, wait,\u201d said the man. \u201cI\u2019m serious. I represent Crystal Cola.\u201d \u201cCrystal Cola?\u201d asked Farrah. \u201cThat sports drink they sell at the gym.\u201d\u2028\u2028The man got up before he further explained his intentions to Farrah. \u201cThat\u2019s correct, ma\u2019am. My intention is to find somebody who can test out our company\u2019s new experimental drink that won\u2019t be ready for the market for at least a month.\u201d Farrah raised her eyebrow again. \u201cGo on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Farrah didn\u2019t know where this was going but anything experimental sounded absolutely dangerous. However, it would probably do well to relieve her of the monotonous lifestyle she had been leading for so long. The representative then took out a strange purple can of soda with a black steampunk robotic camel on the front of it. \u201cThis is Crystal Cola\u2019s newest albeit top secret product; Camel Cola. One can of these soda and the drinker will be able to go without drinking anything for weeks, in theory that is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man handed the can to Farrah who proceeded to take it before she held it up and inspected it. \u201cThe problem is,\u201d said the representative. \u201cWe still need to test this soda out to make sure that it works. Of course, there aren\u2019t a lot of people willing to volunteer for this experiment. Just for the record, this soda has no sugar or calories.\u201d \u201cWhere\u2019s the fun in that?\u201d asked Farrah to herself. \u201cSo, you want me to test it out.\u201d The man nodded his head. \u201cAfter you drink the soda, keep the can. There\u2019s a phone number to call for after the three weeks are up to see if it works. Then we\u2019ll be ready to unleash it. Good day to you, Mrs...\u201d \u201cJust call me Farrah.\u201d Said Farrah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028Once the man left, Farrah went into the women\u2019s locker room and carefully read the soda can. From the looks of it, she couldn\u2019t tell exactly what was in Camel Cola. \u201cHmm,\u201d she said. \u201cThis seems ominous. However, it could also be fun.\u201d Farrah shrugged her shoulders and then started to drink the soda.</span></div></div>",

I just hope I don\u2019t get thirsty again.\u201d Farrah crunched the can and would\u2019ve thrown it out, but then she remembered that the man had explicitly instructed her to keep the can for after the test was over to call the company back. So, she simply put the can in the back of her shorts pocket and then walked out to get back to exercising. Farrah went back on the treadmill and was walking for half an hour without so much as a sweat. From the looks of it, the soda appeared to be doing exactly what the man was supposed to do. Or so she thought, Farrah didn\u2019t notice it, but her butt had gotten slightly wider and she appeared to have sprouted a tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFarrah then moved on to the rowing machine but as she was operating the machine, she failed to notice that her arms and legs actually seemed to be getting wider and thicker. The other patrons of the gym were sweating. Farrah then moved on to lifting a large weight that from the looks of it, weighed two thousand pounds. As she was lifting, she was listening to her iPod and failed to notice that with every lift her stomach seemed to be bulging and bulging. Several bodybuilders took note of this and put their own weights down right before Farrah stood up and loosened her hijab due to the intense heat. She even blew out some air before she decided to leave the gym. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Farrah checked out, the gym manager gasped because Farrah was now 10ft tall and looked like she weighed 600lbs of flab. Before the gym manager could say anything, several of the bodybuilders came to confront him. \u201cWhat kind of a place are you running? We saw that woman exercising all day and she suddenly became obese.\u201d The manager was mumbling nervously as he tried in vain to explain exactly what was happening. But he couldn\u2019t find the right words to explain it and found himself in hot water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFarrah was jogging home, knowing that her husband would be back from work soon and was so busy listening to music that she had no idea that she was getting bigger with every step. First, her feet turned into what looked like hooves and burst out of her shoes. Her ass expanded as her shorts were stretched out and shrunk. Her belly bulged out as a thick golden brown fur started to sprout and grow all over her growing body. She then begun to slouch as her neck extended and two large humps grew out of her new hunched back, tearing through her shirt. Finally, Farrah\u2019s ears stretched out and then her mouth appeared to stretch out into a snout before she gave a grunt. Of course, Farrah had yet to realize that she was indeed transforming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028By the time Farrah got back home, the young woman had transformed into a 15ft tall and 10 ton Bactrian camel (Bactrian camels are the camels with two humps while single-humped camels are called dromedaries). Her breasts had expanded to E-cup size with thighs as thick as boulders and a 20ft belly and butt. Farrah had some trouble squeezing in through the front door until she finally got all the way through and shook her head. \u201cMan,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get a bigger door. Francis is going to be home soon. I better get dinner ready and...\u201d That\u2019s when Farrah gasped. She looked in surprise because there was a mirror in front of her. Farrah looked into the mirror and saw her transformed state. She even turned around to see how her butt had gotten so big that her panties and shorts tore off. She was only wearing a hijab and a tanktop at this point. \u201cOh my.\u201d She said in shock at her transformed state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Farrah take her transformation into a huge and obese two-humped camel?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Most people would be afraid of such a development. However, Farrah was not only not afraid but she was smiling. \u201cWell,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is strange. It must be a side-effect. No wonder they call it camel cola. So that\u2019s what they mean when they mention going weeks without water. Huh, it looks more along the lines that I\u2019m retaining said water. The Pacific Ocean from the looks of it.\u201d Farrah tapped her 20ft wide girth and then let out a laugh. \u201cI might\u2019ve just found a permanent cure for terminal boredom. Oh my gosh, it\u2019s almost five o\u2019clock. Francis will be home soon. I better get dinner ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe camel giantess walked into the kitchen, lowering her neck in order to avoid injuring herself on the doorway. However, she soon had trouble because one of her humps got stuck. She grunted a few times before she squeezed her humps through, but then she couldn\u2019t move because now her butt was stuck in the doorway. Farrah let out a groan and pulled on her hijab slightly before she simply wiggled her massive badonk in order to shatter the doorway and make it bigger. \u201cGeez,\u201d said the obese and huge camel woman. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t the humps, it\u2019s the cheeks. Nobody said being a camel was going to be easy. I might have actually gotten bigger. Maybe I\u2019m still growing. It\u2019s gonna be real fun to see how big I get.\u201d Farrah then laughed and took out a leg of lamb to cook for hers and Francis\u2019s dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Farrah was preparing dinner, her husband, Francis was riding on the bus home from work and was reading the newspaper as he was eating a hamburger. \u201cFarrah would kill me if she knew I was eating this,\u201d he thought to himself. \u201cBut just because she isn\u2019t allowed to eat this stuff doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t. Nobody said mixed marriages were without their complications.\u201d Francis quickly got rid of the burger wrapper before he returned to the paper. \u201cCrystal Cola Suspected of Questionable Chemicals: The soft drink company, Crystal Cola, is believed at the threat of going bankrupted, resorted to the use of unknown and potentially dangerous chemicals within their soft drinks. Might be facing a lawsuit.\u201d Francis then let out a scoff. \u201cGive me a break. Nobody really knows what\u2019s in those soft drinks. Ah, here is my stop. Farrah should be home already.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancis got off and walked into the house only to look in surprise at the large hoof prints pressed into the floorboards. \u201cWhat the heck happened to the floor?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt looks like a camel's been stomping around on it. For that matter, what happened to the doorway. Farrah, are you in here.\u201d \u201cOh!\u201d yelled Farrah. \u201cHello, Francis. How was work?\u201d Francis then turned his head and looked in horror and surprise as Farrah waddled out of the kitchen. He saw the giant obese camel woman who was his wife staring down on him. At first he didn\u2019t realize it was Farrah but when he saw her veil on the creature, he all but fainted because he knew it could only be his wife. Farrah then stretched out her neck to kiss her husband and cover his face in camel saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFarrah!?\u201d Francis yelled. \u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d said Farrah with a giggle. \u201cI was at the gym when somebody asked me to test out an unreleased soft drink. That\u2019s the can in came in over there.\u201d Francis walked up to the can that was on the table and picked it up to inspect as he was still processing the fact that his wife was now an enormous and fat camel. \u201cSo, anyhow, it turned me into a camel. Who knew. Oh, dinner will be ready soon.\u201d With that, Farrah walked back into the kitchen, leaving Francis to stare at her enormous humps and big rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow exactly does Francis take this development?</span></div></div>",

He held up the can of Camel Cola and noticed that there was a phone number written on the side. \"Uh,\" he said. \"Honey. I'm going to just make a call.\" \"That's fine, Honey.\" Said Farrah as she continued to prepare dinner. However, the phone was right behind Farrah and the camel woman's massive ass was in the way. Francis let out a sigh as she squeeze past his wife's colossal butt cheeks and wound up pressed to the wall right by the phone. Francis dialed on the phone as his huge wife unwittingly begun to grind him to the wall as she wiggled her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancis nervously stroke one of the camel woman's humps right before he heard a dial tone and then a click. \"Hello, Crystal Cola. How may I help you?\" \"Do you make the energy drink, Camel Cola?\" asked Francis with an angry tone in his voice. \"My name is Francis Cohen. My wife Farrah took your kooky cola and it mutated her into a camel the size of a dinosaur.\" \"What?\" asked the man on the other end of the line. \"Please hold, sir. We'll get to the bottom of this.\" Francis tapped on one of Farrah's massive butt cheeks. \"Poor choice of words.\" Francis had no choice but to wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Francis was on the phone, Farrah had finished cooking a mouton dinner and brought the meal to the table. Francis was still holding the phone while he had his dinner and noticed that his wife was voraciously devouring her meat while using 4 chairs at once to hold up her bulk and her belly was even pouring over onto the table. Francis was still waiting and bit his lip nervously. \"Isn't it cannibalism for a camel to eat meat?\" Farrah just shrugged her shoulders and continued to eat. Francis drank his water as he continued to hold the phone and then realized that Farrah had no beverage to speak, only food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put down the phone, Honey,\" said Farrah. \"I kind of like being a big camel.\" \"But you look even bigger than you were a few minutes ago. How big are you going to get?\" \"How should I know?\" asked Farrah. \"I thought you'd like this, honey.\" Francis bit his lip slightly. \"Everybody is going to talk.\" At that exact moment, the Crystal Cola company finally responded to Francis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Cohen,\" said the man on the other end of the line. \"I just checked with my superiors and they apologize deeply for this. As it turns out, the Camel Cola was made using actual camel genes. The idea was that it would allow human beings to stay hydrated without having to drink for a long period of time, much like camels do. However, it turns out that only 1 in every million people actually have a certain gene that's required for the mutation that your wife has undergone to take place.\" \"Well,\" said Francis in annoyance. \"What about the antidote.\" The service representative let out a deep sigh. \"I'm afraid that we have no way to turn your wife back to normal.\" \"I'm going to be married to a camel for the rest of my life!?\" yelled Francis. \"How could your idiot company be so irresponsible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe representative begun to sweat as he knew all too well that Francis was in a position to file a lawsuit against the company. \"Mr. Cohen. I can assure you that we are doing all that we can to refine the formula to make sure what happened to your wife doesn't happen again.\" Before Francis could open his mouth, Farrah felt her stomach and let out a deep belch. \"Ugh,\" said the camel giantess. \"I think I ate too much.\" Farrah then let out a hiccup and she begun to grow again and her humps pushed against the ceiling and caused it to break. Francis gasped and stepped back as the growing Farrah crushed the table underneath her hoof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe camel woman stopped growing and revealed that she was now 50ft tall and her belly and butt were both 100ft wide. The two-humped giantess held up her massive girth to keep it from crushing the house but her butt had expanded so much that it touched the ground even when she was standing up and crushed several cars, even making one go off. On the street, there was a man staring as the dog he was walking barked at the enormous camel lady. \"Oh darn,\" said Farrah with a laugh. \"I seem to have outgrown the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancis sputtered a few times as he saw his wife walking away from the house with the hole in the roof and then turned angrily to the phone. \"Now she's 50ft tall! You can expect a lawsuit, buster!\" \"Don't lose your temper, sir. I just contacted the CEO of Crystal Cola and...\" \"Get him on the line!\" Farrah shook her head. \"Francis,\" she said. \"You really have to learn to control your temper. It isn't that bad.\" \"Farrah,\" said Francis. \"You're not taking this with the seriousness that it deserves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, the CEO of Crystal Cola was on the line. \"Hello, Mr. Cohen. I understand you have a complain.\" \"I've got several complaints, you jerk! Your soda turned my wife into a camel so big and fat, she could be mistaken for Godzilla's wife! I am ready to sue you for creating such a dangerous product.\" \"Mr. Cohen,\" said the CEO. \"I understand your anger. But if you hear me out, we can come to an agreement. I might not be able to turn your wife back to normal, but perhaps we can come to a solution that doesn't involve a lawsuit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut is Francis willing to listen?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was the day before Halloween in Salem Massachusetts and everyone was getting ready. However, our story is about two houses that stand out in particular. The first house is the home of Tim and Lydia Spellmans, a goth couple who were busy decorating their house for Halloween. The pale-skinned and slightly chubby Lydia was busy carving a pumpkin while Tim was setting up a gargoyle statue. \u201cIt\u2019s too bad that Halloween only comes once a year, Lydia,\u201d said Tim. \u201cIt would be nice if it came once a month.\u201d \u201cIt is too bad,\u201d said Lydia. \u201cFor the ghosts and ghouls and witches to only have one day to have fun. Take a look at this, Tim.\u201d Lydia showed her husband a jack-o-lantern carving in the shape of a skull and Tim let out a laugh. The fact was, for the Spellmans, Halloween could never come too soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, this was not the same for their cranky middle-aged neighbor, Maxine Parr. Maxine was a grumpy blonde haired and rail-thin woman who had a long nose that looked almost like a bird\u2019s beak. She saw the Spellmans preparing for Halloween and was disgusted. Maxine hated being next door to a couple of goths (she considered pink to be the only beautiful color in existence) and she also hated how cheerful the Spellmans were. \u201cI hate Halloween.\u201d She said as she took out her keys. But then, Lydia noticed her. \u201cHi, Maxine,\u201d said Lydia. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to decorate your house for Halloween.\u201d Maxine scoffed. \u201cA holiday where idiots dress up as fake monsters and witches only to hand out junk food to a bunch of dirty brats? If you think that I\u2019m going to take part in such a stupid holiday, you have another thing coming, Spellman.\u201d With that, Maxine slammed the door. Tim shook his head. \u201cThat woman is never happy. Don\u2019t waste your breath, Lydia.\u201d But Lydia shrugged her shoulders. \u201cHalloween isn\u2019t for everyone, Tim. Maybe she has bad memories of Halloween.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the Spellmans didn\u2019t know was that Maxine was a REAL witch and as she walked into her house, she took off her scarf to reveal a scar from an attempted lynching. She looked at a painting of herself from the times of the Salem Witch trials and then saw a literal skeleton in the closet that looked like it was actually real and looked like it had been burned. \u201cDid you ever see anything so ridiculous, Abigail?\u201d asked Maxine to the bones. \u201cHalloween is an insult to all us actual witches. Did you ever see a witch wearing a pointy hat or be covered in warts? That stereotype makes me psychotic. And living next door to those insufferable Halloween-loving Spellmans really drives me up the wall. I am just about ready to snap.\u201d Before Maxine could continue on with her tirade, she heard giggling from next door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaxine looked out the window to see the Spellmans from next door and was horrified. Lydia was wearing a costume that consisted of a long blue robe with a tiara made out of spikes and her hair worn in large horns that looked like a jester\u2019s hat. She was also carrying a long fake wand. \u201cHow do you like my witch queen outfit, Tim, honey?\u201d asked Lydia. Tim let out a whistle. \u201cLydia, baby,\u201d he said. \u201cYou look gorgeous.\u201d This was the last straw and Maxine was so mad seeing Lydia in a \u201cwitch queen\u201d outfit, that she blew smoke out of her ears. \u201cThat\u2019s it! No more Ms. Nice Witch! That was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. I\u2019m going to get that Lydia Spellman!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028Maxine was soon working at a cauldron and mixing weird potions together before she emptied the cauldron into some dust. She smirked as she held up the bowl of dust. The next morning, she saw Lydia and her husband having breakfast and then noticed Lydia eating a donut. Using her magic, Maxine blew her spell dust in such a way that it would land on Lydia\u2019s donut as she took a bite into it. \u201cThink of this as a new twist on an old curse, Spellman,\u201d said Maxine with an evil grin. \u201cAccording to fairytales, true love\u2019s kiss turns a frog into a prince. As soon as your husband leaves for work tonight and kisses you, the fun can begin.\u201d Maxine then let out a sinister laugh and kicked back to watch the fun.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Are you feeling alright?\u201d Lydia just gave a hiccup before she spoke again. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Probably just a little migraine.

As Tim was leaving, he saw Maxine with a smirk on her face. \u201cGood evening, Tim,\u201d said Maxine wickedly. \u201cWhat do you feel about amphibians?\u201d Tim just raised an eyebrow and got in his car before driving off. \u201cThat\u2019s weird,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like Maxine to be courteous.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaxine then immediately ran back into her house to look out her window and into Lydia\u2019s to see Lydia getting the candy ready for the trick-or-treaters. She looked at herself in her witch costume in the mirror and kept practicing an evil laugh, but it just turned into a giggle. Lydia\u2019s giggling irked Maxine as she was watching. \u201cLaugh while you can, little girl. You\u2019re about to feel a little hoppy.\u201d Lydia continued to feel her stomach and then went to get some aspirin. Lydia swallowed a couple of aspirin tablets and then realized something. \u201cOh,\u201d she said. \u201cI was supposed to take these with food.\u201d Lydia saw an apple in a nearby fruit bowl, but instead of walking out to get the fruit, she instinctively and spontaneously flicked out her tongue and snatched the apple into her mouth before she swallowed it whole and gasped. Maxine watched the scene and laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid I do that?\u201d asked Lydia rather sheepishly. \u201cWhat just happened?\u201d Lydia then gave a few hiccups and held her stomach again. Before Lydia could say anything else, she let out a loud croak and then a dragonfly flew by. Instinctively, the young woman snapped up the creature in her mouth and then chewed it up before eating it. Lydia gasped and blushed. What is happening to.... croak.\u201d Lydia held her stomach and felt it bulge out to several feet wide and then she felt her legs expand as well. The goth girl then screamed because she appeared to be getting taller. Maxine looked in confusion as she was spying on Lydia. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d asked Maxine. \u201cThat\u2019s not supposed to happen.\u201d Then Maxie grunted and held her head. \u201cThat idiot, Tim! He must\u2019ve kissed Lydia multiple times.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia grunted and groaned as her skin turned a grayish shade of yellow and her mouth stretched out as she grew a triple-chin. She ballooned to 10ft tall and had a 15ft wide belly and butt with D-cup breasts and then she looked at her hands to see her fingers were becoming webbed and she gasped. Surprisingly however, her witch queen costume was staying completely in tact as she was growing. Then Lydia saw warts sprout all over her body and then let out a croak. Maxine gasped and actually fainted when she saw what her evil spell did to Lydia. Lydia was now a 10ft tall, 6 ton and possibly still growing anthropomorphic toad. She let out a croak as she tried to wrap her head around her current predicament. But before she could even begin to ponder what happened, there was a knock at the door.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Next door, Maxine got up and she was very worried. \u201cGreet Beelzebub,\u201d she said. \u201cIf those brats see Lydia in her transformed state, they\u2019ll realize that there is a witch in town. They\u2019ll hang me for sure. Wait. What am I worried about. This isn\u2019t Salem. They don\u2019t hang witches here. I hope.\u201d Lydia was just as concerned as her evil neighbor was and gave a croak of distress. \u201cOh my gosh,\u201d she said. \u201cOh my gosh. Somebody is going to see me as a 10ft tall toad.\u201d Then Lydia realized something and then slapped herself in her rather fat face. \u201cI\u2019m such an idiot,\u201d she said with a nervous laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s Halloween. They\u2019ll just think that I\u2019m in a costume. Well, better get my Halloween on. Maybe this could be fun.\u201d Lydia gave a croak and then started to waddle up towards the door. As she did so, she spotted a praying mantis on the floor. Without even giving a second thought, the toad woman flicked out her tongue and swallowed the mantis whole. However, upon realizing what she did, she gagged and held onto her mouth. \"Oh good grief.\" She then stuck her own tongue out and groaned. But then she decided to grin and bear it and face the awaiting trick-or-treaters and inflated her throat in order to be more intimidating. After all, it was Halloween.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside there were three trick-or-treaters. One of them was dressed up as Spider-Man, another boy was dressed up as a vampire and the girl who was with them was dressed as Medusa. The female Chaperone was dressed like Leonardo Da Vinci\u2019s Virtruvian Man and smiled as she knocked on the door again. \u201cYou kids are going to enjoy this. The Spellmans practically worship Halloween.\u201d The Spider-Man kid let out a laugh and held up a toy web launcher. \u201cI\u2019m prepared for any scary surprise she might have waiting for us.\u201d \u201cShush,\u201d said the vampire boy. \u201cShe\u2019s coming.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia\u2019s door opened and the toad woman leapt out and let out a loud and bellowing croak. The three trick-or-treaters screamed at the roaring face of the giant toad woman in front of them. Lydia then stretched out her tongue and swung it like a whip as the children looked at her in fear. She even gave an evil laugh before drawing her tongue back into her mouth and then laughed very sweetly. \"Happy Halloween,\" said Lydia. \"The night where the creatures of darkness run free.\" Lydia laughed again and this time the children laughed with her as she was passing out the candy. \"Really cool.\" \"I'll admit, I was so scared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither the children nor their chaperone had any idea that Lydia's amphibian features weren't even part of her costume. \"I'm impressed,\" said the chaperone. \"Lydia, that is the most realistic costume I've ever seen. How did you get the warts and drool just right.\" Lydia gave a nervous laugh so her friend would be none the wiser about her transformation. \"Well,\" she said. \"Let's say it wasn't completely my own intention.\" Lydia's friend nodded her head and then felt Lydia's bloated stomach, much to the enormous toad woman's dismay. \"I gotta say,\" she said. \"I'd like to know what you're using for padding. Are you packing pillows underneath there, or is that just a fat suit?\" Lydia did not appreciate that crack about her weight and slapped her friend in the face with her tongue. \"Okay, okay, touchy aren't we. Okay kids. Off to the next house. Just don't go anywhere near that crank Maxine's house.\" \"Bye, Mrs. Spellman!\" \"Thanks for the candy!\" \"I love your costume, Mrs. Spellman.\" The children and their chaperone walked away, leaving Lydia to smile and shut herself back into her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the trick-or-treaters had left, Lydia breathed out a rather deep sigh of relief before she spotted a dragonfly flying up ahead. She flicked out her tongue in order to devour the dragonfly just like she devoured the praying mantis from earlier. She then gagged in horror. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m a giant toad and I\u2019m eating bugs and...\u201d Suddenly Lydia heard a ripping sound and saw that the back of the skirt on her witch queen costume was tearing apart. Lydia turned her head and saw her jack-o-lantern print panties. \u201cOh man,\u201d she groaned. \u201cHow am I going to explain this to Tim.\u201d Lydia was pacing back and forth as she was trying to figure out what caused her to transform and even croak a few times as she inflated her throat. The night went on with Lydia answering the door again and again and frightened trick-or-treaters with her appearance. She even swatted the hat off of one chaperone with her long tongue. Fortunately, because it was Halloween, nobody said anything about her monstrous appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Lydia had been given out all but one handful of candy and let out a sigh. \u201cWell,\u201d she said. \u201cThat should be the end of the trick-or-treaters. Of course, Tim is going to be surprised to learn that he\u2019s married to a sumo-sized toad.\u201d Lydia was about to finish off the rest of the candy when she heard a buzzing sound that filled her with dread. \u201cOh no.\u201d There was a firefly buzzing above and Lydia was trying to fight the urge to eat it. \u201cNo,\u201d said Lydia. \u201cI can\u2019t keep this up. I can\u2019t eat another bug.\u201d However, the fire fly was too tempting and Lydia shot out her tongue. However, she missed the firefly and accidentally broke the lightbulb on the ceiling, causing everything to go dark. \u201cRibbits.\u201d Groaned Lydia. Lydia saw the firefly and jumped up and caught it with her tongue before landing and creating a small quake that shook the entire house. \u201cOops.\u201d She said. Then, Lydia saw something rather strange that intrigued her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext door, Maxine was mixing together a cauldron in front of a statue of a demon of some kind. \u201cCome on,\u201d said Maxine. \u201cCome on. I\u2019ll give you the entire bottle if you can just tell me a way to protect myself from that giant toad.\u201d Lydia gasped because from the looks of it, Maxine was trying in desperation to invoke a demonic ritual of some sort. That was when realization struck. \u201cOh my gosh!\u201d she yelled. \u201cMaxine is a witch. Something tells me that she had something to do with this. And I thought all this time she was just an unpleasant neighbor.\u201d The toad giantess then let out a croak before she came out of the window in order to confront the witch, causing the windowsill to break under her weight. \"I'm going to give that witch a big old piece of my mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaxine just kept tending to her cauldron and grumbling to herself. \"Of all the times for a spell to backfire. Other witches don't have trouble turning people into....\" Before Maxine could even finish her sentence, there was a rather violent knocking on her door and then she heard a crashing noise and looked in horror at the now 20ft tall and 8 ton toad woman in front of her who was very mad. Maxine gulped and then stepped back as Lydia lowered her head. \"Oh no,\" said Maxine. \"Oh sweet Salem no.\" Maxine tried to get away but the toad giantess used her enormous girth before staring down at the villainous witch who was at this point frozen in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe it,\u201d said Lydia. \u201cAll these years we\u2019ve been neighbors and you were a witch this whole time! I knew you weren\u2019t exactly the most social or pleasant woman, but a witch!? I thought witches were supposed to dress in black and wear a pointed hat.\u201d Maxine lit a fireball into her hand and then snuffed it out as she grit her teeth. \u201cThat is yet another way you mortals have bastardized black witchcraft! You are so narrow-minded! This Halloween is a travesty! Your love of these insults to the forces of darkness trigger me, you chubby bitch. You and your husband are so pleasant that it makes me want to vomit. But that \u201cwitch queen\u201d costume was the final straw...\u201d \u201cSo you turned me into a giant toad?!\u201d Maxine kicked Lydia in the stomach but it was so soft and huge that her foot got stuck and she had to pull it out. \u201cI never meant to turn you into a giant toad. The spell was designed so that you\u2019d turn into a toad after that idiot husband of yours kissed you. But he kissed you three times in a row before the spell could take effect!\u201d Lydia gave a croak and inflated her throat. \u201cWell,\u201d she said to the witch. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a problem. You can just turn me back to normal and....\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaxine begun to jump up and down and grabbed the sides of her hair. \u201cIs there anything between those ears of yours, you ample, addle-minded amphibian!? yelled Maxine angrily. \u201cWhy would I design this spell to be capable of changing you back again! It\u2019s permanent!\u201d \u201cWhy would you do such a thing!?\u201d yelled Lydia. \u201cYou had no way of knowing the spell would actually work the way you wanted.\u201d \u201cShut up!\u201d Maxine slapped Lydia in the stomach a few times. \u201cI\u2019ve been casting evil spells for years and you dare to tell me how to be a witch!? What do you know about witches and sorcery! You\u2019re just a happy-go-lucky pleasant goth girl who still believes in fairy tales! I hate you! I would like to slit your throat and make a scarecrow out of your....\u201d Before Maxine could finish her rant, Lydia stomped the ground and gave out a rather angry croak. \u201cYou know, Maxine,\u201d she said. \u201cI am really starting to lose my temper with you.\u201d \u201cGet real, you ugly bitch! Go back home and throw your hissy fit, little girl. You\u2019re nothing more than an idiotic toad that\u2019s not even worth my time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaxine really shouldn\u2019t have been pushing around such a ginormous toad woman because Lydia was quickly losing her patience with the witch and her insulting ways. Lydia in fact is so absolutely livid that she snaps and proceeds to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It begun in a mysterious curio store that had just mysteriously appeared in Venice. In the center of the store, there was a large skull of a minotaur in the center and it appeared to be glowing. \u201cThat young man should\u2019ve known better. Now his fianc\u00e9e is going to be a Pegasus for the rest of her life. That\u2019s not even going into the fact that Pegasi can live for over a thousand years. Well, everyone seems to choose to learn things the hard way.\u201d However, that was when there was a ring at the door and in walked a young woman with short black hair and what looked like a pair of red sunglasses on her head. She was very hourglass-shaped and was wearing a white-feathered coat as she looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the shopkeeper?\u201d asked the young woman. \u201cThis is a magic shop isn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cMagic,\u201d said the voice that appeared to be coming out of the skull. \u201cRarities, curios. For what reason do you enter this shop.\u201d The woman noticed the skull appearing to speak and let out a sigh. \u201cOh great,\u201d she said. \u201cSo the shopkeeper is a ventriloquist. Very cute. My name is Selena Bartolomeo. I came to buy revenge.\u201d The minotaur skull then turned. \u201cRevenge is poisonous, Signorina. Perhaps you should start from the top.\u201d Selena gave a glare. \u201cMy boyfriend, currently ex-boyfriend, who I have been dating for 10 years since I met him in highschool, just dumped me. We were going to start a construction company together, but he ditched me for another girl, someone born into money.\u201d Selena slammed her fist on the table. \u201cLust and greed are deadly sins indeed Ms. Bartolomeo. However, wrath is just as deadly. Perhaps you should think things through before you go through with something so questionable and dangerous.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Selena just pounded her fist on the table again and made the skull shake from the sheer force of her fist. \u201cI don\u2019t care! He hurt me and I want to hurt him! So, is there a curse of some kind? Perhaps something to turn him to stone?\u201d The minotaur skull\u2019s eyes then glowed bright red. \u201cYour revenge is right behind you.\u201d Selena turned around, accidentally knocking the skull off the table with her backside right before she saw a strongbox right in front of her. Inside the strongbox was a bottle of a strange pink perfume that read \u201cPink Flamingo of Horror No. 9.\u201d Selena raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me. A bottle of perfume? You expect me to get revenge on Aldo by spraying him with\u2026\u201d \u201cYou do not spray the object of your wrath with this perfume,\u201d said the skull. \u201cYou spray yourself with the perfume. Then you will turn into the tool of your very beastly revenge. Just as long as you want it. If I were you, I would take every chance that came your way. This shop won\u2019t be in town tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena just let out a scoff and sighed. \u201cWell,\u201d she said. \u201cHow much are you asking for it?\u201d When Selena turned around, she looked in surprise because the skull was mysteriously placed back on the table where it had been until it fell. \u201cOh,\u201d he said. \u201cThis one is free. You will be paying for it soon enough.\u201d Selena raised an eyebrow but she wanted revenge and didn\u2019t really care about the details, so she shrugged her shoulders right before she left the store. \u201cShe will pay,\u201d said the skull. \u201cI almost feel sorry for her ex-boyfriend, even if what he did drove her to this extreme a decision.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena then walked out of the shop and sniffed the perfume. \u201cYou have wronged me, Aldo,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd for that, you are going to suffer. I might spare your tramp providing she proves not to be as loathsome as you, but you, you I fully intend to destroy. Say your prayers for mercy, because I\u2019m not giving you any.\u201d Selena then sprayed herself with the pink flamingo perfume. She gagged on the perfume and then looked around. She was wondering what would happen next because she hadn\u2019t changed at all. However, even though Selena\u2019s body was normal, her shadow briefly turned into that of a large flamingo. A sudden change was going to take place and it was going to be big.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What was that perfume supposed to do? Give me the power to fly, make me an amazon to pulverize Aldo. I dunno. At least it was free. I guess you get what you pay for.\u201d The young Italian girl was walking down the street and up ahead she saw Aldo, her ex-boyfriend, picking up his new girlfriend, Catalina and saw the two of them kissing.\u201d Selena gave a glare. \u201cYou poor girl,\u201d she thought to herself. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t really love you. You\u2019re just another pretty face with money to him. Oh, that Aldo just makes my skin crawl.\u201d Selena then grunted because her skin really did feel as if it was crawling. \u201cOh,\u201d she groaned. \u201cI think that I might actually be allergic to that weird perfume.\u201d Selena then grabbed her head because she felt that it was spinning and then ran off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena returned home and she was in her bathroom brushing her teeth as she was thinking about Aldo. In her rage, she brushed so hard that she had worn the brush right down. She threw the brush away and grumbled. \u201cIt\u2019s all Aldo\u2019s fault!\u201d she yelled. \u201cI gave him the best years of my life and he throws me aside for Catalina. I\u2019ll bet Catalina doesn\u2019t even know that I exist!\u201d As Selena was growing more and more angered, she looked at the flamingo shape that her shadow had taken. She gasped and then stepped back. But then she grunted and she held out her arms to see bright hot pink feathers growing on them. Selena then saw her hair turn a rose color and then felt her head as her arms were now completely covered in feathers and they appeared to be bulging out. Selena\u2019s face then appeared to have turned into a beak. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d asked Selena. \u201cIs this the purpose of the perfume?\u201d Before Selena could even say another word on the matter, the transformation continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe appeared to be getting taller and her neck stretched out. She also felt herself getting fatter as her thighs extended and her ass got so big that it smashed apart her bathtub while her belly got so big that her sink was soon destroyed. It was at this point that Selena realized exactly what that perfume was supposed to do and let out an evil laugh. She was going to have her revenge on her ex-boyfriend after all. \u201cLook out, Aldo,\u201d said Selena. \u201cHere comes Selena.\u201d Selena just continued to laugh as her transformation took place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that time, Aldo was with Catalina at Catalina\u2019s mansion and Catalina was giggling in the pool. \u201cCome on, Aldo,\u201d said Catalina. \u201cCome and join me.\u201d Aldo was reading the stock exchange on the newspaper but quickly put it away. \u201cUh, coming Catalina.\u201d Aldo was laughing to himself. \u201cOnce the company\u2019s off the ground,\u201d the scoundrel thought to himself. \u201cI\u2019ll get the naive girl out of the way. She\u2019s so desperate for a man at this point. Sure I had to dump Selena to get to her, but it\u2019s gonna be worth it in the end.\u201d Catalina giggled and Aldo smiled at her and was about to enter the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028However, that was when he heard a stomping sound and the water begun to ripple. \u201cMama Mia,\u201d said Catalina. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cBonjourno.\u201d Said Selena\u2019s voice above, somewhat deeper. Catalina and Aldo both looked up and Catalina screamed in horror as Aldo gasped. Selena had at this point, completely transformed into a 40ft high pink flamingo with a very chubby face and thick neck. She had a 50ft ass, a 60ft belly, huge thunder thighs and E-cup breasts as she smiled down at Aldo. Catalina got in the pool and looked in horror. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d asked Catalina. Catalina then yelled because Aldo hid behind her. \u201cStill as weak and cowardly as ever I see, Aldo.\u201d Said Selena. Aldo then gasped because he recognized that voice. \u201cS-S-Selena?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina was surprised. \u201cYou know this giant flamingo?\u201d she asked her boyfriend. \u201cYou alleged boyfriend is a liar and a sneak,\u201d said Selena. \u201cHe\u2019s only after your money. I should know. He dumped me for you.\u201d Aldo laughed nervously as Catalina glared at him. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me you had another girlfriend.\u201d Catalina said in outrage. Aldo gave a nervous laugh but then Selena stomped the ground and Catalina got out of the way. \u201cYou stay out of this, Catalina,\u201d said Selena. \u201cI\u2019ve got no beef with you. I just need my revenge on this piece of filth for breaking my heart.\u201d Aldo screamed and moved back as Selena was closing in on him. She was going to make sure that he suffered for how he treated her.<br>\r\n\u2028But how does Selena punish her evil ex?</span></div></div>",

It starts in Athens when a burly looking young boy in his early twenties with glasses is working outside of a flower store and smiled as he was pruning some daffodils. He then smiled and decided to walk away with the floral arrangement. Nearby, there was a young whitish-blonde hair girl in a pair of large black horn-rimmed glasses who was reading a book when the young man walked forward. \u201cGood morning, Odile.\u201d Said the young man as he handed the young woman a pot filled with daffodils. \u201cHector,\u201d said the girl. \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s important is how you\u2019re doing,\u201d said Hector. \u201cHappy birthday.\u201d \u201cThanks, Hector.

Don\u2019t you think that Odile deserves a real man?\u201d Odile overheard and rushed in. \u201cAre you boys fighting again.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d said Hector. \u201cNo, Odile.\u201d \u201cWe were just having a discussion, that\u2019s all.\u201d Said Troy. Odile gave a grunt. \u201cLike I said, I had plans with Hector. I don\u2019t want you two fighting over me again, especially not on my birthday.\u201d Hector and Odile walked away, leaving Troy to try to think of a plan to get Odile all to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy knew that he needed an Ace in the hole in order to win this game of love triangles, so he decided to walk down the street to a place that looked like it would be promising. It was a magic shop that had a minotaur\u2019s skull in the center of it. He pulled his car up in front of the store and then walked inside. \u201cI read an online article about this place. The last time it showed up somewhere, people have reported seeing a giant flamingo. Of course, I have something else in mind. Now, isn\u2019t there supposed to be a skull somewhere in here?\u201d The minotaur skull then turned around as an ominous wind filled the air. \u201cYou called?\u201d he asked. Troy looked in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d he asked the skull. \u201cI have a feeling that you weren\u2019t always a minotaur skull.\u201d \u201cI believe that is my business. What do you want?\u201d \u201cThe most beautiful woman in Athens.\u201d Said Troy. \u201cWould her name happen to be Helen?\u201d asked the minotaur skull sarcastically.  Troy gave a glare. \u201cI am the perfect man for Odile. I\u2019m rich, handsome, athletic, and yet she likes that flower man, Hector. I need a way to ensure she\u2019ll be with the man with whom she belongs.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t sell love potions here.\u201d Troy beat the minotaur skull on the forehead. \u201cWatch it! Last month a rather fat bottomed Southern sheriff sat on my head.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want a love potion you idiot! I heard a rumor that several women turned into giant animals because of your merchandise. A man turned his fianc\u00e9e into Pegasus for crying out loud.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skull spun around a few more times. \u201cYou are playing a dangerous game,\u201d said the skull. \u201cThere is no guarantee that everything will go as planned. For all that you know, your plan will fail. You may very well lose Odile forever.\u201d However, Troy just slapped the skull and made it spin. \u201cJust give me results. I am not going to lose Odile to Hector. I have an idea, have you heard of the Swan Princess?\u201d \u201cThere isn\u2019t a fairytale made that I don\u2019t know,\u201d said the skull. \u201cI read your mind. You want to turn Odile into a swan and make it a curse that will only break if she agrees to marry you.\u201d \u201cAnd not just any swan. Make her the biggest swan in the world.\u201d The minotaur skull\u2019s eyes glowed bright. \u201cAs you wish,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you better be ready to accept the consequences should your plan fail?\u201d \u201cShut up and cast the spell.\u201d Said Troy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minotaur skull chanted in strange language and enchanted a nearby swan that proceeded to fly out just as Odile was helping out Hector in his garden. \u201cOh,\u201d said Odile. \u201cHector. Looks like you have a visitor.\u201d Odile reached to pet the swan but then the swan bit her as she yelled. \u201cBe careful, Odile,\u201d said Hector. \u201cSwans sometimes bite.\u201d However, the bite mark on Odile\u2019s head proceeded to glow as Odile looked in confusion. An evil spell was about to strike.</span></div></div>",

Something tells me that that was no ordinary swan that bit you.\u201d Odile nodded her head. \u201cI believe it, Hector. That swan acted as if it was possessed. I wish it would\u2019ve given me a closer look. I hope that it wasn\u2019t hurt or anything.\u201d Odile then gave out a honk. Hector looked in surprise. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d he asked. \u201cOh,\u201d said Odile. \u201cI\u2019m sure that it was nothing. Odile then heard a ripping sound and turned back to see her butt had outgrown her skirt. \u201cUh,\u201d she said. \u201cHector. \u201cWhat exactly was in that birthday cake you made me.\u201d Hector had to take off his glasses and then he saw that his friend\u2019s ass had not only gotten bigger but sprouted tail feathers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdile then grunted in pain. \u201cMy feet are killing me.\u201d Odile took off her shoes and gasped because her feet had turned into bright golden webbed talons. \u201cOh my gosh!\u201d Hector couldn\u2019t believe it. \u201cOdile,\u201d he said. \u201cSomething is seriously wrong with you. Odile felt her stomach gurgling and got on her knees as her butt continued to expand and tore her underwear to ribbons as she sprouted feathers all over her body.\u201d Odile then let out a scream that turned into a honk as her neck stretched out. She kept getting bigger as feathers grew on her body and her neck became more and more bloated. She leaned back and pushed her rear against Hector\u2019s house, causing it to crack slightly. Then her breasts expanded and destroyed her shirt, leaving her wearing nothing but a pair of glasses as her face stretched out and her mouth turned into a gold beak. Finally her arms stretched out and turned into huge wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028By the time the transformation was complete, Odile was an 80ft tall swan with huge H-cup breasts, a 65ft belly, a 115ft booty. Her wings stretched out and had a wingspan of 130ft in order to allow her ginormous body to fly and she also had thighs so thick that her ankles were toothpicks in comparison. Odile looked down and saw Hector and was shocked while Hector was just as surprised. \u201cOdile, you\u2019re a swan.\u201d Odile looked back to see how huge and obese she was. \u201cA sumo swan. What happened?\u201d Troy let out a laugh as he came forward. \u201cTroy?\u201d asked Odile. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Troy walked around and let out another laugh. \u201cGetting exactly what I wanted to happen. So, how\u2019s it feel being the world\u2019s biggest bird. Consider that my ultimate gift to you, Odile.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTroy,\u201d said Hector. \u201cYou\u2019re not making any sense. How could you be responsible for this?\u201d Troy smiled smugly. \u201cYou know that weird store down the street than just opened?\u201d \u201cThat creep shop?\u201d asked Odile. \u201cWhat of it?\u201d \u201cAm I the only one that reads the Internet?!\u201d yelled Troy. \u201cEverywhere that store has showed up something strange happens. A guy married a giant pegasus, all crimes in Texas were thwarted by a minotaur cowgirl as big as a building. So I figured that I\u2019d ask the shopkeeper to place a curse on Odile.\u201d Odile honked and felt her stomach bulging out again. \u201cCurse?\u201d asked Odile. Troy gave a laugh as Hector cracked his knuckles. \u201cThis isn\u2019t funny, Troy. How do we turn her back. Troy just gave a rather sinister grin. \u201cThere\u2019s only one way to return Odile to her gorgeous self. She must marry me.\u201d Hector gave a gasp and Troy smiled at him smugly. \u201cFace it, Hector. You lost.\u201d Hector held his head down thinking that Troy\u2019s evil plan would work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy thought that with that ultimatum, Odile would agree to marry him. However, instead Odile looked at her reflection in a nearby lake and then shrugged her wings. \u201cI\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d Troy\u2019s eyes then popped. \u201cWhat?! But you\u2019ll be a giant swan for the rest of your life unless...\u201d \u201cDid I say that I didn\u2019t LIKE being a giant swan, Troy?\u201d asked Odile. \u201cSwans are my favorite animals. Thanks for the transformation. This is the most unusual birthday present I\u2019ve ever received. So, if I don\u2019t marry you, I don\u2019t turn back? Alright?\u201d Troy was dumbfounded. This was not how it was supposed to go. Hector just let out a laugh and Troy looked at his rival in rage. \u201cSo you\u2019re choosing flower boy over me!? But... but...\u201d \u201cTroy,\u201d said Hector. \u201cYou\u2019ve already proven who the better man is. If you had to take Odile\u2019s humanity hostage, it\u2019s clear you\u2019re not her ideal man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdile then let out a loud honk to get Hector\u2019s attention. \u201cCome on, Hector,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s see if the world\u2019s fattest swan can still fly.\u201d Odile picked up Hector with her beak and placed him on her shoulder before she flapped her wings, creating a small jetstream before she managed to get her fat anatidaean ass off the ground and flew high into the air. She flapped her wings and feathers as big as cars came down. Troy could not believe it. He tried to turn her into a swan in order to coerce her and it still failed. He decided to return to the shop and give the skull a piece of his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028The shop appeared to be packing up as Troy walked to the skull. \u201cI\u2019ve got a literal bone to pick with you, skull boy! You ripped me off! Your spell didn\u2019t work!\u201d \u201cIt worked fine,\u201d said the skull. \u201cYou told me that you wanted a spell cast on Odile that would turn her into a swan and that the curse would only be broken if she married you. I didn\u2019t guarantee that she would marry you.\u201d \u201cThen change her back.\u201d \u201cI couldn\u2019t if I wanted to. There is only one way to break the curse and turn her back into a human.\u201d \u201cListen here! Do you have any idea who I am?! I will have this place torn down!\u201d Suddenly, Troy gagged because something grabbed him from behind. From the looks of it, it was a 80% rotted zombie with a skeletal face and a missing heel. \u201cThis is Achilles,\u201d said the skull. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019ve read about him. I realized that after being kidnapped by sneak thieves and suddenly sat on by a fat-bottomed sheriff who I wound up turning into the planet\u2019s most wonderful species, I needed somebody to keep troublemakers out. Achilles, kindly throw Troy out.\u201d The zombie nodded his head and then walked out to throw Troy screaming into the garbage nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAchilles returned inside the shop and Troy saw that the shop appeared to be fading away into nothingness. \u201cI\u2019d like to chat but we\u2019re off to Scotland. Give the swan goddess my regards.\u201d Troy angrily shouted and shook his fist as the skull, the shop and Achilles all disappeared. Meanwhile, Hector was still riding on Odile\u2019s back as she had flown all the way to...</span></div></div>",

Keeping her bulk in the air all the way across the ocean was quite a wear on a girl. Especially a first time flier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Odile flew over the city, dropping feathers onto the streets and casting a massive shadow over them, the people weren't quite as happy to see her. \"MONSTER!\" one woman yelled. \"CALL THE ARMY!\" another man said. Everyone started screaming and running for their lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are they saying?\" Odile asked. \"I don't think they're happy to see you.\" Hector said. \"Nonsense\" Odile snorted with a honk. \"Who wouldn't love to see a giant beautiful swa...WHOA!\" Odile banked as loud shot suddenly went past her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHector looked down, to see a tank was on the streets shooting at them. \"I think we've got a problem!\" Hector yelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdile swooped and swerved and darted through the air like a pro, despite her huge frame, dodging like a jet. \"I'm getting pretty good at this!\" she yelled. But eventually she was struck in her massive stomach by a tank shell....which promptly bonuced off her gut with a BOING and flew off into the sea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. Didn't even hurt.\" she said smugly. She heard a buzzing and looked to see a helicopter approaching her. Odile flapped her wings hard, causing a powerful gust that blew it off course. \"I mean no harm! Really!\" She heard a yell from her back, as a shot nearly hit Hector and send him tumbling off. But Odile managed to catch him with a leg, and tossed him back onto her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hector are you alright?\" Odile said. \"Grrr...those jerks.\" she growled.</span></div></div>",

A pudgy blonde woman in fishnet stockings was singing this song to her husband who was plugging his ears because the song was not going exactly as it was supposed to. \u201cSo?\u201d asked the woman. \u201cHow do I sound, Arnold?\u201d Arnold just looked at his wife rather nervously. \u201cWell,\u201d he said. \u201cIt certainly sounded like it was something. Not sure that it sounded like music though.\u201d Grey let out a sigh. Arnold was right. She was very tone deaf and couldn\u2019t carry a tune in a bucket. This was frustrating because she was planning to join the town\u2019s glee club, though with her sorry excuses for vocal chords, that wasn\u2019t looking like it would happen anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Grey and Arnold had decided to take a walk in order to think, all while Grey was trying to practice singing again. \u201cIt\u2019s my own design, it\u2019s my own remorse.\u201d Arnold kept holding his ears in pain because his wife didn\u2019t have the right voice for singing. He knew that all too well. He learned it the hard way when they went to a karaoke club after their marriage. \u201cI wish I knew what her singing voice was like before I married her,\u201d thought Arnold. \u201cHow could someone who looks so angelic sound so disastrous.\u201d Arnold looked back to see he wasn\u2019t the only critic of Grey\u2019s poor singing voice. In fact, everywhere they went, people were retreating from the voice, birds were flying away and stray cats even screamed as they saw Grey. \u201cOh who asked you!\u201d yelled the blonde in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnold knew that Grey\u2019s voice was not going to get any better anytime soon and realized that if he hated her singing this much, there was no way that the glee club would like it. He heard Grey inhaling and exhaling and gasped in horror because she was going to practice singing yet again. He needed an excuse to get out of the area and then he had a thought. \u201cOh, Grey! Maybe your voice would do better with watering, like they do with flowers.\u201d Grey just looked at her husband in confusion. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a coffee shop in the area,\u201d said Arnold. \u201cI\u2019ll go get something for that voice.\u201d Arnold ran off as fast as he could and then Grey gave a glare. \u201cAlways my most vocal critic aren\u2019t you, Honey Love?\u201d asked the blonde in an annoyed tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrey then tried to sing again. \u201cEveryone\u2019s watching, to see what you will do!\u201d Nearby there was a scream of agony. There was a man in green rags with a metal mask and he was shaking his head. \u201cWhat is that noise? It sounds like somebody is strangling a raccoon.\u201d \u201cEverybody\u2019s a critic,\u201d grumbled Grey. \u201cEven the homeless.\u201d The man in green walked up to Grey. \u201cYou\u2019re never going to be able to join the glee club with a voice like that.\u201d \u201cWait, how did you\u2026\u201d The man in green shrugged his shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m Erlking. It\u2019s what I do. Anyhow, your singing is not exactly what I would call singing, lady. For the good of everyone\u2019s ears, I am going to give you a wish to stop that horrid singing.\u201d Grey gave a look of surprise, however, she had nothing to lose at this point. \u201cYou can make me sing like a canary then?\u201d Erlking nodded his head. \u201cYep. Now just watch.\u201d Erlking stood on a trashcan in order to cast a spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI say, 1, 2, spell me do,\u201d chanted Erlking. \u201cLet this lady\u2019s wish come true. Here me high, hear me well, let me be this spell.\u201d Erlking jerked back and magical energy surged from his hands and took the shape of a canary before flying down Grey\u2019s throat. Grey let out a scream that turned into a canary\u2019s chirp. She then started to sing in the exact same tune as a canary and then covered her mouth. Erlking smirked but then he heard a stepping sound. \u201cUh-oh.\u201d He said. Erlking snapped his fingers and disappeared just as Arnold showed up. \u201cGrey?\u201d asked Arnold. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d Grey gave a few more coughs. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said right before she smiled. \u201cBut something tells me I\u2019m going to get into the club.\u201d Grey then hummed in a far more angelic tune than earlier and smiled, not noticing the yellow feathers growing on her back.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Imagine what will come of me just singing it now.\" Grey then inhaled and then decided she would try her hand at singing for real. \"Ain't she sweet? When she's walking down the street? I ask you very confidentially, ain't she sweet?\" \"Okay,\" said Arnold uneasily. \"Unusual choice of song, but it looks like your vocal chords are working perfectly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrey smiled however, she didn't seem to notice that the voice was the least of her worries because with every step she was getting chunkier and taller, not that Arnold really noticed since his wife was already heavyset and was also already somewhat taller than he was. But that wasn't the only thing that was unusual. As Grey kept walking down the street, she appeared to be shedding golden yellow feathers. As Grey and Arnold came to an alleyway, a cat ran down the street carrying a fish and Grey let out a loud scream upon seeing the cat and jumped back. Grey's shriek was actually loud enough to cause all the windows in the skyscraper to her side to crack slightly. Arnold looked at his wife in confusion and noticed she was panting and clutched her chest. \"Grey?\" he asked. \"Are you feeling okay? It was only a cat.\" Grey then inhaled deeply. \"I'm really sorry about that, Arnold,\" she said. \"I have absolutely no idea what came over me. Somehow that cat just stressed me out. Oh well.\" Arnold scratched his head because something was up. Then it occurred to him that something weird might be going on with his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Grey,\" he said. \"Did anything unusual happen while I was busy getting coffee?\" Grey let out a grunt. \"Well, if you must know, earlier, my singing was apparently bad enough for a homeless man to put his two cents into the situation. He offered me a wish to remedy my voice.\" Arnold raised an eye. \"A homeless man just <i>magically</i> improved your voice. I find that hard to believe. What exactly did this magical vagrant look like.\" \"Well,\" said Grey. \"I didn't get a good look at his true face, but he was wearing a metal mask, green rages and bandages all around his body. He looked rather strange.\" Arnold rubbed his chin. \"Grey,\" he said. \"I don't think that was a good idea. Have you ever by any chance read <i>the Monkey's Paw</i>.\" Grey gave a scoff. \"I don't care about my hands, Arnold. I just want to have a golden voice. I'll show you. The next morning, I'm going to march right down and tell off those glee club jerks. They'll have to let me in when I show off my vocals. The blonde then let out a loud high note that shattered the windows of three nearby cars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnold immediately tried to push his wife out of the way before they got blamed for the damaged property. However, Arnold noticed something. \"Whoa, Grey,\" said Arnold. \"Take it easy with the pasta. Your ass seems thicker than usual tonight.\" Grey grunted and then slapped her husband in the face. \"You NEVER mentioned a woman's weight, Arnold.\" Arnold let out a grumble as he rubbed his face. \"I can't say anything to her,\" he thought to himself. \"I do recall her being <i>only</i> 300lbs this morning though. I know she's a compulsive eater but she seems to have gained more weight in such little time.\" Suddenly, there was a loud grunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile trying to walk into their apartment building, Grey had gotten stuck in the door frame. Somehow she had gotten too-wide for it and appeared to be 10ft tall. \"Damn it all,\" grunted the blonde bombshell blob. \"What gives?!\" The landlord came by and looked in surprise to find Grey stuck. Grey gave him a glare. \"Not one word!\" snapped the blonde. The landlord couldn't help but laugh as Grey grumbled and tried to squeeze her way out. Grey grunted and finally managed to get her way out and revealed that there were yellow feathers on her back, much to Arnold's surprise. Then, Grey heard a tearing sound and then looked down to see that her fishnet stockings were coming undone. \"Okay,\" said Grey. \"I'll admit that I'm a little heavy.\" \"A <i>little</i> heavy?\" asked Arnold with a scoff. \"You weigh more than three times what you weighed when we were married and that was only three years ago.\" Grey gave her husband a glare and then would've yelled at Arnold but then grunted in pain. Her shoes were feeling rather tight. What Grey didn't know was that her feet had turned into light gray talons like those of a bird with rather sharp claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before Grey and Arnold returned to their apartment and Arnold had picked up several of the golden feathers and was very confused as to where they came from. \"Nobody in the apartment complex has a canary. Where did any of these feathers come from?\" Grey at the time was brushing her hair as she was on the phone and hadn't noticed that there were bright golden yellow feathers sprouting on her arms and neck at this point and she had gotten so obese that the chair she was sitting on was barely holding on against her large booty. \"Listen here, Vicky,\" said Grey. \"You may be running the club but tomorrow after I show you my golden voice, you'll have no choice but to let me in. What was that? I'll have you know that my weight makes me a much better singing than you. To hit the low notes, I need a big throat and you can't have a big throat without a big everything. Tone deaf?! You'll see how tone deaf I am when I come by tomorrow and show you what I can really do. Good night to you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrey then angrily hung up and grunted. \"That Vicky drives me up the wall! She is so nasty!\" \"Don't listen to her, Grey,\" said Arnold. \"You let her get to you much too easily. Hasn't she been taunting you ever since high school?\" Grey let out a scoff. \"I don't know why they made her the leader of the glee club. She criticizes my singing? Her voice sounds like somebody dropped a chainsaw in a wood chipper. Just hearing it makes me really mad.\" Grey then noticed the feathers on the ground, in the process, failing to notice the feathers growing on her own body. \"What's with all the feathers? Did you get a pet canary when I wasn't looking.\" \"You know I'm not that fond of birds, Grey,\"said Arnold. \"I found these feathers laying around the street. Grey, exactly what did you say to that homeless wizard you met on the street.\" \"Like I said,\" said Grey. \"I told him that I wanted to be able to sing like a canary. Speaking of which, I need to keep my voice wet to make sure my vocal chords don't rot back to the sorry state that they were before I met that Erlking character.\u201d Grey walked up towards the bathroom and shed her clothes, revealing feathers growing all over her body that were bright gold. And she also revealed her taloned feet and her much larger than usual ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnold rose his head and then gasped as he saw his wife as feathers continued to appear on her fatter than usual body. \u201cOh my gosh!\u201d he yelled. Grey at this moment had yet to notice she was transforming and stepped into the shower as she then turned on the water and was continuing to sing to herself. \u201cDance!\u201d she yelled in a higher voice than before as she scrubbed herself with the soap. \u201cBoogie wonderland! Midnight creeps so slowly into hearts of men who need more than they get. Daylight deals... huh?\u201d Grey scrubbed her armpit and plucked out a few golden feathers. \u201cHuh!?\u201d Grey then grunted because she felt her stomach press against the wall and then looked at her hands to see that they had turned into sharp claws and her arms had turned into large wings. \u201cOh my!\u201d she yelled. \u201cOh my! Oh my!\u201d Grey then yelled and tripped over the shower curtain before she stood up with the curtain acting as a thong and then looked into the window to see that her mouth had turned into a large beak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnold heard Grey shrieking and barged into the bathroom and gasped. His wife had turned into a 15ft tall canary with an 18ft wide ass, 16ft wide belly, enormous hips, H-cup breasts and a 25ft long wingspan. \"Oh my gosh!\" yelled Arnold. \"I knew it! Grey, look what your bad choice of words has done. You wished for that weirdo that you could sing like a canary. Well, nobody can say you can't sing like a canary now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Grey herself take the transformation?</span></div></div>",

Grey then lifted up her huge stomach in order to see her gray talons and tapped them on the floor before feeling her beak and letting out a canary chirp. \u201cGrey,\u201d said Arnold in a concerned tone to his giant mutated wife. \u201cAre you going to be alright?\u201d Grey held her enormous booty in front of the mirror and then she broke out in chirping laughter, much to the surprise of her husband who at this point only reached up to her knee. Grey opened her wings and then flapped them as she danced from side to side and shook her enormous hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBow chicka wow wow!\u201d yelled the giant canary woman. Grey let out a giggle to herself before she started to sing to herself. \u201cI want to know the structure of your heart, why do you tear my broken soul apart?\u201d Grey laughed again and shook her belly as Arnold looked on in both surprise and in concern. \u201cWell,\u201d he said. \u201cYou certainly are taking this well.\u201d Grey chirped again as she held her head in front of Arnold who could see a smile form on her beak from her enormously chubby cheeks. \u201cThis is perfect, Arnold. That annoying clod Vicky D\u2019Arcy said that I had a terrible voice. Now that I\u2019m an actual canary, there\u2019s no way she can deny that I can sing like a canary.\u201d Grey let out another laugh but then hit her head on the ceiling and grunted as she caused part of the ceiling to come off. She then tried to waddle her way out of the bathroom as Arnold quickly moved out of the way to avoid having his big bird of a wife stepping on him. Grey\u2019s stomach got caught in the entryway to the bathroom and she grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a little shaking, Grey managed to tear out the entire wall to the horror of Arnold. \u201cThe landlord\u2019s gonna kill us!\u201d Grey let out a sigh. \u201cOh, pish-posh,\u201d she said. \u201cYou worry too much, Arnold. Now, how about we go find that glee club and show them that I can sing.\u201d Grey then started to sing a song in French as she was flapping her wings. She blew the furniture and caused it to fall back as Arnold tried to get out of the way. To his surprise, Grey actually got off the floor. He then saw Grey holding out her talons and gasped. Arnold tried to run but Grey grabbed him and then flew through the apartment wall out into the air with a loud chirp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople looked up into the air and gasped at the sight of such a huge canary. Several strays cats spotted Grey and were drooling heavily. One man in a birdwatcher\u2019s outfit spotted Grey through his binoculars and his jaw dropped. Down the street, Erlking was walking by with his hands in his pockets and a piece of wood in his mouth when a giant feather the size of a car fell in front of his feet. He looked up just in time to see Grey flapping away. \"Oh dear,\" said Erlking with a sigh. \"Looks like I goofed again. I wish that didn't always happen but... oh well.\" With that, Erlking faded away as if to teleport to somewhere else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrey was laughing through the air right before she stopped to roost on a large skyscraper, scratching it with her talons and causing it to crack under her enormous butt. She tossed Arnold into the air and he grabbed hold of his wife's blonde hair before placing his feet on her back. \"This is fun,\" said Grey. \"And to think, I used to be afraid of heights.\" \"Come on, Grey,\" groaned Arnold. \"Stop fooling around. You know, one would think being turned into an enormous bird would be a lot more traumatizing.\" Arnold then felt something beneath his foot. From the looks of it, Grey's back had grown a lot more fat. He also saw his enormous bird wife's shadow over several buildings as crowds flocked to look at the huge canary and saw that Grey seemed to have gotten bigger as well as fatter. But Grey was too busy whistling a tune to notice her belly and butt hanging off of her roost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Arnold could put any more thought into the matter, he heard loud flapping yet again and saw that Grey was getting ready for takeoff again. Arnold held on tight as his huge canary wife flew off again. At that time at the glee club, the club president, a rather weedy and ugly looking red-haired young woman with long fingernails was watching as a new recruit was singing a song in Japanese. Everyone else loved the song in the club, but the leader for some reason hated the music. \"Rejected.\" The redhead said. The applicant was shocked and then hung her head down and left. \"Come on, Vicky,\" said one of the male glee club goers. \"She sounded pretty good. Even better than you.\" Vicky gave a glare to intimidate the male club goer. \"<i>Nobody</i> is better than me! The nerve of some trash that tries to get in.\" Vicky then gave an obnoxious laugh. \"Like that hussy Grey Nance. Her voice sounds like a cat on drugs.\" But as Vicky was laughing, everyone heard flapping. \"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe glee club members walked out and Vicky was leading them right before she looked up to see a large shadow coming down. Before Vicky could get out of the way, she looked in fear as Grey was coming down fast. Everyone gasped at the sight of a huge canary and it was no wonder as Grey seemed to have grown larger than she was before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the canary woman was... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Our story begins in a mountainous area right above a small town. Atop one mountain was a pale white haired albino woman in a tangerine jumpsuit who was drawing images of wild birds. Her name was Drew Weever and her husband was the town undertaker. However, Drew was surprisingly cheerful and pleasant for somebody who was married to a man  with a rather dark and grim profession. At that moment, she was smiling as she drew an image of a bluebird. However, as she looked up, she let out a sigh when she saw a cardinal flying. She looked through her sketchbook and saw the dozens of images of different birds. Some of them were still lives while some were clearly not as they depicted birds such as flamingos, parrots and Japanese cranes that clearly were not indigenous to the area. The fact was, Drew loved birds. This was because they possessed a gift that human beings didn\u2019t, namely, the ability to fly. \u201cMan,\u201d said Drew. \u201cI envy you. All of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrew walked away and continued to look at her sketchbook as she was pondering to herself. \u201cIt\u2019s too bad that humans cannot fly.\u201d She said. She even let out a giggle. However, she then saw a sight that really irked her. Several punks were picking on a middle-aged homeless looking man in green rags and a tin plate mask. \u201cGet out of our town, freak!\u201d yelled one of the punks. \u201cWe don\u2019t like your kind around here!\u201d One of the gangsters even tried to steal money from the man. \u201cOh, come on,\u201d muttered the man. \u201cYou\u2019d really steal money from someone like me?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to have a beggar in town,\u201d said the punk. \u201cBut a bad one? This isn\u2019t even enough for me to buy beer. Let\u2019s take him out back and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the goon could finish his sentence, Drew jumped up and kicked him in the head. She then glared at the gang before she violently beat them up. \u201cGet out!\u201d she yelled. The villains scattered as Drew grabbed the one who tried to rob the man in rags and then snatched the money back before kicking the goon in the rear and forcing him to run. Drew then handed the man in rags back his money and took out her wallet to pay him extra. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry about that, sir. People who pick on the homeless oughta be tortured to death.\u201d The man in rags smiled at Drew. \u201cYou are a very kind woman. I am Erlking.\u201d \u201cDrew,\u201d said Drew. \u201cErlking. That\u2019s a strange name.\u201d \u201cI know. I don\u2019t even remember where I got it from. I\u2019ve been around for a very long time.\u201d That was when Erlking noticed Drew looking up at the air at a bird flying through the air. \u201cOh,\u201d said Erlking. \u201cYou wish to be able to fly like birds.\u201d Drew gave a look of surprise. \u201cHow did you...?\u201d Erlking nodded his head. \u201cIt\u2019s my job to know people\u2019s wishes. I am a granter of wishes.\u201d Drew just let out a laugh at that absurd idea. \u201cGet out of town.\u201d She said. But Erlking shook his head. \u201cI am serious,\u201d he said. \u201cI will grant you your wish to fly, that is, if you want it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrew didn\u2019t know what to think about this development, but still the idea of being able to fly sounded too good to pass up and she let out a giggle. \u201cOkay, Erlking. Hook me up.\u201d Erlking stood on a nearby tree stump in order to cast a spell to grant Drew\u2019s wish. \u201cI say, 1, 2, spell me do,\u201d chanted Erlking. \u201cLet this lady\u2019s wish come true. Here me high, hear me well, let me be this spell.\u201d With that Erlking\u2019s eyes begun to glow bright and magical energy entered Drew\u2019s body. Drew gagged and held her throat as a strange aura surrounded her. She didn\u2019t see it but the aura took the shape of a vulture. \u201cThere you are,\u201d said Erlking. \u201cYou will soon be able to fly just like a bird.\u201d Drew just raised an eyebrow. \u201cBut how will I know it will work.\u201d Erlking gave a sweet smile before he spoke again. \u201cOh, you\u2019ll know. See you later.\u201d With that, Erlking faded away and disappeared in a pile of rags. Drew chose not to doubt the man as he was clearly a wizard. She smiled because if Erlking was right, then she would soon be able to fly. However, when Drew told Erlking her wish, she failed to be specific about what type of bird and the way you word your wish can be very important as the albino woman was about to learn as she was walking away and sprouting tail feathers.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At that moment, Drew\u2019s husband, Corey was putting together a casket when Drew walked back in. \u201cI\u2019m home.\u201d She said. Corey just continued his work. \u201cYou know,\u201d said Corey. \u201cYou\u2019re surprisingly chipper for somebody whose husband buries people for a living. It kind of creeps the townspeople out.\u201d Drew then smelt the air and for some reason was aroused. \u201cHas it always smelt so good around here?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhat is that wonderful aroma?\u201d Corey raised an eyebrow. \u201cThis is a funeral parlor,\u201d he said to his wife. \u201cWhat could you possibly smell that smells good? You usually complain about the smell. Whatever, could you please do me a favor and hand me that file.\u201d Drew walked over to get the file for her husband, not realizing that her ass seemed to have gotten bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo who died this time?\u201d asked Drew. Corey let out a grumble. \u201cNobody who will be missed in my opinion. You remember that other undertaker from the next town over. He was found beaten to death.\u201d \u201cWho killed him?\u201d \u201cI dunno. Probably the corpse of one of his clients. I never liked him that much anyway. He had no respect for the dead. I don\u2019t think he even used embalming fluid. I also heard a rumor he killed somebody. Oh well. Gotta make the right coffin. Not like one of those cheap pine coffins he used to sell. So how was your day? Draw any good birds lately.\u201d Drew let out a laugh. \u201cI met a very nice but very strange man who asked me for my wish and I told him I wished to be able to fly like a bird. He said he\u2019d grant it.\u201d \u201cSounds to me like a crackpot. There\u2019s no such thing as a wish granter. I think you\u2019ve been out in the sun too long, Drew.\u201d \u201cSome sun would do you good, Corey,\u201d said Drew as she was walking up to her husband with the metal file. \u201cI\u2019m albino. What\u2019s your excuse?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorey just rolled his eyes. Given how grim he was and how perky his wife was, people didn\u2019t see any reason how they could\u2019ve gotten together in the first place. Drew then bent over to hand Corey the file in order to properly prepare the coffin. \u201cHere you go, Sweetie.\u201d \u201cThanks... Drew.\u201d Corey looked to see that Drew was several heads taller than he was now and appeared to be somewhat pear-shaped as well. \u201cWhat the?\u201d asked the mortician in regards to his wife. Before Drew could walk away, Corey grabbed her by the ass cheeks and made her grunt. \u201cThese are a lot thicker than I remember,\u201d said Corey. \u201cI thought you were on a diet.\u201d Then Corey found something really puzzling that seemed to worry him. It was what appeared to be a grayish brown feather and then he pulled it out, Drew screamed in pain. \u201cCareful, Corey.\u201d Corey gave a befuddled and very afraid look. \u201cUh, Drew,\u201d he said. \u201cExactly what did you say to this wish master.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said Drew. \u201cI wished only to be able to fly like a bird. Why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Drew begun to twitch as she ran out of the house. \u201cDrew!\u201d yelled Corey in shock. Something really strange was happening to Drew. First her belly and breasts expanded wide enough to break the zipper on her jumpsuit and then her legs expanded into thighs as thick as mammoth pumpkins as the feathers above her growing ass were growing more and more. Drew then obtained a rather noticeable hunch in her back as her neck stretched out. The albino woman let out a shriek as her mouth extended into a black beak. A collar of white feathers appeared around Drew\u2019s neck before gray-colored feathers were soon growing all over her body, everywhere except for over her neck. Then her boots ripped apart to reveal sharp talons as feathers grew on her arms to turn them into wings. Drew was also getting bigger and bigger until the house only reached up to her knee. \u201cOh my gosh!\u201d yelled a very afraid Corey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Drew\u2019s transformation was complete, she was an 80ft tall humanoid vulture with a 110ft wide ass, a 125ft wide stomach, H-cup breasts and several chins in her neck. She looked around and stretched out her wings as she looked at her new body in pure fear. \u201cShe\u2019s a vulture,\u201d thought Corey as he looked at his mutated wife. \u201cMy wife is a giant vulture, a giant vulture fatter than a hippopotamus. Oh no. That wish granter must\u2019ve been real after all. She did say she wanted to fly like a bird. Dammit. A vulture IS a bird. Damn literal.\u201d Corey then looked up at his enormous vulture wife. \u201cUh, Drew? Are you feeling okay?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Drew breathed heavily as she looked at her new vulture body and begun to sweat as she bit her beak slightly. \u201cWhat went wrong? I don\u2019t understand this.\u201d \u201cWell, I do,\u201d said Corey. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem with people who grant wishes. You have to be very careful what you say. You told this Erlking character that you wanted to be able to fly like a bird. So he turned you into a bird. Since you weren\u2019t specific, he turned you into the one bird that would make the most sense for the wife of an undertaker.\u201d Drew held her head and groaned. \u201cI get it,\u201d she said. \u201cI get it. I\u2019m an idiot.\u201d Corey let out a sigh. \u201cYou\u2019re not an idiot, Drew. But your fascination with birds just reached its pinnacle. The neighbors are going to stare you know. It\u2019s really not considered healthy for someone of my occupation to be married to a vulture. It\u2019s bad enough that a certain French comic depicts undertakers keeping vultures as pets.\u201d Drew just felt around her body and snapped her beak. \u201cBeing a vulture, I could probably get used to. Being a giant vulture, it might not be so bad. But why oh why did that stupid Erlking have to make me so fat.\u201d Drew\u2019s movements caused her jumpsuit to finally rip to shreds and reveal that she wore no undergarments underneath. Drew shrieked and tried to cover up, but then she realized something. \u201cWhat am I worried about? I have feathers.\u201d Drew let out a laugh as Corey let out a groan and looked to see that Drew bursting through the roof had totally wrecked the funeral parlor and he then looked up with a stare. \u201cSomehow,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think our insurance covers up damages made by vultures.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Drew\u2019s 125ft wide stomach growled and the vulture giantess rubbed it. \u201cI guess mutations give you the munchies,\u201d said Drew. \u201cI am starving. Oh gross. I\u2019m a vulture now! That means I\u2019m gonna have to eat carrion. Yuck!\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t panic, Dear,\u201d said Corey. \u201cNo wife of Corey Weever is going to eat a corpse, even if she\u2019s a vulture as big as Godzilla. Just stay here and I\u2019ll get you something to eat.\u201d Corey was almost out the door when he stopped himself. \u201cAnd don\u2019t eat Mr. Thoreau\u2019s body while I\u2019m gone. It wouldn\u2019t look good for an undertaker to feed the corpses under his care to a giant obese bird. Besides, I\u2019ve already embalmed him. You\u2019d poison yourself.\u201d Drew gave an angry shriek at her husband. \u201cGive me some credit, Corey,\u201d said the vulture titaness. \u201cI\u2019ve got some self-control.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m just making myself clear.\u201d Said Corey. Corey kissed his wife at the tip of her beak before walking out. Drew let out a squawk as she was walking around the remains of the funeral home right before she sat down on the part of the house where she and her husband lived before her transformation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes he really think that I have so little self-control that I\u2019d actually resort to eating a human? We\u2019ve been married for so long that you\u2019d think he\u2019d have some faith in me?\u201d Drew then opened up her wings and saw that she now had a 200ft wide wingspan. \u201cHmm,\u201d she said. \u201cWell, Erlking did grant my wish to be able to fly like a bird, no matter how utterly literal, misguided and clueless he was with the results. Since I\u2019m going to be a bird, I might as well get used to these wings. Heck, this is the reason I made the wish in the first place.\u201d Drew then heard a cracking and got up off of her seat. \u201cUh-oh,\u201d she said. \u201cCorey\u2019s not going to like it if my ass crushes the main part of the house. I better get to work on an alternate dwelling.\u201d Drew flapped her wings and the vulture giantess flew up into the sky. On the ground, there was a birdwatcher with thick goggles who was observing a rare golden-cheeked warbler and sketching the creature.\u201d However, the warbler suddenly flew off in fear. The birdwatcher mumbled in confusion before he looked back and gasped as Drew\u2019s shadow was cast straight over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the process, one of the enormous vulture woman\u2019s feathers fell. The birdwatcher ran up towards the colossal feather and saw that it was as big as himself. \u201cIncredible,\u201d he said. \u201cThis feather is huge. But that\u2019s impossible. The largest flying birds to ever exist were the Teratornithidae family of prehistoric vultures. Teratorns have been extinct since the Pleistocene era. But this feather looks like it comes from a creature even larger than a teratorn. What kind of a bird is flying around here?\u201d While that birdwatcher was pondering what could\u2019ve been flying around. Drew flew into a clearing and started to use her rather enormous beak to tear out several trees from the ground as she gave a loud shriek. \u201cI\u2019m definitely not going to wreck the house again,\u201d thought the vulture woman to herself. \u201cIf I\u2019m gonna be a bird, I know what I have to do first and foremost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Corey was at the butcher's shop and had bought up most of the stock. \"Buddy,\" said the butcher. \"Is there any reason why you're buying so much meat? There's enough food here for a dinosaur.\" \"You wouldn't believe me if I told you.\" Said Corey. The butcher's assistant ran forward carrying a small leg of lamb. \"This is the last edible thing that hasn't been unfrozen, Sir.\" \"Well, Harold,\" said the butcher. \"Looks like we're closing early today.\" As Corey handed his debit card to the butcher, he noticed a man brooding outside.\" \"What's with that guy?\" he asked. The butcher let out a sigh. \"He's having marital trouble. His wife and him haven't been getting along well.\" Corey gave a scoff. \"That's nothing compared to the trouble I've seen. My wife is a vulture.\" \"I see. Married a real gold digger, did you.\" \u201cNo,\u201d said Corey. \u201cI mean she\u2019s <i>literally</i> a vulture. A big, fat, fat, fat vulture.\u201d The butcher and his assistant looked at Corey in concern. \u201cUh,\u201d said Harold. \u201cExactly what line of work are you in?\u201d Corey didn\u2019t know exactly what to say and just bit his lip. \u201cI\u2019m a.... a mortician.\u201d With that, he left the butcher shop and the butcher let out a sigh. \u201cUndertakers,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re lonely men. They don\u2019t have a lot of options so they scrape the bottom of the barrel. Still, they serve a purpose, just like the vultures.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Corey was driving back home with the meat and let out a sigh. \u201cI hope Drew hasn\u2019t dug up any graves in her hunger. That would seriously make me look like an incompetent undertaker. What a day. I really hope I can get used to this.\u201d Suddenly, Corey came to a stop because Erlking walked out into the road. Erlking screamed as he was nearly run over.\u201d Corey drove to the side and then parked the car before running out to confront Erlking. \u201cLook before you cross the road, dumbwad!\u201d yelled Corey. \u201cI\u2019ve got enough problems today without...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Corey stopped mid-sentence as Erlking was waving his hands. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cErlking was just...\u201d \u201cErlking?!\u201d yelled Corey. \u201cAha! So you turned my wife into a vulture!\u201d Erlking gulped. \u201cOh dear,\u201d he said. \u201cIt happened again. I\u2019m bad at this.\u201d Corey raised an eyebrow. \u201cHappened again? What do you mean?\u201d \u201cIt happens whenever I grant a wish. I don\u2019t try to do it, but my magic just has a mind of its own.\u201d Corey was now horrified beyond belief. \u201cYou mean to tell me that my wife isn\u2019t the only one of your mutated victims? You jerk! Fix it right now!\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d said Erlking. \u201cOnce I grant a wish, I can\u2019t grant a wish to undo the wish. I'm afraid that the damage is permanent.\" Corey was so mad that he was just about ready to punch Erlking but he stopped himself. \"You're <i>supremely</i> lucky I've got bigger birds to fry. Get out of town. I never want to see you again, you troublemaker.\" Erlking nodded his head nervously and teleported away. Then Corey let out a sigh. \"Well,\" he said. \"It looks like I'm going to have to break the bad news to Drew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Corey was back home, he saw several spectators gathering around. \"What the?\" Corey looked to see several people staring out and taking photographs. \"What's going on here?\" One of the young men from the crowd turned and faced the mortician. \"You've got to see it,\" he said. \"It's the biggest vulture I've ever seen.\" Corey looked up and was completely dumbfounded by what he saw. Drew was gathering trees, barbed wire and crushed cars and appeared to be building a nest atop the biggest mountain within range. \"Drew!\" yelled Corey. \"What the Sam Hell are you doing!?\" Drew had to wait to answer Corey because she had a broken down truck in her mouth that needed to be put down. \"What does it look like, Honey?\" asked Drew. \"I'm building a nest. You don't seriously expect me to fit in our bed and house anymore.\" \"Drew! The neighbors are literally staring.\" Drew gave a scoff. \"Well,\" she said. \"You got to admit, a vulture as big as a Megazord isn't the easiest creature to hide. What do you expect?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd was even more surprised. \"A talking vulture?\" \"Wait, did he say that vulture was his wife?\" \"Isn't he the undertaker.\" \"Undertakers are creepy guys, but I didn't think anyone would be creepy enough to marry a giant buzzard.\" Corey slapped himself in the face and grumbled. \"First of all, a vulture and a buzzard aren't the same thing. Second of all, she wasn't a vulture this morning. Some idiot turned her into a vulture because she wanted to fly like a bird.\" The crowd didn't appear to hear Corey and just started to take photographs. Drew let out a sigh as she continued building her nest. \"There goes the neighborhood.\" Corey shook his head and let out a groan. \"Oh sure,\" he said. \"My customers can rest in peace, but we'll never get a day of peace with all this commotion.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make matters an even bigger headache for the Weevers....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few days later, Drew had settled into her nest and was snoring away. Corey on the other hand couldn\u2019t sleep at all with an 80ft vulture wife snoring. He was shaking in bed. Since Drew could no longer fit in it, Corey had the bed to himself and as a consequence he wasn\u2019t used to the extra space. The very next day, Corey was drinking an extra large cup of coffee as Drew was busy with something she scrounged for breakfast. \u201cYou know, Corey,\u201d said the ginormous vulture to her tiny husband. \u201cYou would sleep very tightly in the nest.\u201d Drew smirked and shook her 110ft wide feathered booty. Corey just gave a scoff. \u201cYou may not be a human being any more but I still am. It\u2019s bad enough that people know I\u2019m married to a vulture. It\u2019s bad press for an undertaker to be married to....\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorey then saw Drew munching and was horrified. \u201cWhat the **** are you eating!\u201d Drew just swallowed what was in her mouth before speaking. \u201cDon\u2019t rightfully know. I found it in the woods. I think it was a bear given the size. Hard to tell. I think some other scavengers got to it first.\u201d Corey gagged and turned his head to vomit. \u201cThat is disgusting!\u201d Drew let out a slight burp. \u201cWell,\u201d said Drew. \u201cI\u2019m a vulture. Vultures eat dead things.\u201d Corey grumbled. \u201cDrew! I handle the dead for a living! I\u2019m a mortician! Do you have any idea how bad for business it would be if people knew my wife was a scavenger!? Nobody wants their deceased to be fed to a giant bird.\u201d Drew gave a scoff. \u201cWhat do I look like? A cannibal? Geez, you\u2019re such a pessimist.\u201d \u201cWhen you do what I do, Drew, it\u2019s hard to be optimistic about anything.\u201d Drew just let out a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there was the sound of hammers pounding away. \u201cWhat the?!\u201d yelled Corey. Corey immediately ran to check out the noise and realized it was coming from a couple of construction workers pounding in a rather large billboard. Corey looked up and read the billboard. \u201cCome, see the largest vulture in the world. What?!\u201d The billboard depicted a more stylized version of Drew and depicted the giant obese vulture woman chewing on what looked like a skeleton of Godzilla or at least a similar dinosaur. \u201cWhat!?\u201d Corey rushed to the foreman just as Drew flew overhead and cast an enormous shadow. Drew tried to perch on a nearby mountain only to have it come apart underneath her big butt. She had to flap her enormous wings as she could just to avoid falling flat on her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell is going on?!\u201d yelled Corey to the foreman. The foreman lit a cigar right before he coughed. \u201cWe have orders from Mayor Baldwin. He thinks that your blimp of a wife is good for publicity.\u201d \u201cSay what?!\u201d The foreman coughed a few more times before he held his throat. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at the world\u2019s largest vulture. Your old lady makes the California condor look like a chickadee.\u201d Drew let out a laugh at that idea and even blushed but Corey wasn\u2019t laughing. \u201cThat\u2019s not cool,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s my wife! Not a sideshow freak!\u201d \"Don't shoot the messenger, man. Think about it. It could put the <i>eggs</i> through college.\" The foreman laughed at his own joke as Corey let out an angry yell into his hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat comment really shook Drew up. \"Oh my gosh, Corey. I never thought about it like that.\" \"We don't <i>have</i> kids, Drew.\" \"Not yet,\" said Drew as she held her beak down to her husband's level. \"But we could one day.\" \"Drew,\" said Corey. \"Don't you find it more pressing that the town wants to turn you into a laughing stock.\" Corey was walking to the car when Drew stepped in front of him, her belly pressing against the ground. \"Calm down, Corey. Don't you think you're being too hasty.\" \"You don't see the gravity of this. Nobody will take you seriously after this. If I have to, I'll fly to city hall to complain to Baldwin!\"</span></div></div>",

Drew shook her large booty and smirked as well as she could with a beak. Corey realized exactly what he said and gave a groan. \"Drew,\" he said. \"I didn't mean that literally. If you think I'm... Ah!\" Before the undertaker could finish his sentence, his wife grabbed him by the back of his collar with her beak and then tossed him onto her back. Corey slid down and then grabbed a hold of one of Drew's tail feathers and laid his other hand against his vulture wife's mountainous ass before he heard wings flapping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, oh no, Drew. You are not...\" But before Corey could reason with his wife, Drew flapped her wings and flew up into air above the mountains. Corey looked down and nearly had a heart attack as he saw the entire town miles below. Drew let out a laugh at her minuscule husband's fear. \"What's the matter, Hun? Don't tell me you're afraid of heights.\" Corey let out a grumble and climbed the vulture's enormous booty. \"If I wasn't before, I sure as heck am now. Just get us to city hall so I can complain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrew gave a shriek and then flew down. Over town, everyone stared at the vulture giantess flying down. One old man dressed as a birdwatcher was drawing pigeons in the park when he spotted the enormous and obese bird and dropped his teeth before he switched the sketchpad and tried to draw the giant vulture. Drew flew down and landed on the street, creating a giant dent in the road the shape of her behind. She then looked in embarrassment to see that she flattened a truck. Corey let out a sigh. \"When the owner gets back. Tell him to send me a bill. I'm going to have a talk with Mayor Baldwin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrew shrieked and nodded her head as her husband entered city hall. She then started to pick at her feathers with her beak while Corey gave a grimace. Corey walked up to the secretary and pounded his fist on the table. \"I'd like a word with Baldwin. Corey Weever. Undertaker.\" \"Right this way, Sir.\" \"I know the way!\" Corey kicked the door open and confronted the mayor. \"Baldwin! You have no right to make an exhibit out of Drew!\" Mayor Baldwin held up his head and looked at Corey in fear. Corey's undertaker outfit made him look like a western ghoul and it didn't help that he was angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Weever,\" said Mayor Baldwin. \"Don't you go blowing your top. Sure, your wife's condition is unfortunate but she doesn't seem to think so. Besides, you can't hide a vulture as big as the Chrysler Building. People will find out sooner or later, so why not find a way to profit off of it. This could put our town on the map. After all, Oakhaven has the world\u2019s biggest turkey. We\u2019ve got the world\u2019s largest vulture.\u201d Mayor Baldwin gave a laugh and held up a t-shirt of a vulture sitting on the Earth. However, Corey wasn\u2019t amused. \u201cThat vulture just happens to be my wife!\u201d \u201cListen,\u201d said Baldwin. \u201cWeever. I happen to know you\u2019re a mortician. Vultures eat carrion don\u2019t they? Who would trust a mortician whose wife could and would eat his \u201cclients\u201d.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst of all,\u201d said Corey. \u201cDrew is still human on the inside and is not a cannibal. Second of all...\u201d There was suddenly a crashing noise. Both Drew and the mayor looked up and spotted the ceiling cracked and a part of Drew\u2019s feathered butt sticking out. The two men looked outside to see that Drew had tried to roost on city hall and cracked the ceiling in the process. Corey looked in surprise while everyone around took photographs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait,\u201d said Mayor Baldwin. \u201cShe looks fatter than I thought she was. And bigger.\u201d Corey looks up and his eyes pop out because indeed Drew\u2019s height and weight both rose and her stomach at the point was both obstructing traffic and pressing against a bank wall at the same time. She was bigger than she was just five minutes ago, but by how much...</span></div></div>",

The quarterback was getting ready. \u201cHut, hut, hike!\u201d The quarterback tossed the ball to one of his men but that young man grunted before collapsing on the ground. The quarterback let out a groan. \u201cCome on, Waterman. We have a game tomorrow.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s the point, Armstrong? It\u2019s been a lousy season. The Chickenhawks haven\u2019t won a game all year.\u201d Armstrong bit himself in the lip before he spoke again. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cOkay. I know that we haven\u2019t been having the best season, but come on, people! We have a game coming up and we have no time for pessimists.\u201d\u2028\u2028It was there eight cheerleaders showed up and the leader was Armstrong\u2019s girlfriend, Dory. She was a tall and very buxom young woman with red-orange hair as she shook her pom-poms. \u201cChickenhawks sore through the sky, the other team will drop and die. When we swoop down today, the football field we\u2019ll find our prey! Go chickenhawks!\u201d Armstrong let out a sigh. \u201cAt least somebody is being optimistic.\u201d Dory ran up to Armstrong and grabbed her boyfriend\u2019s arm. \u201cThe only reason you guys haven\u2019t been winning is because you guys forgot how to think like real winners. Just try and be positive, Armstrong.\u201d Armstrong let out a scoff. \u201cAre you kidding me, Dory? Let\u2019s face it. We can practice all we want but these mopers have a point. And tomorrow we go up against the Gladiators. They\u2019ll slaughter us. I appreciate your support, Dory. But nothing is going to save the chickenhawks now. Come on, Chickenhawks, let\u2019s take five.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Dory was with her friends, Reika and Michelle and were walking through town. \u201cYour boyfriend is being a real grouch lately.\u201d Said Reika as she licked her ice cream. \u201cWell, Reika,\u201d said Dory. \u201cHe\u2019s under a lot of stress. The chickenhawks were unbeatable when Armstrong\u2019s dad went to school but now, they\u2019ve been facing a losing streak for 10 years and now that Armstrong is in college he\u2019s taken it upon himself to get the hawks back on track.\u201d \u201cCome on, Dory,\u201d said Michelle as she brushed her blonde hair. \u201cThe chickenhawks haven\u2019t been doing so well lately and that\u2019s why Armstrong is so grumpy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what the problem is,\u201d said Dory. \u201cThe problem is bad luck. What we need is a good luck charm in order to raise people\u2019s spirits.\u201d \u201cTough luck, Dory,\u201d said Michelle. \u201cI spent my lucky penny by mistake the other day. Besides, where are you going to find a four leaf clover?\u201d Reika then pointed to a shop. \u201cThat shop looks interesting.\u201d Up ahead there was a shop that had voodoo dolls, strange charms, jars with strange alien skeletons inside and a minotaur\u2019s skull laying on the center of the table. Michelle gave a shiver. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cThat looks like an evil shop.\u201d However, Dory looked in and say an Egyptian looking necklace of a hawk\u2019s eye and gave a smile. \u201cWhat better good luck charm for the Chickenhawks?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As the trio walked away, the eye around Dory\u2019s neck was glowing brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Dory didn\u2019t think about that and instead, she walked out in order to continue with cheer practice. All 8 of the cheerleaders were practicing ferociously but Dory was leaping higher than the other girls. \u201cWould you look at that,\u201d said a Hispanic girl. \u201cDory is jumping higher and higher. She looks like she could fly. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculously, Faith,\u201d said an African girl. \u201cIt\u2019s a placebo effect. She thinks that the necklace works and so it does.\u201d \u201cBut, Layla,\u201d said Reika. \u201cI don\u2019t think any amount of cheering is going to do any good for the Chickenhawks.\u201d Dory jumped down and confronted Reika. \u201cI heard that Reika. Any more negative attitude and you\u2019re suspended from the squad. Okay girls. Since Horus is guiding us, we\u2019re going to do an old favorite. The human pyramid. Line up. We\u2019re going to give it all we got.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls all did as their leader commanded and lined up for the human pyramid. Four of the girls jumped back first as Reika, Faith and Michelle jumped into their hands. Finally Dory jumped up and then landed on their hands. However, the girls grunted and then fell back and Dory grunted as she landed butt first on Reika. \u201cOMG! Are you girls okay?\u201d Reika groaned and then got up. Then she gasped. \u201cDory,\u201d she said. \u201cYou might want to look at your caboose.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDory looked back and gasped because not only had her ass expanded exponentially, but she also had sprouted bright reddish brown tailfeathers. Reika and Michelle ran up to Dory as Dory started to grow taller. \u201cDory,\u201d said Reika. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Dory slapped her ass as the eye necklace around her neck glowed brightly. \u201cSo, my butt is getting bigger. Armstrong will like that. He always said it was his favorite part of... urk!\u201d Then Dory looked and saw that her belly and breasts were following and her neck got much thicker as she sprouted a triple chin and then she felt more feathers growing all over her body as she appeared to be getting bigger. \u201cOh my gosh,\u201d said Reika. \u201cThis is not normal.\u201d Dory then saw her shoes slip off and her socks get torn off as her feet turned into large and sharp talons and her legs stretched out into thunder thighs. \u201cOh no,\u201d groaned Dory. \u201cThis is why I hate Mondays.\u201d With that, Dory\u2019s mouth turned into a sharp beak with a black tip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the cheer squad looked at their sorority leader and saw that Dory had been transmogrified into a 60ft tall anthropomorphic and Egyptian looking chicken hawk. She had two F-cup breasts that her shirt was barely containing, a 90ft wide butt that completely murdered her skirt, an 80ft wide belly and thighs big enough to crush elephants. The rest of the cheer squad looked in shock and Dory herself was surprised and then held up her necklace. She took it off, believing that it would undo the spell but it didn\u2019t and she was still a hawk. \u201cDory?\u201d asked Michelle. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d Dory just smiled and then let out a laugh. \u201cUh, Dory?\u201d asked Reika. \u201cDory just flew into the air and revealed her 135ft wingspan as she perched onto the dorm building, her fat ass completely shading it. \u201cOh,\u201d said Dory. \u201cI\u2019m more than alright. This is awesome. Wait until the football team sees that their head cheerleader now doubles as the mascot. If I could find enough material, I can dress as an Egyptian goddess and then we\u2019d really be jumping.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDory let out a laugh as Michelle held up one of the hawk giantess\u2019s feathers that was now as big as a human being. \u201cDory,\u201d said the blonde. \u201cYou do realize this will take some getting used to, right?\u201d Dory just gave a smug grin. \u201cCall me...\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Marie walked in and saw that the restaurant looked like a standard 1950s restaurant but what worried her was that there was nobody there. \u201cThis does not look promising.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe owner then walked out and let out a laugh. He was a tall and very hairy man with a mustache and from the looks of it, he hadn\u2019t showered for days and Marie held her nose at the sight of him. \u201cWelcome to Zoogie Burgers,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m Zoogie. May I take your order?\u201d \u201cOui. Ma nom est Marie Delacroix. Food critic.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d said Zoogie. \u201cThen this is my chance at the big time if you like my burgers. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll find you something good. Just wait here.\u201d Marie did that and looked around to see paintings of American cartoon characters from the early half of the 20th Century. Marie heard chopping and was very much not looking forward to whatever Zoogie was doing in the kitchen but then sighed at the d\u00e9cor. \u201cI personally prefer European cartoons. I wonder who\u2019s more popular in America? Luke or Asterix?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was there there was a loud sound and Zoogie came back with food. \u201cThere you are! Ostrich burgers, specialty of the house.\u201d Marie looked at the burgers and was not confident with the quality of the brugers. \u201cExcusez-moi,\u201d said Marie. \u201cBut aren\u2019t ostrich burgers illegal in this area.\u201d Zoogie just gave a nervous laugh. \u201cI won\u2019t tell if you don\u2019t tell.\u201d Marie just shrugged her shoulders and then bit into the burger. However, she immediately regretted it and gagged because something about the burger was not doing her tastebuds any good. What Marie couldn\u2019t have known was that A) the ostrich burgers were indeed made out of actual ostrich meat but it was made out of ostrich meat that had been improperly handled and was sitting next to tanks of what appeared to be toxic waste and had been out in the sun too long. That combined with Zoogie\u2019s poor cooking had violently upset Marie\u2019s stomach and she held herself in pain. \u201cOh, please don\u2019t sue me!\u201d yelled Zoogie. Marie just held her stomach in pain. \u201cI really don\u2019t think that I need to taste anything else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie groaned and then jumped out of her seat as Zoogie tried to stop her. \u201cWait!\u201d yelled Zoogie. \u201cYou\u2019re making a horrible mistake.\u201d Marie groaned. \u201cThe only mistake that I ever made was eating your horrid cooking. You can expect a rather nasty review for your restaurant, Monsieur Zoogie. Oh.\u201d Marie stormed out of the restaurant and Zoogie pulled on his hair. \u201cDammit!\u201d he yelled. \u201cAnother dud! I gave up plumbing for this?\u201d Marie just continued to groan as she was walking away from the restaurant. \u201cI better tell Henri that I\u2019m not going to be in the mood for cooking tonight. Ugh. He and the kids will just have to order\u2026 ow. Oh, as soon as I\u2019m done calling Henri, I\u2019m calling the health department to shut that eyesore restaurant down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as Marie typed on her cell phone, indigestion was going to be the least of her problems. In fact, she didn\u2019t notice but her rear end was getting larger and fatter as she walked away and her legs were getting as long as ostrich legs.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Zoogie should be in prison for selling such tainted and putrid food.\u201d Marie then groaned again. \u201cI feel so bloated.\u201d Marie had no idea how spot on she was because she was getting bigger and more bloated with every step. Her skirt tore apart and revealed the panties trying to cover her enormous ass. However, her hips were the part of her that were growing at the most rapid rate and her nylon stockings were tearing apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she wasn't just getting fatter. Marie's body was changing. Her neck was slowly getting longer and fatter and bright colored reddish brown feathers were growing all over her body and she sprout long fluffy white feathers on her butt. Her feet also turned into talons like those of a bird. Of course, these changes went completely unnoticed by the French food critic as she took out her cellphone to contact her husband Henri, all while she was holding her stomach in absolute pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bonjour, Henri. C'est moi. \u00c7a va? Moi, J'ai mal au ventre. I ate at a restaurant run by a man named Zoogie who is less qualified to be a restauranteur than a bathroom attendant. He fed me ostrich burgers that were so rotten that the flies wouldn't even touch them. I might even have to go to the hospital. Listen, I'm not going to be in the mood to cook tonight, so please tell Marcel and Chantal that you'll have to order out. I don't care. Order a pizza or something. I won't be ready to eat for some time. My stomach is killing me. Au revoir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie let out a groan as she held her stomach in absolute pain and hung up. She saw a pub up ahead and then ran in as she yelled. Everyone looked at her and saw her run into the bathroom. She was about to reach a stall when she twitched and got on her knees. Feathers sprouted all over her body as she became more and more bloated. \"I think I might just be allergic to ostrich meat.\" Then, Marie squawked and her mouth turned into a beak as her neck elongated. Outside, there were several people tapping on the bathroom door. \"Mademoiselle? Mademoiselle, are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie then stood up and her panties tore apart revealing a patch of black feathers that had grown to resemble a pair of small shorts on thick meaty grayish pink legs like those of an ostrich. Marie then felt her butt expand and knock the sinks off the wall as water came bursting down the pipes. Marie then squawked because her belly got larger and larger and pushed into the stalls, breaking them down. Her neck expanded and her breasts got bigger as her arms turned into wing with clawed, feathered hands. She coughed a few times and then she started to grow until she burst through the pub's roof and everyone outside the pub looked up and saw a sight that made them stop and stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie had transformed into a giant anthropomorphic ostrich. She stood 80ft tall (110 if you included her thick neck), 3 chins, a 90ft wide butt and 100ft wide belly that crushed the rest of the pub, forcing the patrons to run out. Marie looked at herself in horror. \"Zut alors! Un grand autruche!\" \"She is huge! But I saw her entering the bathroom and she was a human.\" \"What is this world coming too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie let out a groan and looked at her new body. \"Those ostrich burgers were even worse than I thought. I've been poisoned! Oh! And my stomach still hurts.\" Marie waddled up to a nearby river and stuck her head into the water in order to swallow as much as she could to heal her stomach. Marie took her long neck out of the water and then gargled before she stomped away. She then reached into what was left of her jacket to take out her cellphone to call her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenri was at home watching the television with their children, Marcel and Chantal and they looked in shock at what they were watching on the television because it was video footage of the giant obese ostrich woman stomping through Paris holding her stomach in pain. Henri and his children had their jaws dropped and then the phone rang and Henri answered it. \"Bonjour?\" \"Bonjour, Henri,\" said Marie. \"You aren't going to believe me, but I've somehow turned into a giant ostrich from really bad cuisine.\" \"Oh,\" said Henri. \"I believe you, Marie.\" On the television, the ostrich giantess was holding up her cell phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa,\" said Marcel. \"Is Mama going to be okay?\" \"Je ne connais pas, Marcel,\" said Henri. \"I have never seen a case of food poisoning this bad.\" Chantal then took the phone from her father. \"Chantal! What are you doing?\" Chantal then talked with her mutated mother on the phone. \"Mama,\" she said. \"I think you need to see a doctor. You look severely ill.\" Marie groaned before she sat down on a large building and spoke with her daughter. \"Tell me something I don't know, Chantal. I feel like I'm either going to fart a hurricane or lay an egg as big as the Eiffel Tower. But I think it's getting better, I think that....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when the ostrich giantess held her stomach in pain and then let out a loud fart. Everyone around her looked in disgust and Marie blushed in embarrassment before running out of the city limits and then she ducked her head in the ground. She gave a moan. \"This truly is the lowest point of my life. From a food critic to the world's largest bird.\" As the ostrich giantess had her head in the ground, the rest of the Delacroix family drove to look for their matriarch. Henri was driving their car when Marcel looked out and spotted something. \"Papa, look!\" What Marcel spotted was Zoogie at his restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoogie was being pulled away in handcuffs. \"Oh come on! That meat was only left out for two weeks. How was I supposed to know the chemicals I was using were harmful. I had no idea it would turn that lady into an ostrich.\" \"Well,\" said Chantal. \"It serves him right. He turned Mama into a big bird.\" \"Well,\" said Henri. \"I hope that wife of mine is doing well. Wherever she is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut in the forest at the time...</span></div></div>",

My son, the goalie. That\u2019s no position for a Monroe. Sit up straight in the car. You don\u2019t want people to make you think you were raised in a barn.\u201d \u201cSorry, Mom.\u201d Groaned Cole. Janet was driving her son to soccer practice. Cole didn\u2019t even like soccer but Janet bullied him into joining. The fact was, Cole had the extreme misfortune to have been born to the ultimate soccer mom.\u201d Janet\u2019s husband was with them and looked at Cole in sympathy. \u201cDear,\u201d said Taylor. \u201cDon\u2019t you think you\u2019re being too hard on Cole? So what if he\u2019s not the most athletic kid in the world.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the problem, Taylor,\u201d said Janet to her husband. \u201cLack of exercise leads to health problems and I will not have my child spending his school year in the emergency room.\u201d Cole rolled his eyes in the back. He resented his mother for being so overdramatic and acting to control him. He would like to see how she felt when something happened that she couldn\u2019t control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the Monroes arrived at soccer practice and Taylor and Janet walked out to talk to the coach. Before Taylor could say a single word, Janet butt in. \u201cI would like to know why you made my son goalie instead of captain. His grandfather was the football captain when he was in school, my brother was captain before\u2026\u201d \u201cMrs. Monroe, I already told you, Cole has weak legs.\u201d Said the coach. The coach then lowered his voice. \u201cNot to mention a weak will from dealing with you all the time.\u201d Janet stomped her foot. \u201cYou listen here. It\u2019s your fault. If you worked towards improving upon the weakness, my son would have a future, but no, you had to just be apathetic\u2026\u201d As Janet was giving an earful, the rest of the soccer team was staring and one turned to face Cole in embarrassment. \u201cBoy, Cole. Your mom sure is mean.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t know the half of it.\u201d Thought Cole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor then pushed Janet to the side to speak with the coach. \u201cJanet,\u201d he said. \u201cPerhaps we should let me speak to Coach Delgado.\u201d Janet gave a glare and stomped away before she got in the car and drove off. \u201cI don\u2019t have to deal with this,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m late for the bake sale anyway.\u201d In the back of the car was a blackberry pie. Coach Delgado glared at Taylor. \u201cYou need to stand up for yourself more. That harpy needs a big fat kick in the fanny treating you and Cole like that.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s not all bad,\u201d said Taylor. \u201cI mean, she wants what\u2019s best for\u2026\u201d \u201cShe wants what she THINKS is best for Cole. She\u2019s not letting him live his own life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet overheard the coach and then drove forward rather angrily. She parked the car and then let out a scream. Janet then turned her head to learn that nearby, there was a man in green rags and a metal mask rooting through the trash. \u201cCome on,\u201d said the man. \u201cI saw that pizza boy drop you. I know you\u2019re in there, come to Erlking.\u201d Janet scoffed. \u201cI\u2019ll bet that you don\u2019t have to worry about your child\u2019s performance in soccer.\u201d Erlking turned his head and looked in confusion at Janet. \u201cWhat do you mean, lady?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt\u2019s my son,\u201d said Janet. \u201cHe\u2019s not the captain of the soccer team. The coach said he had weak legs. What does he expect from substandard equipment?\u201d Erlking nodded his head and then he took out a slice of pizza from the trash. \u201cSo, you want him to get stronger.\u201d Janet nodded her head. \u201cFor the Amarillo High Amadillos, they need a much bigger and harder ball. I wish I knew where to buy one.\u201d Erlking noticed the pie in Janet\u2019s car and smirked. \u201cPaid in full!\u201d he yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet turned and saw Erlking grabbing the pie and yelled. \u201cHey! Come back with that pie for the bake sale you dirty hobo!\u201d Erlking saw Janet chasing after him and had to run as he cast his spell with a mouth full of pie. \u201c1, 2, Spell me too. Let this woman\u2019s wish come true. Hear me high, hear me well. Let me be this spell.\u201d Erlking faded away as Janet grit her teeth. \u201cWhy you no good.\u201d Suddenly, Janet grunted and then felt her butt expanding. \u201cOh no,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d That was when Janet turned to see her back was getting bigger and then looked into her mirror and screamed as she saw her face turning into that of an armadillo.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With all the trash that's coming into this town, it makes it hard for decent people to breathe. I'll fix his wagon.\" Janet took out her phone not realizing that her back was expanding, to say nothing of the rest of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" said Janet. \"Sheriff? This is Janet Monroe and I'd like to report a crime. A dirty, haggard, ugly, homeless man in a horned mask and green rags just stole the blackberry pie that I made for the bake sale and then he made my face look like an armadillo's. No I am not drunk! It happened just as I dropped off my son for soccer practice! Are you threatening me!? Listen here, you bumpkin! I don't know what the rest of the town sees in you but when election day comes, you're in for a big surprise! You hear me!\" Suddenly Janet heard a ripping sound and turned to see her butt had expanded until each cheek was the size of a watermelon. Her butt also had plates on it like that of an armadillo and a long tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet saw the bright golden orange-colored plates and gasped before she looked at her fingers to see they turned into claws. Janet yelled in horror as her clothes tore off and she expanded into a 17ft tall armadillo woman. Her belly was now 25ft wide, her butt was 20ft wide and she had a pair of large D-cup breasts. She appeared to have a triple chin now and she felt all over her fat body in horror and let out a scream. \"This isn't happening!\" she shouted. \"This can't be happening! This is a nightmare!\" Janet then walked forward and accidentally stomped on a mailbox before she yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown the street, Taylor was walking down to look for his wife. \"Coach Delgado is right though,\" said Taylor to himself. \"Janet has been pushing both me and Cole around a lot lately. Heck, Cole hates soccer. It was Janet's idea he joined the team. She's too much of a perfectionist. One of these days I'm going to really tell her... Ugh!\" Taylor nearly slipped and fell into a hole in the ground. He stopped himself and then noticed that the hole was shaped a lot like a footprint of some kind. \"That looks like an armadillo footprint,\" said Taylor. \"But there aren't any armadillos in this area. Heck. This footprint looks like it belongs to an armadillo big enough to eat a bear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor heard a rumbling sound and saw that there were more of the armadillo footprints in the ground, at the time, unaware that they were Janet's footprints. As Taylor followed the footprints, he spotted the giant armadillo woman slowly trying to scurry away and gasped before falling to the ground on his back. \"Good grief!\" Janet's ears picked up and she turned and faced her husband at her feet. \"Taylor!?\" yelled Janet. Taylor recognized the giantess's voice and gasped. \"J-Janet?\" Janet turned her head. \"Don't look at me!\" yelled Janet. \"Ugh! This is horrible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor stood up and poked one of Janet's car crushing butt cheeks before looking up at his wife. \"Janet?\" asked Taylor. \"What the... how... how did this...?\" Janet let out a shriek and grabbed her ears. The armadillo woman was filled with intense rag. \"Some homeless man did this to me. His name was Earl or something or other and said some mumbo jumbo to turn me into this ugly beast. And that idiot sheriff didn't believe me. I mean, what are we paying the ****ing town for!\" Taylor tapped his wife a few times and was in shock. But then he realized something and rubbed his chin. He thought about how Janet pushed both him and their son around and her bad attitude towards the soccer coach and insistence that the school was at fault for Cole being a mere goalie. Given how mean Janet was lately, he saw this as an opportunity to teach her a lesson for her behavior. \"Uh,\" said Taylor. \"Janet, maybe you should curl into a ball. After all, you can't let anyone see you like this.\" Janet admitted that her husband had a point and then with a little effort, curled her giant obese body into a large and round ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Janet was curled up, she let out a grumble to herself. \"I hope they find that horrible man who did this to me and throw him in jail for the rest of his life. Dirty hobo. I'd like to...\" Janet then grunted because she felt something being attached to her. \"What the?!\" What Janet didn't know was that Taylor was applying tape to her to make sure she stayed curled up in her ball form. He was laughing to himself as he put on a tape. \"Janet did say faulty equipment was at fault for Cole's status on the soccer team. Well, let's see how hard they can kick this ball.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taylor!\" yelled Janet in a muffled tone. \"What are you doing?! I swear if... ack!\" Taylor took out some white paint in order to paint his armadillo wife to look like a soccer ball. \"You've been quite an overbearing soccer mom lately, Dear,\" said Taylor. \"Let's see how you like it when the shoe is on the other foot.\" Taylor took out black paint in order to finish the paint job on Janet as Janet was fuming mad inside. \"You traitor!\" she yelled. \"If you're thinking what I think you are, you can cook your own dinner for the next month!\" Taylor paid his wife's threats no heed and finished the paint job. He then whistled to himself as he pushed Janet towards the soccer field as the curled up armadillo giantess let out muffled swear words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor returned to the soccer field and Coach Delgado and the soccer team looked in surprise at the large \"soccer ball\". \"Janet said that you had substandard equipment,\" said Taylor. \"So I decided to pick up something to remedy it.\" \"Oh my gosh.\" Said the coach. \"Dad,\" said Cole. \"Where did you get a soccer ball that big?\" \"Uh,\" said Taylor. \"I'd rather not say.\" Janet let out a moan as Taylor rolled her into the field. \"You're gonna pay for this Taylor. You will pay.\"</span></div></div>",

Soccer practice was quickly rolling and the children were surprisingly able to handle such a rather large \"soccer ball\" and manipulate it without hurting themselves. \"Ooh!\" shouted Janet in pain. One young boy gave a blink. \"Is it just me, or is this ball surprisingly light?\" One girl then headbutt Janet, making the armadillo giantess curled into a ball groan as she wobbled in a zigzag pattern. Inside her curled form, Janet grabbed herself by the mouth to prevent herself from vomiting all over herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the kids were busy with soccer practice, Taylor had explained everything to coach Delgado. \"What?\" asked the coach. \"That soccer ball is Janet?\" Taylor nodded his head. \"This may sound hard to believe, but somebody turned her into an armadillo the size of a bulldozer. She's been acting really mean and snooty lately, so I decided to teach her a lesson. Since she was blaming your equipment on Cole's performance in soccer practice and didn't consider that Cole may not even like soccer, I decided to paint her to look like a giant soccer ball.\" \"You're right,\" said the coach. \"That <i>is</i> hard to believe. But if that's true, she's going to be furious. You're dead meat, Taylor.\" Taylor let out a sigh. \"I'll jump off that bridge when we get there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the field, Janet kept grunting in pain as she was kicked through the soccer game. \"Why is this even happening?\" asked the mother turned armadillo to herself. \"I'm 10 times bigger than these kids and (ouch!) they're kicking me around as if (Ooh!), I was lighter than (Ow!)...\" Cole was about to get ready to kick the \"ball\" but then he gave a look of confusion. \"Is it my imagination?\" he asked. \"Or is that soccer ball screaming?\" One girl on the same team stepped forward. \"You can't be serious. Get out of the way. That thing will crush you.\" Janet rolled forward, trying to shake off the glue holding her in her ball form but the girl got ready and ran towards her. As small as that girl was and as big as Janet was, the young challenger kicked what she assumed was a soccer ball so hard that Janet was sent rolling and screaming at a rapid speed towards the goal. The goalkeeper saw the \"ball\" coming and out of panic, jumped out of the way as the \"ball\" kept on rolling out of the field and down the hill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" shouted Janet from trapped inside her spherical form. Taylor saw the \"ball\" rolling and grabbed himself by the mouth. \"Okay,\" he said as he tried to fight back the urge to laugh. \"I know I'm going to get it later, but it'll so be worth it.\" At that moment, Janet kept rolling down the hill screaming and people were running for their lives to avoid being flattened by such a giant round creature. The armadillo giantess kept on rolling and rolling until she reached a large pier and rolled off the docks with a big splash into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for Janet, the water diluted the glue that was holding her stuck and caused her to uncurl. The water also washed away the paint that made the armadillo giantess look like a soccer ball. She had also undergone another growth spurt. The armadillo woman was 30ft tall with a 35ft wide butt and belly. She coughed and shook her head as she climbed back onto the docks that shattered beneath her massive weight as she crawled back onto land. The massive armadillo lady gave a cough before she grit her teeth. \"You're going to pay when I get home, Taylor Monroe. Oh, you're going to pay.\" Janet then looked at her reflection in the water and screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm even bigger now! And look at how <i>fat</i> I am! All that time on the treadmill come to naught! I can't believe I got turned into a giant armadillo. What did I do to deserve this?\" Janet growled and then she grunted as she held her stomach in pain and it let out a loud growl. \"I'm starving,\" said the giant armadillo woman. \"Oh man. I'd probably need to eat an entire truck to stop this aching hunger.\" The armadillo giantess then looked forward and saw that she was about to have a feast as up ahead there was...</span></div></div>",

Well, just because they\u2019re getting bolder doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re getting more competent.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe police arrived at their destination and then exited the car. Drake smashed a warehouse door with his fists and saw a printing press of some kind that was being used for counterfeiting purposes. \u201cYup,\u201d said Alex. \u201cFunny money.\u201d \u201cThen why aren\u2019t I laughing?\u201d asked Drake as he punched the press to wreck it. However, he then heard a motor and then Drake and Alex ran to see the gang members of Circle-5 leaving on a motorboat. \u201cNot today, punks.\u201d Said Drake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Drake and Alex ran up and then jumped out in order to land on the getaway boat. As Alex landed, she caused the boat to rock slightly and then the grunts turned around only for Alex and Drake to shoot their guns out of their hands. \u201cYou can so be Lucky Luke.\u201d Joked Alex to her partner. But that was when Drake turned and noticed that there was far worse cargo on the criminals\u2019 ship that simple counterfeited money but what looked like a case of experimental bombs. \u201cWhat are those?\u201d he asked. It was there a rather large criminal muscleman with wires attached to his head and muscles charged in and then assaulted Drake to make him drop his gun into the water. \u201cNone of your business, creep.\u201d Drake stood up and then looked at the much stronger criminal. \u201cSmasher.\u201d He said. Smasher smirked. \u201cWell,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t Drake Savage. I remember how you\u2019ve been hunting me like a dog for years.\u201d \u201cMaybe that\u2019s because you ARE a dog, Smasher.\u201d Smasher didn\u2019t like being unfavorably compared to a dog and tried to strike Drake again, but then Alex shot at him a few times. \u201cLeave him alone, jerk.\u201d Smasher then gave an evil smirk and grabbed Alex by her double chin. \u201cAlex!\u201d yelled Drake in worry. Smasher laughed wickedly and threw Alex overboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrake tried to jump to help Alex but Smasher grabbed him and slammed him face first into the railing of the ship, knocking lose the crate full of bombs. Alex was sinking before she managed to keep herself afloat and then saw Drake continuing to be beaten on by Smasher. Before Alex could even think about getting out of the water and going after Smasher, she saw a great white shark coming forward. \u201cOh no.\u201d She said. The shark attacked Alex and forced her to try and wrestle the creature before it could bite her. The shark had obviously mistaken the overweight woman for a rather large seal. While Alex was busy with the shark and trying to keep it under control. One of Smasher\u2019s bombs fell out of the ship and floated right near the policewoman and the shark and begun to beat. Alex spotted the bomb counting down and gave a look of fear because she was sure that it was going to kill her. \u201cOh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBOOOOOOOM!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As Alex let go of the shark, she saw that her fingers were becoming webbed and her teeth were falling out as hundreds of razor sharp fangs were taking their place. Alex then grabbed her neck and yelled because gills were sprouting on her neck and her obese body seemed to becoming even rounder than usual and she was quickly getting bigger. \u201cWhat next?\u201d asked Alex. \u201cAugh!\u201d Alex yelled because at that moment, a large dorsal fin had sprouted on her back and her eyes had turned bright red. She then let out a loud roar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack on the boat, Savage had cornered Smasher. \u201cYou\u2019ll pay for what you did to Alex, Smasher.\u201d But Smasher just cracked his knuckles as Savage held up his gun. \u201cGive me a break, Drake,\u201d he said. \u201cCops risk their lives everyday. You\u2019re risking it right now picking a fight with somebody who you just can\u2019t win against.\u201d Drake shot at Smasher but Smasher blocked the bullets with his biceps and then ran at Savage where he proceeded to beat on the policeman. Savage grunted as he was punched and blood leaked out of his mouth. Drake then headbutt Smasher and slammed Smasher to the ground. He would\u2019ve put the cuffs on him but Smasher came prepared with mace and then sprayed the cop in the eyes before putting him in a headlock before squeezing tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour girlfriend is probably shark food by now,\u201d said Smasher. \u201cWhich is what you\u2019re going to be really soon.\u201d Smasher let out a laugh but then he also heard a rather loud roar. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d the criminal asked.\u201d There was a large shadow and then there was a loud shaking noise. \u201cSounded to me like one of the sharks jumped ship.\u201d Smasher\u2019s men then screamed and ran away. \u201cMonster! There\u2019s a monster shark on board!\u201d \u201cCowards,\u201d said Smasher. \u201cIt can\u2019t move on land. Just don\u2019t go anywhere near...\u201d The crooks then screamed as they heard a loud roaring noise and something tore through the cabin of the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmasher looked in fear because it was a 27ft tall anthropomorphic great white shark very obese with a 45ft girth, a 35ft wide butt and large H-cup breasts. The shark also had reddish brown hair worn in the same style as Alex and was wearing lipstick and the remains of a police uniform. Drake looked in surprise because he recognized the titanic shark mutant as his partner. \u201cAlex?!\u201d he yelled. Smasher was in pure fear as Alex looked down at him with red bloodshot eyes. \u201cThe bomb hitting the water combined with the shark attacking her must\u2019ve mutated Alex,\u201d thought Drake. \u201cAnd with the appetite she had before, I really hope that sharks prefer donuts to human flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex just let out a growl.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Let\u2019s rock and rule!\u201d Atlanta and Archie laughed before Archie spun his wife around and she shook her dancing shoes. Atlanta and Archie Rainmaker were a couple that although they weren\u2019t born even close to the 1970s, they lived in the time period everyday with how they decorated their home. Most people thought they were insane but every Friday night, the two would shake a leg or two at the local discotheque.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, Arch,\u201d said Atlanta. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of this place and bust a move.\u201d Archie let out a laugh. \u201cI knew that there was a reason that I married you. Let\u2019s boogie!\u201d Both Archie and Atlanta were right outside the door and Atlanta did a twirling dance only to slip as she grunted. Before she could hit the ground, Archie grabbed hold of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa there, Little Mama, you alright?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m fine, Little Papa,\u201d said Atlanta. \u201cBut it don\u2019t look like we\u2019re going anywhere tonight.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean, Atlanta? After all, we\u2019ve always gotten down on Friday Night. It\u2019s called TGIF for a reason. Come on!\u201d Atlanta then held up her foot and showed that the heel broke in her shoes. \u201cLooks like my dancing shoes have had their last dance. I can\u2019t go anywhere with one heel, they\u2019ll think we\u2019re weirder than we normally are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028However, that was when Archie saw a mysterious shop with strange odds and ends up ahead and smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t you worry, Atlanta, my dancing queen, we\u2019ll knock them dead soon enough on the dance floor. I\u2019ll bet that store sells shoes. Wait here.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArchie ran up to the store and then walked inside to see all sorts of odds and ends all around. There were scarlet beetles in jars, what looked like a golden seashell, a box that appeared to be shaking and even a crystal ball. \u201cAha,\u201d said Archie as he walked up ahead. \u201cShoes.\u201d Archie saw several pairs of shoes, there was a pair of glass slippers, a pair of sandals as red as blood, a pair of blood-stained Jordans but the shoes that caught Archie\u2019s eyes were a pair of green shoes resembling alligator shoes. \u201cSnazzy.\u201d\u2028\u2028Archie picked up the shoes and read the label. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo alligators were harmed in the making of these shoes. But it\u2019s highly recommended that you don\u2019t put them on. Of course I won\u2019t put them on. They\u2019re high heels, shoes for Atlanta. She\u2019s gonna love them. Hey, shopkeep! Huh, he must be out.\u201d Archie took out some money to put on the table and then walked out, not noticing that there was a nearby minotaur\u2019s skull on the table that appeared to be snoring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Atlanta put the shoes on and smiled. \u201cSo, how do you like those croc shoes, Atlanta?\u201d Atlanta smiled. \u201cBanging, Archie. Now it\u2019s off to the club. Disco waits for no one. Woo!\u201d Archie and his wife laughed and walked off, not noticing the large and scaly green tail sprouting from above Atlanta\u2019s now surprisingly large butt cheeks.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Atlanta looked at her husband as if he was daft and shook her tail that she had no idea existed. \u201cWhat are you talking about, Arch?\u201d \u201cUh, nothing.\u201d The Rainmakers decided that it would be best to walk up into Club Mango. The bouncer was a tall Japanese man in a bright red jacket with a banana tattoo on the side of his arm. \u201cArchie and Atlanta,\u201d he said. \u201cIt must be Friday.\u201d The bouncer then noticed that Atlanta who had previously been shorter than Archie, was now the same height as her husband and appeared to have gotten fatter as well from the looks of her much larger midriff. Wanting to change the subject, he noticed Atlanta\u2019s alligator dancing shoes. \u201cNew shoes?\u201d he asked. Atlanta held up one of her legs that looked thicker than usual and smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d she said. \u201cOne of my dancers quit on the way over and it was good fortune that there was a bizarre bazaar that was selling footbenders, yo.\u201d The guard nodded his head as the Rainmakers walked in but then gasped the minute he saw that Atlanta had a tail. \u201cI know a certain Anton who is going on the rack for this.\u201d Said the guard to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe discotheque was jumping and music was filling the air as Atlanta and Archie walked up towards the bar. They didn\u2019t notice it but there were a few people who couldn\u2019t help but stare at Atlanta\u2019s reptilian tail and her massive rear that was slowly devouring her bellbottoms as green scales were growing all over her back. Her skin was turning tough and somewhat reptilian in appearance. However, the Rainmakers were both blissfully unaware as they came up to the bar table and Atlanta\u2019s now much larger ass had taken up three whole seats, three of which wound up being bent due to the sheer magnitude of the female hippie\u2019s rear. The bartender didn\u2019t even turn around to look at Archie and Atlanta until Archie banged on the table. \u201cYo! J.J.! What\u2019s shaking!\u201d yelled Archie. \u201cWell, well,\u201d said J.J. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t the Rainmakers. I was wondering when you two would show up for the party.\u201d \u201cSorry, Cat,\u201d said Archie. \u201cMy young lady bent an Achilles heel on the way over, but luckily there was a shop nearby that sold gators.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Archie was busy speaking with the bartender, Atlanta felt her stomach gurgling, although she had no idea how large it had gotten and then she spotted a vending machine. However, it was one particular treat in the vending machine that caught her eye. It was a small bag of Jack Link jerky and the sight of it prompted Atlanta to get up from her three mangled stools and walk up to the machine to buy the jerky. By the time she returned, Archie looked at her in surprise, not at the fact that she was now taller than him and obese but because of the fact that she was eating jerky at all. \u201cAtlanta?\u201d asked Archie. \u201cThat\u2019s beef jerky. I\u2019ve never known you to munch on meat.\u201d Atlanta just gave a hiccup before speaking again. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Arch,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what came over me but I\u2019ve got the munchies for something dead and red.\u201d The barkeeper saw nothing unusual and gave each of the Rainmakers a glass of rather odd-looking blue lemonade. \u201cVoila,\u201d said J.J. \u201cMr. and Mrs. Rainmaker, this here is my new concoction, blue flamingo lemonade.\u201d \u201cBlue flamingo?\u201d asked Atlanta with a laugh. \u201cJ.J. your eyes must be running on monochrome, yo. There\u2019s no such thing as a blue flamingo.\u201d \u201cHe must be from the land of the boars,\u201d said Archie. \u201cI\u2019m open for new experiences Atlanta.\u201d \u201cAnd whatever\u2019s good enough for my man is good enough for me, Archie,\u201d said Atlanta. \u201cBottoms up.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Atlanta and Archie were drinking their drinks, J.J. noticed that Atlanta\u2019s skin looked a shade of yellow-green for some reason and her teeth appeared to be turning into razor sharp fangs. \u201cWhoa, Atlanta,\u201d said J.J. \u201cWhen was the last time you saw a dentist.\u201d Atlanta looked in confusion and was slightly dazed from her drink. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d asked Archie. \u201cAre you saying my wife has yellow choppers?\u201d \u201cNot yellow, Archie. Atlanta\u2019s teeth look a little too sharp for my tastes. They look kind of mean.\u201d Atlanta then looked at her fingernails and realized that they had been turned into  rather sharp claws and then looked back and noticed her alligator\u2019s tail. However, because she had recently downed an unfamiliar drink, it didn\u2019t cross her mind that she was mutating. \u201cGee whiz, Archie,\u201d said Atlanta. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I like this new drink. J.J. you haven\u2019t been putting any L and S and Ds in here have you? I\u2019m starting to see crazy things.\u201d J.J. just scratched his head before the DJ started to play (ironically) Crocodile Rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO.M.G.!\u201d yelled Archie. \u201cAtlanta, that\u2019s his voice, the great one.\u201d \u201cWicked cool, Archangel,\u201d said Atlanta. \u201cThat\u2019s the song they played on our wedding night. Let\u2019s show the squares how the Dancing Queen and her king tear up the disco floor.\u201d Archie and Atlanta laughed and made a break for the dance floor as J.J. looked and noticed the stools that Atlanta had murdered and then saw Atlanta\u2019s scaly green tail and dropped his jaw in the process. The music was playing as Archie and Atlanta grabbed each other in an embrace and were dancing ferociously on the disco floor. At this point, Archie was too into the music to notice that his wife was now two heads taller and had at least 150lbs on him as he twirled her around and she wagged the tail she had no idea she had at the moment. As Atlanta was moving her feet, her alligator shoes appeared to merge with her feet and transformed them into the feet of an alligator just as her bellbottoms were being stretched out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the strange shop with the minotaur\u2019s skull, the skull had come alive and was looking around. \u201cAchilles!\u201d he yelled in a ghostly voice. \u201cHave you seen the alligator shoes made out of the scales of Sobek himself? Not crocodile. Alligator. We locked the crocodile Sobek shoes in the basement. I know Sobek was a crocodile god but alligators and crocodiles are related species. Huh, what\u2019s this money from. Don\u2019t tell me some yutz took those... well at least they paid for once. Although by now they\u2019re probably paying with more than money. Guess we better leave town. One titan in this place is enough for now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at Club Mango, Atlanta was giggling as she and Archie continued their dance and the other dancers were staring. \u201cLook at her skin,\u201d said one girl dancer. \u201cShe\u2019s so dry she\u2019s already sprouted a tail.\u201d \u201cNot only that, she\u2019s huge,\u201d said another girl. \u201cHer bellbottoms are being eaten alive by all that ass.\u201d \u201cAnd look at those teeth. I don\u2019t know whether she\u2019s going to kiss him or bite his head off. She looks absolutely hideous and disgusting.\u201d But Archie and Atlanta were completely oblivious as to what exactly was going on with them. \u201cAlright, Archie. Let\u2019s knock them dead.\u201d \u201cYou got it, Atlanta.\u201d Archie twirled Atlanta and those her giggling self up into the air with the intent to catch his wife as she landed.<br>\r\n\u2028However, while in the air, Atlanta was getting larger and larger as her transformation was completing. As she was laughing, her face stretched out until her head was that of an alligator as her long brown hair appeared to be glowing from the shine of her scales. Her underbelly turned a more yellow-shade of green to contrast with her Chartreuse scales as her throat expanded and she grew bigger and fatter. The other patrons of the discotheque screamed in fear of the giant alligator lady who was about to land. But before Archie could realize what had happened to his wife... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtlanta landed butt first on top of her husband and cartoonishly flattened him into her enormous alligator booty. However, Atlanta got up and was really concerned, though she had no idea that she was an alligator. \u201cArchie? What happened, you were supposed to catch me. Archie managed to squeeze his way out of Atlanta\u2019s reptilian butt cheeks before he looked up and saw what had become of his wife. He then gasped and then took off and adjusted his glasses and then stopped to clean them because he didn\u2019t trust his eyes 100% that he was seeing a giant alligator, a giant alligator that had to be 25ft tall with a 40 ft wide girth and ass, D-Cup breasts and three chins. While Archie was trying to reconfirm what he saw, Atlanta looked at her scaly hands in surprise and then felt her obese scaly belly and opened her mouth to see that she had hundreds of sharp teeth. But surprisingly despite everyone else in the discotheque staring at her in pure fear, Atlanta didn\u2019t fully believe that she wasn\u2019t hallucinating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cArchikins,\u201d said the alligator titaness. \u201cI think that lemonade has turned.\u201d Archie put his glasses back on and looked at Atlanta before...</span></div></div>",

Dang. There must\u2019ve been something really funky in that blue lemonade. Looks like this night is knocking off early. You don\u2019t dance well when you\u2019re high.\u201d Atlanta nodded her head and begun to walk away as the patrons of the discotheque ran out of the way to avoid being trampled by the alligator lady\u2019s massive feet. One man even took off his star-shaped sunglasses because he couldn\u2019t believe it himself. \u201cWait a minute,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t drink the lemonade. Archie, you ain\u2019t tripping. Your old lady is an alligator and a big one at that.\u201d Archie just gave the man a stare. \u201cDon\u2019t call my wife old lady, man. She only looks like an alligator now because we\u2019re stone cold... uh... stoned. As soon as the two of us aren\u2019t baked, we gonna report this house to the department of health. Them drugs ain\u2019t funny. Come on Atlanta, we\u2019ve partied too hardy.\u201d\u2028\u2028Atlanta let out a grunt and nodded her green reptilian head before stumbling to the door, only to find that she was much too big to fit through it. Though, since Atlanta thought she was high at the time, she still attempted to open the door and wound up destroying the wall in the process as she and her husband walked out. \u201cCome on, Arch. We\u2019re going home.\u201d Archie and Atlanta left the club as the rest of the patrons were dumbfounded. \u201cWell that was a Big Lipped Alligator Moment,\u201d said girl at the party. \u201cLiterally.\u201d One bright orange haired girl scoffed. \u201cLeave it to Atlanta Rainmaker to turn into a monster on the dance floor. Exactly what kind of drugs was she on?\u201d \u201cArchie and Atlanta are dead set against drugs,\u201d said a young man with an Afro and a pierced lip. \u201cYou know that. Anyway, those two are going to get a big surprise when they wake up tomorrow and learn for sure that this isn\u2019t a drug-induced hallucination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Atlanta and Archie were still walking down the street (or wobbling in Atlanta\u2019s case), still under the impression that Atlanta\u2019s transformation was just a hallucination. \u201cOh my, Archie,\u201d said Atlanta. \u201cMoon daddy, that was some heavy lemonade. I feel so bloated.\u201d \u201cNot to be a nitpick, my Atlanta Ocean, but you did feel like you put on weight back there. When you came butt down on me, I felt like I was that Atlas cat in Greek mythology. Hell, isn\u2019t that the guy your daddy named you after.\u201d Atlanta let out a scoff. \u201cI ain\u2019t fat, Archie. But you do look abnormally small. What kind of stuff was that. Oh man, I\u2019ve got the munchies like you wouldn\u2019t believe and I\u2019m too wasted to cook.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said Archie. \u201cWe\u2019ll find something. There\u2019s gotta be an eatery open around here.\u201d As Archie and Atlanta were walking down the street, Atlanta failed to notice that she was crushing several cars under her feet and ass because she couldn\u2019t see past her ginormous belly. One jogger spotted them and she gasped as she looked up at the titanic alligator woman. \u201cWell,\u201d said the jogger. \u201cThat answers the question about alligators flushed down to the sewers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArchie and Atlanta just continued to walk in search of a restaurant. \"So, Atlanta,\" said Archie. \"What's on the menu tonight? A little Chinese? Perhaps a taco or two?\" Atlanta just snapped her jaws as her mouth begun to water and she turned to see a steak house up ahead. \"Somehow,\" said Atlanta. \"I think that place has what I'm looking for.\" Archie squinted and even though he thought he was high at the moment, he clearly recognized a steak house when he saw one and was surprised that his wife would suggest such a thing. \u201cAtlanta?\u201d asked Archie. \u201cAre you sure about that, babe. That\u2019s a steak house. I don\u2019t eat meat. You don\u2019t eat meat.\u201d Atlanta\u2019s stomach just rumbled ferociously and the alligator woman patted her stomach. \u201cI know, Archfiend, but for some reason, my mouth wants something red and bloody.\u201d Archie could not believe that Atlanta would actually suggest eating meat, but even if he didn\u2019t realize that Atlanta truly was a 25ft tall alligator, it would be a mistake to argue with his wife, so the two of them were walking up to the steakhouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArchie came in first right before Atlanta burst in and scared all the other customers, causing them to scream and run. \u201cWhat was that all about?\u201d asked Archie. \u201cI dunno,\u201d said Atlanta. \u201cGuess they don\u2019t like \u201chippies\u201d around here.\u201d Atlanta plopped her ass down and destroyed half the seats in the restaurant in the process. All the waiters were too scared to come out when the chef came forward. \"What's going on in here?\" he asked. \"It looked like an earthquake struck this place.\" \"Worse, sir,\" said one of the waiters. \"An alligator dressed as a hippie just came in and she's huge.\" \"An alligator dressed as a hippie. Of all the...\" The chef spotted Atlanta chewing away at the napkin holder and was shocked and afraid. All the other waiters ran off as one waiter couldn't run off fast enough as the chef grabbed him by the collar and made him gag. \"Sorry, kid,\" he said. \"But we need all the men we can get.\" \"But that's an alligator!\" \"Exactly. Give an alligator everything she wants to eat so she'll be too full to want to eat you.\" \"Excuse me!\" yelled Atlanta. \"Not to be rude, but this dancing queen's got the mega munchies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter and the steak chef clearly didn't want to upset Atlanta so they brought out most of the meat they had in the kitchen and laid it on the table. Of course, Archie noticed something strange about the meat. \"Uh. I don't normally eat meat, but isn't it supposed to be, I don't know, cooked?\" Atlanta on the other hand, licked her lips and ate all the meat she could with one enormous mouthful as she continued to chomp down. \"I don't mind, Archikins,\" she said. \"Surprisingly it actually tastes better this way.\" Atlanta even let out a deep belch. \"Atlanta,\" groaned Archie. \"You'll get sick eating raw meat like that.\" Atlanta gave a look of embarrassment as she showed her large bloodstained teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I don't think that's gonna be a problem.\" Said the waitress. Archie just looked in confusion. \"But that raw meat's not supposed to be good for you. Besides, it could make her totally fat.\" \u201cAre you blind?!\u201d yelled the waiter. \u201cYour wife is an alligator as big as a house!\u201d Archie shook his head. \u201cKid,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t do that blue lemonade at Club Mango. It\u2019s making you see crazy things.\u201d \u201cI am not high! And neither are you! Have you noticed that your wife\u2019s ass alone is taking up half the restaurant.\u201d Atlanta let out a growl at that comment. \u201cKid,\u201d she said as she unconsciously showed her sharp teeth. \u201cYou never mention a woman\u2019s weight.\u201d Atlanta then unconsciously let out an alligator\u2019s growl. \u201cOh really?\u201d asked the waiter. \u201cLook in the mirror! Haven\u2019t you noticed that you have a tail.\u201d Atlanta looked back and wiggled her enormous tail that had to be 15ft thick and would up tearing the wall off the side of the restaurant. \u201cAnd look at those teeth!\u201d Atlanta felt one of her hundreds of teeth and realized just how sharp they were. \u201cOkay,\u201d said Atlanta. \u201cMaybe a trip to the dentist is...\u201d \u201cStop right there! Answer me this, lady. Do you normally eat meat?\u201d Atlanta scoffed. \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cArchie and I are strict vegetarians.... usually. Tonight I just had a craving for...\u201d \u201cThat settles it! For some reason, you\u2019ve turned into a giant alligator!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArchie and Atlanta processed this information and both gave looks of surprise. Atlanta even reached into her cleavage for her compact mirror and finally realized she was a giant gator. \u201cCrazy!\u201d she yelled. \u201cSweet Elton John!\u201d yelled Archie. \u201cIt must\u2019ve been them alligator shoes I bought you. They must\u2019ve been magic.\u201d \u201cWell don\u2019t just stand there, Archikins, let\u2019s get them...\u201d Atlanta held up her leg and saw that the shoes had disappeared and her feet became the webbed claws of a giant gator. \u201cCrazy Jane.\u201d \"Don't panic, Atlanta,\" said Archie. \"We'll just go back to that naughty shop and ask the keeper to put the kibosh on this curse.\" Atlanta got up and destroyed the ceiling on the steakhouse before she and Archie ran out. \"Hey!\" yelled the waiter. \"You didn't pay!\" The chef let out a groan. \"I just had an idea,\" he said. \"Alligators eat for free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArchie and Atlanta walked down the street to try and find that strange shop. \"What kind of crazy shop sells alligator shoes that turn the wearer into an actual alligator?\" asked Atlanta. Atlanta suddenly heard a ripping noise and was that her bell bottoms were coming apart at the sides and gave a nervous look. \"We better hurry, Atlanta,\" said Archie. \"I'm not sure how big you're going to get. Aha, this is the place.\" Unfortunately when Archie and Atlanta finally reached the spot where Archie found the shop, they saw the shop had disappeared. \"Ratsville!\" yelled Archie. \"I could've sworn...!\" Atlanta let out a sigh. \"You know the man, Archie. They probably bulldozed the place down. Guess I'm going to have to get used to being an alligator as big as a Megazord. Come on, babe, we're going home.\" Atlanta picked up her husband and dropped him between her scaly green boobs before waddling away. Archie let out a sigh and smiled slightly. \"Well,\" he said. \"At least there's one advantage to this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtlanta was busy picking meat out of her teeth with her claws. \"I think I better look into hiring a bird to pick my teeth like alligators do.\" \"Those are for <i>crocodiles</i>, dear.\" Said Archie. \"What's the difference?\" \"Crocodiles have larger skulls and more narrow mouths and their teeth show when their mouth is closed.\" Atlanta just let out a yawn. \"Whatever, Archie. This is worse than a hangover and I want to go back home and sleep it off.\" It wasn't long before the Rainmakers got home. However, by the time they did, Atlanta was 50ft high with H-cup breasts and an 80ft butt and belly and couldn't fit in the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alligator lady just let out a sigh. \"Whatever.\" She said before laying down next to the house as she and Archie drifted to sleep.</span></div></div>",

The 50ft gator girl let out a slight growl. \u201cGeez,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m starving. I\u2019ve got a serious case of the munchies.\u201d Atlanta got up and started to walk away from the house. \u201cNo sense waking Archie up.\u201d However, as Atlanta walked away, the alligator giantess stepped on a car and set off its alarm, causing it to beep loudly. Not wanting to wake her husband up, Atlanta grabbed the car and then tossed it into her mouth to crush it with her teeth so as not to cause a scene. As Atlanta swallowed the car, she lowered her head in an attempt to listen into her stomach. She then let out a sigh. \u201cThank goodness,\u201d said the alligator giantess. \u201cCrazy. I almost ended up like that crocodile that swallowed the clock. How they heard the tick and tock through the snapper\u2019s skin, who knows.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028Atlanta stomped off in search of food and found a large football field nearby where she started to tear the grass out of the ground but she had trouble actually swallowing it and then just gave a coughing fit. \u201cNo good. Atlanta, you big fat reptilian dummy, alligators don\u2019t eat grass. They eat...\u201d Atlanta shivered just thinking about it. Neither she nor Archie ate meat so the idea of the fact that she now depended on a carnivorous diet disgusted her. The alligator giantess stuck out her tongue and then tore into the ground with her claws to tunnel into the sewers. As she did so, she rolled her eyes as she moved on all fours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn\u2019t help but laugh to herself. \u201cCrazy. An actual alligator in the sewers. Just like the old clich\u00e9.\u201d Atlanta then stopped and sniffed her armpit before she gagged. \u201cYou\u2019d think I\u2019d be used to smelling funky.\u201d the hippie alligator thought to herself. Her stomach growled again to remind her that she was hungry. \u201cDamn. I need to find something and soon.\u201d That was when Atlanta heard something from above. It sounded like a burglar alarm going off and then a woman\u2019s scream. \u201cShut up!\u201d yelled a voice from above. There was then a gunshot. Atlanta\u2019s blood ran colder than it already was when she heard what was going on. There were several more gun shots and the alligator giantess scurried through the sewer, tearing apart what was left of her bellbottoms. \u201cThat sounds like bad days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove there was a bank robber who was driving away in a car that was clearly stolen. He was wearing a tattered prison suit as he held his gun in one hand. \u201cLousy broad,\u201d moaned the robber. \u201cRatted me out. I hope they don\u2019t get to her in time. I didn\u2019t bust out of prison just to...\u201d The criminal suddenly drove more erratically due to the tremors created by Atlanta moving underground. Before he could do anything else, Atlanta had burst through the ground, knocking the car over. The alligator giantess shook off bits of the street and then looked down to see the criminal looking up at her. \u201cWhat the hell are you?\u201d asked the thief. \u201cSome kind of hippie crocodile.\u201d Atlanta let out a moan. \u201cI\u2019m an alligator actually. My husband already told me the dif....\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t care, broccoli buns!\u201d yelled the criminal. \u201cSo just waddle your leather-skinned, viridian fatass out of my way before I make you into a purse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtlanta\u2019s stomach growled again. \u201cListen,\u201d says Atlanta. \u201cI don\u2019t want any trouble and I\u2019m too hungry to...\u201d \u201cThen eat this!\u201d the bank robber tried to shoot Atlanta but Atlanta\u2019s size, girth and leathery skin made the bullets completely useless against the alligator giantess. Atlanta grunted and scratched her girth. \u201cFor the record. I despise violence.\u201d \u201cBite me!\u201d yelled the robber. \"Bite me you lousy hippie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtlanta\u2019s stomach rumbled again and at this point, hunger was clouding Atlanta\u2019s judgement. The alligator woman let out a roar and opened her large mouth to show all of her razor sharp teeth. Now, Atlanta normally wouldn\u2019t even consider eating meat, let alone stooping to cannibalism but her alligator body was influencing her behavior. Before the thief could react, Atlanta took a large bite out of the road, trapping him in her mouth.<br>\r\n\u2028Now does the alligator giantess let her instincts take over?</span></div></div>",

She gave a grunt and a growl before she gave an alligator's smile and tilted her head back, leaving the bank robber to scream as he traveled in a bulge down the 50ft alligator's throat. As soon as the criminal is eaten, Atlanta taps her large leathery belly and lets out a belch. \"Damn,\" thought the alligator hippie giantess. \"That's one crazy piece of meat. I had no idea...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Atlanta gasped and then dropped her jaw because she realized what she had done. \"What have I done!\" yelled Atlanta. \"Oh my gosh! I just ate somebody! Eating meat would be shocking enough but, is it cannibalism if you turn into an alligator and then eat some buddy. Well, look on the bright side, Atlanta. At least it was a criminal. But what is Archie going to think when he finds out....?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Atlanta could further grouse on the details of what she had done, her stomach begun to growl again. \"What?! How can I still be... Duh, Atlanta. You're 50ft tall. One bank robber is going to settle your stomach. Damn. Now I have a craving for meat. Hmmm.\" The alligator giantess then got on all fours and begun to crawl away, looking for more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for Atlanta to find something to eat because there was a couple of gangsters who appeared to be disposing of a body. \"Man,\" said one of the two gangsters. \"Some people just don't know better.\" \"Let's just drop the stiff and leave. The cops already got half our gang.\" \"Relax, man. By the time anyone finds us here, the gators will have already chewed through the body.\" The gangsters tossed the rolled up body into the water where it immediately sank. However, a stream of bubbles soon came up from under the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" It was at that moment that Atlanta surfaced out of the water and let out a roar. The gangsters screamed. \"What the heck is that?!\" \"I didn't know alligators got that big! Wait, does that thing have boobs?!\" \"Worry about that, later!\" Both of the gangsters shot at Atlanta but the bullets that didn't bounce off her lardy belly just bounced off of her leathery scales. Atlanta growled and then snatched the gangsters as they screamed and tossed them into her awaiting mouth. She moaned in ecstasy as she swallowed the criminals. For some reason, the once peaceful hippie enjoyed being a ginormous predator and she snapped her jaws as if she had a carnal urge to use them. She was still hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp the street, there was an attempted carjacking in progress and the would-be thief was so busy trying to hotwire the vehicle that he failed to notice the enormous meat-eating reptile behind him and by the time he noticed, both him and the car were in Atlanta's esophagus. Atlanta spat out a tire before wiping her mouth. \"Oops,\" she thought. \"I probably shouldn't have eaten the car as well. Oh damn. Atlanta, what happened to you? Yesterday you'd never consider eating meat and now you're a man-eater. This alligator spell is messing with your head girl.\" Atlanta's stomach gurgled again and she let out a growl. \"No. I can't eat anymore people. Wait. What's that smell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtlanta stomped forward and saw a fish market up ahead. She gave a smirk. \"Good,\" she said. \"It's closed.\" The alligator giantess snaps her jaws to rip the wall off of the fish market before using her tongue to slurp up all the fish inside. \"Not bad,\" said Atlanta. \"But eating all this meat is making me feel uncomfortable. Wait? Don't alligators eat fruit.\" Atlanta grabbed a fruit car filled with apples and then plopped it into her mouth before chewing it up. \"I better lay low for a while.\" The gator girl then decided to retreat to the beach and the enormous and obese hippie swam out to make sure nobody saw her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Archie had woken up and was looking for his wife. \"Atlanta?\" he asked. \"Atlanta? How does an alligator the size of a building disappear?\" Archie then noticed a newspaper on the ground and picked it up before he read the headline. \"Mass Disappearance of City's Illegals. Several criminals disappear mysteriously. Large reptilian footprints found at the scene of the crime. Paleontologists deduced that the footprints are <i>not</i> dinosaur in origin. More likely, a large carnivorous reptile?! Oh no. Atlanta. What happened?</span></div></div>",

A young businessman was in the backseat going over the contents of his briefcase and was looking at his chauffeur, a young Asian-looking brunette woman with a pair of goggles on her head. He lowered his head as she looked back. She was lovestruck with her boss but what she didn\u2019t know was that he seemed to feel the same way. \u201cJust drop me off here, Halle,\u201d said the businessman. \u201cI can walk to the meeting from here.\u201d \u201cSure thing, Remo. Uh, I mean, bo\u2026\u201d \u201cHalle, we\u2019ve known each other for years. You can call me Remo.\u201d Barbara pulled over to the curb to drop off Remo. \u201cOkay, Halle,\u201d said Remo. \u201cThe meeting won\u2019t take long. Just park in the parking lot up ahead and you have an hour break before I need you to pick me up.\u201d \u201cYes, sir.\u201d As Remo walked away, Halle gave a smile to herself but then noticed the limousine. \u201cMaybe if I washed this thing before he was ready, he might like it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Halle was driving away, Remo let out a sigh and then looked back at Halle. \u201cShe is something,\u201d said Remo. \u201cOne of these days, I\u2019m going to go through with it. Once it\u2019s over, she won\u2019t have to drive me around anymore. I\u2019ll hire somebody to drive us both around. That is, if she\u2019ll have me.\u201d However, Remo failed to notice that his chauffeur had the same feelings towards him. She then held her head down. \u201cWhat are you thinking, Halle? A rich handsome and powerful man like him wouldn\u2019t notice somebody like you.\u201d Halle then went to park the limo only to suddenly stop as a man in green rags and a metal mask walked in the way. \u201cOh my gosh!\u201d The man turned and faced Halle. \u201cOh,\u201d he said. \u201cSorry about that. I really should remember that red means stop. I\u2019ve been around so long my brain isn\u2019t working lately. I\u2019m Erlking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalle parked the car and Erlking looked at the limo and even noticed a hood ornament that looked a lot like a platinum sabertooth tiger. Erlking would\u2019ve stroked it but Halle stopped him. \u201cPlease, please don\u2019t touch it. My boss would have my hide if that ornament was destroyed. Sabertooths are his favorite animal. Well, they would be if they haven\u2019t been gone for thousands of years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYour boss,\u201d said Erlking. \u201cI think this sounds like more than a job for a young woman like you.\u201d Halle bit her lip. \u201cThe truth is,\u201d said the young woman as she pulled down her goggles. \u201cI took the job because he\u2019s such a gorgeous young man. Also very nice. Surprisingly given his place in society. And smart too. No wonder his folks retired early. But how on Earth could he fall for somebody like me? I\u2019m a chauffeur. I just wish that Remo would notice me.\u201d That was when Halle took off her shoe and then took out some money. \u201cHere,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in purses. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re safe enough.\u201d Halle handed Erlking the money and Erlking smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat a nice young woman,\u201d he said. \u201cI would love to help that brunette with her problem. She wants her boss to notice her.\u201d Erlking then looked at Remo\u2019s hood ornament and smiled. \u201cThat looks noticeable enough.\u201d Erlking then waved his hand in order to cast a spell. \u201cOne, two, spell me do. Let that woman\u2019s wish come true. Here me high, here me well, let me be this spell.\u201d With that, Halle was washing the limousine not noticing the magic spell that struck her.  Suddenly, Halle let out a yawn and then revealed that  her canine teeth had turned into enormous fangs that appeared to be still growing. The hood ornament on the limo also seemed to let out a roar.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She didn't know that Remo was looking out the window at her right before the meeting. He reached into his pocket and took out a box, the kind one would use to carry a ring. He let out a sigh. \u201cBy the end of the day,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to do it. I wonder if she\u2019s noticed.\u201d But Halle didn\u2019t notice. She had no idea of her boss\u2019s intentions for her and just absentmindedly polished the side of the car as she let out a sigh.

As she drove the car, Halle failed to notice that those fangs in her mouth from before were getting much longer and her belly was getting larger. She then looked at her hair in the rear-view mirror and let out a sigh. \u201cMaybe if I dyed my hair, he\u2019d notice me. Perhaps maybe aquamarine or violet or vermillion. Ouch. My mouth hurts. But I just had bridgework the other day. Ouch.\u201d Halle pulled over at the gas station and tried to get out of the car but grunted because her stomach had got in the way. Then Halle grunted because she accidentally hit her head on the top of the car\u2019s roof. Halle go out of the limousine and groaned in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s strange,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought that the car was bigger than that. Oh my gosh! I wonder if Remo is into tall girls. Huh, wishful thinking, Halle.\u201d Halle let out a sigh as she pumped gasoline into the limousine. \u201cHmmm,\u201d she muttered. \u201cWhy do I suddenly have a craving for raw meat. Halle at this point was 7 feet tall and weighed 500lbs. Not that she noticed it because her mind was on other subjects, mainly how to get her boss to notice her.\u201d Somebody pulled over their car next to the limousine and that man walked out and noticed Halle. \u201cWow,\u201d he said. \u201cCheck out the amazon. Hey, Wonder Woman, I think you\u2019ve been sitting too long in the invisible plane. You won\u2019t be able to fit in that spandex any longer.\u201d Halle wasn\u2019t paying attention and the heckler let out a groan. \u201cIt\u2019s no fun when they don\u2019t react.\u201d Halle had soon refilled the limousine and squeezed back inside with a lot of effort. At this point, she had gotten so fat that her butt pressed against both the diver and passenger seat in the front of the limousine and was caused both seats to crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh damn,\u201d said Halle. \u201cAm I putting on weight.\u201d Halle\u2019s fangs at this point were now as large as swords and as she was driving, she could no longer ignore them and gasped. \u201cLook at these teeth! Oh my gosh! That man! I wished that Remo would notice me, so he made me fat and have fangs. What the fu....\u201d Halle then gasped because her nose had suddenly turned into that of a feline and yellow fur was growing over her body and tore out of the sides of her black spandex pants. She saw her arms and legs bloating out and stepped on the gas. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get to the hospital!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028As the mutating woman was driving down the street, there was a man in front of her whose car was in both lanes at the same time. \u201cOh, come on!\u201d yelled Halle. Halle honked her horn and the driver of the cadillac in front of her seemed to be moving to the side to allow her to pass but then drove back in front of Halle. Halle tried to switch lanes but the rude man in the cadillac kept driving in front of her. \u201cHey, Jackass!\u201d yelled Halle. \u201cThis is an emergency!\u201d Halle was so angry she let out a roar and then her ass, belly and breasts expanded again. Her butt broke through to the passenger area of the limousine as her breasts pressed against the dashboard and her belly broke the steering wheel. \u201cOh crap!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalle swerved the limousine off the road right before she finally outgrew it and reduced the car to an ill-fitting thong that was squeezing her massive thighs and ass. Halle\u2019s pants had been reduced to undershorts that looked tattooed to her body and her shirt had been reduced to a bra as her belly poured out. Yellow fur had grown all over her body and she sprouted a stubby tail over her massive butt cheeks. Her face stretched into a snout and her fingernails and toenails turned into claws that were as sharp as knives. Her fangs were now enormous saber teeth. Halle moaned as she walked past a building and saw her reflection in a skyscraper. She almost fainted at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalle had become an 80ft tall saber-toothed tiger. Her belly was 130ft wide and was pressing against the building and making it crack. Her breasts were huge H-cup breasts and her ass was now 120ft wide and she had a triple chin. \u201cOh my gosh!\u201d yelled the sabertooth giantess. \u201cIs this what Erlking meant?! How can anyone not notice me now?!\u201d All around people were looking at fear and this caused Halle to panic as she ran down the street. Her movements and the shaking of her body caused what was left of the car to come apart and fall off her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need serious help.\u201d She said in despair. With that she ran off...</span></div></div>",

I joined the Polar Bear Club so your brother will give me a chance.\u201d Westley then dove into the water below and then grunted and screamed. \u201cI mean,\u201d said Westley afterwards. \u201cVery refreshing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was there, Undine turned to see her large and bulky older brother Albert walking forward. \u201cNot good enough,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you can\u2019t last that long in the water for today\u2019s swimming race, you can\u2019t hope to win. The deal is, you have to beat me to win a chance to marry my sister. I ain\u2019t letting her get saddled with a loser.\u201d Undine just gave her big brother a dirty look. \u201cAlbert, you\u2019re not being fair.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want you to wind up with any sap, Undine. Only the best is good enough for my baby sister.\u201d Undine just turned her head and pouted. \u201cDon\u2019t you pout at me, Undine,\u201d said Albert to his little sister. \u201cThis is for your own good. If Westley can\u2019t beat me, he can forget it.\u201d \u201cWhat if I win?\u201d asked Undine. Both Westley and Albert were surprised at Undine\u2019s proposition. \u201cWhat if you win?\u201d asked Westley. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that you\u2019re entering the competition, Undine. That\u2019s insane.\u201d \u201cAnd what is so insane about it?\u201d asked Undine. I have a right to seize my own destiny.\u201d \u201cForget it,\u201d said Albert. \u201cYou\u2019re no polar bear. The water is too cold for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUndine grunted and then was walking away. \u201cI\u2019d like to win that competition. I\u2019d like to be a polar bear. Then that would teach Albert a lesson. That\u2019s it, I\u2019m entering this race.\u201d Up ahead, there was a man in green rags and a metal mask shivering on a bench in the cold weather. \u201cOh no,\u201d said Undine. \u201cYou poor man.\u201d Undine then walked forward and gave the man her sweater that she was wearing. The man looked in surprise. \u201cHuh,\u201d he said. \u201cThanks, young lady. Erlking wasn\u2019t expecting any hospitality today.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d said Undine. \u201cI\u2019m not going to need it. I\u2019m going to be competing in the Polar Bear Club\u2019s swimming race.\u201d Erlking was very confused at Undine\u2019s words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPolar Bear Club?\u201d asked Erlking. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d asked Undine. \u201cIt\u2019s where we swim in icy cold water.\u201d Erlking raised an eyebrow. \u201cPeople do that on purpose?\u201d he asked. \u201cIs everyone on this planet insane?\u201d \u201cThe fact is,\u201d said Undine. \u201cMy brother challenged my fianc\u00e9 to a race in these frigid waters because he doesn\u2019t approve of him. I\u2019m sick of him treating Westley this way, so I\u2019d like to take Albert down a peg. I\u2019m going to join the race. I wish I would win. If I prove that I\u2019m just as much a polar bear as those two. Well, I\u2019ll see you later, Mr. Erlking. I\u2019ve got to sign up for the race.\u201d Erlking nodded his head as Undine walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hugged the sweater that Undine gave him tight and smiled. \u201cIf she wants to join the polar bear club, Erlking will help her out.

People had gathered to watch the polar bear club and the new applicants lining up in their bathing suits at the start of the race. Albert was staring smugly at Westley who was shivering. \u201cYou can always give up,\u201d said Albert. \u201cBut I\u2019m not giving my sister away to a wimp.\u201d Westley gave a glare at Albert. \u201cIt is so on, Albert.\u201d Albert and Westley glared at each other before they heard a groan. \u201cWould you two idiots knock it off?!\u201d Albert and Westley turned and looked in surprise as they spotted Undine walking forward in a bikini. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding me!?\u201d yelled Albert. \u201cYou were actually serious? Undine, the water out there is freezing.\u201d Undine simply glared at her brother. \u201cI\u2019m getting really tired of you being so unnecessarily overprotective. If I make it past the finish line, you have to leave Westley and me alone once and for all.\u201d Albert was stunned at his sister\u2019s words but was not one to turn down a challenge. He let out a sigh and relented. \u201cAlright, little sister. You have a deal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUndine lined up at the starting line as Westley gasped. \u201cUndine,\u201d he said. \u201cAre you crazy? You could catch hypothermia.\u201d Undine let out a scoff. \u201cI\u2019m the kind of girl who rescues herself. Trust me.\u201d Westley gulped but then accepted as the swimmers gathered and the official appeared. \u201cEverybody,\u201d said the official who was wrapped up in a faux fur coat and long beard. \u201cWe have gathered for the recruitment race for the polar bear club. The polar bears are a club of swimmers who go out in the absolute cold. To them, winter is only a state of mind. We\u2019ve gathered here to watch as those brave enough to face the freezing waters will try for their shot at being polar bears. Those who make it to the finish line marked by the green bellbuoy will be admitted into the club.\u201d\u2028\u2028Undine nodded her head and everyone took their places as the official held out his gun. \u201cOn your marks, get set, go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe official fired his gun and everyone dove into the water and begun to swim. Several of the would be recruits stopped not even a quarter of the way and retreated back to the land. \u201cWimps.\u201d Muttered Albert. Albert then gasped because Westley had easily swum ahead of him. \u201cHmm,\u201d he muttered. \u201cMaybe he is right for Undine after... Undine!!\u201d Albert looked in shock because at this point, Undine was way ahead of anyone else. Westley looked on and smiled as his girlfriend swam ferociously through the water. \u201cIt can\u2019t be,\u201d said another swimmer who stopped and saw that his toes had turned blue from the cold. \u201cHow could she not be cold?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUndine herself was wondering how the cold water couldn\u2019t effect her. \u201cThat\u2019s odd,\u201d she said. \u201cThe water doesn\u2019t even feel mildly breezy. Undine then noticed that her belly was expanding and she gasped. She dove underwater and felt her butt expanding as her bikini was being stretched out. Undine also spotted white fur growing on her arms and legs and then gasped and surfaced as her fingers were turning into claws. She surfaced from the water and saw Albert and Westley catching up to her. \u201cUndine!\u201d yelled Westley to his girlfriend. \u201cYou\u2019re almost there! Keep swimming!\u201d Undine saw that she was almost at the red bellbuoy and even Albert seemed to smile but then he gasped. \u201cUndine! Behind you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028The young woman looked back to see that her butt had expanded to the size of the bow of a boat and she sprouted a round medicine ball-sized tail. She let out a scream that evolved into a roar as she held her head and she started to undergo a strange transformation. Her white blonde hair extended as white fur grew all over her body and her face stretched into a snout. Her ears became more rounded and she growled again as she started to grow bigger and fatter. It was a wonder how her bikini stayed on. Both Albert and Westley were shivering. \u201cWestley!\u201d yelled Albert. \u201cWhat is going on with my sister?!\u201d Westley gulped. \u201cIf I knew, Albert, I\u2019d tell you.\u201d Undine roared as she transformed into a polar bear but she was continuing to grow bigger and fatter as multiple chins formed under her neck. In less than a minute she was 80ft high with D-cup breasts and a 110ft stomach and ass. Her big round tail was large enough to land a plane on at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around in shock at her new form before she opened her mouth and....</span></div></div>",

She then sniffed the creature and then she felt something. \u201cJust as I thought,\u201d she said. \u201cThis zebra is possessed by the ghosts of the mares of Diomedes. Before they gunned it down, it attacked several people and even ate a man\u2019s shoulder. Not normal behavior for its species.\u201d The witch doctor was preparing a cauldron as she took off a piece of the zebra\u2019s jaw and it seemed to growl as strange spirits filled the air. Right before the witch doctor put the jaw in a jar and trapped the spirits inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCalm down,\u201d she said. \u201cCalm down. The ghosts of the Mares of Thrace possessed this zebra and turned it into a flesh-devouring beast. Legends say that the horse rode by Alexander the Great was descended by this mares. The zebra was also descended from one of the mares that managed to reach Africa. That\u2019s why they possessed it. Who knows what these evil spirits with give their evil appetite too next? Which is why I will defuse and cleanse them just as they were cleansed in life.\u201d The witch doctor chanted to herself as she poured in some slime from her cauldron and continued to chant.\u201d\u2028\u2028In the next room, the woman\u2019s husband was playing poker with his friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGeez, Charlie,\u201d said one of them. \u201cWhat is your wife doing in there?\u201d Charlie shrugged his shoulders. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Alphonse,\u201d he said. \u201cEcho\u2019s working. That\u2019s the thing when your wife is a witch doctor.\u201d \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have married her, Charlie,\u201d said another of Charlie\u2019s friends. \u201cShe\u2019s creepy.\u201d \u201cJonny\u2019s right, Charlie,\u201d said Alphonse. \u201cShe\u2019s been obsessing over that taxidermied zebra all day.\u201d \u201cShe does a lot of weird stuff. But she saved my mom from going blind. I had to marry her after that. But then again, she has been cooped up all day. I\u2019m going to invite her to join us.\u201d Charlie was walking to try and get his wife and Johnny let out a groan. \u201cThat woman scares me. I\u2019d never marry someone like her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEcho continued to chant as she stirred the potion with the zebra\u2019s jawbone in it and inside of it, the spirits that were extracted from the zebra and saw then spinning in the jar. \u201cCalm down, spirits,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t you go making trouble now. And now, to finally cleanse you.\u201d But before Echo could continue what she was doing, the door opened up behind her and she wound up tossing the potion into the air as she yelled. \u201cHey, Echo!\u201d yelled Charlie. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come out and\u2026?\u201d The potion fell back down and then splashed over Echo as the witch doctor yelled. \u201cUh-oh.\u201d Said Charlie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEcho turned and glared at Charlie. \u201cCharlie,\u201d she said as she looked down and saw her bare stomach appearing to rumble and expand. \u201cYou fool! Look what you\u2019ve just done.\u201d Echo then grunted and continued to hold onto her stomach. She then sprouted a horse\u2019s tail as her butt completely destroyed her skirt and her skin was turning pale white with black stripes. \u201cOh crap.\u201d Echo said.</span></div></div>",

Charlie gasped as his wife let out a neigh and her face was twisting and turning into a snout as she let out a neigh. Echo\u2019s teeth surprisingly turned into fangs as her stomach got even bigger, then her boobs begun to bounce right before she sprouted a long black tail and her ears elongated. By the time the transformation was complete, Echo was a 10ft tall and 6 ton zebra with a 20ft wide ass and 8ft wide belly and E-cup breasts. Charlie saw his wife transmogrified and his jaw dropped right before Echo let out a neigh. \u201cEcho?\u201d asked Charlie. \u201cHoney, exactly what were you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEcho glared at her husband and pressed him to the wall with her large girth. \u201cI\u2019ll have you know that I was trying to contain the ghosts of the Mares of Diomedes who possessed that zebra before it was shot and stuffed.\u201d \u201cMares of Diomedes?\u201d asked Charlie. Echo sat down, her large rump causing the house to shake with a loud rumble before she explained everything to her husband. \u201cThe Mares of Diomedes, Podargos the swift, Lampon the shining, Xanthos the yellow and Deinos the terrible. They were four horses in Greek mythology who were violent, wild and uncontrollable due to their unnatural diet of humans. Heracles had to capture these horrifying beasts for the Eighth of his Labors. These man-eating horses continued to exist on as violent spirits, possessing their descendants to gorge once more. I was trying to seal away those creatures for good until you barged in! Dummy!\u201d Echo neighed loudly and angrily in her husband\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Echo. But I can\u2019t be expected to know all the workings of your magic spells.\u201d\u2028\u2028Echo just let out a sigh as she looked at her big ass. \u201cAnd I thought I had a big booty before. I know I got turned into a big old zebra, but I look like a hippopotamus with this big booty and belly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie looked at his wife's belly and ass and couldn't get his eyes off the striped wild horse meat on such tiny bones. \u201cWell,\u201d said Charlie. \u201cCan\u2019t you change yourself back?\u201d Echo glared at Charlie. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to do that Charlie. You\u2019re going to have to get used to having a hefty horse as a wife. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, since your little interruption destroyed all my ingredients, we have to go back to the grocery store. Come on, Charlie.\u201d As Echo walked out, Johnny and Alphonse saw their friend\u2019s wife turned into a giant obese zebra woman as she was trying to squeeze her way through the door. \u201cYes!\u201d yelled the rather annoyed zebra. \u201cIt\u2019s an ass! Get over it.\u201d Charlie walked out rather nervously. \u201cLooks like game night\u2019s off, guys.\u201d Johnny shook his head. \u201cThis is what happens when you marry a witch doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Echo tried to squeeze her way into the passenger seat of Charlie\u2019s car, but because of her much bigger backside, this was very difficult. \u201cEcho?\u201d asked Charlie. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to work?\u201d Echo grunted. \u201cNeed I remind you that you\u2019re the one who has a driver\u2019s license?\u201d \u201cEcho,\u201d said Charlie. \u201cYour butt is bigger than the car.\u201d Echo proved this true because part of one of her butt cheeks had gotten stuck in the car. Echo got up and lifted the car with her butt before she groaned and shook it off, to Charlie\u2019s dismay. Charlie let out a groan. \u201cThis is what I get for marrying a witch doctor.\u201d He thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Echo was much too large and fat to fit into the car, she and Charlie had to walk down the street, attracting stares from everyone they passed, to Echo\u2019s annoyance. \u201cOkay,\u201d said Echo. \u201cSo I had a little magical mishap. Big fat hairy deal.\u201d \u201cMore like big fat black and white hairy deal.\u201d Joked one onlooker. Echo gave a glare and showed her unusually sharp teeth for a zebra. At this point, Echo\u2019s witch doctor garbs looked more like a sumo loincloth and tank top on her fat equine body and her hair had turned into a giant black and white striped Mohawk. \u201cI really hope that we don\u2019t run into any lions on our way to the supermarket.\u201d \"Not funny.\" Charlie and his wife passed by a trio of gossipers who couldn't help but poke fun at the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's her,\" one of the said. \"I heard that she's that witch who's always working on strange experiments.\" \"What possessed her to turn herself into a zebra?\" asked another of the gossipers. \"She clearly has no shame walking around in a loincloth with her heavy weight.\" Echo gave a growl. \u201cI\u2019m not a witch! I\u2019m a witch doctor. Witch doctors undo all the bad things witches do! Get the facts together.\u201d The women spotted Echo's teeth and screamed before running off. The witch doctor smirked but then Charlie gave a look of concern. \"Uh,\" he said. \"Echo. Are you certain you can control those ghosts inside of your body.\" Echo felt her teeth. \"I must say,\" she said. \"I'm so hungry I could eat a...\" Echo's eyes popped because she realized the irony of what she was about to say. The zebra then grit her teeth and walked away as her husband ran after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last the two of them reached the supermarket. \"That's one thing about the modern world,\" said the mutated witch doctor. \"Ingredients are easier to come by. Albeit mayonnaise makes a poor substitute for eel saliva.\" \"Are you sure you should be going inside in your condition?\" asked Charlie. Echo turned and glared at her husband. \"Do you know anything about sorcery?\" asked the zebra woman.\" Charlie just zipped his lip. \"I'm going in.\" Said Echo. Of course, Echo had to bend down to squeeze into the entryway to the market and by the time she finally got her obese frame in the door, the automatic door closed on her tail and made her scream. Charlie could only sit down and sigh as he shook his head. \u201cAnd I thought it was a challenge to live with her before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, in the store, Echo made her way to the produce aisle. \u201cI hope they have some riper tomatoes than last time. Only the freshest ones have the enzymes I need. They work better than using a chicken leg as a substitute for a diseased bat\u2019s claw.\u201d The zebra woman picked up a basket and then bent down to inspect the tomatoes, but accidentally bumped her backside against a display of canned pineapple and caused all the cans to come crashing down as a supermarket worker yelled in shock. The zebra giantess just blushed and quickly ran out of the way. The worker gave a look of absolute horror as he saw Echo. \u201cOh my gosh! A giant zebra must\u2019ve escaped from the zoo.\u201d The manager showed up to help pick up the display. \u201cLeave her alone. It\u2019s just that insane witch doctor probably under the influence of one of her own spells. It\u2019s best to leave her alone.\u201d In the next aisle, Echo let out a moan as she held her head. \u201cThat was really embarrassing. What else could go wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEcho then heard a grunt because somebody was pressing against her backside with a shopping cart. \u201cHey lady! Get your fat lard butt out of the way! You\u2019re in three aisles at the same time.\u201d The witch doctor turned her head and then glared at the man who was harassing her. \u201cIt is unwise to raise your voice to a giant.\" \"What are you going to do to me?\" asked the jerk. \"You're a zebra.\" Echo in rage stomped on the man's cart and made him run off screaming. Echo let out a snort and a whinny. \"I'm not having a good night,\" said the witch doctor to herself. \"I'm not...\" Echo then grunted because she hit her head on the ceiling. She looked to see that she was just as tall as one of the aisles. \"Okay,\" she thought to herself. \"It appears that I'm actually getting bigger. Maybe I should've let Charlie accompany me in here after all.\" Echo waddled down the grocery store as people were staring at her. \"That is the most gaudy looking cereal mascot I've ever seen.\" Said one store-goer not appreciating the gravity of the situation. One woman stared at Echo walking away and rubbed her chin. \"That reminds me,\" she said to herself. \"I need to pick up some whipped cream for those zebra pies for the bake sale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEcho had picked up several cases of buttermilk and stuck out her tongue. \"This stuff isn't good for drinking, but it's good for deflecting evil magic.\" Echo then held her chest and let out a neigh. Inside of the zebra giantess's body, the ghosts of the mares of Diomedes were spinning around and shrieking as their eyes glowed white and then they entered Echo's brain and made the zebra woman's eyes glow bright yellow as she felt her head. \"Oh no,\" she said. \"The spirits. They're getting to me. I need to keep the ghosts of the mares under control before something awful... urk!\" Echo got on her flabby knees as she was hyperventilating and then begun to chant a spell in gibberish in an attempt to subdue the spirits inside of her. One worker came by and walked up to her as he witnessed the now 20ft tall and 18 ton zebra obviously in distress. \"Ma'am.. or sir,\" he said nervously. \"Are you alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEcho was panting and showed her teeth as she turned and caused the young man to run for it before the zebra woman stood up. \"I'm starving,\" she thought to herself. \"Those evil spirits combined with me much bigger belly. I need nourishment, but what. Yes. Carnivorous horses possess my body. Like the mad mares of Diomedes, I must have meat to break the madness.\" Echo then grabbed her face. \"You dumb zebra! Don't forget, you may be a big fat zebra but you ain't no animal. Just keep in under control and... I can't keep it under control much longer! I must feed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow will Echo beat this hunger she has been cursed with?</span></div></div>",

Jane just chuckled as she began to pack up as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane Malkin was a professor at Donview College. Specifically, she was one of the math professors. As she walked across the campus to her car, she was aware of the stares she got. Some were annoyance, others were attraction. She was both loved and hated by the student body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was loved because many people thought she was hot. Jane was a 6' Russian American, with long red hair in a ponytail and black eyes. She had a naturally curvaceous figure, with E cup breasts, wide hips, and a nice bubble butt. She also spoke with a Russian accent. A common joke was that Jane could make even the boring suits she wore sexy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut at the same time, she was hated for being considered tough. She always made sure to assign a lot of homework to the students, and if anyone didn't finish it, she would double that students amount of homework for next week. And if anyone broke the rules of her class, she'd make them stay after and finish three tough math problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane just smiled as she got in her car. She couldn't wait to get home. Scott was cooking tonight.<br>\r\n---------------------<br>\r\nScott was humming to himself at the stove when he heard his wife walk in. He turned to see Jane taking off her shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hun.\" He said as he walked up to her. She bent down to give him a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt 5'7'', Scott was much shorter then his wife. He had black hair and blue eyes. He was also pretty slim, so at first glance, no one could tell he and Jane were husband and wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey to you. How was work today?\" Jane asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" Scott said. \"I think we have the formula down. And we are 90 percent sure that it is safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott worked at a genetics lab, and lately they had been working on a formula to create human-animal hybrids. Why, no one knew. But Jane, interested in human-animal hybrids, offered to be the first human test subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Jane asked. \"Do you have it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott pulled out a vial with a cork. Inside the vial was a glowing blue liquid. \"When you drink this, it will combine your human DNA with the animal's DNA, in this case that of a siamese cat. But are you sure you want to do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it helps advance science, then yes. Besides, wouldn't you want a catgirl for a wife?\" Jane said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott chuckled and gave Jane the vial. She popped the cork and, without hesitation, drank the contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, when is it supposed to work?\" She asked when she was finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The change should start in a few hours.\" Scott said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.

Who knew?\u201d Scott had prepared grilled salmon for dinner and it would appear that the feline DNA had set in because Jane was chewing away at the fish with her bare hands much like a hungry cat. Scott was impressed. He didn\u2019t expect the feline DNA to take effect so soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, honey,\u201d said Jane. \u201cWhat exactly is this project intended for?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Scott as he sliced a piece of fish for himself. \u201cThey didn\u2019t tell us. It could be anything from super soldiers to a remake of Zoobilee Zoo. Heck, I don\u2019t even know whose crazy idea this project was to begin with.\u201d Jane started to lick her hand, revealing that her teeth had turned into fangs in the process. \u201cUh-huh. Okay. Next question. Why did you choose a Siamese cat? Besides to satisfy your libido that is.\u201d \u201cThe lab is playing it safe for now,\u201d said Scott. \u201cWe\u2019re only using domestic animals for now.\u201d Jane let out a purr as she blinked and her eyes begun to glow. \u201cToo bad. Maybe you\u2019d rather take your chances with big lioness lady.\u201d Jane let out a slight hiss as she held out her hand and playfully waved it at her husband. Scott could only blush right before his wife laughed. \u201cHopefully this will go better than that jerk who tried to create artificial mythical creatures in that cartoon.\u201d \u201cMix and matching is a really bad idea,\u201d said Scott. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to add more DNA than necessary.\u201d Jane at this point had eaten her fish to the bones and was eating the bones as well. \u201cThis is good fish, Scott. Is there any more?\u201d \u201cUh,\u201d said Scott. \u201cI\u2019ll go back to the grill.\u201d As Scott was cooking more fish he was thinking to himself. \u201cGee, she has an appetite tonight. Oh well, maybe it\u2019s just a side effect of the mutagen.\u201d As Scott was preparing seconds,  Jane was tapping at the window, staring at a finch outside. Clearly the effects of the mutagen were starting to take effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner, the Malkins were watching television and on the television, there appeared to be a movie of a giant red European dragon that appeared female based on her breasts. The dragon also had long black hair and appeared to be morbidly obese. As she watched the movie with her husband, Jane appeared to have sprouted a long cream-colored tail with a brown highlight at the end. Her ears had turned into chocolate colored pointed ears just like those of a cat. She also appeared slightly taller as she sat next to her husband on the couch. \u201cThat dragon lady, what was her name?\u201d \u201cThe actress is called Carol Hale. That\u2019s very good makeup and special effects. She almost looks like a real dragon.\u201d Jane then let out a purr as she swung her tail and held onto her husband\u2019s shoulders. \"I better be careful then. Wouldn't want to lose my man to a mutated dragon girl.\" Scott let out a laugh. \"Impossible,\" he said. \"There's no way to get dragon DNA because dragons don't exist. You should know. You're a college professor.\" Jane let out a laugh. \"No I wouldn't. That area isn't my field.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before Scott was waiting for Jane in bed. \"Jane,\" he said. \"I'm ready.\" \"Be right there in a minute, Kletska.\" Cooed the transforming cat woman. Scott looked as Jane walked in and now she had completely turned into a rather tall cream-furred Siamese cat woman with a brown-colored face and a pair of F-cup breasts. Scott looked in absolute delight as this new feline goddess was making her way towards him. Jane turned around and smirked as she shook her now much rounder than usual butt in her husband's face and rubbed his nose with her tail. \"Oh, Jane,\" said Scott. \"I am so hot for you right now.\" Jane then let out a growl and turned around to show Scott her now very sharp claws. \"Spasibo, Darling,\" said the Russian Siamese cat woman. \"You make me purr. Now let's love Russian style.\" Jane pounced on her husband and ravaged him with her claws as he moaned in pleasure. At this point he was used to the rough stuff and he was too catatonic with joy at his wife's transformation. \"The formula was a success,\" said Scott. \"I can't wait to tell the boys in the lab tomorrow. Hope Jane is okay with me leaving early.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, these types of experiments are very dangerous and often unpredictable and very soon, Jane was about to feel the full effects of the transformation. As she was ravaging her husband, the feline amazon's curvaceous appeared to be getting thicker. Her panties appeared to be shrinking on her large cat ass. As both of the Malkins had passed out and were both snoozing away, Jane\u2019s shirt appeared to be coming apart as she continued to purr in her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028The next morning, the alarm clock rung loudly and it annoyed the sleeping cat woman who lowered her ears before she tried to shut off the clock with her foot. However, the kick was strong enough to knock the entire bedside table over. Jane grumbled to herself as she got up and gave a slight hiss. \u201cUgh. I guess cats aren\u2019t morning creatures. Oh, and it looks like Scott left for work early. Oh well.\u201d As the cat girl got out of bed, it cracked in half, not that she noticed it. At this point, the Siamese cat girl was 10ft tall and she was morbidly obese, mostly in the breasts and ass. She had to weigh 4 tons. However, for some reason, she didn\u2019t seem to realize it. First she entered the shower, brushing her teeth at the same time. But when she turned on the water, Jane shrieked in distress and ran out. She shook the water off and hissed. \u201cI hate water.\u201d She mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane decided to have breakfast next. She ate three bananas and four pieces of toast before cooking herself some bacon. As she sat down to eat her second breakfast, she sat her ass down on two chairs. As she was eating, Jane felt her stomach and made a realization. \u201cGeez,\u201d she said. \u201cDid I eat too much fish last night. Oh well.\u201d Jane got up just in time for the chairs to break and put her empty dishes in the sink before she went to her car to drive to take a drive. As she took another step after another, she failed to notice that her shirt and skirt were stretching out because of her growing obesity. Jane drove her car as she was making her way to work. \"I love Saturdays,\" she said to herself. \"Wait until the people down town see what a cat I am. I think I'll freak them out.\" Jane let out a laugh. However, she noticed that for some reason, her car was slowing down. \"What the?\" asked Jane. Jane kept pressing her foot down on the accelerator but she wasn't making the car go any faster than it was already going. The cat lady let out a hiss and checked to see the speedometer read 40MPH and yet the car was moving at a snail's pace. Suddenly, the entire car broke down and the wheels detached and rolled off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane got up and let out a few Russian profanities. But then she heard a slight popping sound and saw that buttons were popping off of her blouse and her boobs, now H-cups popped out. Before she could do anything else, she heard a ripping noise and saw that her stockings had torn apart. Then the Russian amazon turned and noticed that her butt was twice as wide as she was tall and she was twice as tall as her car. The cat girl let out a hiss again but then realized something. \u201cWait a minute,\u201d she said to herself. \u201cScott said that the vial of mutagen was 90% safe. Maybe this is the 10%. Obesity as a side effect? Was I infused with the genes or a Siamese cat or a hippopotamus.\u201d Jane tried to walk away but only wobbled and was swaying from side to side as her ankles and thighs as well as everything above them expanded larger and larger. \"Whoa,\" said the cat girl. \"I am one big kitty cat.\" Jane turned and saw her skirt snapped off and her panties exploded as her red hair extended and she let out a hiss. \"Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane was getting too fat for her feet to hold her up and then she fell down, ass first on top of her car and completely crushed it to a pulp as it honked and beeped. \"Perhaps that was too much bacon.\" Said Jane with a blush. Jane then grunted and struggled to try and stand up, but she wasn't moving. She looked down to see that her thighs were so thick that they made her feet look like pimples. It was there, Jane realized something; she had become so fat that she was completely immobile. She couldn't move on her own. She also noticed that she was 50 feet tall with a 100ft wide belly and 115ft wide ass and a pair of H-Cup breasts and 4 blobbish chins as she hissed. \"This is not good,\" she thought. \"Me, a college professor, I'm so big they could build a college inside of... ouch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane turned to see that somebody had stopped their truck and literally rear-ended her. The driver got out of his car and gasped as he saw the fat feline goddess. Several more people had gathered around. \"Oh my gosh! Is that a Siamese cat?\" \"That's the biggest cat I've ever seen. She makes Garfield look anorexic.\" \"What an ass.\" \"Get back. She might be hungry.\" One smart ass took out a laser pointer and Jane turned her head and tried to reach around her ass to try and touch the red dot right before she groaned. \"Well,\" she said. \"This is a situation that I never thought I'd be in.\" Jane then reached between her rolls and bit her lip right before she pulled out her cell phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Siamese cat giantess squinted before she pressed the buttons with her claws to call....</span></div></div>",

She recognized them as Channel 12 News copters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, hell.\" Jane simply said.<br>\r\n----------------------<br>\r\nMeanwhile, at Temik Genetics Lab, Scott was pouring over some note when one of his co-workers burst into his station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scott, you've got to see the news! Channel 12!\" The co-worker said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised, Scott turned on the nearby TV and went to Channel 12. He was immediatly greeted by an image of a giant, obese Siamese cat woman. His eyes went wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jane!?\" He yelled. He listened to the channel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Traffic was brought to a halt today by the unexpected appearence of a 50 foot, obese woman resembling a Siamese cat. The cat woman, who showed speaking abilities, has identified herself as Jane Malkin, a Donview College professor and the wife of Scott Malkin, a worker at Temik Genetics. This proves that the human-animal hybrid formula they have been working on and keeping Channel 12 up-to-date with works. This, while odd, is a great step in science, as it shows-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott shut off the TV. He was surprised. He knew it would work, but wasn't expecting this kind of side effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scott!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott turned at the voice and saw his boss and the head of the lab, Mark Temik. Mark was in his mid-80's, but was surpisingly fit and healthy for someone his age. He was beaming with joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scott! You saw the news! The formula works!\" Mark bellowed happily. \"You're wife looked amazing! It's great she volunteered!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but did you see her?\" Scott replied. \"She's 50 feet tall and morbidly obese. We need to go and help her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark nodded. \"I agree. We need to go and see the effects up close and personal. And the person who paid for this formula is on their way.\" On that, Mark left Scott's station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott sighed. \"I hope Jane won't be too mad.\"<br>\r\n---------------------<br>\r\nAbout an hour later, Scott's car pulled up in front of his gargantuan wife. He and Mark stepped out. In front of Jane was Calvin Tonner in his tow truck. Calvin saw Scott and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Scott. Wasn't expecting this today. Can't believe that formula acutally worked!\" Calvin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was only supposed to make her a human-animal hybird. Not make her a 50 foot blob!\" Scott yelled. Just then, a Channel 12 copter landed near him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scott Malkin?\" The pilot yelled. Scott nodded. \"You're wife wants to talk to you. I'll take you up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott ran over and got on the copter, which flew up near Jane's face. It then landed on one of Jane's chins and dropped Scott off before flying off. Scott faced his massive wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, hi Jane. You're not mad, are you?\" Scott said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm 50 feet tall, and I'm so fat I can't move, but belive it or not, this actually feels great. I was surprised at first, but now I feel so soft. So no, I'm not mad.\" Jane said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a relief.\" Scott said.

Everyone on the ground got out of the way as the feline giantess was expanding. Calvin tried desperately to pull on Jane in his tow truck but the cat was too heavy and she was still getting heavier. The tow cable on the truck snapped off and the truck itself drove 10 feet ahead before it broke down. \"Whoa!\" As Jane was expanding, the helicopter pilot panicked and took off, leaving Scott to hold onto his mountainous wife to avoid falling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn less than a minute, Jane was now 100ft tall with a 250ft wide stomach and 275ft wide butt. She gave a hiss as she wiggled her now obsolete feet and her long tail. \"Well,\" said the Russian cat giantess. \"This will definitely take some getting used to.\" A news copter flew up into the air overhead to film Jane's growth spurt. \"It would seem that the mutagen used on Professor Malkin's DNA still has some troubleshooting. The thunderous feline has now expanded to twice her size and has gotten larger than ever. She is a veritable mountain. I'd say it will take more than just a really powerful tow truck to get this cat back on her feet.\" As the news helicopter flew in the air, Jane's instincts took over and she tried to swat at it like a cat would a toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she let out a sigh and a purr as she looked down at Scott. \"Well,\" she said. \"Looks like you're going to have to get used to having a mountain for a wife. Scott climbed up and then scratched Jane's ear as the fleshy feline purred happily. Then Scott took out his phone to call Mark. \"Hello, Mr. Temik. Something happened with the mutagen. Jane just got even bigger. Is that supposed to happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark tapped his chin before he spoke on the other end of the phone. \"To be perfectly honest I'm not sure. I know that the previous results pleased the client but I'm going to have to talk with them to determine what they intended the formula for. I'd recommend you keep a close eye on your wife for any more side-effects. But it doesn't seem like any harm is going to come to her anytime soon. Just be careful with her. I've already called a construction company to move your wife out of the way of traffic.\" Jane gave a look of confusion. \"Construction company?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane then grunted because something was pushing against her titanic ass. That something was several bulldozers that were pushed to their limit removing Jane from the road. The cat giantess gave a growl as the dozers pushed against her ass. One of the men driving the bulldozers was dumbfounded and reached out to poke Jane in her fleshy booty. \"How am I going to explain to my wife that I spent the day moving a cat.\" The driver next to him shrugged his shoulders. \"Stranger things have happened. Believe me, I'm just as uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane was placed near the Malkin residence and saw that she was much larger than the house. In fact, she could wear their house as a crown at her current size. Scott had to massage Jane's large ass as Jane gave a purr. \"Thanks for the massage, Honey,\" said Jane. \"Those bulldozers were starting to give me a wedgie. Not that any clothes will fit me today.\" Scott kept massaging the cat flesh right before Jane's tail wagged in his face and he had to push it back as he continued to rub his Siamese cat wife's butt. \"You better get used to the bulldozers, Jane. You're going to need them to get to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane then gave a somewhat evilly laugh. \"Wait until my class sees me now. Oh, damn. I'm gonna have to use my belly as a blackboard. Scott then climbed up Jane's red hair and then slid onto his wife's big brown nose. Jane gave a purr and then licked her husband as he groaned. \"That sandpaper tongue is going to take some getting used to. But we can make it work. Once again I'm...\" \"Don't be sorry, Scott. I like being like this. Jane let out a yawn and then placed her husband in her large cleavage. Scott let out grunt but settled between the big fleshy and furry orbs. \"Dobroy nochi, Scott.\" Scott gave a sigh. \"Good night Jane.\" With that both Jane and Scott fell asleep, though Scott had some trouble with his Siamese cat wife's tremendous snoring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day...</span></div></div>",

The second candidate was a 6\u2019 tall tan-skinned blonde woman with a spot-shaped birthmark on her neck. \u201cPeople of Wellhaven,\u201d said the young woman. \u201cFor too long, this town has been in chaos.\u201d The female candidate walked down a street that was missing pieces of the road and tapped her foot. \u201cFor one, the roads have been taken apart and put back together dozens of times. How much development do we need? We wouldn\u2019t have to keep repairing the road if there was such a cheap budget. To say nothing of the streets littered beyond recognition.\u201d The woman walked up to a garbageman who was driving a broken down garbage truck down the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me, sir,\u201d said the woman. \u201cHow long have you been picking up garbage just today.\u201d The garbageman gave a scoff. \u201cAre you kidding. I\u2019ve been at the for three hours and I\u2019m still not halfway done. The truck had a malfunction on the way and I had to call a mechanic to replace the engine. I told Mayor Blake that these old gal can\u2019t take anymore.\u201d \u201cAnd how long have you been waiting for a replacement garbage truck.\u201d \u201cSix months! I know that the town can afford it, but what the heck!?\u201d \u201cThank you, Sir. It is clear that the current mayor has been misusing Wellhaven\u2019s funds. And speaking of which...\u201d The woman in the video showed a photograph of a strange man in gladiator armor with a minotaur\u2019s skull on his shoulder handing a suitcase to the mayor. \u201cMayor Blake was recently spotted accepting a payoff to allow an unknown shopkeeper to set up shop in the area. Several items in this shop include unknown chemicals and weapons that are outlawed in this state. Yet our current mayor is endangering our safety by allowing such dangerous merchandise into Wellhaven. Who knows what will become of Wellhaven if such corruption still stands. I am Candidate Patsy Nelson and I approve this message.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake turned off the television and gave a glare. \u201cWho does that woman think she is? I\u2019ll teach her to run a smear campaign against me. She can\u2019t prove nothing. Besides, the payoff wasn\u2019t that big. I\u2019ve got to get her out of the race somehow.\u201d Blake\u2019s assistant adjusted his glasses. \u201cIt really doesn\u2019t help that her campaign manager is also her husband.\u201d \u201cBig deal, Pericles,\u201d said Blake. \u201cMarriage is overrated anyway. It only limits your options. What I need is to fight back, find a way to fight fire with fire. I need some dirt on that woman.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said Pericles. \u201cThere is one thing we\u2019ve found out about Patsy Nelson.\u201d Blake turned his head to face his assistant and smirked. \u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d Pericles handed his boss a file. \u201cWell. Mrs. Nelson always goes to bed right before the sun goes down. Apparently, there\u2019s a superstition in her family that causes them to fear the moon. Her mother instructed her to never look up at the full moon.\u201d Blake gave a smirk. \u201cInteresting. Nobody will vote for somebody afraid of something as ridiculous as the moon. I need to draw her out and expose her fear to the world. I\u2019ve got it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long before Blake had sent a message to his opponent. \u201cHe wants me to what?!\u201d yelled Patsy. Patsy\u2019s husband Sam cleared his throat before speaking again. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly as it sounds, Patsy. You have been called to speak at the Wellhaven Inn about your plans for the future of our town and it\u2019s scheduled at 7:00.\u201d \u201cKind of early for a speech, isn\u2019t it, Sam?\u201d \u201cNot 7:00 a.m. 7:00 p.m. At night.\u201d Patsy gave a look of concern. \u201cBeneath the moon?\u201d Sam let out a groan. \u201cYou\u2019re not a little kid, Patsy. For crying out loud, it\u2019s only the moon.\u201d \u201cBut my mother always told me that I was never to look at the moon. She said that the moment someone in our family looks at the moon, there\u2019s no going back.\u201d Sam let out a laugh. \u201cNo going back from what?\u201d \u201cWell, she didn\u2019t say.\u201d \u201cUh-huh. Listen. I think this is Roger Blake\u2019s way of trying to make you look like a coward in front of the voters. You\u2019re not gonna let him scare you.\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d yelled Patsy. \u201cNo way! There\u2019s no way it\u2019s going to end like that. This city has suffered enough at the hands of Roger Blake\u2019s incompetence and corruption. I\u2019m going.\u201d Sam gave a smile. \u201cThat\u2019s my girl.\u201d With that, the Nelsons kissed and were on their way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the inn, the people of Wellhaven took their seats to listen to Patsy\u2019s speech. The entire ceiling above was a glass dome that let the moonlight come in. In the back was Roger Blake and Pericles. \u201cAfter tonight,\u201d said Blake with an evil smirk on his face. \u201cIt will be clear that I\u2019m all set for another term. I\u2019ll bet that Nelson will be too scared of the moon to come out. That\u2019s what a skirt gets for running for mayor in my town.\u201d Up on the stage, Sam was fixing Patsy\u2019s tie. The presence of his wife\u2019s opponent in the polls did not go unnoticed. \u201cLook at that creep.\u201d Said Sam. Patsy then looked out at the ceiling and then turned her head. \u201cLook at that moon.\u201d \u201cCome on, Patsy,\u201d said Sam. \u201cIt\u2019s just your mother\u2019s superstition talking. The moon can\u2019t harm you. You just go out there and give your speech and answer any questions the voters might have.\u201d Patsy nodded her head. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she said with a smirk. \u201cLet\u2019s let Blake try to intimidate me. I\u2019m going out.\u201d Sam smiled because he was sure that his wife had nothing to worry about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Patsy walked up to the podium, she felt the moonlight on top of her and at first flinched but then she shrugged her shoulders. \u201cHuh,\u201d she said. \u201cLooks like Mom was worried about nothing.\u201d That\u2019s what Patsy thought but she failed to notice her breasts and butt were expanding. Her butt in fact was growing so fast as she was shuffling her notes to prepare her speech, that her tore off the back of her skirt and then sprouted a long furry tail as yellow fur grew on the exposed skin with black spots. Patsy also didn\u2019t notice that her eyes had turned into those of a feline and she was still growing.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cJacob! Where are my shoes!? I always keep them in one place!\u201d Jacob let out a sigh as he shook his head. \u201cI put then on the dining room table, Aunt Sunny,\u201d the 10-year old said to his aunt. \u201cI accidentally spilt a soda and didn\u2019t want them to get wet.\u201d \u201cYou put shoes on the table!? Are you insane!\u201d Sunny ran downstairs and grabbed the shoes as Jacob put some bread in the toaster to make a sandwich. Jacob was staying with his aunt for the summer and he wasn\u2019t enjoying himself. Aunt Sunny was always stressed out and right now she was stressed out over her date with her boyfriend Mike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunny took out a notepad and Jacob turned his head to face her. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt\u2019s the schedule for my date with Mike. The movie starts at exactly 2:00 and runs for 120 minutes. Based on experience, 6 of those minutes are the credits, which means that we leave for dinner at 3:54, arrive at 4:03 and then leave at 4:55.\u201d \u201cWait,\u201d said Jacob. \u201cYou planned an entire date? That\u2019s no fun.\u201d \u201cThis is efficient, Jacob! I know what I\u2019m doing. Without a plan, everything falls into chaos.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob let out a sigh. It was always like this. He knew that his Aunt Sunny and that Mike were a bad match for each other. Sunny was very controlling and had a serious case of O.C.D. Everything had to be done a certain way and everything had to be planned out. A sharp contrast to Mike who was more laid back. Even a child like Jacob could see that those two were bad for each other and wished that they could get along well. \u201cAunt Sunny,\u201d said Jacob. \u201cWhat difference does it make when you leave the movie. There might be a stinger.\u201d Sunny gave a scoff. \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d she asked. \u201cWho cares about the stinger? If I stick around to read the end of the credits, I\u2019d be wasting previous time and I\u2019d fall behind schedule! Do you understand?!\u201d Jacob let out a groan. \u201cI understand perfectly well, Aunt Sunny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028What neither Sunny nor Jacob knew was that nearby, there was a grungy-looking mad in a metal mask and green rags walking around. \u201cErlking is hungry. I haven\u2019t eaten in days. This traveling from town to town with every wish I grant is killing me. I hope I find something to eat soon.\u201d At that moment, there was the sound of a toaster going off and Sunny let out a scream. \u201cJacob! What have you done!? This toast is burnt. Don\u2019t tell me that you plan on eating it.\u201d Sunny took the toast and threw it out the door. \u201cAunt Sunny,\u201d said Jacob. \u201cYou\u2019re overreacting. It was still edible.\u201d \u201cIt was slightly burnt!\u201d Outside, Erlking picked up the toast and bit into it. \u201cThis is good toast,\u201d said Erlking. \u201cWhat is that woman thinking?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunny then rushed to the sink to wash her hands and then yelled. \u201cLook what you\u2019ve done, Jacob! Now I\u2019ve got crumbs on my dress.\u201d \u201cThen wipe them off!\u201d Sunny didn\u2019t pay attention to her nephew and just ran upstairs. Erlking looked in and shook his head. \u201cGood grief,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is up with that woman. She\u2019s insane.\u201d At that moment there was a knock at the door. Jacob went to answer it and saw Sunny\u2019s boyfriend, Mike, in a pair of Bermuda shirts and a tanktop. \u201cHey, Jacob. What\u2019s shaking. Where\u2019s that aunt of yours?\u201d Jacob let out a groan. \u201cHi, Mike. Aunt Sunny is upstairs getting changed.\u201d Mike let out a sigh. \u201cThat\u2019s nothing new.\u201d Sunny came downstairs in a black cocktail dress and saw Mike\u2019s outfit and was absolutely horrified. \u201cYou\u2019re wearing THAT to the movie!\u201d \u201cI was about to ask the same about you, Baby,\u201d said Mike with a scoff. \u201cAren\u2019t you overdressed for the occasion?\u201d Sunny let out a groan and then checked her watch. \u201cAugh! We\u2019ve got no time to change! Come on, Mike. The movie starts in thirty minutes.\u201d \u201cSo?\u201d Sunny grabbed Mike by the hand and pulled him away as Jacob rolled his eyes. Mike was moaning as his girlfriend pulled him away. \u201cCareful,\u201d said Mike. \u201cCareful, Sunny! I only have two of those!\u201d \u201cRemember, Jacob,\u201d said Aunt Sunny. \u201cDinner at 5, bed at 9.\u201d With that, Sunny shut the door. \u201cLet\u2019s go, Mike! Time\u2019s a wasting!\u201d Jacob couldn\u2019t help but shake his head as he saw his aunt dragging her date away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish that Aunt Sunny was more colorful and fun for Mike to be around.\u201d Said Jacob. What Jacob didn\u2019t know was that outside, Erlking was digging through the trash when he heard the young speaking. He rubbed his chin. \u201cColorful?\u201d he asked. \u201cI can do that. 1, 2, spell me do..\u201d Unfortunately, Erlking completely misunderstood the wish and as he cast his spell, something came over Sunny. She felt her forehead as she groaned. \u201cAre you feeling alright, Sunny?\u201d asked Mike. Sunny took out her contact lenses and put on a pair of glasses. \u201cI\u2019m fine. These lenses are irritating me. That\u2019s all.\u201d A fly then landed on Sunny\u2019s cheek right before she actually flicked her tongue out to catch it and ate it. Mike gasped in disgust. \u201cWhat?!\u201d yelled Sunny. \u201cNothing.\u201d Said Mike. Sunny just shook her head and then walked ahead, not realizing that her butt was getting bigger and parts of her body were changing colors.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Matthew was bored out of his mind sitting on a beach near the perfume store in the middle of the mall. His wife dragged him here to 'help' her with shopping. Right now she told him to wait outside while she 'browsed' the store. She always does this every time he gets his pay check for the month. Surround by multitude of bags he slump down with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there deary, care for your fortune told?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew sprung up and looked around to find a old lady looking at him by a cart several feet from him. He could have sworn that it was not there before. He then pointed to himself and the lady nodded yes. Looking back at the store he slowly got up and walked to the cart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was not much was on this old wood looking cart. There was a small velvet cloth draping over both sides of it and a few stands with several necklaces drape over them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sonny, I saw you all sad over there and thought that might want a reading,\" the old lady answered with a big smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked back at the store and began to rub the back of my head, \"I don't know.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it will be fine. She won't come out for another half an hour.\" she said confidently <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI began to think of my wife and how she'll go crazy if I spend any money for myself. But something inside me that for once in my life I should do something for my self. I turned back to the lady and said yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good my boy,\" she said excitedly as she took out a old deck of cards. She shuffled them and took out several cards from random parts of the deck placing them on the cloth. She then reviled them one by one as she began to say something under her breath. She had this worry look when she eventually turned to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My deary you have a very sad life, from birth to adult you have been controlled by your mother, sister and now your wife. You never got anything that you liked even for your birthday. They prevented you from having any friends or a life outside of them. When you became an adult your mother immediately married you to a wealthy woman that you hate. You work at a small company where you are push around by all your female coworkers. You are prevented from your wife to pursuing your interests of books and games by taking everything you make from your measly paycheck. You life is devoid of joy and happiness as you think about the day when it will all end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was both stun and sadden by the accuracy of her reading, but before I could say anything the old lady spoke up as she flipped the last card. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I for see change in your future, great big change, and finally happiness.\" She then paused for a moment as she again said something under her breath before looking back at me, \"you poor young man, no person should live a life like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea,\" I already accepted my fate a wile ago, \"anyway how much I owe you,\" I asked as I pulled out my wallet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For you, one dollar,\" she said her smile returning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was a bit surprised considering that a sign that said ten for card reading. After giving her the dollar I looked back at my wallet seeing only a five left. But just before I close my wallet the old lady spoke again, \"since you have been a good boy for listening to this old woman tell you what you already now I would like to give you this necklace for only five dollars.\" She then took a black sting necklace with a small green butterfly pendant off one of her stands and presented it to me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hesitate for a wile as words from my mother and wife telling me I shouldn't but deep down in my core something told me that I should get it regardless of what they say. In the end I followed that gut feeling and slowly took out my money still feeling a resistance as I gave her the money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good my deary,\" her smile getting bigger handing the necklace to me, \"now remembered, this for you to wear and don't be afraid. The things to come is all for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI became puzzled by her statement but before I could think about it further I heard my wife. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matthew?! What are you doing near that old hag?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly put the necklace in to my pocket as I turned to face her, \"nothing dear. She was just asking me when the mall closes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though we have been married for a couple of years she already looked older by several years no thanks to her plastic surgery on about every inch of her body. Her breast was large but clearly fake including her rear. She was warring a white miniskirt with a golden tube top so she can show off her assets. With dyed blonde hair and more jewelry then you can count she was the definition of a spoiled rich girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you're stupid for letting the bags go unintended, someone could have stolen something! Now get back here and grab the bags, we're off to the next store!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked back to the bench where the bags are grabbing them all and followed her. I looked back to where the old lady was but to my shock she was gone. </span></div></div>",

It was given as a wedding gift but it's hard to enjoy it when I feel depressed just by looking at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe already finished dinner in silence then off to our beds. Of course we never slept in the same room which was a blessing in disguise. My room didn't have much to offer but it was mine. I had a small computer where I did my work that I brought home sometime with the occasional game here and there. I also had a small bookshelf with a dozen books that I've read several times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat the corner of my bed as I was reviewing today's events, especially what the old lady said to me. I put my hand into my pocket to see that the necklace was indeed there and wasn't imagining things. I took it out and examined it. It was a simple necklace with a simple green crystal carving of a butterfly as the pendant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I looked over it there was this strange feeling in me telling me to put it on. I put it on the small dresser near my bed and went to the bathroom to get ready for bed. Even in the shower I could feel an urge to put it on like it was calling to me. When I came out I was half expecting it to disappear but there it was still on the dresser. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked upon it for a few moments thinking about what to do with it. I was never very good at making decisions due to how I was raised. I sat down on the bed once more grabbing it thinking what am I got to loss and putting it on. I could have sworn it glowed for a moment but when I looked at it it looked perfectly normal, although I did feel a bit more confident then normal. I then looked at the clock as it was getting late so I turn off my stand light and went to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Sawyer (the wife) was taking off her makeup in the bathroom. She always loved the high life and would do any to keep it. The marriage was purely economic, merge both family's assets together making them more rich then being alone. Although it's been two years since the wedding, to her Matthew was nothing more than a extra servant but better, she gets money from him, with thanks to his more timid nature it was easy to control him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWearing a pink nightgown she walked to her bed when suddenly there was a small pain coming from her stomach. She recognized it as hungry pains which she was quite acquainted with it. Ignoring it she got into her bed, but the pain continued to grow. She tossed and turned trying to sleep but her stomach continuity growled. \"Your on a diet so shut up,\" she yelled pounding her stomach but her hunger pains grew in protest. It grew so much that she jumped out bed running to the kitchen, \"damn you, I got to eat something!\" </span></div></div>",

Funny enough I favor it a little bit more then staying home with my wife, even though I have to deal with hardship there too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slow got out of bed getting ready to go down for breakfast. I purposely moved slowly as to be for of a hurry when leaving so I could spend less time at breakfast as possible but that did not matter that much for Sawyer felt the same. As I got my clothes ready I realized I still had that necklace around me, forgetting to take it off last night. I looked at it for a movement before deciding to leave it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing putting on my work clothes I slowly walked down the stairs to the dining room. As I approached the room I began to smell many different kinds of food like pancakes and sausages. I question this because Sawyer always ban anything that is above the fruits and vegetables on the pyramid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI froze when I walked in to see several plates of food across the table, with Sawyer eating a small pile of food. I began to stare as I began to see something was off about her but I could not put my finger on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you starting at?!\" Sawyer barked with food in her mouth snapping me out of my trance. \"Nothing dear,\" I walking to the table grabbing a empty plate. Soon I sat on the opposite side of her looking down at my food. I had put one pancake with some eggs and sausages. It's been years since I have eaten anything like this. Most of the time I ate something more like toast or something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we ate a few questions began to swirl around my head as I occasionally looked at Sawyer eating like she hasn't eaten in days. Normally I would hold my tongue but right now I had a strong urge to say something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sawyer dear, what's s with all the food?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! Can't I have a cheat day?\" She ate without looking up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But this much for breakfast?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea! I was hungry!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was getting nowhere and it was getting late anyway. Finishing my food I got up and walked by Sawyer. That's when I got a better look at her. She looked 'better', more natural, as if she had reverse plastic surgery. She also looked bigger and not just fuller but also taller too, I think. But that can't be right, you don't just grow overnight like that. But before I could continue this thought I looked up to the clock telling me I was going to be late so I push the thought back leaving her to go to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matthew, I'm going to the mall later! Don't wait up for me!\" Yelled Sawyer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI froze in place, \"she never tells me where she goes when I'm at work,\" I thought feeling bewildered. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was hard to concentrate on driving as my thoughts was focused on my wife. Her actions confused me and for a moment I had a tinge of worry for her. Then a idea crept up from the depth of my mind, could it be something related to my necklace. I touched the pendant as I lingered on the thought. \"I'm just imagining things, it can't be real,\" I thought as I drove into my work parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked into the one-story building where I worked for a small data-storage company with only 5 employees, and as soon as I walked in I knew I was in trouble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MATTHEW GET IN HERE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI signed knowing this would happen. I heard snickers from behind cubicles as I walked to my boss's door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Ms. Bahl?\" I entered into her office. The office was dimly lit with very few decorations scattered about the room, and what decoration was there was very organized and clean. At the back of the office Ms. Bahl sat behind a large desk looking at me sternly. She was a slim Indian woman wearing a black suit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your two minutes late Matthew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Ms. Bahl I was...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't give me your excuse. I expect you to be on time and to make sure you do I would have to deduct pay for today for this. Now get to work!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly left her room rushing to my desk. Today was not starting in a good way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Matthew, I needed you to come here for a moment.\" An employee called from across the room. I knew this routine all to well. Groaning I slow got up to see the one calling me, Filicia, a black hair thin as a rail woman was standing by the water cooler facing away from me. I walked out of my cubicle toward her. As I approached her I walked pass another cubicle when suddenly a foot jetted out causing me to trip. As I stumbled I fell close to Filicia's butt when she released a large fart into my face. I fell into my hands gagging as the room was filled with laughter from the 3 employees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sorry there Matthew. I must have eaten something for breakfast.\" That was Filicia the prankster. She always pulls pranks one me at the pleasure of the others. Filicia walked pass me laughing going back to her desk. I got up coughing as I turned around to see the woman who tripped me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't look at me like that, you should watch where you walk,\" she giggled while working on her computer. Rebecca was the oldest of the workers among us, like somewhere in her forties. She was a mother until she got an divorce and the husband getting custody of the children a year ago. That was about the time she became mean toured me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked back to my desk hoping this nightmare would end, but before I could get there the last of the employees came up to me. Sylvia was the smartest of all the workers and handled more of the technical problems. She could have been a great employee if it wasn't so lazy. She looked at me through her large round glasses with a evil grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Matthew.\" The sound of giggles from the other employees  grew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey Sylvia,\" I stuttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to ask you to do a favor for me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" I knew I shouldn't have said that knowing what's to come. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got a little bit behind my work and need you to help me finish it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before I could say anything she cut me off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks I'll bring you it.\" she quickly said as she dash off to her desk. Just as I sat on my desk sighing with frustration Sylvia came back with a stack of papers placing them on my desk. \"They better be done by the end of the day.\" She left me alone with the papers questioning myself why I let myself get push around like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery day was like this with no way to escape. I looked at the pile of papers as a saddess grew in me but I push those feelings down like every other day and got to work. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was an tiring morning but lunch was here and I could finally take a break. As soon as I got out my homemade sandwich my boss called for me. Groaning, I put down my sandwich and went to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Ms. Bahl?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need you to go on a errand for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't it wait till after lunch?\" I knew I was pressing my luck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, besides this is a lunch errand. I need you to get some food for me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had never asked me to fetch food for her. She always brings her own. Then I looked at her desk to see crumpled paper and napkins. This only confused me more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you standing there for?\" she snapped me out of my confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never told me what to get?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry.\" She then grabbed a piece of paper and started writing something on it. After a few moments she handed it to me. I read it in disbelief, it was filled with many different kinds of food from multiple fast food places. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure about all of this?\" hoping this was a mistake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you questioning me!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No ma'am, I'll be right on it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then handed me a wad of cash and I left the room. This was getting bazaar I thought as I started to head out of the office. That's when I was interrupted by Rebecca. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Matthew.\" she calling out standing up from her cubicle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Rebecca?\" turning to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You going out to eat?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um no just picking up some food for Ms. Bahl.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, then you can pick up some food for us too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then went down into her cubicle to just come right back up holding a paper with money clip to it handing it to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything is on here, thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh I grabbed it and left the building. Now in my car I looked at my coworkers order. I was dumbfounded seeing the size of the order. \"What is wrong with everyone today?\" I thought. If this was some kind of prank then why would they give me their money. But in the end I knew that if I didn't get what's they ordered I'll be in trouble so, especially with my boss, I started my car and drove off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat down at my desk sighing in relief. I spent all my lunch hour and beyond hauling food into the office making sure it went to the right person. The office was now flooded with the sound of eating and the smell of greasy food. Sighing, I picked up my sandwich as I got back to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end I got very little done today with the bizarre sequences of events. Not even an hour after getting my coworkers there food they all came back to me asking me to go out again for more. Ever since then all I did was go out for food. Every time I came back to deliver there order they already finished the previous order and ordered again. I was only able to end this cycle when it was time to go home and even then it was difficult to leave as they begged me to get them more. Thankfully I was heading back home with a car smelling like food and a head full of questions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a day like this I was glad to be back home. I walked in heading straight to his room up the stairs to rest and gather my thoughts, but just as I got up a couple of steps I was interrupted by Sawyer walk out of the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Matthew, come over here.\" she said sternly but with a strange amount of softness. I turn around to face her but upon doing so I almost fell off the stairs in surprise. The first thing I saw was she was noticeably fatter. Both her breast and butt was twice as big as yesterday with a small potbelly in between them. Her legs and thighs was thicker to accommodate her larger rear as she wore tight and reveling clothes. Secondly I was standing three or four steps above the ground floor but we was looking at each other eye to eye. Although that means that from 5' 6\" she is now 6' 6\", growing a foot at least. I could see that she face looked much more softer as she now looked as if she never had plastic surgery in her life. I almost couldn't recognize her, although she does look a lot better than before. I was dumbfounded and speechless, was this some kind of crazy dream or something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Earth to Matthew. Hey I'm taking here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Um yea. What do you want dear?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here.\" she extended her arm out looking away from me shyly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked down to see she had a book out. I took it out of her hand to see it was a fantasy novel. I'm shocked, I'm truly am, never in our entirely of being wed have I ever received a gift from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do you get this?\" I said quietly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was on a rack outside of this book store near this clothe store I was leaving. I had some pocket money and you know how much I hate have loose bills on me.  Also I don't know what you liked or even if you read so I chose the cheapest one there.\" she then turned around and walked back into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just stood there frozen in place. I stared at the book for what felt like eternity before I looked away from it and looked at doorway to the kitchen. From here I could hear the sound of eating. If this is some kind of weird dream then I'm starting to like it. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This morning was the same as yesterday with only being that there was more food on the dining table. Sawyer ate without mercy grabbing everything within reach and stuffing into her mouth. Today so looked like she was taller than yesterday and looked like she weighed over 300 if she was her original height. I could hear her chair groan under her now immense weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just sat there across from her staring at her dumbfounded. I just could not process what I was looking at, but the thing that confused me more than anything else was that nobody else saw this was strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis morning I talked to the our chef and some of the servants about this and they said that they didn't see anything wrong. Oh don't get me wrong, they did see that she got taller and fatter but they didn't see it as strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI barely ate being to distracted by my fattening wife, and it took me a while for me to pry myself from her to leave for work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoughts of my wife lingered as I drove. I thought about how and why this was happening and what this had to do with the necklace from the old lady. I really need to get back to the mall and find that old lady to get an explanation for all of this. Although I was frighten for Sawyer for the first time ever but I was starting to get aroused by these current events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rushed to the the building knowing I was in big trouble. I was ten minutes late for watching my wife's eating for so long. But as I entered my work I stopped as I was hit by the smell of greasy food and sugar snacks. I stood at awe seeing my coworkers stuff their faces with food. All around them was crumble up rappers and bags littered there desk. They all looked physically bigger like my wife as they all was hunched over there desks eating whatever they had on them. There clothes was now too small for there bulk as I could see tares down one of my coworkers back and ripped sleeve on the rest of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MATTHEW GET IN HERE!\" My boss yelled snapping me back to my senses and rushed into her office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly entered the room to the same in her office as the rest of the workplace. Usually a tidy room is now was covered by trash. Her desk was covered in crumpled bags and greasy papers. On one side of the deck they were a stack of pizza boxes as tall as her desk while on the other side was a trash bin overflowing with more trash. She didn't notice me as she devour the largest burger I ever seen. It looked like it had three large patties with a mountain of bacon in between them with cheese. Ms. Bahl was massive looking like she grew a couple of feet and gain hundreds of pounds but looked like she weighed over 250 if she was her original height. Her clothes was much like the rest of them; a suit that looked like it was made for a woman much smaller than her with buttons that was about to pop right out and her seams about to rip apart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yes Ms. Bahl?\" She quickly looked up at me but continued eating her food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matthew, finally your here! It took you long enough,\" she began as she ripped a few more bites off the burger, \"I got a few errands for you to do and if you complete it within the hour there will be a nice bonus in your next paycheck.\" She said still eating as she grabbed a thick envelope from under the trash and handed it to me. I grabbed it noticing it was covered with grease stains. She then immediately returned to her burger devouring it. As I left I could have sworn that I heard her growl but I was too dumbfounded to question it all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I walked out of the building I opened the envelope to see a ton of cash with a piece of paper. Reading the paper it was a list of orders from my boss and coworkers. Luckily this time around it was more streamline than yesterday's one was. Now it was more simple orders but a ton of it. It ranged from supreme pizzas, fried chicken, burgers and fries, sodas, and all sorts of snacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got into my car sat there now having a moment to think. \"First my wife, then my boss and coworkers too. What's going on here? And why can't anyone see what's going on is abnormal?\" I thought as I sat there looking at the driver's wheel. But I more I thought about it I began to remember what that old lady said to about great change coming. Was this what she was talking about? Putting my thoughts to the side as I away do I turned on my car and drove off to fulfill my coworkers orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI plopped down onto the couch in my house trying to relax from today's blur of fetching for food. I just want to forget everything that was happening over the last few days and rest. Closing my eyes I laid back sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, move over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI really didn't want to deal with this right now. I groan internally as I moved to the edge of the couch. Suddenly the whole couch shook with the sound of tearing clothes and wood crunching as I was almost launched from my seat. I quickly turned to Sawyer but instead of seeing her face I got an eyeful of her mammoth breast. If enormous was a word I used to describe her before she was gigantic now. I scanned her from top to bottom to get a assessment of her body. As she sat she was over a foot taller than me with her legs stretched out far from the couch. I estimate she was over nine feet tall if not more. Her face hasn't changed much, still retraining some her slenderness, if not rounded out, but after that it was a whole different story. Her breast was almost three times bigger than her head but given her size it was much bigger if it was on a normal person. Her shoulders and arms was much thicker, giving her more of a broad shoulder look. The light blue blouse she was wearing was on its last leg being overly stretched while I can see her overly tight bra between the rips. Her smallest feature was funny enough was her large potbelly, although it was still bigger than my head. On top of it sat a large salad bowl filled with small pieces of candy, chips, and pretzels, probably her creation. Her flaring hips was almost touching me as she filled out the rest of the couch made for three. I couldn't see her butt but I could tell it must have been enormous because she looked like she was sitting normally as her butt sank deep in to the couch. Her legs and thighs was massive looking more like thick tree logs then legs. She wore an extremely torn pair of jeans, probably made that way because of her size than being fashion, that more looked like it was painted on than clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbed the remote, looking comically small in her hands, she turned on the TV and put on a movie streams program. I always hated her movie choices and usually leave but I was to awestruck by her body to do anything as she scrolled down the list of movies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seen it, boring, boring, seen it, not interested, boring.\" She stated as she scrolled. She eventually stopped at a movie and stared at it. I was too preoccupied at looking at her to see what she was looking at. After a few moments of staring at the screen she started the movie and laid back making the couch groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the movie started it caught my attention by its familiar intro. I turned to the screen and was shocked to see the movie she selected, Star Track: the First Movie. There is no way she chose this movie, she hates sci-fi. \"What's going on?!\" I thought as I began to panic a bit. But before I could have another thought Sawyer puts her immense arm around me pulling me closer to her as she munched away at her \"snack\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I lay there pressed upon her breast I began to calm down. I didn't know why but something about laying next to her fat relaxed me. I wanted to question all of this but at this moment I couldn't. My worries started to melt away as I watched the movie resting on my wife. </span></div></div>",

I don't remember much after the movie ended but I must have fallen asleep on the couch and over slept. Throughout the morning as I got ready to leave I didn't see Sawyer except for hearing her eat at the dining table. I had to skip breakfast just so I wouldn't be that late. I didn't even have time to say goodbye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI panicked all the way to work. This is going to be the most late I have ever been and knowing my boss this could get me fired. Then I'll get an earful from Sawyer that I got fired. This is going to be a bad day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was twenty minutes late when I entered the office. Same as yesterday the place smelled of food and the sound of eating. I just hope that with all of this eating she might not notice me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MATTHEW!\" Ms. Bahl roared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm dead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as I was about to move I heard loud thumps coming from her office. I stood in fear as her door burst open. I watched as this gigantic mass of a woman bent down and squeeze herself through the door. With a few cracks and a little quake she existed and stood before me putting her hand onto her hips. Surprisingly this was the first time I had seen her get out of her office, and I can clearly see her changes. Her head was almost a couple of feet away from the ceiling making her over ten feet tall. Her long black hair flow down over her considerable round face over her thick shoulders. Her fat neck and broad shoulders supported her beach ball size breast. She happened to have a new suit to accommodate her size, or the size she was yesterday because it was tearing at the seams as I could see her dark skin oozing out between them. Her belly was in full view sticking out almost as far as her breast. Her black pants barely held her bone crunching butt and thighs even with her button undid and zipper down. Her lags actually looked like there was more muscle then fat that made its thickness. As a matter of fact she looked more like there was a lot of muscle under all that fat over all. With her imposing size and her stern face looking down on me I felt like she was going to crush me at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know what time it is?!\" she growled at me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, it's 9:20.\" I whimpered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And do you know when you're supposed to be here?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"9.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good Matthew, then can you tell me why you have been late for the last few days then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"uh, I... uh...\" I stammered trying to think of a way to explain everything that happened this week knowing that they don't see any of these changes strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eyes up here Matthew!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly looked up to her face seeing her stern face. Just then I noticed that there was something sticking out on both sides of her head. To my shock the two things was big round fluffy white and orange ears! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on I'm waiting!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, It's been a rough week for me. I really don't want to talk about it.\" I spat out surprising myself. She stared at me unblinking realizing what I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm done for,\" I thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really?\" She said crossing her arms under her breast. I nodded to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, if you're having some trouble at home, then you should take the day off to settle it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy jaw dropped, \"what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard me, take a day off tomorrow. I need my employees working at their best and if you're having home problems then you can't work at your best.\" She then turned around going back to her office, \"I can't lose a good employee like you to domestic problems can I.\" She then gave me this weird smile before going through her door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood dumbfounded, my mind was an empty wasteland. But as I thought I couldn't be more surprised I noticed sticking out of her gigantic butt was a thick orange and black stripped tail waggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What on earth is going on here!\" I yelled in my head. Although to be fair with everything changing recently I shouldn't be surprised. Nothing as of recent was predictable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just stood there staring at Ms. Bahl office door just possessing everything. I really don't know what to think. Eventually I went to my desk dropping myself onto my chair feeling exhausted and puzzled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, you're so lucky. It's almost impossible to get vacation time from her!\" I jumped as I heard Sylvia from behind me. \"Besides you kind of need it. You have been looking a bit uneasy for the past few days.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI really didn't want to look considering the changes that my boss undergo but my curiosity got the best of me. I turned to her preparing myself for the enviable surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough not as big as Ms. Bahl, she was still huge. She must have been a over eight feet tall, and looked like she weighed over a literal ton. Her face was strikingly slender giving her weight sipping on a extra large cup of smoothly but given her size looked like a normal size cup. But all of that was being blocked by her breasts casting it's shadow over me. I could see her white blouses straining to contain it as I could see her white bra between its gaps, although her stomach didn't help. Not as big as her breasts it was still big enough to have its own zip code as it hanged over her waist. While her smallest asset, but still big, was her thighs and butt, barely being contained within her long black skirt that came to her knees. I wonder how she could even move being squished into that skirt. And just like Ms. Bahl she had a pair of red-white furry pointy ears with a long fluffy red curled tail witch was slightly wagging. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah, I thought I was going to be fired.\" I answered as I tried to look past her breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, fired, ha!\" I heard Filicia from behind Sylvia. \"If you're fired then this company would fall into the toilet!\" I was half expecting Filicia to fart right then to emphasize her point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI strain myself to look around Sylvia to see Filicia walking from the break room holding a box of donuts. Out of all of them she was the shortest at just over seven-and-a-half feet tall but given how round she was she looked a lot bigger. She looked like half of her weight she gain fell on her double folded belly. Her breast was over twice the size of her head as her purple blouse had only one button holding every thing together. I could hear the groaning of her black mini skirt as she walked pass me and Sylvia showing off her shelf of a butt. Her animal features was easier to spot seeing that she had a gigantic black and white fluffy tail taking almost half the size of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy head was starting to spin. Not just because of my conversations with my boss but also with my coworker. They never was concern about my well being let alone thinking I had value. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need something to drink, excuse me.\" I said as I got out of my seat, squeezed around Sylvia, and walked into the water cooler. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I filled my cup with water I could hear Rebecca walk up behind me. \"Oh dearly, you don't look so good, are you coming down with something?\" She asked with a motherly tone. I turn to her sighing, preparing myself for the changes she'd undergo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood a little over nine feet tall casting a long shadow over me wearing a undersized red work suit. The first thing I notice about her was her neck. It was twice as long as normal thick with fat. Her face was strangely slender compare to the rest of her. Her brown hair cascaded down her long neck to her slender shoulders. Surprisingly most of her upper body was slender except for her breasts which was bigger than her head. But if her top was somewhat slender then her lower half was the opposite. Her stomach was gigantic, it stuck out several feet from her bursting out of her white blouse. But all of that was nothing compare to her butt. It must have weighed half of her total weight. It stuck out in every which way tying to fine room. Her skirt was pretty much ruined as she had safely pins to hold it together. Her legs was thick and massive to hold such a rear, I couldn't believe that she could walk with legs that thick. And the last feature I saw, just like my boss in some ways, was a big white feathery tail sticking out of base of her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"n-no, I'm f-fine.\" I stuttered as my neck was starting to strain by looking up to everyone now, \"I just need some time to figure out some things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet it has something to do with your bitch of a wife,\" Filicia yelling from her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, everything is fine, I just need to clear my head,\" I said as I slunk back to my desk. But before I could get there I was stopped by a wall of fat blocking my path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, you can tell us,\" asked Sylvia as she stood in front of me. But before I could answer I was bummed from behind by something large and soft. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, we're your coworkers, you can ask us for anything,\" Rebecca said sounding a bit sinister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at both of the gigantic women seeing that I was stuck between a giant pair of breasts and a mountain of a butt as both of my coworkers was staring at me with this sinister smile on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no everything i-is f-fine. I-I need to g-get back to work,\" I stuttered as I squeeze myself between them and rushed to my desk. The two looked at each other and shrugged, walking back to their desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat in my seat breathing in and out trying to calm myself down.\" When did they care about my well-being. Just last week Ms. Bahl called me lazy for not finishing on time, Filicia spiking my coffee with hot sauce, and Sylvia and Rebecca teaming up to trick me to do there work as they took a day off.\" I thought, \"and now their asking me if I'm alright. What's going on here?!\" Then my thoughts went to the necklace. \"Could it be the necklace causing them to care more?\" Soon my thoughts went to my wife, \"if this is happening to my coworkers, with these animal features, then what does Sawyer look like?!\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I stared in disbelief as I stood in front of my front door, or what used to be a front door. The whole doorway was smash open as if a wrecking ball went through it. The actual front door was leaning on the wall right next to the hole. Gathering my courage I walked through the hole. Lucky we lived in a house that had high ceilings and doorways, so nothing inside looked too banged up. Occasionally there was a few things knocked over like a small display table or a vase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sawyer, are you home?\" I called out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence only answered. She must be out and the chef and servants are off now. If everyone is gone then it's a good time to look around and see what other damages has been done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked into the living room seeing the crushed remains of the couch as it looked as flat as a pancake. Walking through the room and headed to the dining room. In there the table was clean and spotless as expected in a house with a servant, but the chair where Sawyer usually sits was gone, but upon further inspection her chair was there but was in pieces. The kitchen was the next room over and I dreaded looking in there. As I entered and looked around I was surprised that the kitchen was actually clean, although I can see by the sink was full of recently cleaning pile of plates, probably just from breakfast. I looked looked around the kitchen to see it was all devoid of food except for a little bit of leftovers in the fridge. Just then I felt quakes coming from the front door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSawyer was home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matthew, are you here?\" Sawyer yelled into the house. I froze in fear, in part because of the her yelling my name and because of what she might look like, but eventual I called out to her, \"yes dear. I'm in the kitchen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stomping started again as I felt it coming closer to me. Preparing myself for the revealment, I walked out of the kitchen and went toward the living room. I kept my head down, too afraid to look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after I entered the room Sawyer's stomping stopped as I stood in front of her. The only thing I could see was her feet, which was already twice as big before all this transformation. With a sigh I looked up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the first time since the stairs that I saw Sawyer full body, and out of all the women that has changed she was the biggest! She was a couple of feet from the ceiling making her around thirteen feet tall! Her body was mostly composed of boobs, butt, and hips all supported by gigantic pair of legs with a \"small\" belly sticking out from between them all. If she was normal height she looked like she weighed over 500 but with her given height she must be well over three tons. She wore something like a white toga with a golden belt (if you can see it), she looked like a goddess, a very voluptuous goddess. She probably was waring that because there probably was nothing she size to wear. In one of her hands she had a bag as big as me that looked like it was filled with clothes and in the other she held several smaller bags filled with different kinds of food. As for her animal transformation it was obvious to see, which to my surprise, she had these huge pair of mouse ears stick out of her head. I would have probably expected horns or something more wicked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood there with my mouth agape trying to rap my head around her gigantic size. She looked down at me with confusion, \"What are you looking at?\" But before I could answer she slowly smirked at me, \"oh do you like this dress?\" She then twirled around making me jump back to avoid being hit by her. That's when I saw her thick tail just like that of a mouse but fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just bought it. Could you believe that it was one of the few things they had at my size, despicable. I think from now on I need get them custom fitted, ugh what a pain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then walked past me and toward the dining room, \"and while we are talking about custom fitting, we need a new couch and chairs, they are so flimsy it's a wonder why we got them all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven your size it was hard to imagine what could survive with your new weight I thought. It was also hard to imagine how she could be so casual about destruction of property. I then thought about the destroyed door, we have a gaping hole that was used to be our front door. I was afraid to ask her about it, she usually gets snappy at me when I asked questions about anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the front door?\" I asked meekly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That? Yea, that broke this morning as I left for the mall, that stupid door. Anyway, I was already thinking about replacing it anyway. I already called some door repair guys to come tomorrow to improve upon it by making it taller and making it double doors,\" Sawyer said walking into the dining room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomorrow, yea, almost forgot about my day off. I really don't want her to know about it but if she found out be sleeping outside for a week, although that wouldn't be a bad idea, but in the end I knew what I must do. I rubbed the back of my head in nervousness, \"speaking of tomorrow, I got a day off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSawyer stopped in her tracks but didn't face me. \"Oh really?\" she said with a upbeat tone but quickly snapped back to her more commanding voice , \"Um, good, um, that could help me a lot! I could use you with furniture shopping tomorrow.\"  She cleared her voice as she continued walking until she got to her destroyed chair sitting down on top of it. \"Hey why don't you have a light dinner with me before you go to bed. You don't look so good,\" she stated as she placed her bags of food upon the table wile placing the other bag next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI should be surprised that she asked me to eat with her since she usually actively tries to avoid me, but I'm not. With every thing that has happened to me these past few days I'm too exhausted to be surprised. So without a word I went into the kitchen to find anything left for me to eat, coming back to the table facing the opposite side of Sawyer and ate quietly as she devour her food.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just as recommended I went to bed early, besides, I was exhausted. That day was so confusing with how everyone was acting. I fell asleep quickly even with the knowledge of things to come. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorning came but I was too nervous to get out of bed, but I knew that I can't prolong the inevitable. Eventually I slowly got of bed and took my time getting ready. I felt worried about today's outing with Sawyer. Normally it wouldn't bother me but this time I was afraid of Sawyer, with her recent height and girth, she can seriously hurt me now. When Sawyer gets angry she sometimes she becomes physically abusive on top of her verbally abuse, and she got angry often with me when we went out shopping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spend a couple of hours longer in my room before heading down to the living room. I was trying to avoid her as much as possible hoping to prolong the peace and quiet before the stress of being with Sawyer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before leaving I remembered my necklace looking at it on top of my dresser. I thought about the changes that had happened over the course of a few days, how the women of my life that has treating differently, although mostly as a delivery boy. My thoughts then focus on Sawyer and her changes as a part of me strangely calmed. I quickly grabbed my necklace as I walked down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I got near the ground floor I could hear Sawyer eating. She must have been eating for hours being how long I tried to avoid her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matthew, are you here?!\" Sawyer yelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stopped just before the last step. How can she hear me from here, let alone hear me with all that eating. Just then the house shook I heard heavy footsteps rushing from the dining room toward me. I had to hold onto the rail so I wouldn't be shook off my feet. Before I could process what was happening Sawyer was standing in front of me with fist on her very wide hips and a angry look on her face, that is, a face of a very rounded mouse face, with whisker and all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a strain to look up at her as her extremely oversizes beach ball size breast was in the path of her face. Her height didn't help as she seems to have gotten bigger overall as her head now almost touched the ceiling. Apparently those animal additions from yesterday was a prologue of things to come as she was now a giant overly obese white anthropomorphic mouse! Today she was wearing similar clothes to the ones she wore from yesterday but instead it was blue and looked a little bit smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why haven't you come to breakfast?!\" Sawyer said sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... uh...,\" I stuttered, staring at her as I tried to reassemble my mind as I think this was the point my mind snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Matthew, are you alright,\" she asked as her expression soften.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um yeah,\" I replied finally thinking straight, \"what did you say?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you come from breakfast at your usual time?\" she became stern again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't hungry,\" I lied, \"and I didn't want to disturb you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, um, from now on I want you to eat with me, got that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am,\" I said softly lowering my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't notice but Sawyer looked hurt when I said that. We just stood there in silence for a bit before Sawyer spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, we better be off to the mall, it's going to be a long day ahead of us,\" she said as she waddle off to grab her purse. I sighed, getting the feeling that although Sawyer physical changed her personality didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood on the stairs as I watch Sawyer struggle to get her stuff. Her body shook like a balloon filled with water ever which way as she had a hard time to bend and walk. Her butt stuck so far out and hips so wide she hit everything every time she bend over, she seemed to be not used to her current size, making me wonder if she was aware of her changes. That's when I noticed that her hair also changed to match the rest of her fur color as it looked longer draping down her many back rolls like white water flowing down a stream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of struggling to get her things a servant had to help her. We then both left, me following her, as she took a device that looked like an iPad out of her backpack-turned-purse making a call to some kind of service. After several minutes a middle-size bus pulled up, and it just dawn on me, I never thought how she got back and forth from the house to the mall being so big as she is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSawyer got into the back squeezing herself into the mostly empty bus making it rock back and forth violently as she tried to fit complain all the wile. As soon as she became comfortable I got into the side seat and we drove off. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Unloading Sawyer was uneventful as getting out of a car but with a obese giant anthro mouse woman getting out of a bus instead. It felt so strange to see so little people interested in us as everyone just treated this as a normal occurrence. Even though it was normal for everyone it was still a spectacle to watch. I could hear the bus creak as it shook as Sawyer squeeze herself out. Occasionally I heard the sound of metal bend trying to hold her bulk as she shifted her weight around. Soon, with help from the driver and me, she was able to get out. She looked frustrated as she smooth out her toga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a horrible ride, we better get a costume vehicle after this. I deserve a better ride than some dirty old bus!\" She complained while our ride drove away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now it's going to be a long day so I want you to be by me at all times!\" She commanded as she waddle off to the entrance of the mall me following behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe are lucky that our mall was one of those open air malls with the glass roof or Sawyer would have been a very difficult time squeezing herself in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though she was waddling, given her size, Sawyer actually faster than me, and because of this I walked behind her. I watched her gigantic shelf of a butt bounce as it rocked back and forth as her fat tale swished from side to side. If I didn't know any better she was doing that on purpose. The more I watched the more I became aroused, and that disgusted me. Oh don't get me wrong, I wasn't disgusted by her fat, no, I was actually starting to enjoying it, I was getting disgusted by me being aroused by my wife. Ever since getting married I have grown to hate Sawyer's body, her small, bony body. Now she was the opposite of all that, well expected her personality, that was mostly the same to my disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe walked past many stores as I had a hard time looking away from Sawyer's backside. When I was able to tear eyes away from her for a moment I looked around to see how people looked at us. Although many people treated Sawyer's gigantic size as if it was normal there was still plenty of people staring at her dumbfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe eventually reached to our destination, a furniture store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matthew I want you to stay out here until I'm finished, you got that?\" She said sternly turning to face me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am,\" I answered looking down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And um, look at me when I speak, I want to see your face.\" She sounded a little uneasy said that as her ears fell a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn odd request, the whole reason I looked down when she spoke to me was that she told me to do so right after the wedding. I looked up to her, but it was not easy as a literal ton of breasts was in the way of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And after here I want to check something out I saw on tv.\" she then turned and squeeze herself into the furniture store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood there until she was able to get pass the front door before I let out a sigh. My arousal was starting to get a little hard to control. I have been a relatively shelter child when growing up, mostly because of my controlling family, so I never really experienced arousal for anyone before, so all this is new and confusing to me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then remembered about the old lady. I looked around me trying to see if I spot her but saw nothing. Somehow I knew I wouldn't find her, given all this weirdness I would easily believe she proofed out of existence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly looked into the store to see Sawyer arguing with the manager, probably about how there was no furniture that can handle a over four ton anthropomorphic mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually with a furious face Sawyer squeezed herself out almost braking the doors and stumped out toward me. I became afraid as she approached me fearing she might do something to me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The nerve of that guy! Telling ME I'm too big for anything! Well that's the last time I buy anything from them!\" She yelled, her entire body shaking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo my relief she then stomped away down the mall as her heavy footsteps shook the ground. Her body quaking with every step she took. I looked at Sawyer's backside knowing exactly why they rejected her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe eventually calmed down as we walked around the mall occasionally stopping at cosmetic shops, fabric stores, and jewelry stores. I was surprised when we stopped at a glasses store, she told me that it was becoming harder for her to see and needed glasses. Similar to the furniture store it was difficult for Sawyer to enter the stores and when got in she was approached by a employee. Although she bought stuff from them she was frustrated with how they handled her. To what I saw Sawyer was trying buying all new stuff that would match her new size with varying degrees of success. I could see that after this trip Sawyer may have to buy things custom made for her online. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost noon as we walking down the mall load with many bags. I was lucky that most of the bags was light or the ones she gave me because she was also carrying some bags for the first time ever. I was looking down trying to not stare at Sawyer's hypnotic butt when she stopped in front of another store. Strangely enough she thick tail moved as if she was trying coaxing me to look at her butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally it took forever to find this place. Who would have thought that I passed by this many times before without going in!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked up to see what store she was talking about. To my shock it was a gaming story! \"Well of course you pass by this place never going in, you hate video games!\" I thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You stay here as I check if they have what I saw,\" Sawyer said as she walked up to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched as she squeezed herself through the double doors as a few of the workers began to panic. Although it was hard to concentrate on anything else when you have a gigantic butt wiggling in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she made it in as a worker quickly came up to her, most likely to stop her from going deeper into the store so she wouldn't knock anything down with her hips. I watched as the worker talking to her looked a bit nervous, but not like fear of a giant woman nervous but more like talking to a girl nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of talking some other worker came up to her with several different sizes boxes. She took out her card and handed them it. I saw as the two workers blushed as they took her card as they got a very good look at her canyon of a cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSawyer soon squeezed though the doors again with a victorious grin carrying her newly purchased gear. I received the same sight as the two workers as I got a eyeful of cleavage as she exited. Then it dawned on me, did she have  anything under her toga!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally! Decent customer service! You'll think that these stores would treat you better if they what you to come back. Now come on, it's almost time for lunch.\" She said strongly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSawyer walked off into the mall as I stood there dumbfounded. The thought of her probably not wearing anything under her clothes was strangely arousing me,but what surprised me most was she bought stuff from a game store! Then I thought about the necklace, \"is it changing her personality to someone I like?\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The food court was as busy as always, especially one that it's seating arrangement was outside on this cool sunny day. There was almost a dozen different fast food restaurants circling around the seats. Although I don't take much notice as I was in deep thought my eyes to the floor, mostly thinking about what other personality changes Sawyer has undergo. Because of this I don't notice that Sawyer stop causing me to bump in between her legs, my head just below her butt. I expected her to react negatively to me bumping her but instead she raped her tail around me as if she was shelter me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are those your women over there from your work?\" Sawyer asked with a hint of aggression in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to fight her tail to get around her to see who she was looking at. I thought she might have mistaken some random women as my coworkers given the resent changes they had undergo, but didn't even need to look to see who Sawyer was talking about as they stood out like a big fat furry sore thumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere on the other side of the seating area sat three gigantic anthropomorphic women eating, and before I could answer Sawyer's question the one that looked like a white bird with a long neck of the behemoth ladies looked at me and yelled out, \"is that Matthew? Hey Matthew!\" Quickly the other two turned around looking at where the giant bird was pointing to. With great hast they stuffed there remaining food down there throat before standing up and walked toward us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they approached I got a good look at there most recent changes. Normally I wouldn't be able to tell who was who with their current forms if it wasn't for what animal parts they had yesterday. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca, the one who call me out, was the tallest of the three, although not as tall as Sawyer, as she stood just about twelve and a half feet tall. Now her transformation was complete from yesterday looking like a white goose or swan with her body covered with white feathers, a long neck and wings for hands. She didn't look at much fatter except for her hips that can mistaken for white boulders. Her whole lower half shook with every waddle she made forced to take large strides by how much fat was in her legs that got in the way, walking more like the bird she now looked like. She wore a large t-shirt that said \"Super Mom\" that stretched across her relatively large bust. Wrapped around her waist was a large semi-transparent floral design beach skirt that only covered half of her waist, exposing the other half for all to see with her feathery potbelly of a tummy rolling over the rim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind her was Filicia eating a large burrito. She too completed her transformation as she was now a black and white ball of a skunk. Although the shortest of the three, only standing a little over ten feet, she was clearly the roundest as she stomach cascaded down she legs well pass her knees wile her large but equally size breasts and butt rounded her out. The only thing I could see her wearing under all that fat was a over size stained white t-shirt. I couldn't tell if she was wore any pants or anything like that under all that fat but if she did it would certainly be ripped apart by all of her body sloshing about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd last was Silvia and she seemed to be the most fluffy. She was was a white and red furred husky that stood in the middle of the three just above eleven, and wile the other two had trouble walking because of there thick legs and bellies she was having trouble seeing pass her wall of boobs. It seems that she had to use a multicolor strip hammock to contain the two bouncing boulders as her only choice of a bra. Although she still had a sizable large belly and butt, it couldn't compare to the two mountains. She was also the only person out of all the anthropomorphic girl to be wearing pants, given it was short shorts that's on its last threads literally but pants nonetheless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSawyer and I watched them as they waddle toward us while I felt Sawyer's tail rap itself around me and pulling me closer to her. I couldn't see it but Sawyer was not happy to see my coworkers here as she gave them a judgmental look, and as they came closer Sawyer changed her expression to more welcoming to mask her true intentions. The three eventually arrived after lumbering there way through the crowd standing in a line before us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Matthew, a wonder meeting you here and this must be your wife Sawyer?\" spoke Rebecca looking a little displeased Sawyer was here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why yes I am and you must be his coworkers, Rebecca, Filicia, and I believe Sylvia correct?\" Sawyer spoke up before I could say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, I remember you coming to our little office party last year,\" said Sylvia a bit relieved to look at someone without looking over her boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, your the one that was so uptight that you left early leaving Matthew to take a taxi home,\" Filicia said with a bit of snark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And weren't you the one who drank so much you almost threw up but instead burping in Matthew's face\" Sawyer snapped back as she crossed her arms under her chest making it look bigger, as if she is trying to intimate her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFunny enough I remember Sawyer enjoying that moment at the party and when Sawyer did leave early so she didn't need to spend more time with me, I remember Filicia laughing at my attempt of trying to keep her from taking the car, forcing me to take a cab home after the party. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey girls, that was in the pass,\" intervene Rebecca, \"this is our day off and I don't want to spoil it, and besides I don't think Matthew here wants to be reminded those events.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it's fine, but besides that, you also have a day off?\" I asked finally able to speak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yea, Ms. Bahl didn't tell you? After you left she realized that the office was a feeling a bit too cozy so she decided to do some remodeling and wont be done till next Monday,\" Sylvia responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little bit cozy?!\" I thought, \"your the size of cars now and probably weights as much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Us too,\" said Sawyer, \"and just yesterday Matthew's mom called saying how she need to do a bunch of repairs around her house and might have to come visit us, I can't believe how flimsy things are made these days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy body froze when Sawyer mentioned my mother. Then a scary thought come to me, did my mother and sister change too? Given the fact that the other women in my life has changed into giant obese anthropomorphic women, thinking about what could my mother and sister change into made me shiver. I guess Sawyer noticed my discomfort because she bent down a bit placing her hand on my head pulled me closer to her making me squish into her furry leg fat. Sawyer then changed the topic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I haven't heard so much about you girls from Matthew, he rarely talks about work.\" Sawyer sounding a bit happy by that statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Sylvia said almost sounding offended by Sawyer's comment , \"well he never talks about you or what his home life is like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't he tell you why he had his day off,\" Filicia spoke up with a bit of venom, \"he became stressed by home life and couldn't do his work properly.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now girls, we can't presume his stress was cause by <i>marriage issues</i>,\" Rebecca stressed the last words, \"it could have been from over working for all we know.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike they care about why I'm so stressed, I'm usually being bullied by my coworkers and by my wife, as they are not interested in listening to me. Now It is like they are trying to one-up each other on who is the better person who treated me the best in the past while in fact they only treated me poorly. I know I shouldn't be surprised by all of this by now but it's still so strange for them to act so fond of me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSawyer started to turn red as these three women tease her in front of her husband, so much so that she didn't notice that her tail that was raped around me was getting tighter. It felt like a thick squishy rope tying me up. Luckily she began to loosen before it became to hard for me to breath as a friendly yet wicked smile appeared on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it must be good for him to have a vacation from work, I can't imagine how much stress he has working with such egregious women like yourself. Also thanks for telling us that Matthew has a week off from work, it would be great for him to go on a little vacation trip with <i>me</i>, maybe someplace private for the two of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three giant women look at Sawyer with annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we better be off, it's lunch time and I'll like to take my <i>beloved</i> husband to a nice restaurant,\" Sawyer huffed still keeping her smile as she pull me with her tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well good luck you two,\" said Rebecca cheerfully, \"and Matthew, we hope we will meet again soon, <i>very soon</i>.\" They then had this sexual look in their eyes before walking away from us. A chill surge through me as a worrying though cross my mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>To my amazement Sawyer actually took us to a nice Italian restaurant a short walk away from the mall. Fortunately for them they had outdoor seating. Unfortunately for them Sawyer was going to decimate their food supply. I was glad to see that Sawyer was aware of her size and tried to accommodate for it despite everyone seeming that it was normal for a hulking giant of a mouse to be walking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile waiter bought us to our seats, another waiter bringing a bench for Sawyer creaking as she sat down. As the waiter took our order, his fear was realized when she ordered the more then half of the menu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen our food arrived we just ate in silence. That was blessing for me as it allowed me to process today's events. Sawyer buying games, being so close to me, my coworkers transformation, the tension between Sawyer and my coworkers, and most of all that comment about my mother's house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo start with, Sawyer hates anything that she considers as \"nerd stuff\" seeing it all as beneath her. The little books I had and the small about of games and movies I had just strength her of me being another more then a stepping stone, only marrying me for my mother's money. Buying games just spat at everything she believed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen my thoughts shifted to my coworkers transformation and attitude changes. The fact they was flirting with me was more shocking then the actual physical transformation itself! The presence of Sawyer wouldn't stop them from insulting me, actually Sawyer would of encouraged it. Their physical transformation was a lot less shocking if not predictable. But seeing them at their full height made me feel small while they stood around me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat feeling made me think about my mom and sister. I began to wonder what animal did they turn to. But again I couldn't think to long as Sawyer began to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a good lunch.\" She huffed holding in a burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked up to her seeing her finished plate. Then I noticed at her left stood a stack of fifteen plates! I barely finish my plate of food, but then again I was preoccupied with my thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway,\" she stated as she wiped her muzzle, \"seeing that you are free this week it would be good to spend a day at the beach, it's been a while since I been there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mind just flashed of Sawyer in her old body in a bikini making me shudder. Not waiting for my answer she called for the check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting home was mostly uneventful besides Sawyer getting stuck in the bus again. Our door was fix now being able to handle Sawyer's new girth. As we both entered I decided to head to my room as I need a rest from today's events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Matthew... um... before you go... um... I need your help,\" Sawyer stammered, struggling to ask for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to her to see she was holding up the bag of stuff from the video game store. With a sigh I turned around and headed towered the living room, and for a moment I thought I heard a squeak from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't know it was getting late until I heard the grandfather clock chimed ten. After helping Sawyer with setting up the game console she asked me how to play, and since I hadn't had that much experience myself we we both learned together. It has been over six hours since then the two of us playing games together. It has been the most time I have played a game. I had so much fun that I forget I was playing with Sawyer. But after the clocked chimed we stopped playing and got ready for bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was now sitting on my bed thinking about the fun I had with Sawyer. This is the first time ever that I had fun being with Sawyer and first time having fun in general in a long time. I started to smile thinking that these changes that was happening in my life won't be so bad after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matthew, come out here!\" Came a roar from outside my door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy door then suddenly opened snapping me out of my thoughts. I jumped off by bed and ran out the door. I almost slammed into her as she stood much closer to my door then I thought. \"Yes Sawyer,\" I asked reverting back to my old habits as I stood at attention and looked down at her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at me when I speak!\" She command. I quickly looked up but only saw was her under boobs. As I looked upon her I saw that she was wearing a simple light purple gown that was almost transparent that hugged her body showed off her canyon of white cleavage and draped down to just before her knees. I took a few steps back to see her face. Upon seeing it I noticed that she didn't look angrily but look nervous as she had a hard time looking me in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matthew... um I need you um... in my room,\" she said with a strange combination of authority and nervousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am,\" I said without thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a small squeak she turned around and walked down the hallway, the walls quaking as she walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer room was down the hall and to the right around the corner. Apparently she also changed her bedroom door also, allowing her to enter without trouble. Sawyer's room was quiet the opposite of my room. While my room small and simple, her room was massive and colorful. She had a large vanity mirror with tons of beauty products to our right just before the door, a walkthrough closet to our left, her own personal bathroom to our right, with with both doorways enlarged, and a massive king size poster bed with dark purple drapes in front of us. The color purple was the dominant theme as is it was the color of her walls to her furniture. The lights in the room was mostly off except for two large Tiffany lamps on nightstands parallel to each other on each sides of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSawyer then quickly turn to me looking down with a strict face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are to sleep with me tonight!\" She stated in a matter of fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mind just shut off as I looked at her dumbfounded. I couldn't answer as she looked at me annoyingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you not hear me! Tonight you are sleeping with me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a bit of time for my brain to restart, \"what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, get in my bed!\" She commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fear I quickly climbed into her bed and just laid on the sheets as stiff as possible. We have never been in the same bed before so I was very scared and nervous. I looked back at her to see what she'll do expecting her to be furious but upon looking at her face I become confused. She stood rigid and uneasy as she looked at me awkwardly and for just a moment I thought I saw a bit of red under fur around her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly and mechanically she walked around her bed to the opposite side where I entered and dropped her butt onto the edge of it sending me a bit into the air from its impact as the wooden frame grown around me. Taking her time she maneuver herself on her bed one enormous leg at a time scooting her butt closer to me. By the time her whole body was on the bed she practically took up nearly two-thirds of the whole bed pushing me closer to the edge. Leaning forward she grabbed her blanket covering us and turning off the lights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lay there in the dark unable to see anything as my mind raced, wondering why she wanted me in her bed. My mind went everywhere but the most frightening thought was if she want to have sex. Normally I wouldn't even give this a thought because of our pass relationship, but with recant events it was a real threat. God, just the thought of it made my pelvis hurt. Just then I felt the bed shift and quake as a massive form turned. I remained still as my fear rose as the wood creaked and the bed quaked with every movement. Then with a sudden flop near my chest which I could only presume was her breasts everything became still again.  As I lay there I had the feeling that someone was watching me, and I believe who that was. Remaining still I rolled my eyes toward her in an attempt to look at Sawyer. Although my eyes was not adjusted to the darkness I could almost make out two large eyes starring at me. Feeling uncomfortable for multiple reasons I decided to ignore her and quickly turned to my side away from her. That's when I heard a soft sad squeak but I ignored it as I tried to go to sleep.</span></div></div>",

Once my fit was over, I stared about in shock at my whereabouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sandy beach bordering a deep tropical forest nearby, a vast contrast to the ship I was on <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQUickly getting on my legs, I looked around in horror for any sign of the boat, coming up dry. No hull, no crates, no wreckage, no other crew members. Just me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, god\u2026please don't be an island\u2026\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mustered all of my drained energy and began sprinting down the beach, my cut and battered body begging me to stop. Several times I'd trip or lose my footing on the soft sand, but nonetheless would stand back up and continue running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an hour until I came across my own footprints, trailing down the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, god\u2026\" I began whimpering, sweet hope ebbing away. \"OH GOD, <b><i>NO\u2026</i></b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like some kind of nightmare; the thing you only think would happen in the movies or to some survivalist on the news. But sure enough, I was stranded on an island perhaps devoid of any life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-Keep calm, Stu\u2026Just keep calm.\" I insisted to myself, uttering and absorbing the words with great difficulty. \"First\u2026First things first, find shelter\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trees ahead seemed to grow thicker the deeper they went on, almost warning me of any threats that lay within. I tried my best to stay at the edge of the trees, hyperventilating as I tore off the thick branches and laid them in a pile in the middle of the sand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough my pile seemed large enough to make a crude tent. However, before I could calculate any strategy as to my survival, sounds within the forest caused me to shoot up straight, bringing hope to my unsettled mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">\"Wait here. I think I heard something in the trees.\"</font></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey\u2026HEY!!!\" I nearly fell over and turned around and sprinted towards the woods. \"I CRASH LANDED HERE! I NEED SOME HELP, AND I HAVE NO\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as I passed the mouth of the trees, the muscle in my legs seemed to melt away as something huge came crashing through the woods. I couldn't tell what it was, but it possessed astonishing mass, probably ten feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was...</span></div></div>",

As if it wasn't painfully clear before, this was a very obese, very large and extremely heavy creature. Before I could make another move, the ground shook again and I found my head at the same level with the crotch of a pair of skintight jeans that looked like they were unzipped from the weight of the creature wearing them, exposing a pair of pink panties. I looked in shock and saw that the creature was a woman... for a very, <i>very</i>, <b>very</b> loose version of the term. She was a 12ft tall and 5 ton crocodile woman with yellow-green skin. From the looks of it, she had a 12ft wide stomach and 15ft wide ass as well as a pair of titanic D-cup breasts and short black hair worn in a bob haircut. Even though everything else on her was morbidly obese,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what really surprised me was how she was dressed. She was wearing a rather tight pair of jeans as well as a leather jacket that only served to hide her nipples as well as a spiked glove over her left hand and a pair of orange and purple split-colored triangular sunglasses. She looked a lot like something out of Mad Max. From the context, this was an island of obese anthro amazons and the style of the island seemed to be post-apocalyptic. Of course, before I could even think of what was going on, the colossal crocodile woman got down on her knees to inspect me as drool came out of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well let's see what we have here,\" said the crocodile woman as she looked down on me. \"From the minuscule size and lanky frame, I'd say that it's a man.\" The crocodile woman licked her lips and I tried to run but surprisingly, the crocodile giant was able to jump high for someone was huge and fat and landed in front of me, shaking the ground as I tumbled into her massive ass. Before I could move away, the titanic crocodile amazon wrapped her tail around me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crocodile girl then lifted her sunglasses and laughed sinisterly at me. \"Well,\" she said. \"Don't go running off now. I haven't decided if I'm going to eat you yet.\" The croc woman opened her mouth and was drooling more uncontrollably than ever and I was soaked as I yelled. \"Of course,\" said the crocodile woman. \"It isn't entirely up to me. I'll bet the girls will be really happy to see you. My gang is nearby and they haven't seen a man in years.\" I knew that whatever plan this crocodile girl had for me wasn't good but I was powerless to stop it as the crocodile pressed me against her butt crack and then grabbed me with her clawed hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crocodile woman laughed evilly as she held her ass up and shoved me into her jeans'...</span></div></div>",

Soon enough there is a procession of sorts, as more and more of the women gather behind Gorus, waddling slowly and a few steps behind her. A  few minutes have passed as we moved deeper into the village until suddenly, I felt my captor come to a halt, given by how frantically the \"cage\" shook.

Why did you stop?\" I asked, raising my voice just so Gorus could hear me. Sure enough, I felt a sense of vertigo, the world shifting in a sudden movement as the cage is brought to the ground, opened, and I was forcefully (but also somewhat gently) taken out and placed outside. Before me as a very large tree, its thick and old trunk being hundreds of feet tall, branches sticking out and nearly blotting out the sun. At the base of the tree there was an opening that obviously led into the tree itself, and a staircase that led to it. But what really got my attention were the figures at the entrance of the steps,  three of the largest women I had ever seen, standing easily at 30 feet and sporting the biggest, well, everything, from their thunderous thighs to their hefty chests, to even their soft pillowy midriffs, their sizes as intimidating as the masks they wore and yet, I couldn't help but think they were somewhat...arousing.  The one in the middle, standing just a little taller than the other two, wearing a plumed mask and grasping an ornate wooden spear, took a step forward, her grey skin glistening under the sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gorus! Back so soon? What's this you bring with you?\" She drops to one meaty knee, her massive belly getting a bit in the way as she takes off her mask to look at me. Looking at my shocked form with an inquisitive expression in her rhino-like face, she scratched her horn absent-mindedly. \"..oh?... Oh! A human, and a male at that! Nice catch, the Chieftain will be pleased!\" Chieftain? Oh no, this could turn out very badly, by the way it was headed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy thoughts were interrupted when the head guard, I assumed, hoisted herself back up and raised her spear into the air. The low murmurs that have been following me and Gorus were instantly silenced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone! Hear me! Your suspicions are correct, Gorus has found a MAN!\" There was a few gasps and then a sudden cheer, as the animal-like women shouted in apparent delight, conversing in an animated fashion, from what I understood. I guess they haven't seen a man in ages, I mused to myself nervously. My musings however, didn't last too long, as I was yanked off the ground by the rhino guard lady. She stuck the spear on the ground with her other hand and held it under me, so I could stand in her palm. \"YOU are a lucky one, not many men manage to find us or this village, or get to speak with our Chieftain.\" Her face turned stern. \"One word of advice, mind your tone with her, you do not wish to get on her bad side, or mine for that matter. Disrespect her, and anything she will do to you, I will do it ten times worse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this statement, I'm not going to lie, my skin turned completely white. She noted this, and as if reading my thoughts, she added, in a somewhat reassuring manner:<br>\r\n\"Do not be frightened out of your skin, man, she may have a temper sometimes, but our Chieftain is fair and wise, and we will not harm you...unless you force us to.\" And with that statement, she beckoned Gorus, who had been assisting to this whole thing with an amused look in her boarish face, to follow her. I couldn't resist the urge to look back to the crowd as we climbed the steps to the tree, and I saw that the massive crowd (pun not intended) had gotten...um...\"friskier\" in their celebrating, as many started feasting, singing, and downright kissing and groping each other. Even the two other guards had joined in the \"celebrations\", discarding their spears and ornate masks in favor of making out with each other passionately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...okay, soooo thankful I'm not over there...\" I can't help but mutter to myself. It wasn't however, low enough, as the head of the guard looked at me as she waddled up the steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mind them, stranger. The effects of your presence here shall be explained soon enough.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, am I really that special to your people?\" I ask, shyly. She and Gorus share a thunderous laugh, their soft bodies jiggling wildly and by extension, making me shake as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Patience, stranger, all shall be revealed soon. We have arrived.\" I shifted my gaze, having been so completely distracted by the sway of their large chests and the motion of their titanic stomachs. The allure had been such that I completely missed the hallways, the working maids and of course, the large room we found ourselves in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing, however, could have prepared me for their Chieftain, as she... </span></div></div>",

For a moment, I couldn't tell if it was just some amorphous mountain of smooth black dough, but the white streaks implied it to be an orca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDozens of dining tables were suspended from wooden cranes on the walls, one of which was resting on her gargantuan breasts as she stuffed her obscenely fat body. Even while seated she had to be forty feet tall, with legs that had to be bigger than houses hanging from her sides. It almost looked like she'd been rendered completely immobile, given her (nudge) whale of a gut bloated to an almost impossibly gigantic size, puffing out probably larger than she was tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MORE!!!\" I heard her call out, and the table she was eating from was lifted away, another one filled with food swinging in to take its place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, my chief!\" The rhino guard called out, acting her from taking the next bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, guard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We wish it to be known that a human male has been found on the island, whose presence we have made known!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, and somewhat to my horror, the whale-woman braced herself and managed to heave her grotesque bulk onto her two legs, the ground beneath me shaking as she trudged forward. I could see less of her upper half as she got closer, seeming all the more huge as she got closer. I was shaking as her footsteps grew louder and louder, until she finally came to a halt as she was several paces away, and all I could see was the curvature of her belly and the hand that she held out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I see him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" I was broken out of my daze as the guard gently picked me up and help me up to her, who grabbed and lifted me up to see her face. Her head rested on a hill-sized chin with puffed cheeks, and each of her eyes had to be bigger than I was.</span></div></div>",

As I stood on the palm of her hand, the orca chieftain turned and wobbled back to the center of the room, no doubt to continue feasting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat her massive bulk on the ground, and with a few huffs, addressed the rhino woman who held me. \"Thoria, have the man sent to the Shamaness's quarters to prepare him.\" Prepare me? For what? Was I going to be eaten? I began to panic on the inside of my head. \"Also, summon her sister here, I will have need of her services.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook a bit in Thoria's hand as she bowed to the massive woman. \"As you wish, chieftain. But what of Gorus here? She was the who found him.\" And she raised her hand for emphasis, holding me further away from the ground. The blob of an orca paused, and after a few seconds addressed the boar woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gorus, you will sit with me in tomorrow's Grand Feast. Bring your mate with you, and be sure to enjoy yourself tomorrow. You've earned it, plus a bag of gems. Use them wisely.\" She winked at the boar lady, who bore a mix of shocked surprise and joy as a maid brought her the aforementioned bag of gems.Gorus fell on her fat knees and bowed multiple times, shaking her meaty body. \"Thank you, I shall never forget this honour, my chieftain! Thank you!\" She cheered, happily accepting the gift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gorus raised herself and turned to leave, no doubt to go tell her \"mate\" about the good news, Thoria turned to her right and went through an archway, heavily decorated with paintings and strange symbols. After a short while of a silent walk, I turned to face my carrier, who was humming some tribal tune as she waddled through the corridors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, uhh..miss Thoria, was it? What's going to happen to me?\" with a smile on her horned face, she eyed me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, little man, are going to meet our Shamaness, Lanirra. She's going to prepare you for our chieftain.\" Again, I was left more confused than enlightened, so I pressed her some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prepare me for your chieftain? I thought you said I wasn't going to be eaten.\" she chuckled, and patted me gently in the back of my head, as if I was a pet who had amused its owner. Needless to say, I wasn't liking the idea of being petted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we wanted you as a meal, you'd be taken to the head cook, not the shamaness. Don't be afraid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Point taken.\" I admitted, that made sense. I was about to say something else when she suddenly stopped in front of a heavy, wooden door. This is it, I thought to myself. Thoria knocked twice, and from the inside I heard a snore, followed by rustling and slow, heavy footsteps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened and I gagged as colored fumes and smokes emanated from the room. I heard a feminine yawn, and gazed upon this new woman, the shamaness called Lanirra. She was slightly taller than Gorus, but had an extremely hourglass figure, with thunderous thighs and big butt, a small potbelly in her midriff, and a meaty but shapely bosom. Her fur was snow-white, and she had long, wavy, black hair. It was an odd detail, since she was a rather stunning lioness. Her blue eyes at first focused on Thoria, and then darted to me, surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thoria, what's this? A male? Is this why you interrupted my meditation?\" her voice was girly, yet at the same time, mature. I heard the rhino lady chortle, and saw her smirking, amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lani, you weren't meditating, you were napping, I know the difference. And yes, this is a male alright, Gorus found him, and the chief has sent us here so you could prepare him for...that.\" at this, Lanirras' eyes brightened, and she held out her hand. I was passed on to her care, i thought. \"Do what you must with him, I need to summon your sister, chief's orders. Is she in her quarters?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the lioness nod her head, Thoria waved to me and left. I was carried inside the room, trying not to gag or suffocate under these heavy scents and smokes. Lanirra on the other hand seemed to like taking deep breaths of this stuff. Her room was cramped, full of wooden totems and idols, scrolls and manuscripts, strange handcrafts with feathers and wooden beads. Hanging on the walls were some eerie maks, and a bunch of cushions lay on what I assumed was her bed. She set me down in a cushion, and sat crosslegged in front of me, her blue eyes regarding me with curiosity. A brief moment passes where neither of us says anything.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So... what's this all about?\" was the exact first thing that came out of my mouth, because I just couldn't take it anymore, I HAD to know. Lanirra wasn't surprised at all, and she grabbed a large smoking pipe that was in one of the cushions. It was lit, and she too a whiff of it, exhaling a sweet fragance that made me feel slightly lightheaded. As I shook my head to clear my mind, she casually set it aside and focused on me, completely serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have been given a great honor, stranger. But I'm afraid I cannot tell you more than what you think you know. It is our way. But rest assured, no harm will befall you, and soon, you will understand\" She took a strand of her lustrous black hair off her face, and sighed. \"You were brought here to be revitalized, these smokes may smell a bit foul, but they clear your spirit of any impurities. They also heal wounds, clear your mind, and, well, let's just say that they're good for you. What you just smelled from this pipe was in fact a light narcotic, to me it just brightens my day, but for you...the dose was too big, so you're going to be knocked out for a while.\" Wait. What? That's when it hit, my vision blurred and I began to wobble like a drunkard trying to stay awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...what did you....do to me?...Ah feel....fuh....fuh-nee...\" When I looked at her, I saw twins, then triplets, and quadruplets before I plopped down, completely wasted. Last thing I heard before passing out was her voice saying \"Sleep now, stranger, you will feel like a new man when this is done...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't know how long I was out, but when I awoke, I was alone, and not in Lanirra's room. I was laying in a large bed, still clothed, thankfully, and I felt myself to see if anything had changed. To my relief, nothing about me changed, or so I thought. At the time I didn't realize, but whatever the lioness did to me had made me...well, denser. As in, capable of withstanding great pressure and supporting it without breaking bones or pulling muscles. It was invigorating, that was for sure, and that was what I felt. Lanirra wasn't kidding, that was some therapy she did to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood up on the large bed and gazed around the room: it was lavish, to say the least. There were a few ornate chairs and a table with some fruits on it, some I recognized while others were exotic and unknown to me. There were also colorful curtains hanging on the walls, even though there were no visible windows. Luxurious carpets lay on the floor, and a pleasant aroma lingered in the air. At first I was just taking my surroundings in, but something began gnawing at my mind, couldn't figure what it was until hit me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was in a bedroom, SOMEONE'S bedroom. Feeling the implications of this, I panicked and looked around, completely flustered. But then I recalled what was said in the chieftain's hall and again at Lanirra's door:<br>\r\n\"Have him prepared for 'that'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words echoed in my mind as the truth sunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hoo boy...\" was all I could say, as heavy footsteps thundered outside the room, becoming louder and louder as they came closer to the room. I was about to have company, big company. But who was it?</span></div></div>",

Like the ones guarding the entrance of the tree, they were wearing ornate masks with multicolored plumes on top, skimpy armor that revealed their huge waists, hefty bosoms, and wide hips. They stood at the doorway, looking at me in silence, almost sizing me up it felt, and then lightly bowed their heads and took a sidestep in each direction, revealing the miniscule figure that was concealed by their size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a young woman. A beautiful young woman, human like me, that began walking towards the bed, her toned yet curvy hips swaying seductively from side to side, and her generous chest jiggling and bouncing with each step she gave, a smile curving her supple lips as she saw me gawking. I was caught with my guard down. This mysterious lady snapped her fingers, and the guards withdrew at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had shoulder-length black hair and wore a tiara in her head, glistening with jewels I couldn't distinguish, and her slim but well-endowed figure was clad in nothing but a bikini and a see-through skirt. The closer she got, the more my nostrils were filled with a sweet aroma of honey and jasmine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are awake, I trust you slept well?\" she inquired, stopping just an arms' lenght in front of me. There was something familiar about this woman, I just couldn't see what...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yes...I suppose so. How long was I out, and why did that Lanirra woman drug me?\" I asked, looking at this woman's golden eyes. Golden eyes? No...it couldn't be...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You needed that, Stranger. You're no good to me tired and weakened, so the Shamaness treated you so you could regain your lost vitality. It was only for a few hours, don't worry.\" She gently took my hand, and we sat by the huge bed. She smiled. \"You must have lots of questions, hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, like, who are you?\" Her smile widened even more, and I saw her perfectly white teeth, also unusually sharp. There was an idea forming in my head about this woman's identity, but it was absurdly impossible for it to be true. She held up one to her mouth, giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we have already met, don't tell me you've already forgotten? Thoria brought you to me while I was enjoying lunch.\" My face was becoming paler and paler by the second. No way. Seeing my reaction, she held my hand tightly. \"It's me, the chieftain of this tribe, Alyssia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI let go of her hands and stumbled back, while she give a hearty laugh at my reaction. \"Oh, don't be such a drama queen, human. It's nothing a little sorcery and enchantments can't make. After all, it's why I summoned Lanirra's sister for, she's the enchantress here.\" Regaining my composure, I asked her why the sudden change from a 40foot tall, morbidly obese, orca woman to a small and thin human, just inches shorter than me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCocking her head sideways, she says...</span></div></div>",

I asked for all this to be done for you.\" gesturing to herself, for emphasis, Alyssia continued. \"Unless you think you can handle all of me in my true form, I mean, I don't mind either way.\" She gave me a wink and smiled. I just sat there, flabbergasted, for a few seconds before recovering and turning on the offensive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why? Why do you want to sleep with me? We've just met!\" my line of questioning didn't deter her, as the human-turned orca woman leaned closer to me, her sweet scent filling my nostrils, as she whispered in a lustful voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Why not? Come now, don't talk, just enjoy this.\" I couldn't back away from her, as Alyssia got closer to my face. Her perfume... suddenly I had a sense of dej\u00e1 v\u00fa, as it was clouding my mind, leaving me powerless to stop the woman from kissing me! We remained like that for a short while, lips interlocked in a passionate make-out session. Her soft moans were all I was hearing, and we parted for a quick breather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... Not bad...always wanted to kiss a male like that.\" she purred, smiling seductively. For my part, I just sat there with a goofy smile in face, before my consciousness slapped me in the head. No. No! I had to resist the urge, there was something I needed to know, needed to understand! But she smelled so nice...and her kisses were divine... On the inside, I was in turmoil, because part of me wanted to make sense of all this, while the other just wanted to go with the flow. She noticed this, and she leaned closer again, this time with a look of worry in her beautiful face. \"Is something wrong? You seem troubled.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I gonna do?!?\" was all I could think of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich will win, willpower or hormones?</span></div></div>",

The campsite sat at the very top of the hill and allowed for a very wide, long view of the forested valley below. As the sun started to set the valley was coated in a blanket of shadow, peppered with orange lights in the mountains from the villages at the foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah...\" Jennifer whispered in awe as she stepped onto the grass and basked in the sight. \"David, this is amazing! How'd you pick such a perfect spot here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, just a reflex several years in the making.\" He smirked confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, why not pick up some tent-raising reflexes on the way?!\" Valerie sneered as he started unzipping the tent bag, with Jennifer coming to carefully pull out the tarp. \"How long till the eclipse, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soon. <i>Very </i>soon.\" He described, looking at the sun and moon in the horizon. While the sun was a glowing orange orb in the sky the moon looked like a perfectly round, black ink spot. He could almost see the moon shifting through the sky, as though it were part of a clock ticking the time away. \"Get your boxes ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On it!\" Jennifer announced, holding up a cardboard box with a hole cut out for her head. Valerie lazily raised hers, still busy adjusting the tent. \"Gah, I hate the wilderness...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, come on, Valerie, lighten up!\" David chided. \"It's a solar eclipse! An eclipse on thirteen-fourteen-fifteen! This is a one in a billion event and we're in the front row!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meh, <i>every</i> moment's one in a billion...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you're no fun!\" Jennifer teased, giving her a playful jab in the arm before running up to join David. The moon looked only less a minute away, it's approach to the sun much more visible. \"Hurry, Valerie, it's starting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them stood with their backs facing the birthing eclipse with their heads covered by the boxes, aligning themselves so they could see the sun inside. At first all they could see was a white spot, but as the moon moved in the way the circle malformed until it shifted into the thin, glowing halo of the eclipse's corona. David smiled at the sight, and next to him he could hear Jennifer give an amazed \"ooooooh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then the eclipse seemed to dim, if ever so slightly. David took a step back to see if he was in a bad position, but nothing changed, because upon taking a closer look he could tell that the eclipse was changing color. It was turning to a pastel yellow and was slowly turning deeper, but rather than turn into a sun-like orange it tinted into a bright green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...is it just me, or is the eclipse turning green?\" Valerie asked, confirming that he wasn't seeing things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This can't be happening! Eclipses don't turn that kind of color!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it's some stuff going on in the atmosphere or sky?\" Jennifer offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut a thin needle of light rose from the top of the eclipse, another forming from the bottom that seemed to slowly stretch until it reached the ground. It almost looked like something out of a science fiction movie, something David'd never seen in all his years studying astrology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...guys?\" Jennifer began uneasily. \"I feel kinda funny.\" He could hear her drop the box on the grass, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jennifer? What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lifted the box to see Jennifer stepping forward, clutching her abdomen, but before he asked what was wrong he could see that her midsection looked much larger than before. In fact, her breasts looked to have grown much bigger than he'd last remembered, and even her thighs had filled up a lot more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut strangest of all, as he focused on her in the shade, he could see that she slowly, but visibly, fattening up on her own accord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What's happening to me?!\" She stammered fearfully, pressing her hands against her engorged stomach. But in a sudden flare in her gain her stomach surged out enough that it tore apart several buttons on her shirt and placed a sudden, tense strain on her belt till it snapped in half and allowing her gut hang over her blobby knees, her thighs swelling enough that they burst through the seams on her jeans. David and Valerie watched in stupefied shock as Jennifer continued to expand, but to add to the surreal image they could see strange patches of color start forming on her skin that grew into layers of...</span></div></div>",

Her clothes started to tear apart around her increasing girth and slid off her inflating body in tatters, her stomach in a few moments ballooning so big that it started to touch the grass in front of her. Tiny little pinpricks began to form on various places on her body that slowly began to sprout into feathers, longer ones spreading on her arms as though they were wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the icing on the cake plopped down as even while transforming and gaining weight at an unprecedented rate, Jennifer began to grow taller. Slowly, foot by foot she started to ascend as her body quickly swelled beneath her as though she were an inflating parade balloon. The feathers covered a majority of her body by the point she was seven feet tall, her stomach coated with white while the rest of her body was covered in brown that darkened as they reached the ends of her limbs. But as the last few shredded remains of her clothes were torn off, by some surreal chance her enormous breasts were held within a black bikini that managed to stretch along with her growth, the bottom relatively a thread as they travelled around her mountainous legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, as Jennifer loomed a few inches above ten feet, she let out a shrill squawk as her face was coated with beige feathers and her lips and nose melded together so they formed a small, dark black beak in between her swollen cheeks, but as engorged as her head was it looked like a small bump compared to the rest of her mammoth-sized body. Her legs were so horrendously swollen with fat that her rear end was over nine feet wide, able to crush a sofa into dozens of pieces. But what took the majority of her body was her gargantuan belly, which billowed out from her in a grandiose, almost spherical mass that crushed a large amount of the grass in front of her with her legs pressing in from behind, and her firm, colossal breasts laying on top. The only way she bore any semblance to their formerly human friend was her long brown hair, but even the it'd grown over twice its own length, almost to her new tail feathers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid and Valerie huddled in fear as Jennifer slowly regained her senses, and became more aware of her evolution. As she felt the feathers on her arms she ran her hands along her belly to assess its size, which was far too large for her to completely reach around and kept her hands several feet apart.</span></div></div>",

Beneath her black hair, he could see the sides of her head covered by a dark, tomato red with the tips of some black veins peeking out, and against his legs she felt as hot as she looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holland...<i>ghh...</i>\" Her body winced as she clutched her stomach in pain, yet was barely aware of where she was or what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll be arriving at the entrance to the city shortly!\" The driver announced, sitting two rows ahead of them. The other riders were dressed in metal armor, wielding wooden spears with metal tips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Holland could now see the dark opening to the cavern Cinder Island lay within, him and the five other guards tensing in apprehension at having to face the delegates. All of them were dead silent as the horses trotted in through the mouth of the cave, save for an occasional whimper from Gloria, whose soft voice whispered against the cold walls of the tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce all light had gone and they were riding through darkness, one of the drivers lit up a lantern, giving them a small spot of warmth to help them navigate. But even though it lit enough for them to see their way, they still couldn't see more than ten feet above them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey kept traveling in silence for several minutes through the shadows of the stone tunnels, watching within the meager distance ahead of them for anything in their path, but it was as they reached a clearing in the tunnel that a stray gust of air puffed the candle's light out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, they could still make out some light ahead of them. All of them finally began moving and apprehensively disbanded from the carriage, one of the men helping Holland at his side to pick up Gloria and cradle her with them. The chamber they walked into was absurdly large, probably a few hundred feet high and wide. Far in the distance they could make out torches lit on the walls, which gave vague silhouettes to monument-sized furnishings in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MY NAME IS ARLINGTON, FROM THE KINGDOM OF SANDYE!\" The head of their troupe called out. \"WE COME ON BEHALF OF THE ROYAL FAMILY ON MATTERS OF ROYAL INTEGRITY!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing. Just a wind howling by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OUR PRINCESS REQUIRES AID, AND WE NEED ASSISTANCE TO ENSURE MAINTAINED TIES!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed to do it. They could hear a heavy groaning followed by some sort of thunderous movement from elsewhere in the area, which tapered into very loud, paced footsteps that shook the ground beneath them in decent tremors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards nervously raised their spears while Holland and Gloria stood from behind, watching with fear. As the footsteps became louder and closer he could also hear whatever it was dragging something along the ground, and flinched as he saw some sort of mountainous black shape that had to be over a hundred feet tall lurching towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Everyone jumped in shock as a stream of white-hot fire sliced through the air and set ablaze a wooden chandalier hanging from the ceiling, hot enough that each of them reflexively backed away from the heat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the room lit, Holland gawked in astonishment and horror at the fire's source; a female dragon with thick black scales, her underbelly covered by dull gray armor traveling from the chin of her maw across the entire expanse of her astronomical midsection. Her body was fattened up <i>light years</i> beyond the threshold of 'morbidly obese', fat enough that he could see that the load she was dragging around was her own belly, which billowed out in front of her in a rounded mountain of flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nContrary to their filthy scraps she was dressed in a black T-shirt with the design blurred as it wrapped around her breasts, with her balloon-like thighs bound within a pair of khaki shorts. Two red horns sprouted from a head of straight black hair so long that it covered most of her back's width, wrapped around deep hills in the folds of her fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes were a red so bright it looked as though they were fueled by the fire she breathed, which haunted the travelers as she stared them down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...what have we here?\" She inquired in a hearty, yet young voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArlington recalled why he'd come in the first place and cleared his throat. \"I am Arlington of Sandye, and these are my cohorts. We ave a matter that requires your urgent aid!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My aid?\" She asked curiously. \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our princess has succumbed to Crimson fever, and she's not expected to live through the night at her condition! All our best medical tactics have no affect on her body, and <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Crimson fever?</i> She pondered. <i>...Ah, yes, one of those 'diseases' they get time to time...</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and by stability of governmental relations, we appease you for treatment to preserve the royal family's ties!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sneered at his appeal, spitting out a stray flame from the corner of her mouth. \"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...yeah, that's about it.\" He muttered, using up the last recited words he had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and what if I <i>don't?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't? Why wouldn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>An arrogant...this is gonna be fun.</i> \"Iunno, what if I don't feel like it? Maybe I got better stuff to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-But...we'll lose a vital link in our family tree! Our economy requires a successor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's in it for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If one economy goes, all will follow!\" His mind grabbed at any straw in reach as the tide turned against him. \"We won't accept such a reaction! If you don't help us, we'll take action!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Action?</i>\" She laughed scoffingly. \"Sorry, pal, but you're on your own. I don't know if you notice or not, but which one of us is 120 feet tall? Yup, that's me. Hell, I could call my pals over right now and stomp the living crap out of your little kingdom, and you know what? I'd <i>still</i> be having bacon the next morning. Don't think that just 'cause you've got a gold-plated toilet means you call shots on every damn inch of the planet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and for the record, I'd actually be more willing to give a rat's ass to help if you actually came here to <i>save her life</i> rather than keep your country pretty. So, yeah, way to help yourself out!\" She pointed to the cave which they'd entered with. \"Get out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OUT!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss dragon, <i>please!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards turned to look behind them and parted way as Holland walked past them, with Gloria cradled within his arms. \"Listen, I know that we're not in your jurisdiction. I know that you don't owe us a single favor. And I know that anything I beg for you would mean absolutely nothing to you, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and this appeals to me how?\" She snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, I beg of you for just one chance to help us out! Gloria lived her childhood with nothing but the hardwood floors, but in her time under royal rule had done absolutely nothing for herself and always strove to help out those in need! She'd done so much for the lives of so many people and always found happiness in the joy of others, but now...\" He looked down at her face, which was devoid of any of the spark of optimism she always lived with. \"Anything it takes, I promise I'll do <i>anything</i> to repay you! Whatever task you could lay down for me, as insignificant or even implausible as it could get, I'll attempt and follow through with even if it kills me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" The dragoness tapped her chin with one of her claws. <i>Damn...that was the corniest thing I'd ever heard.</i> But even if he was the size of an ant to her, she still had to admit she did sense a tangible love and dedication to his voice. <i>...eh, why not?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys go.\" She pointed the guards to the exit, but they didn't immediately react. \"COME ON, ENDELE!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards flinched and started to bustle out, while Holland slowly sunk to his knees in despair. \"...but not you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? But...\" A glimmer of hope shimmered in his eyes. \"You'll help her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness reached to the ceiling and plucked a torn from a branch hugging the stone above them, and flicked it down so it lawn-darted into the ground only a few feet from him. \"That's a thorn from the cinderberry bush.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cinderberry brush? Will it cure her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By default. It'll turn her into a dragon like me, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TURN HER INTO A DRAGON?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...But! As the venom enters her body it'll immediately cure her ability to get sick or injured, so in a few seconds she'll be up and running.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's so drastic! Isn't there some other way?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whelp, you asked for my help and this is the best you got. Whaddya say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" Holland's body felt numb, drooping as he took in the dragoness' offer. Looking down at the thorn, he reached down and pulled it out of the ground, observing the pink liquid oozing from the tip. \"No other way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deal struck him like a cannonball. On one hand he was fearing they'd live empty-handed, but one the other <i>some</i>thing didn't meet <i>the</i> thing. But then again, he knew Gloria, who never strove solely for royal lifestyles, and also the times he'd alway spent at her side, promising to stay there for her. \"...alright. I'll do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and as for repayment, you will thus live under her possession.\" She added. \"The full transformation shall take about a week, but by the end of a day or two she'll have completely shed her humanity and become a full-on dragon, save for the complete size. As such, she'll live here with you her property, and whether she treats you as an equal, pet, slave, or even snack is up to her. Deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...yeah, deal.\" He sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alrighty. Just jab her with it, and we're good to go.\"</span></div></div>",

The purple liquid drippind from the hollow tip looked like acid to him, But then he looked back at Gloria; at the seething pain she was filled with as the virus spiderwebbed through her body, which hurt him more than the sight of the throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing reluctantly, his fingers wrapped around the thorn as his hand tensed into a fist and slowly lifted it above, forming a mental path from the tip of the thorn into her chest. The dragoness watched curiously as he hesitated for a decent amount of time, occasionaly twitching his arm in a few muttered attempts to muster the courage to inject her. But finally, in one swift motion, he thrust the thorn downwards and straight into her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>WHAP!!!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria's eyes shot open as she sucked in a long breath, which ran back out in a horrified scream that made Holland leap back in terror as she scrambled away and hit her back into a rock, the thorn still embedded within her chest as she slid back onto the ground. Her breathing was coarse and heavy as she slowly got her bearings back on her surroundings, but Holland could still see the grip of the virus slowly vanish and leave behind her healthy, unblemished, appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe weakly lifted her hand and grasped the thorn, slowly drawing it back from her heart, but the bleeding hole it'd left slowly shrunk until her skin had completely healed over it, leaving behind only a few drops of blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Gloria?\" Holland asked carefully. \"Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ggh...Holland?\" Gloria began to look about the wide cavern around them, unsure of where they were. \"...What just happened?

It might be shocking to you, but I promise that I did it to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-W-W-What's going on?\" Gloria stammered fearfully. \"Holland, are we in <i>Cinder Island?!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gloria, our doctors had no means of treating you due to your anaphylaxis, so our last resort was coming here to request assistance from the dragons, and...\" Holland could feel his words tumbling down the steps as he came closer to the moment of truth. \"...the nobles failed to gain any sympathy from her, but she'd managed to trust me enough to let me perform a...well, <i>procedure</i> on you that would save your life, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Holland?

After all, she couldn't argue against somebody who tried to save her life and succeeded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, uh...Gloria?\" The dragon spoke. \"I know it's a lot to take in right now, and you probably don't wanna hear it from me, but I promise that bein' a dragon's something you'll get used to.\" She promised. \"If you need somebody to take it out on, you can take it out on me, but I can also show you around if you want. Teach you a thing or two about the change, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria turned her head away so she looked at neither of them, mulling over what she'd heard. \"There was no other way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a deep breath, letting it back out in a tired sigh. \"...thank you, Holland.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry, Gloria.\" Holland said honestly as he laid a hand on her shoulder. \"I truly am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whelp, I think it's time for square one.\" The dragoness laboriously turned her mountainous bulk around, stomping toward a passage deeper into the cavern. \"C'mon, I'll give you your training wheels!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria kept a glare on Holland as she pushed herself onto her feet, but with some more strain then usual. As she stood back up Holland could see that her breasts had a bit more perk to them than before, and underneath her dress he could see a soft roundness that her dress gripped against, while her hips puffed out further with a chubby paunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't help but watch in place as he watched her newfound pudge jiggle as she waddled away, but when she glanced back at him he snapped back and ran to follow them, the three venturing into the dark recesses of the dragon city...</span></div></div>",

In the kingdom of the Blue Fan, Crimson Fever was running rampant, only in Paragon City, the epidemic had led to a massive burst in crime. People had gone mad from the disaster and had resorted to stealing food, money and medicine just to stay alive. Panic was griping the city and the rest of the kingdom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that was the least of the problems for the kingdom of the Blue Fan. The kingdom was actually an offshoot of the Dark Hand kingdom that had been responsible for releasing the crimson fever in the first place. Exactly three centuries ago, the Blue Fan broke away from the Dark Hand to escape from their cruelty and vice. However, the Dark Hand had not forgotten and they sought to take the land that the people of the Blue Fan had obtained since they broke away. The Dark Hand\u2019s leader, the cruel and vindictive King Hoi had enlisted the help of a dark wizard to create and spread the Red Plague into the Blue Fan Kingdom. At that moment, the evil king was watching as his enemy kingdom was affected by the plague and the wizard walked up to him. \u201cIt would appear that the Red Plague has spread to the west, my King,\u201d said the red wizard. \u201cI fear that many far lands will be effected by the disease.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the king turned to face the wizard and frightened him. \u201cWhy should I care? As soon as the Blue Fan Kingdom is back under the Dark Hand\u2019s control, where do you think we\u2019re going next?\u201d Then the king grabbed the wizard by the throat and begun to choke him. \u201cThink about it, the king of the Blue Fan kingdom is dead. All that leaves is Princess Seiryuu and there\u2019s no way that she can stop the plague. Just sit back and watch as those traitors come crawling back to the Dark Hand kingdom.\u201d King Hoi let out a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the kingdom of the Blue Fan, Princess Seiryuu was conducting a strange ritual in front of an idol of some sort and lit several candles. \u201cPrincess Seiryuu,\u201d said the vizier. \u201cI understand that times are bleak, but this sounds very desperate.\u201d But the princess was not going to be discouraged. \u201cYuya,\u201d she said to the vizier. \u201cMagic created this plague and divine magic should drive it away. I am going to seek the ancestors\u2019 help and end this plague. We are not the only ones suffering. The kingdoms to the west are being unjustly punished by the Red Plague because of King Hoi\u2019s cruelty and greed. I will do all I can to stop the plague.\u201d Yuya nodded his head and stepped back as his Princess Seiryuu was casting a spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess chanted in an indecipherable language as she cast her spell and the idol glowed before cracking to pieces and revealing a light blue-colored spirit with a disfigured looking eye. Yuya stepped back in fear as the spirit stepped up to Princess Seiryuu. \u201c I am Zuu, first kind of the Blue Fan Kingdom. I have heard your pleas for help and have seen the evil committed by the Dark Hand king upon your kingdom. Hoi\u2019s Red Plague is truly odious, but I know of a way to cure the plague from your land and put an end to Hoi\u2019s evil once and for all.\u201d Princess Seiryuu just stared at Zuu. \u201cI am willing to do anything to save my kingdom. Even as we speak, the illness and death from the Red Plague has driven my people mad. They\u2019ve resorted to the very wicked acts that were the reason why the Blue Fan separated from the Dark Hand.\u201d Zuu nodded his head before speaking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a way to end the plague, but it requires a sacrifice.\u201d Seiryuu nodded her head. \u201cI will willingly sacrifice my life for the good of the Blue Fan.\u201d Zuu just shook his head. \u201cNot your life, your body.\u201d Seiryuu looked in confusion. \u201cMy body?\u201d she asked. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d \u201cThe rising of a great beast will make the plague vanish from the land, but the great beast needs a human mind, your mind, Princess. Will you allow your body to be traded for the beast?\u201d \u201cThe ghost is speaking in riddles, Princess,\u201d said Yuya. \u201cDon\u2019t you listen to him. This is madness.\u201d Seiryuu however, didn\u2019t seem to think so. It can\u2019t be any worse than the madness that plagues our kingdom, Yuya. Zuu, I am ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZuu nodded his head and that\u2019s when blue fire enveloped Princess Seiryuu and she rose into the air in a trance as her eyes glowed bright blue. Yuya stepped back as Seiryuu\u2019s body begun to change. She appeared to be getting bigger and her dress was coming apart because she also appeared to be getting somewhat obese as bright glowing blue scales appeared on her body. Her neck and body elongated into a long pear shape as her hips expanded to be as wide as tree trunks and the princess\u2019s face transformed into a long snout as she sprouted glowing silver antlers and golden scales decorated her body as her breasts swelled to the size of watermelons. The princess\u2019s hair turned bright white and stretched to her large behind as Yuya look up in fear. Seiryuu then sprouted a long tail and a small red fin running from her neck down to her tail. Finally, her teeth became sharp as her fingernails and toenails turned into sharp claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the transformation ended, the princess of the Blue Fan kingdom was a 200ft tall Chinese dragon with a 250ft wide stomach and rear and huge H-cup breasts. Yuya looked in fear before Zuu disappeared, his job complete. Seiryuu looked at her new form and breathed fire up into the air as light radiated from her scales. She knew that the Red Plague would soon be over. \u201cHoi,\u201d said Seiryuu. \u201cOnce the plague is over, I\u2019m coming for you.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the Kingdom of Salmonia a curse had struck the land. The curse was called the Scarlet Curse or as most people call it, the Crimson Plague. Our story begins with a carriage on a mountain road. Inside the carriage King Hercules Baronheart was leaning against his maid due to contracting the Crimson Plague. Symptoms of the plague include unusually high fevers followed by chills, red skin, and a dry mouth. Now King Hercules wasn't a man who would easily get sick. Being a young man in his 20s and standing at seven feet tall with huge muscles is a testament to his rigorous training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much farther until we reach the dragon warlock's lair?\" The maid asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It shouldn't be much longer Evelyn. We should be there momentarily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvelyn sighed as King Hercules's head was resting against her bosom. Evelyn was tall for a woman, standing at 6'2\". She had blonde hair and blue eyes. She stroked her king's black hair. Normally Evelyn would freak out if a guy even dared to touch her bosom, but with King Hercules Baronheart rendered unconscious due to the Crimson Plague she was more concerned about his health. Little did anyone know that she was secretly smitten with Hercules. Ever since they were children she always liked Herc. But as she grew older she began to develop feelings for him, unfortunately he was to wed a queen from another kingdom to help build political and economical ties. Herc wasn't fond of the idea, but he had no say in the matter. It had always been family tradition to plan out who the future king or queen marries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Evelyn finished reminiscing the carriage had stopped by a cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here. Someone help the king out of the carriage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour guards carefully hoist their king on their shoulders. Evelyn followed King Hercules to the cave. The cave was dark and damp. Stalagmites and stalactites were all over the sides of the cave except for the cave's center. Evelyn and the guards stood at the center. After waiting for a few minutes a loud thud could be heard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but don't lose your grip on the king! We want to cure him, not kill him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the guards were arguing the thuds got louder. Out of the shadows a large figure appeared. It's belly was dragging on the ground and it's massive legs caused the room to shake. The figure let's out a spark of fire. The guards carrying King Hercules step back. The figure was a massive red dragon. The dragon stood at 350 ft and was almost as wide as he was tall, with his belly being the largest thing on him. His horns rested on his head and he evevn had a horn that resembled facial hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you the dragon warlock?\" Evelyn asked the massive dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I indeed am the dragon warlock. State your purpose for disturbing my slumber!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you can see our king has fallen ill and we need your help.\" One of the guards responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you need my help? Can't your sorcerers and alchemists come up with a cure? Are you really that shallow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've tried everything and his condition is not improving. We have heard legends of your magic and how it does wonders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you expect me to be a miracle worker. Do you not know that magic always has a price?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen bub, our king has to prepare for his wedding to Queen Natalia Smerch. Without this marriage our kingdom will be doomed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's how you're playing it. You just care about being in your king's favor. Forget about about it. If I felt like it I could send my buddies to wipe out your kingdom. Unlike your race, dragons live thousands of years. If you're unwilling to show some humility and respect you can show yourselves the way out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvelyn just shook her head at how incompetent the guards were being. It wasn't a secret that the last queen had spoiled them by lining their pockets, but at this rate Hercules will die!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please great and powerful warlock! Please help our king! I beg you! Don't let him die!\" Evelyn sobbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Looks like someone knows how to be humble. Humans just think they are entitled to whatever claim their family name offers. It's such a sick way of thinking.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should I reconsider and help your king, maidservant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our king is a kind and noble man. He helps the poor and even offers opportunities for one to improve their social standing. When we were young he took me off of the streets and provided me food and shelter. I am forever in his debt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, I shall heal your king. Only the maidservant gets to watch. All others must leave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards place King Hercules by the dragon warlock's feet before they exit the cave. Once the guards left the dragon explains the price it would cost to cure King Hercules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only way to cure your king is to have him drink my blood. By doing so he'll be cured of the Crimson Plague, but after a day or two he'll start transforming into a dragon. The transformation should be complete in a week or two, save for his size. As his maidservant you're already bound to serve your king until you die. Are you willing to accept this price?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good. Then we can proceed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon warlock uses his magic to summon a golden chalice. He places the chalice near his belly. He then uses one of his claws to puncture his belly. The dragon warlock's blood fill the chalice. Once the chalice is filled the self-inflicted puncture would is miraculously healed. Evelyn hoists Hercules into a sitting position. She then grabs the chalice and puts it to his lips. After downing the dragon warlock's blood King Hercules recovers from the Crimson Plague. His green eyes shoot open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we Evelyn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvelyn responds by passionately hugging Hercules with tears running down her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are now cured! Now go King of Salmonia!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHercules and Evelyn exit the dragon warlock's lair and make their way back to the castle. On the way back Evelyn whispers everything that happened while Hercules was unconscious. Hercules nodded in understanding, knowing full well that his fate is irreverasble, but learning how to shapeshift may help him once his transformation has been complete.</span></div></div>",

The most I remember is that I was watching TV right before it all began, and that Linda had gone out for groceries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat started it all for me was a knock on the door, and I got up from the couch expecting it to be Linda, probably needing help with the bags. However, upon opening the front door, I was met with anything but my slender wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a woman clad in a tight brown delivery outfit, her eyes a bright green and her hair a silky brown. What stood out about her, however, was her size. She stood at least 6'4\", but most of all was incredibly fat. Probably 400 pounds, her sit still leaving a part of her belly exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mornin', mister! How're you farin', today?\" She greeted in a minnesotan accent, breaking me out of my stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh\u2026uh, fine!\" I stammered. \"Sorry, I just wasn't expecting anybody today\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a problem, sir!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\u2026so, is this a delivery? I dunno if my girlfriend ordered anything, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this isn't a delivery! I'm just givin' out free samples.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, free samples? Of what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sizemore Chocolates!\" She replied in a boastful tone, stepping aside for a box sitting behind her. \"Wouldja be interested in a box?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chocolates? Huh\u2026\" I wasn't much of a chocolate person, but I knew Linda was. \"This isn't gonna cost me anything, is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, free samples!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\u2026eh, why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, thanks a bunch, sir!\" She lifted the box from the ground and held it out for me. \"Hope you enjoy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, thanks!\" I replied as I claimed the box. It sounded like it was filled with candy bars, but I had no idea the true potential of what lay inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but before I go\u2026\" She pulled out a slip of paper from her breast pocket, which she stuck on the box's lid. \"That's a subscription form for out chocolate of the week system. Just in case yer wantin' more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, again, thanks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No prob. See ya 'round!\" With that, she waddled off down the walkway. I didn't really see her off as I walked back inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting the box on the dining room table, I flipped open the lid, curious as to what lay inside. Sure enough, dozens of wrapped candy bars sat inside, far more than anything I'd consider a free sample.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took one out to examine it. It was wrapped in a purple cover on aluminum foil, but what caught my interest (and suspicion) was that there was no nutritional facts. There was an ingredient list, but the only thing listed was \"Damn good chocolate\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cocked my eyebrow, curious as to what catch there might be to the treat...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was a pretty slim girl with not much bounce, but nonetheless had nice blue eyes along with messy, short black hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Linda, how was the store?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, nothing new.

But for whatever reason\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, go right ahead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI left her to the chocolate and headed into the kitchen to sort out the rest of her groceries, but paused as she let out a \"WOAH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's just\u2026this is <i>good!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it contains 'damn good chocolate', as it says.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say! Mind getting the rest of the groceries for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I'm on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went back to work and put the groceries away for her, ignorant to whatever she was doing in there. Once I was done, I headed back into the living room to watch TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spent about five minutes alone in the living room. As I watched TV, it slowly dawned on me that not once since I'd left Linda alone that I didn't hear her move about at all, just standing in the dining room alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Linda, you alright in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MM-HMM!!!\" She exclaimed, as though her mouth was full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, then\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother two minutes had passed, which to me felt longer as I kept a close ear on Linda. Sure enough, I didn't hear her take another step. Curious as to what was preoccupying her, I finally left the couch and headed back to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright in there, honey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I just\u2026<i>mmf</i>\u2026I just said I was fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What're you doing in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just having some chocolate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, Linda was seated at the table and eating a chocolate bar, but to my surprise at least ten wrappers lay on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez\u2026how much you'd eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Iunno\u2026a few.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, wanna watch the game with me in the living room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, be there in a sec\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted the box off the table and (with a bit more effort than usual) pushed herself from the chair. She walked into the kitchen with the box under her arm, but I had to take a second look at her as she stood tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer clothes seemed a bit tighter than usual, but more so her stomach seemed a bit rounder and jutted out further. Her arms and legs had thickened out as well, and her breast and hips seemed somewhat more prominent. It looked as though she's gained several pounds (hell, if not several <i>ten!</i>) since I'd left her alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought I was just seeing things, but up close I noticed that she was taller, as well. She was always shorter than me by a few inches, but as of now we were equalized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alight, sweetie?\" She asked as she took another bite from a bar.</span></div></div>",

Whatever nude bits she once had were concealed as black, plastic-like skin began covering her globular body, from which soft fur began to grow. Terry couldn't bend her head forward to see her enormous self, but could only lift her arms to see that her fingers were fusing to three fat digits as their skin turned to the same black as her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Terry was overwhelmed by an onslaught of sensations and emotions covering her entire body and slowly sat herself down as she clutched at her head, slowly fading from consciousness as her body began adapting to its new species\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\u2026..</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerry was obviously silent as her eyes slowly flittered open, the world slowly coming into view. To slow; almost pixelated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted her arm to scratch her hand, but pulled it away when she felt fur on her head, alone with some other appendage. Her arm looked massive; well over a foot at the biceps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough her senses were coming back, her eyesight still seemed splotchy, yet somewhat clear. Al she could feel was her immensely fat body, her belly a huge fat that pushed her tree-trunk sized legs apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an imaginary groan, she braced herself on the ground and slowly, with considerable labor, stood herself up, now eight feet tall. Lifting one leg forward, she began to heaved her gargantuan bulk forward with surprising strength, but paused as she felt something dragging behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned her head to see that a massive thorax sprouted from behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanicked, she lifted herself several more steps towards porch, ducking as she trudged through the wide screen doors to the living room. Various items in the room shook or broke on the floor as she thundered into the room towards the bathroom, which she could only lean towards and peek her head through to see the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny activity she once expressed vanished as she saw herself, staring in pure shock as she realized what creature she had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her skin had sprouted yellow fur all over her body as yellow-orange tufts appeared all over the back of her neck, forming a high and royal looking collar. Terry gasped. \"Oh no,\" she said. \"Oh no! Oh no! Oh! BZZZZZZZZZ.\" Terry's speech had quickly turned into buzzing as yellow and black stripes appeared on her large thorax that bulged out to be twice as wide as she was and just as long. Terry looked down and heard a ripping noise. What was left of her shirt had been completely destroyed as she sprouted two extra arms. She gasped as she wiggled all twelve of her fingers. As Terry was waddling around in a panic, she stepped on and smashed her coffee table and even screamed. \"<span class=\"cbyellow\">What is happening to me</span>?\" thought Terry to herself. \"<span class=\"cbyellow\">I'm turning into a giant bee</span>!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Terry waddled her obese form, she sprouted a pair of transparent wings on her back that looked big enough to allow even a big fatso like her to fly. Terry let out a buzzing scream as she felt her puffed up cheeks. Her hair extended and turned a golden brown color just like honey as her stomach bulged out more. \"<span class=\"cbyellow\">This has got to be a dream</span>,\" thought Terry as she was getting bigger and bigger and her giant stinger pushed away a wall in her house. \"<span class=\"cbyellow\">That's it, this is just a bad dream. I hope</span>.\" The bee girl grunted as her head burst through her ceiling. Terry looked around to see that she had outgrown her own house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe queen-sized queen bee was now 40ft high with a 60ft wide thorax that was 40ft long as well as a 40ft wide belly, thunderous thighs that each had to be 20ft thick, D-cup breasts, three flabby arms with twelve sausage-like fingers and a prominent triple chin. Terry felt around her body and was horrified at what she had become. \"<span class=\"cbyellow\">This isn't a dream! This is a living nightmare! Look at me, I'm as big as a house.</span>\" Terry then spotted the strange plant that mutated her in the first place and gave an angry buzz. \"<span class=\"cbyellow\">Evil flower! This is all your fault! Take this</span>!\" Terry gave an angry buzz and then stomped the flower into oblivion. She buzzed a few times and smiled briefly, but she realized she was still a giant bee. The world didn't take too kindly to bees that were the size of skyscrapers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as Terry was wondering what to do, she heard a loud, loud buzzing and looked all around to see a swarm of bees that resembled a maelstrom. None of the other bees were giant. They were millions of tiny normal sized bees that had took note of the former human turned bee who was ten-thousands of times bigger than them and from the looks of it, they had taken Terry as their queen. Before Terry could make heads or tails of the situation, a group of bees took the remains of the mutant flower and shaped them into a crown that was just big enough to fit on Terry's huge fat head. Terry could not believe it. This morning she was a gardener but now she was a literal queen bee. She actually smiled. \"<span class=\"cbyellow\">This might not be so bad. Alright, my tiny subjects. If you insist, I will be your new queen bee, and for my first decree, I order you to....</span>\"</span></div></div>",

They kept working around the girth of her thorax to construct a backboard cushioned with all kinds of blankets and fabrics from inside the house, leaving her seated in a crude throne for a queen bee her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cbyellow\">Wow... this is nice!</span></i> She laid her arms on the armrests just as they were fastened on, leaning back with a comforted buzz. <i><span class=\"cbyellow\">I could get used to this!</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut a loud hum of thousands of bumblebees buzzed through the forest as the other bees returned whilst gathered in strong platforms. Upon their backs were tall mountains of food that they dispersed to drop around her, surrounded by piles of food reaching her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cbyellow\">Wow, that'll do nicely!</span></i> She smiled excitedly as she reached to chow down from the pile, but the bees pushed her arm back down so they could carry five watermelons from the top instead, and fluttered them in front of her face. Surprised, yet flattered, she opened her maw wide and let the bees dump their bounty in, large enough that they barely filled her entire mouth. She chopped into the melons only once to fill her mouth with juice, which overwhelmed her insectoid tastebuds with a delightfully sweet wave of flavor, and she swallowed them whole while happily licking her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cbyellow\">More, please!</span></i> She opened her mouth to invite herself to be fed, and the bees paid no haste as they began picking from the piles and lining up before their queen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">.....</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bzzz...\" Terry purred as the bees fed her the last of her feast, her face now crowded by another two chins and puffier cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that was left was a few stray rinds littering the grass around her, and her transformation was quick to absorb her gluttonous behavior. Now she was forty feet tall whilst <i>seated</i>, and her stomach had bloated outward a dozen more in a long, blobby heap, tiered into two mounds of fat bordered by a deep crease wrapping her circumference and traveling through her naval. At either side of her mountainous gut, her legs had fattened into black, luscious hills of fat beneath tough skin, with her midlegs resting atop, only slightly smaller than her wide booty's limbs. However, her body's growth was far overshadowed by her newfound thorax, which now took up over half her height and stretched to cover an area of land that could fit a house and yard. Her throne had long been torn apart by its girth, but she paid no heed as her personal army rushed to replace it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScratching the side of her belly, she thought with a wry smile as she pondered her next command, the humming buzz of her new servants filling her hearing...</span></div></div>",

Terry grunted because the bees appeared to be trying to hold up their ginormous and obese queen. However, the queen bee let out a yell. \u201c<span class=\"cbyellow\">Would you knock that off! I can fly perfectly well by myself. But I do zzzzuppose that a giant bee like me would attract zzzzuzzzpizzzcion. I inzzzztruct you, my zzzzzzubjects to azzzzemble a new hive out in the woodzzzzz zzzzzomewhere while I get uzzzzed to my new body</span>.\u201d The bees nodded their heads and then flew off to do their queen\u2019s bidding as Terry flew into the air and spread out all four of her arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cbyellow\">Thizzzz izzz kind of fun</span>.\u201d \u2028\u2028Of course, Terry realized that she was buzzing in her speech. \u201c<span class=\"cbyellow\">Oh dear</span>,\u201d thought the queen bee to herself. \u201c<span class=\"cbyellow\">I\u2019m even buzzing to myzzzzelf. Oops. I wonder if the mind really izzzz a plaything of the body.\u201d Then Terry let out a slight belch. \u201cUgh. That was a big meal. I wonder how much bigger I am</span>.\u201d Terry saw a nearby river and went to look at her reflection over the water just as she hovering. From the looks of it, She was now 90ft tall. Her thighs were now 40ft thick and her thorax was 85ft wide with a 75ft wide belly and four large chins as she saw her reddish brown hair flowing in the wind in her reflection. She truly was a queen bee; a queen bee as big as King Kong. As Terry flew down she heard a breaking sound and saw that her large thorax and stinger had pushed down and destroyed a few trees, prompting the queen of the bees to blush in embarrassment. \u201c<span class=\"cbyellow\">Oh my</span>.\u201d Terry even grabbed her stomach and held it up. She put her fingers through her thick fur to see that each strange was as thick as a small tree trunk. \u201c<span class=\"cbyellow\">I guezzzz I can forget about ever zzzzzzhaving my legs ever again</span>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bee giantess then flew up into the air again and flew by a mountain that looked like a molehill to her. She noticed that it was covered in flowers and then sniffed it before beginning to drool slightly as she was buzzing. \u201c<span class=\"cbyellow\">Nectar</span>,\u201d she thought to herself. \u201c<span class=\"cbyellow\">Zzzzuch zzzzweet nectar</span>.\u201d The queen bee inhaled and sucked hundreds of nectar filled flowers into her huge mouth. Terry just kept on buzzing as she devoured the flowers in the process, all the pollen came out and covered her massive furry insect body. \u201c<span class=\"cbyellow\">I can\u2019t believe this appetite.I juzzzzt ate. Izzzz thizzzz becauzzzze of my new bee biology? I really hope those other beezzzzz don\u2019t expect me to lay a hundred eggs no matter how big I am</span>.\u201d Terry then let out a slight hiccup and buzzed in embarrassment. \"<span class=\"cbyellow\">I wonder how the bees are doing with the new hive</span>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that time millions of bees were all but tearing apart trees and logs and building honeycombs as they put together a rather large hive in the side of a mountain. They knew that with such a titanic queen they needed the biggest high imaginable. They then picked up a few rocks and even found a deer skeleton in order to build support beams for such a giant hive. Nearby there was a young male entomologist observing the bees. \"This is incredible,\" he said. \"Bees are certainly the busiest and most unified creatures in the animal kingdom. However, this is a whole new level. The bees appear to be dismantling the forest to build a beehive that puts skyscrapers to shame. There appears to be more bees at the high than average. There must be some reason for such abnormal behavior.\" The entomologist then saw several of the bees also appeared to be gathering more fruits and vegetables and raised an eye at the apparently sudden new appetite of the small yellow insects. \"There is definitely nothing natural about this situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Terry had decided to advance on foot as people would've no doubt seen a giant obese queen bee if she kept flying through the air and that would no doubt attract more trouble. With every step, her stomach rippled and she rubbed it with all four of her enormous pudgy arms. The giant queen bee then picked up a large tree and begun to eat it as if it was a stick of cotton candy before she decided to chew on the naked trunk, reducing it to a toothpick right before she let out a world shattering belch. The queen bee looked out and saw that her subjects were surrounding around the mountain to build the hive. \"<span class=\"cbyellow\">Holy cow</span>,\" thought the queen of bees to herself. \"<span class=\"cbyellow\">That'zzz the biggest beehive I've ever zzzzzzeen. It lookzzzzz more like a palace. That hive lookzzzzz too good for a mere bee like me. But then again, at thizzzzzz zzzzzizzzze, I am no mere bee.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerry laughed to herself when she suddenly had another thought and had a sinister grin on her face. \"<span class=\"cbyellow\">On zzzzzecond thought. Perhapzzzz I could be more than a queen bee. At this zzzzzizzze, I could rule over the humanzzzzz. Maybe once I've gotten better uzzzzzzed to thizzzzz new body, I'll conquer the world</span>.\" Terrry then let out a laugh to herself although even she wasn't sure if she was just joking or if she actually did aspire for world domination. Terry then saw her reflection in another nearby lake and then she smirked as she adjusted her reddish brown hair into a beehive style. \"<span class=\"cbyellow\">There</span>,\" thought Terry with a laugh. \"<span class=\"cbyellow\">Now that'zzzz a hairdo that zzzzzimply zzzzpellzzzz, Queen Bee</span>.\" But then, Terry saw something that caught her attention and made her drop her jaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the ground there was a large sea of black wash over, but it wasn't a stream of oil. From the looks of it, it was millions of tiny ants that were as tiny and numerous as Terry's own bee subjects. \"<span class=\"cbyellow\">That'zzz odd. I wonder where all thozzzze antzzzz are marching</span>.\" Terry stomped forward and followed the ants, she was curious as to what they were doing and even more curious as to why they didn't seem to be paying attention to the humongous and obese queen bee giantess following them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerry then looked forward and her eyes popped out of her head because she saw that the ants appeared to be constructing a dwelling of their own and it appeared to be one who's size was more than capable of rivaling her own beehive. It was a giant anthill that was as big as a volcano with millions of ants gathering around. \"<span class=\"cbyellow\">What the hell</span>?\" thought the bee giantess who appeared to be extremely jealous with how big the anthill was. \"<span class=\"cbyellow\">I hope for the zzzzake of those antzzz that that anthill isn't bigger than my hive. Don't they know I am the queen</span>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there was more stomping and Terry was even more confused than ever. \"<span class=\"cbyellow\">Where izzzzz that zzzzztomping coming from</span>?\" asked the giantess bee to herself. \"<span class=\"cbyellow\">I'm not moving an inch</span>.\" Then Terry heard a deep and dry but still feminine voice. \"<span class=\"cnavy\">What are you doing in my kingdom</span>?\" asked the voice. Apparently the voice was coming from a creature that could speak telepathically to insects just like Terry could. \"<span class=\"cbyellow\"><i>Your</i> Kingdom</span>?\" asked a rather angry Terry. \"<span class=\"cbyellow\">Let me tell you zzzzz....</span>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Terry could even say another word, her jaw dropped because now she was looking at another giantess who was an obese insect like her. From the looks of it, the giantess was a giant black-skinned ant woman with lock bluish black hair and a slight beauty mark on the first of her four chins. Just as Terry had four three-fingered arms, this ant giantess had four legs and two three-fingered arms. The ant woman was 90ft tall just like Terry with 50ft wide thunder thighs a 100ft wide thorax and 60ft wide belly. Like Terry she also had H-Cup breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerry could not believe it but then she saw that wrapped around one of the ant giantess's legs was a flower just like the flower that mutated her into a giant bee. This ant woman was a mutated human like her and the ant woman was staring at her. Terry didn't know what to expect from the ant giantess and what the ant thought of a giant bee woman in her territory.</span></div></div>",

She even let out a hiss as her body turned pale green with black and yellow stripes. She then felt her thorax turn into segments as each segment sprouted thighs and legs as thigh as tree trunks. Terry then felt her face becoming more chubby as she swelled all the way to 10-ft tall and from her weight, had she been half her height, she wound weigh 2000lbs. The girl then yelled as she spewed white silk from her nostrils and then sucked them back into her nose. By the time the transformation was over, Terry was a 12ft tall, 20ft long and five ton caterpillar, specifically, the caterpillar of a swallowtail butterfly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerry looked at the mirror and saw that she now had six arms that she used to feel all around her newly obese body. She even felt her breasts that were the size of watermelons. The caterpillar woman turned around and shook her 6ft wide booty in front of the mirror. \u201cOh my gosh,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat was in that flower? It turned me into a caterpillar.\u201d But then Terry gasped. \u201cWait,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cThis is actually a very, very, very good thing.\u201d Terry let out a squee as her obese body was shaking. She wiggled her body and giggled. \u201cBig fat caterpillars turn into big beautiful butterflies. This is good, if I continue to be a caterpillar, I\u2019ll be a butterfly before I know it. A rather big butterfly, but I\u2019ll be gorgeous. It will be as if I\u2019ve turned into a fairy. Terry giggled but then the obese caterpillar girl realized something. \u201cBut wait,\u201d she said. \u201cCaterpillars need to eat a lot of food to have the strength to become butterflies. Well, I am one very hungry caterpillar. One VERY hungry caterpillar who is going to become a beautiful butterfly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting no time, Terry immediately rushed to the fridge and started to eat everything in it. She ate three entire watermelons, rinds and all before spewing the seeds out the window like a gatling gun. She guzzled three entire cartons of milk and then swallowed an entire turkey in one gulp. She saw a chocolate cake and some gelatin that had been in the fridge for a while and then shoved both of them into her chubby cheeks with one greedy gulp before she guzzled two bottles of soda and let out a belch. Her stomach was bulging and she rubbed it. Then she heard her stomach rumbling. \u201cYou greedy thing,\u201d said the caterpillar woman rather teasingly. \u201cI know where there\u2019s more to eat.\u201d Terry then moved onto her garden where she proceeded to eat every plant that wasn\u2019t moving away. She sucked up creeper vines as if they were spaghetti and then chewed up dandelions in a salad before she greedily gobbled all of the grass. She was sorry to see her garden being destroyed, but she could always revive it once she became a butterfly like she hoped. Then she came upon the mutant plant that turned her into a giant caterpillar in the first place and licked her lips. \u201cI have you to thank for the fact that I\u2019m going to be a butterfly soon, but now I have to eat you, little plant. Bottoms up.\u201d Terry ate the entire plant in one ginormous gulp and then let out a belch. She looked and saw she had gotten bigger. She was now 15ft tall and doubled in weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerry let out a giggle. \u201cIt looks like I\u2019m going to become a big beautiful butterfly woman real soon.\u201d However, Terry\u2019s stomach then begun to gurgle. \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d she asked. \u201cAre you still hungry? Terry let out a sigh, but she knew that such boundless and greedy hunger was inevitable. The caterpillar woman retreated back inside, crushing her couch beneath her as she was ordering pizza. \u201cNo, you heard that right, 25 pepperoni pizzas with mushrooms, extra goat cheese and anchovies.

But hey, 1) I couldn\u2019t fit into any car at this size and 2) once I\u2019m a butterfly. I\u2019ll have no more use for a car.\u201d Terry let out a laugh. Her metamorphosis was going to take some extra food, but she knew that in the end, once she was a beautiful butterfly, she\u2019d be worth it. \u2028\u2028Suddenly there\u2019s a knock on the door and Terry waddles up to answer it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(Note: the garden idea isn\u2019t a bad idea, but perhaps we should take it in a different direction).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur story begins in a greenhouse that appears to be filled with all manners of cacti. Hard at work was a young violet haired woman with what looked like red body tattoos all over her. She was wearing an indigo tank top shirt and a pair of skintight indigo shorts that emphasized her pear-shaped figure as she walked into the greenhouse wearing an apron. Her name was Temperance Collins and cacti were her hobby. She had gone through a nasty divorce months ago and had taken up raising cacti in order to cope. Temperance held up her spray bottle as she used it to water the cacti. \u201cThere you go,\u201d said Temperance. \u201cPeople think I\u2019m strange for spending 10 hours a day on cacti, but cacti are much different from people who really don\u2019t understand. Cacti don\u2019t intentionally try to hurt you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTemperance then gasped because she saw that there was a cactus with a flower on it that was getting ready to bloom. \u201cO.M.G.,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is perfect. Hold that pose.\u201d Temperance smiled and held up her camera in order to snap a photograph of the cactus about to bloom. \u201cThis is it,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is it. Get ready to bloom.\u201d However, before Temperance could take the photograph, there was a loud banging on the greenhouse door and Temperance was so startled that she missed and accidentally snapped a photograph of her feet. She then saw the flower had bloomed and she missed it. The young woman gave a grunt and then stomped off to find who was the one who knocked at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when Temperance opened the door, she saw that nobody was there. She looked around and found nobody but then she looked down and to her surprise, there was a small blue cactus on the floor that was shaped like a cube with a purple flower blooming from it. \u201cOh my gosh,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d Temperance looked at the cactus and could not believe it. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a cactus that looks like this one before. In fact, I\u2019ve heard of people growing watermelons in cubes, but not cacti.\u201d That was when Temperance noticed a strange note with the cactus and picked it up. As she read it, she was surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know I haven\u2019t been the best man and you want me out of your life. I can\u2019t say I don\u2019t want you back, but I understand that I was the one who was wrong. What I did was inexcusable. I know you never want to see me again, but let\u2019s end this on a happy note. No more hard feelings. I heard you like cacti, so please accept this gift. Signed, Zack.\u201d Temperance let out a groan. Zack was her ex-husband. She had left him because he had an awful temper and even hit her once. This was out of character for him. He never cared much for her plants or her hobbies. However, it was a beautiful looking cactus, so Temperance decided to give Zack the benefit of the doubt and take the cactus in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed it right on the floor and then sprayed the cactus a few times. \"You're quick a cute cactus. I'll just see if there's a space up on the top shelf for you. Temperance then climbed up the ladder to reach the top of the shelf. She moved a few cactuses in order to make room for her newest acquisition. \"There,\" said Temperance. \"This looks like a nice spot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then suddenly, one of the rungs on the ladder broke and Temperance screamed as she fell down and landed butt first on the blue cactus and jumped into the air. Temperance yelled and screamed as she held her butt in pain. \"Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!\" Temperance then started to pick out the needles from her backside and then turned around. She gave a sigh of relief that her large butt did not flatten the cactus. \"Oh,\" she said.\" Thank goodness that you're alright. I wouldn't want my enormous booty to crush the newest member of my cactus family.\" As Temperance but the cactus in its new spot, she rubbed her ass in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta admit,\" said Temperance. \"My ass has been getting bigger every month, every since the divorce. However, my butt's always been big, ever since I was a child.\" Suddenly Temperance felt her butt throbbing and then she scratched it. She failed to notice that her ass was turning bright green and her skin was getting rougher and rougher. \"But I must say,\" said Temperance. \"This is why I raise cacti. Cacti won't betray you and I know we got off on the wrong... butt... but I have a feeling we will.\" Temperance then yelled because her ladder broke and she landed on the ground hard enough to make it crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTemperance grunted and tried to get up, but it was to no avail because her ass was too big. By the time Temperance finally got up, she saw that her skin had turned completely green and Temperance gasped because she was now 12' feet tall and her stomach was 8' wide while her ass was 15ft wide and managed to crack a hole in the glass wall as she backed up. Temperance grunted and then she looked up to see a pink flower blooming on her head and then she felt spikes growing all over her body and tearing through her clothes. It was as if she was turning into a human cactus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no.\" Muttered Temperance.</span></div></div>",

Second, this character will remain deaf throughout the story, so her becoming a giantess will not fix her hearing.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire Fieldmore was a fairly normal person. She'd just finished college and was ready to get a job. But that proved to be quite hard. Once again, she had been turned down. That was the 4th job this week. No matter what she did, no one would hire her. And she knew why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was because, since birth, she has been completely deaf. And most of the places she tried to get a job at weren't comfortable or couldn't accomidate a deaf person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, she was sitting a bar, upset. While she sat, some guys were checking her out. She didn't blame them. Standing at 5'8'', with black hair in a ponytail, blue eyes, and a nice pear shaped figure, Claire was fairly pretty. But she just wanted to drink her sorrows away right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did smile when she saw her friend, Thomas Mattew, sit down next to her. He was an inch shorter then her, with spikey brown hair and green eyes, and was pretty lankey. He saw Claire's frowning face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;What's up Claire?&gt; Thomas asked, using sign language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Got turned down again. At this rate, I'll be unemployeed forever.&gt; Claire signed back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas sighed. &lt;Claire, you are smart. I'm sure you'll find a job that will take you. You just need to keep trying.&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Claire's turn to sigh now. &lt;I know that, but there aren't any in town. And this job was pretty rude in turning me down. They didn't know about my deafness, so they thought I was stupid. Can you believe that?&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Closing time!\" A bartender yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Closing time, Claire.&gt; Thomas signed. &lt;Tomorrow, I'll take you around to find a job.&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire nodded and got up to leave. &lt;Thanks.&gt; She signed, and left the bar.<br>\r\n----------------------------<br>\r\nAn hour later, Claire was walking down the sidewalk, heading for her apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I hope Thomas is right. I'm sick of being unemployeed.' Claire thought. 'Wish I had the money for a hearing aid.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was pulled from her train of thought when she passed a field. She saw a red glow coming from it. Intrigued, she walked into the field to see what it was.<br>\r\nShe saw a small crater in the field, and in the crater was a glowing rose. Confused, she walked closer to the crater. But as she did, the glow got brighter, and she passed out.</span></div></div>",

She looked in surprise because she was mysteriously found herself back at her apartment. \u201cI\u2019m home?\u201d thought Claire to herself. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? All I remember is...\u201d Claire then turned her head and looked in surprise because there was that glowing pink rose on the table by her bed and even the stem and leaves were glowing as the rose opened up. Mysteriously the rose had been placed inside of a flowerpot. \u201cThe rose?\u201d thought the deaf girl to herself. \u201cBut that\u2019s impossible. I thought that I left it in the crater. How did it get into a flowerpot. There\u2019s something strange going on... ow!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire had foolishly tried to touch the rose to see exactly what it\u2019s true nature was. As we all know, roses have thorns and one of the thorns had pricked Claire\u2019s finger. Claire grunted as she bled slightly and then put her finger into her mouth. However, what she didn\u2019t know was that there was a strange glowing enzyme of the thorn that entered Claire\u2019s bloodstream and mouth. \u201cWhat is with this strange plant? Ouch. Okay, maybe I should not have touched it. It is a rose after all. But how did it get there? Did I pick it in my sleep or something? Well, I might as well waster it and then go to bed.\u201d Claire walked into the kitchen to fill up a pitcher of water for her mysterious new plant. In the process, she stopped herself and then proceeded to drink all of the water in the pitcher herself right before she refilled it and then went to tend to the plant. Now, Claire was always pear-shaped but for some reason her butt looked even bigger on her body than it usually did, to the point where her pants were abnormally tight on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she watered the rose, Claire decided to turn in and go to bed. However, when she was putting on her pajamas, she felt something strange with her pajama pants. \u201cWhat is going on?\u201d thought Claire. \u201cI just bought these pajamas and already the pants don\u2019t fit? What the actually heck.\u201d Claire grunted again as she finally shoved her pants on. Although they were slightly tight and Claire was grunting as she laid in bed until she finally felt asleep. What she didn\u2019t realize was that there was a light pink tone developing in her hair which appeared to be changing color as she slept. As Claire was snoozing away, her bed was creaking and bending as the springs stretched. She was getting bigger and heavier in her sleep and grew two more chins as her fat was growing mainly into her ass that was causing her pajama pants to slip off. Curiously, strange spike-like growths in her skin grew on Claire\u2019s back and nearly made holes in her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe very next morning, Claire\u2019s alarm clock rang very loudly, prompting the deaf girl to slam down on it. \u201cDammit. I hate Mondays.\u201d As Claire yawned and stood up in her bed, she yelled because at that moment, her bed broke in half in the center and her ass had completely destroyed her pajama pants. Claire got up and rubbed her head and then felt her stomach to see that she had grown a few rolls on her body. \u201cWhat on Earth?\u201d Claire then screamed as she looked at herself in the mirror. She had grown to 8\u2019 3\u201d and had to weigh 500lbs. Claire turned around to see that she now sprouted a 5ft wide posterior that bumped against the mirror and cracked it slightly. Not only that, Claire\u2019s hair had completely turned light pink, the same shade of pink as the rose on the table. \u201cOh my gosh! How did I get so fat? I skipped dinner last night.\u201d Claire then noticed the strange spikes on her shoulders and felt them as she was in absolute surprise. \u201cHow can this be?\u201d Claire turned her head and then she remembered that strange rose and saw that the rose had completely bloomed and was glowing. \u201cCould it be that rose? Maybe this is an allergic reaction. But what kind of allergic reaction causes you to grow spikes on your body? And your hair to turn pure pink! This is too weird.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Claire\u2019s phone begun to ring, not that she noticed it because she was deaf, so she just stepped into the shower. \u201cWater! I need water!\u201d The deaf fat girl turned the shower on at full blast and smiled with bliss as the water was swept over her. She had her mouth open wide to swallow as much of the water as she could. \"Oh yeah. That's the good stuff. As Claire was showering, she failed to notice that more spikes were growing over her back and her ginormous booty. The spikes even fell down to her legs. As Claire stepped out of the shower, she finally found her cell phone and noticed that Thomas had left her a text message. \u201cOh my gosh!\u201d thought Claire to herself. \u201cThomas! Oh man! I\u2019m gonna be late.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting no time, Claire ran up to her closet and tried to put on a jacket. However, she discovered that it was too small on her much huger body. \u201cCrap.\u201d Claire went through every last shirt and pair of pants in the closet but none of them fit and caused her to mentally scream. The deaf woman then noticed the curtain on the wall and she let out a sigh. \u201cDesperate times call for desperate measures.\u201d Claire figured that she needed to improvise this time and made the curtains into a makeshift cocktail dress. \u201cWell,\u201d she said as she failed to notice spikes sprouting on her arms. \u201cAt least this will help me make a good first impression to a potential boss.\u201d Claire walked out to meat with Thomas, but as she did, her hair turned into a more reddish shade of pink and she appeared to be sprouting a tail. This tail however, was bright green and covered in spikes and appeared to be made up of twisted vines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Thomas pulled up in his car to pick up Claire and parked on the side of the street. He looked at Claire in pure surprise, obviously not expecting her to have put on so much weight overnight. He signed to her to speak to her. \"&lt;Wow, Claire. What happened? Have you been binge eating since the last time I saw you? You\u2019re huge.&gt;\u201d Claire gave a blush. \u201c&lt;Don\u2019t flatter yourself Thomas. I literally have no idea how this happened.&gt;\u201d \u201c&lt;I\u2019m sorry, that was mean. I found a few potential jobs that might interest you.&gt;\u201d Claire smiled and got into the car but in the process she found herself canned like a sardine in the vehicle and grunted. Thomas then noticed the spikes on Claire\u2019s arms and looked in surprise. However, he couldn\u2019t talk to her in sign language about the condition while he was driving, so he decided to just grin and bear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028The first stop appeared to be in front of a studio that was brightly colored. \u201c&lt;Isn\u2019t this where they shoot the fashion pictures for Mon*Starz Magazine?&gt;\u201d asked Claire. Thomas nodded his head. \u201c&lt;I\u2019ll admit. I wasn\u2019t expecting the weight gain. But I\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019ve found a job for you.&gt;\u201d \"&lt;I hope so.&gt;\" Claire tried to get out of Thomas's car but grunted because she had gotten so obese that her butt got stuck inside the car. \"&lt;Uh, Thomas, a little help please? My butt is kinda stuck.&gt;\" Thomas let out a sight and slammed both his feet into Claire's ass to push her out of the car. Claire grunted and hit the ground and Thomas yelled in pain because spikes seemed to grow on Claire\u2019s fleshy booty as well.\u201d Thomas looked down and gasped as he noticed the spikes and then noticed that Claire had a tail. \u201cWhat was in that breakfast burrito I ate?\u201d asked Thomas in disbelief. Claire let out a grunt as she rubbed her ass in pain but then moaned because of the spikes and proceeded to put her finger in her mouth. \u201c&lt;I don\u2019t know about this, Thomas. Maybe I don\u2019t look the part.&gt;\u201d \u201c&lt;Read my hands, Claire. This job doesn't require use of your ears. The photographer and editor will be out in a few minutes. Maybe they won't mind... uh, well.&gt;\" Claire let out a sigh. \"&lt;I hope so. Or I'm sunk.&gt;\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Claire held her stomach in pain. \"&lt;Claire? What's wrong?&gt;\" Claire made a few gestures as best she could as her stomach hurt. \"&lt;I'm in pain. My stomach feels like it's gonna explode. I think that's what I get for skipping breakfast today.\u201d Claire\u2019s stomach then gurgled again and Claire moaned slightly. But then something strange occurred. Claire\u2019s spikes got bigger and her body grew fatter to the point it shredded the curtains she was wearing just as he body turned green. Claire held out her hands and her fingers formed into three digits on each hand that quickly turned into rose leaves. A second pair of leaves appeared on Claire\u2019s back and took the form of what looked like a pair of wings. Claire\u2019s head also started to mysteriously change shape. Her hair morphed into rose petals as her face stretched out into a dragon-like snout made out of the same material as the petals. However, she hadn't noticed this. Thomas took one look at the mutating Claire and he was horrified. He even let out a loud scream. Back home, Claire's mysterious rose was still glowing, but it had closed up and shed some of its petals as it spun and shook inside of its flowerpot. No doubt the weird flower had something to do with Claire\u2019s transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with Claire and Thomas, Thomas was on the ground and screamed as the transmogrified Claire stood up and unconsciously swung her long vine tail. Since Claire couldn't hear Thomas screaming, she had no idea what was wrong. \"Oh,\" thought Claire to herself. \"My head. My ears feel number than usual. Where are my ears. Claire then looked and see that everything seemed to be getting smaller. \"What's going on?\" Claire then gasped as she looked into her leaved hands and then saw the leaf wings on her back. That's when it dawned on her, she was a giant and obese rose creature and she was still getting bigger and bigger and bigger. When she stopped growing, Claire was...</span></div></div>",

Her belly was 50 feet wide, her butt was 70 feet wide, and her breasts, if human sized, would have been K cups. She also appeared to have 4 chins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that wasn't what freaked her out. She was now some sort of rose monster. Her hair had turned into pink rose petals, and her face streched into a dragon-like snout. Her skin had turned green and was covered in thorns. Her hands now had only three fingers and looked like leaves. On her back were two large leaf wings. Sticking out of her lower back was a thorny green tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked down at herself in disbelief, she noticed Thomas was waving his arms. Squinting to get a better look, she finally realized he was signing to her, asking if she was alright. She began to sign back, only to remember she only had three fingers now, so signing would be a problem. She thought for a moment, and then had an idea. Concentrating, she moved her tail and shaped it into a pair of hands. Using those, she began to sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Thomas! I'm fine! But look at me! I'm a monster!&gt; She signed, having to carefully manuver the tail to make the proper words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;What happened?&gt; He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;I'm not sure! Last night, I was walking home. I saw a crater with a rose in it, and... THE ROSE! That thing must have done this! It's at my apartment!&gt; She signed with her tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Right. Let's head to your apartment.&gt; He signed back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;But, my job...&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;I think a photography job isn't as important as turning into a giant flower monster!&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire nodded and picked up Thomas, careful not to prick him with her thorns. She set him on her shoulder and started for her home.<br>\r\n-----------------------<br>\r\nMeanwhile, back at the crater, a figure was looking at it. The figure was female and humanoid in appearance, but with green, thorny skin and a large pink rose bod for hair in place of her hair. Like Claire now, she was morbidly obese, with H cup breasts, a yoga ball sized gut, beach ball sized butt cheeks, and 4 chins. She looked at the crater in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'DAMN IT!' She thought, 'The rose is gone! It must have bonded to someone. This is bad. I can't go back to Floraniko without that rose. Ok Xanatra, think! If someone bonded to the rose, they'd be a 100 foot Zuok. So just look around for a giant rose monster, and it will lead you to the rose.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, the green woman turned and started for the road.<br>\r\n-------------------------<br>\r\nBack with Claire and Thomas, they were on their way back to Claire's apartment, Claire moving carefully so as to not crush anything. Eventually, they made it to the apartment building. Claire set Thomas on her balcony and, using a finger, broke the sliding door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;It should be in my room.&gt; Claire signed with her tail. &lt;Grab the flowerpot, but don't touch the rose.&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas nodded, and entered the apartment.

Good to know.\" The old man replied. \"I'm Dr. Stephen Henikow, this is my assistant and wife, Jess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've heard of you two.\" Thomas said. \"You're famous, aren't you? You're the people who have been trying to prove alien life for the past few years. And from what I've heard, you're getting close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right.\" Stephen replied. \"And we believe this rose may be the key.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know it was here?\" Thomas asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephen reached into his coat pocket and pulled out what looked like an old ship radar. \"This baby tracks energy that isn't from Earth. It traced the rose to this apartment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you get it?\" Thomas asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, we don't have time to answer that.\" Jess said. She then walked to Claire. \"HELLO! MY NAME IS JESS HENIKOW! WE ARE HERE TO HELP YOU!\"<br>\r\nClarie just stared at her before using her tail-hand to sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire's deaf.\" Thomas said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, let me then.\" Stephen said. He then walked up and began signing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Claire? I'm Stephen Henikow. This is Jess, my assistant and wife. We are here to help.&gt; Stephen signed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;I've heard of you. Can you really help?&gt; Claire signed back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anyone could reply, the door burst open.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It happened in a top secret laboratory where there was a strange machine that appeared to be picking away at a strange block of ice. One of the scientists was a messy-haired and pale-skinned man who was smiling fiendishly as he looked at the ice. His coworker, a large Japanese man with a thick goatee ran behind him. \"Gutierrez,\" he said. \"What are you doing? This is insane.\" Gutierrez turned to face his  coworker. \"This is science, Shijima,\" he said. \"After years of searching I have finally found a test subject for the very chemical I've been working on. My Ultimate Human formula.\" \"I know all about your super steroid, Gutierrez,\" said Shijima. \"But I'm telling you that it can't be done. A chemical that can induce psychic powers, superhuman strength and invulnerability. It can't be done because modern humans aren't strong enough to take it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGutierrez then smiled and looked into the block of ice. \"Which is precisely why I've had to outsource and dig up a more primitive model. Inside the block of ice appeared to be a tan-skinned neanderthal woman who had black hair that also appeared to have a white streak in it. From the looks of it, she had purple tribal makeup all over her body and she looked like she was stronger than the modern human bodybuilder. She was wearing nothing but what looked like a leopard-skin loincloth and a necklace that appeared to be made out of fangs. The ice was rapidly melting and Dr. Shijima looked in concern. \"Gutierrez, what you are doing isn't realistic. You don't know whether or not that girl is still alive.\" Gutierrez gave a glare. \"I'll admit,\" he said. \"She will more than likely be on death's door upon revival, burt my Valentine serum should revive her. Make a note, Shijima, project Valentine will succeed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ice continued to melt and the cavewoman's eyes slowly begun to open, even under the ice. Once her arm was thawed out, it begun to twitch and she begun to break through. Once she was out of the ice, the cavewoman let out a scream and stood up before panting heavily. Shijima was more than a little afraid seeing as this girl came from a more savage time. The cave woman looked around at the strange machines and she was yelling in fear she even held her head. \"Gutierrez!\" yelled Shijima. Gutierrez didn't lose his cool however and calmly walked up to the cave girl. \"Hello,\" he said. \"You are Valentine.\" The cave girl growled and stepped back in fear as Gutierrez held up what looked like a combination of a syringe and a stamp. \"Do not be afraid. I am Dr. Horatio Gutierrez. I freed your from your frozen tomb.\" The cave girl then begun to sweat heavily because it really did appear that the cold hadn't done her any good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're losing here!\" yelled Shijima. But Gutierrez was determined not to lose \"Valentine\" and injected her with the syringe, making her yell before her eyes glowed. The strange serum turned her hair pink and from the wound with the syringe appeared a tattoo of a heart and the number 02.\" Valentine sweated and then felt her arm in pain before she did something that startled Shijima. She spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I? What is this world.\" Gutierrez let out a laugh. \"Phase one is a success. Her intelligence has started to grow.\" Then Valentine felt her stomach in pain. \"I'm starving,\" she said. \"I feel as if I haven't eaten for ages.\" Gutierrez nodded his head. \"Come with me. Can't have you dying of starvation.\" As Valentine followed Gutierrez, Shijima realized that she appeared to have gotten slightly taller and thicker than she was a minute ago. It would appear the Valentine Serum had more side-effects than Gutierrez was aware of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Note: In this path, the test subject is to remain human without turning into an animal or a monster because lwut asked me to do a strictly human chapter. I just decided to exploit a loophole in his instructions)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The cavewoman, now called Valentine, was brought into a room to test her abilities. Since even a madman let Gutierrez wouldn't expect instant results from a cavewoman with an empty stomach, Gutierrez had brought several steaks that Valentine was quickly tearing into with her bare hands as Gutierrez himself looked in disgust. \"I know that I shouldn't expect any basic table manners from a cavewoman.\" Valentine then let out a large belch. \"What kind of animal is this?\" asked Valentine. \"It tastes a bit like aurochs but something is somewhat off. I prefer mammoth.\" \"Well,\" said Gutierrez. \"I'm afraid that mammoth meat has been off the menu and out of stock for thousands of years.\" Valentine was scratching the mark where she was inoculated. It was then she jumped out because she spotted the lightbulb above her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached out and grabbed hold of the bulb in curiosity, only to burn herself as she yelled in pain. \"Fire?!\" she yelled. \"Fire in a gourd.\" \"Those are lightbulbs,\" said Gutierrez with a sigh. \"The 21st centuries has been shaped by centuries of advancements beyond the wheel.\" \"Impossible,\" said Valentine. \"It took my father years of hard work perfecting the wheel.\" Gutierrez raised an eyebrow. \"Your father invented the wheel? Well, there is one mystery that's been solved. Now, Valentine, I need to test your strength. Come with me.\" Valentine followed Gutierrez to a room with a large metal bell. \"This bell weighs exactly three tons,\" said Gutierrez. \"It took a crane to bring it into this room. Do you think you can lift it.\" Valentine was confident and cracked her knuckles. The cave girl walked to the bell and easily lifted it with one arm. \"Good,\" said Gutierrez. \"Now put it down and try lifting it with your brain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, Valentine did not understand Gutierrez's words and tried to pound her head against the bell, only succeeding in making it ring loudly. Gutierrez then let out a sigh. \"Let me explain,\" said Gutierrez. \"We scientists believe that humans use only 10% of their brains. My Valentine Serum I used on you is designed to increase those very abilities and utilize the full potential of the human brain, granting you telekinesis and extrasensory perception.\" Valentine looked in confusion and scratched her head because she had come from a time when the words for such concepts, let alone the concepts themselves, did not exist at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGutierrez slapped himself in the face. \"Of course!\" he yelled with a laugh. \"Of course! I guess I shouldn't have expected your brain to evolve this fast. What I meant to say is, that you should now be able to hear the thoughts of others and move objects simply by thinking. Now, using only your thoughts, I want you to move that bell.\" Valentine was slightly confused but then she gave a look of surprise because she could hear Dr. Gutierrez talk, only his lips were not moving. \"I know you can hear my thoughts, Valentine, so I know that my Valentine Serum is working. Now, just concentrate on the bell. You can do it. Show everyone that I'm not insane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValentine nodded her head and grunted as she concentrated her telekinetic abilities. Her telekinesis was indeed strong because the table and chairs and pens and papers in the room all were floating in the air. Her hair and loincloth were even moving as if there was wind and the purple tattoos all over her body were glowing. Finally, Valentine managed to lift the bell with her mind. \"Yes!\" yelled Gutierrez. \"That is it. Good girl Valentine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Valentine then felt a tingling in her chest and groaned. \"Valentine!\" yelled Gutierrez. \"Don't lose concentration now.\" That's when Gutierrez noticed that Valentine appeared to be getting bigger. Not only was she getting taller, but her stomach, breasts and thighs were expanding. \"Good grief!\" yelled Gutierrez. \"What's happening?\" Valentine was quickly growing and putting on weight. She saw her belly overflowing on the floor and her legs expanding as her loincloth shrunk and gasped as she felt her stomach. She even begun to scream, causing her telekinesis to fly out of control and make the bell shake and ring violently before it started to crack and come apart. The walls begun to crack as well and the tables and chairs exploded before the windows shattered. Valentine was yelling loudly and from the looks of it she was getting larger and larger. At that moment, she was 12feet tall with E-Cup breasts, an 8ft wide belly and a monstrous ass with thighs as thick as tree trunks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValentine screamed as she grew taller and fatter. \"Oh no,\" said Gutierrez. \"The Valentine Serum! It must be a side effect!\" Valentine kept on screaming as her telekinesis continued to run out of control. \"Calm down, Valentine!\" yelled Dr. Gutierrez. \"Calm! Ah!\" Dr. Gutierrez held his head in pain and even begun to bleed through his ears and foam at the mouth because Valentine was accidentally squeezing his brain with her psychic abilities. By the time the cave girl realized what she was doing and stopped, Gutierrez fell to the ground mumbling, showing that his brain had taken a severe beating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValentine screamed and then looked around and yelled as she held onto her head. At that moment...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Valentine held her head in pain and she shattered a nearby window with her telekinesis. The cavewoman was inhaling deeper and deeper as she was trying to collect her thoughts. But then she saw Gutierrez on the ground still brain damaged and was worried what would become of her if Dr. Shijima found out. She imagined being back in the ice before she grabbed the sides of her head and then turned to see something that might be her salvation, a regular window of opportunity, literally in this case. The broken window gave Valentine an idea and the 12ft high psychic neanderthal woman tried to escape out the window. However, she grunted because she forgot how fat she was and had to have weighed 600lbs, most of which was going to her big belly and ass. \u201cI\u2019m bigger?\u201d thought the cavewoman to herself. \u201cHow have I gotten bigger.\u201d Valentine managed to squeeze her stomach right through the window but now her ass was stuck and Valentine was grunting in absolute pain as she was trying desperately to get through. \u201cWhat on Earth is going on here?\u201d Valentine heard a voice say.\u201d Valentine gasped because it was Dr. Shijima and she unleashed a bolt of psychic energy that shattered the wall before she ran out panting heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the cavewoman left in a haste, Dr. Shijima looked around and saw the damage done to the lab by Valentine\u2019s psychic powers. \u201cOh my...\u201d Before Shijima could even finish his sentence, he heard muttering and realized that it was coming from Gutierrez who was muttering on the ground and poking at a silverfish. \u201cGutierrez?\u201d asked Shijima. \u201cCome on Horatio, get up. You shouldn\u2019t be laying... on... the ground.\u201d \u201cI am Escape,\u201d muttered Gutierrez in a daze as he held up his hands. \u201cThis is the male and this is the female.\u201d Shijima took a closer look and saw a burn mark from Valentine\u2019s psychic powers on his colleague\u2019s head and realized what happened. \u201cGood grief!\u201d yelled Shijima. \u201cValentine must\u2019ve lost control of her psychic powers and lobotomized him. I knew this experiment was doomed to failure from the start.\u201d Dr. Shijima then turned his head and looked in absolute horror because he noticed the hole from Valentine\u2019s escape. \u201cNot good, not good, not good. Cavewoman + psychokinesis + big city = total disaster.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValentine at this point had ran out and found herself in the city street where she looked in absolute shock at how the environment had changed. Where there were once trees and rocks, there were enormous skyscrapers with bright neon-lights and a large monitor depicting a newscaster. \u201cReports of a giant swan flying over Greece has alerted the air force,\u201d said the newscaster. \u201cIn other news, in a the Middle North area of the United States, a small town invites people to see the world\u2019s largest vulture.\u201d Valentine turned her head and saw she was in front of a television store that was recording her every move and she could only watch in pure fear as she appeared on every single screen. Valentine could only wave her hand in front of all those screens as a woman wearing a lot of jewelry noticed her. \u201cUgh,\u201d said the passerby in disgust. \u201cThat outfit. It looks positively primeval. And with that cellulite? A midriff doesn\u2019t work with a belly that blobbish. It\u2019s so disgusting.\u201d Valentine was still in fear of the television screens in front of herself and started to step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large cavewoman was panting to herself as she stepped back, not realizing that she was walking out into traffic. Valentine heard the beeping and then gasped because several cars passed by her and were beeping at her. \u201cWhat kind of strange creatures are these?\u201d asked Valentine. Valentine then heard loud beeping and the psychic cavewoman turned her head and spotted a large truck coming and became really scared. \u201cHey!\u201d yelled the truck driver. \u201cOut of the way, Big Bertha!\u201d The truck kept coming and Valentine screamed before letting loose a bolt of psychokinetic energy that froze the truck in place and caused the car behind the truck to rear-end it. Valentine then yelled and ran to the side, causing the truck to fall over as the truck driver yelled. \"What on Earth?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValentine ran into an alleyway and the cavewoman appeared to be getting larger and larger with each step. Her belly, breasts and butt were all bulging as she was getting taller. Valentine felt her face to learn she now had three chins and was gasping. She could feel her loincloth getting tighter on her to the point that it resembled more of a sumo thong. Before Valentine could adapt to the situation, she saw a large feline shadow and let out a growl, expecting it to be a saber-toothed tiger from back before she was frozen in ice. In a panic she shot a telekinetic bolt to blow out a trash can and startle the stray cat that was hiding behind it. Valentine watched as the cat ran off and then sighed deeply. \"Oh,\" she said. \"Thankfully the animals in this new world are smaller and less threatening than the ones from the past. Too bad. I'm starving. I hope that there are still aurochs in the new world. Mr. Gutierrez said that there were no more mammoths.\" Valentine's large stomach growled and the cavewoman then realized that she needed to get food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValentine then smelt the air and saw something in the trash can that she had knocked down. It was a box of pizza and from the looks of it, there was half of a leftover pizza in the box. Valentine, having never seen pizza before, had no idea whether or not she could eat it. \"What is this?\" asked the cavewoman as she held up the old pizza. \"Is this food?\" Valentine sniffed the pizza and bit her lip. \"I really hope that this is safe to eat.\" Valentina held up the entire pizza and started to chew into it like she would an entire roast pig. \"Oh my,\" thought the cavewoman. \"This.... piz za... this is delicious. Tastes way better than mammoth. Ugh. But perhaps I waited too long to eat it.\" Valentine then bit into the pizza box and gave a gag of disgust. \"Ugh,\" she said. \"I guess this part of the piz za can't be eaten.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValentine then held her stomach and let out a loud belch that accidentally released a stream of telekinesis that set off several car alarms and shattered several windows. Valentine then turned and yelled as she held her head and accidentally used her telekinesis to break an entire fire escape off of the side of the building behind her. Valentine screamed and held out her hand, causing the fire escape to fly off into the distance before it exploded. The cavewoman bit her thumb as she looked in fear at what she had done. \"These powers,\" thought the sumo-sized neanderthal to herself. \"These powers Gutierrez gave me. They shouldn't be. What has he turned me into? What have I done to him.\" Valentine was so distraught that she accidentally effected the clouds above her head to rain down on her. Valentine even begun to cry. \"This new world,\" she said. \"It's scary. I want the Earth I knew back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Valentine held her head and her eyes were glowing red as they radiated with bioelectrical power. \"Oh my,\" muttered Valentine. \"Oh my! What's happening to me!?\" Valentine held her head as it made a buzzing sound and let out a yell as she unconsciously activated a field of psychic powers. In the process, the ground beneath her cracked. The more Valentine was using her powers the more colossal and obese the cavewoman was becoming and she panted as she begun to read all the minds around her, gathering information on the world around her, as well as reading some rather disturbing thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis history test is killing me. Okay, there are four types of people in Afghanistan; the Afghans/Pashtuns, the Tajiks, the Uzbeks and the Hezaras. I think that\u2019s right.\u201d \"You're wrong. Wolverine could totally take on the Savage Dragon and win.\" \"He's just mad because he knows that Firebreather is no match for Spider-Man.\" \"Ugh. That was the worst movie ever. I think they waited too soon to remake it. \"The world's largest species of crab is the Japanese spider crab.\" \"In olden times, it was said that sailors considered cutting one's fingernails to be a bad omen. Huh. In some places, black cats are actually considered to be good luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, after processing the more trivial and somewhat information information, Valentine begun to read some more horrifying thoughts that showed the worst of humanity. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that Drummond is running for mayor. If he\u2019s elected, Logan Alley will be torn down. Or worse yet, blown up.\u201d \u201cYou can all kiss Logan Alley goodbye. The arsonist I hired will make his move as soon as I\u2019m mayor.\u201d \u201cWho does she think she is? I\u2019m going to sue that shoddy excuse for a cafe she works at and get her fired.\u201d \u201cEverything will be okay. So long as she doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m already married, the wedding can go on as planned.\u201d \u201cBetter enjoy your last meal, because...\u201d Valentine held her head because she couldn\u2019t bear all of the minds she was reading at once. \u201cI want to be the CEO instead of the CEO! And I\u2019m gonna get there!\u201d \u201cI hope they never find that stupid little...\u201d Valentine held her head in pain as she read all those minds. \u201cAnd these modern humans call <i>me</i> the primitive one?\u201d asked Valentine to herself. \"Such selfish and cruel thoughts. And even some thoughts that don't make sense. I don't want to read any more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Valentine kept on holding her head in pain as more and more unpleasing thoughts were entering her head and caused her to hold it in pain as she screamed. As she was reading those thoughts, Valentine got bigger and bigger until soon she was 50ft tall with a 90ft wide stomach and 80ft wide ass and E-cup breasts. The psychic strain and rapid growth continued to pressure the cavewoman when...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The day begun harmlessly enough in a small art colony town where two lovers were walking through a craft store. This however, wasn\u2019t your average pair of lovers but a same sex couple. First of the couple was Ava, the shorter one, a mocha-skinned and hourglass shaped Brazilian woman who was holding tight to her lover, Zephyr, a tall and well-endowed blonde with a freckled face. The two of them were in a very happy mood. This was because they had been dating for several years and in a month they were going to be married. Zephyr held up a broach that looked like it was shaped like a rook chess piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about this one, Ava?\u201d asked Zephyr. \u201cDo you think that I\u2019d look good with this brooch on?\u201d Ava smiled. \u201cZephyr,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019d look good with anything on.\u201d Zephyr let out a giggle and then she and Ava embraced in a kiss. \u201cYou two must really be in love,\u201d said the shopkeeper. \u201cYou\u2019re in such a happy move.\u201d Ava and Zephyr gave a giggle. \u201cWell,\u201d said Zephyr. \u201cIt\u2019s only natural. Next month we\u2019re going to tie the knot.\u201d The shopkeeper gave a smile. \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly why I love this town. Love is love, no matter who.\u201d Ava then took Zephyr by the hand and walked down the hall. \u201cWould you look at that tiara,\u201d said Ava. \u201cI bet you\u2019d look good in that.\u201d Zephyr let out a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, while the lovely couple was very happy about their plans for the future, there was somebody around the corner who wasn\u2019t very happy. He looked like a French painter and a rather disfigured looking one. One of his ears looked lower on his head than the other ear, his nose looked distorted, he appeared to have sharp teeth and his eyes seemed lower on his face than his nose. He also had a mustache and a red beret. He was yelling to himself as he read a notice. \u201cBastard landlord! Only one month or I\u2019m out on the streets?! Does he not realize who I am?! I am Duba! The greatest artist in the world. And yet the stupid apes of this town do not recognize my genius. All I need is just one customer! Just one and it will show the world! But first I need to find a customer. Or two.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when Duba heard the sound of a cash register and realized that Ava and Zephyr were leaving the shop. That\u2019s when Duba got a smirk on his face and ran up to the couple as they were about to leave. \u201cExcusez-moi, mademoiselles,\u201d said Duba. \u201cYou two are quite beautiful. Perhaps you would each like a painting as beautiful as yourselves.\u201d \u201cUgh,\u201d said Ava. \u201cWhat happened to you? Did you try to paint your own face?\u201d Duba was about to get very angry, but then Zephyr bent down to speak with him. \u201cYou know, Ava,\u201d she said. \u201cIt might not be such a bad idea. After all, the painting could be used to commemorate our marriage.\u201d Duba seemed surprised that he was talking to a couple of lesbians but then she forced herself to smile. \u201cAh, I see,\u201d said Duba. \u201cA wedding. I\u2019ve got it! It will be the greatest commemoration of a union between lovers. I promise you, come back in a week and I will have a painting ready for you to pick up. It will be the best painting in the world.\u201d Ava let out a laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s just what my Zephyr deserves.\u201d \u201cOh you,\u201d said Zephyr will a laugh. \u201cOkay, sir. we will pick it up in a week.\u201d As he shook hands with Ava, Duba let out a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuba wasted no time getting to work and laughed to himself. \u201cThis is it. Once those two take a look at this painting that I use with my special paint, everyone will see the genius that is Duba.\u201d Duba let out a laugh and sprayed a strange glowing paint onto the pallet before he got to work.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That night, Zephyr and Ava were just thinking about the painting that they commissioned and were talking about it on the phone. Zephyr had stripped down and was about to take a shower at her house on the edge of the woods. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see the painting. I\u2019m sure it will be romantic.\u201d Said Zephyr. On the other side of town at a beach, Ava was at her house and was eating leftover pizza as she was speaking with her future wife. \u201cI\u2019m glad that you can\u2019t wait. That means you can\u2019t wait for the wedding. Only one month left to go.\u201d Ava let out a laugh as Zephyr smiled. \u201cOh,\u201d said Ava. \u201cI really hope that your mom is okay with us getting married.\u201d Ava let out a sigh. Zephyr had a point. Ava\u2019s mother was really not happy when she learned that her daughter was gay. In fact, when gay marriage was completely legalized in all 50 states, she took it rather hard.\u201d Ava then shrugged her shoulders. \u201cWhat can she do?\u201d asked Ava. \u201cThe worst that she could do to me is not go to the wedding. I don\u2019t care.\u201d Zephyr then let out a giggle as she turned the shower water on. \u201cOkay then. I\u2019ll talk to you tomorrow.\u201d Zephyr blew a kiss into the phone and hung up. On the other side, Ava let out a happy sigh. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it,\u201d she said as she bit into her pizza. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be married.\u201d Ava let out a laugh at the thought of being Zephyr\u2019s wife and then threw her pizza box away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Ava begun to hold her head. \u201cOh,\u201d she groaned. \u201cI suddenly feel...\u201d To her surprise, Ava let out a large roar and then covered her mouth before she looked back at her mirror. She noticed that her butt appeared to have swelled out. She smacked her brown booty and was surprised at how big it had gotten. \u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d she said. \u201cI had no idea I was eating so much. It all goes down to the same place. Hmmm. On second thought, maybe Zephyr will like this. That\u2019s when Ava muttered in confusion because she saw black stripes on her widened behind. \u201cOh my,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that time, Zephyr was just stepping out of her shower at home, or at least trying too. \u201cCome on,\u201d she grumbled. \u201cCome on. From the looks of it, the blonde girl had gotten somewhat fatter. Her stomach was as wide as she was tall and her breasts were practically suffocating her. Zephyr squeezed her way out and was panting. \u201cWhat have I been eating?\u201d asked Zephyr. \u201cI could\u2019ve sworn I had just put on weight.\u201d Zephyr then looked in the mirror and was going to get ready to brush her teeth. \u201cGee,\u201d she said. \u201cIt looks like I\u2019ve gotten somewhat taller. Well, I\u2019m still a young woman of 21.\u201d Then Zephyr opened her mouth to get ready to brush her teeth but gasped because she saw that not only had her teeth turned into fangs but she had ten times more teeth in her mouth than ever, almost like the teeth of a shark. \u201cOh my gosh!\u201d Zephyr then tapped her teeth and turned around, only to hear a breaking sound because her butt had gotten larger and smashed the sink. Then she hear a scratching sound. Zephyr turned and saw that she had accidentally scratched the mirror but didn\u2019t know how. \u201cWhat did I do to the mirror?\u201d Zephyr asked as she saw that her eyes had turned into cat\u2019s eyes. Zephyr gasped at what she saw and then she felt something tapping on her head and saw a large red scorpion\u2019s tail that made her gasp in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at her house, Ava let out a growl and was getting bigger and fatter as her brown body turned bright white and covered in fur as she held her head. Her face had turned into a feline muzzle and her teeth turned into sharp fangs. She grabbed the railing of her veranda as her clothes were rapidly shrinking on her growing body and suddenly her fingers turned into large and sharp claws as she let out a roar and her eyes turned into cat\u2019s eyes just like with Zephyr\u2019s. Ava looked back to see that each ass cheek had to be the size of a couch and she had sprouted a long striped tail as she let out a roar and jumped off of her Verandah, landing on her feet with an enormous boom that cracked the ground beneath her under her weight. Ava had completed her transformation and had become a 25ft tall and 5 ton white-furred weretiger. Each of her breasts had to be a H-cup while her ass was now large enough to swallow her car and her stomach was exactly as wide as she was tall. The Brazilian woman let out a distressed roar at the creature she had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with Zephyr, Zephyr had gotten so big that her body had broken down the bathroom wall and she burst out of her house as she growled. Zephyr was now 30ft tall and looked like she weighed as much as her fianc\u00e9e. As she got on her knees, a pair of leather wings sprouted on her back and her entire body turned bright red and her face became more feline-like. The 30ft tall blonde was now a rather obese and naked manticore woman with a 35-ft wide booty, a 25ft belly and D-cup breasts. Zephyr looked at her new form and gasped. \u201cOh my gosh!\u201d she yelled. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening to me?! What is Ava going to think when she sees me.\u201d Zephyr let out a loud roar of despair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028What she didn\u2019t know was that Ava was desperately running towards her general direction and let out a loud growl as the tiger woman ran into the street, cracking it beneath her massive body. She was desperate to find Zephyr now. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened to me,\u201d said Ava. \u201cBut what if it\u2019s happening to Zephyr? She\u2019s gonna be an emotional wreck if she turns into a giant tiger.\u201d The weretiger giantess had no idea that her lover had already transformed into a manticore and not a tiger.<br>\r\n\u2028Back at the craft shop, that painting of the lion and tiger was on the wall and it was glowing before it turned pitch gray. Duba the painter saw what was happening and let out a gasp. \u201cWhat the?!\u201d he yelled. \u201cNo! No! No! No! This wasn\u2019t part of the deal! That ghost cheated me! He told me I would become the greatest artist in the world if I used that ectoplasmic paint! That is so evil! Now it\u2019s gone gray!\u201d The angry painter had no idea that the gray painting was going to be the least of everybody\u2019s worries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, with both lesbian lovers transmogrified into giant mythical felines, whose P.O.V. should we follow?</span></div></div>",

She looked back and wiggled her scorpion tail above her enormous ass cheeks, showing how undersized it was as she blushed and made her cheeks turn pink. She waved her blonde hair and let out a nervous growl. \u201cThis cannot be happening,\u201d she said. \u201cJust earlier today, I was shopping for my wedding to my best friend and we even had a portrait painted for the occasion. But now I\u2019m a manticore. A giant manticore. A giant manticore who looks like she should be wearing a mawashi for a sumo fight against King Kong. How am I going to explain this to Ava?\u201d Suddenly, Zephyr had a thought. \u201cOh my. Ava sounded distressed on the other side of the phone. What if something similar happened to her.\u201d Before Zephyr could even think about what horror her beloved was going through at that moment, she heard a rumbling because her stomach was growling. \u201cMe-ow!\u201d shouted the blonde manticore. \u201cI am starving.\u201d Zephyr rubbed her bloated belly and then walked out on all fours to find something to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZephyr sniffed the air. \u201cNow,\u201d she thought to herself. \u201cWhat do manticores eat? According to mythology, a manticore\u2019s favorite food is... humans.\u201d Zephyr\u2019s stomach growled again. \u201cOh no!\u201d she yelled. \u201cI can\u2019t eat a human! That\u2019s wrong! But then again, manticore comes from a Persian word meaning \u201cman-eater\u201d. Even if I am a lesbian, men aren\u2019t livestock.\u201d Zephyr\u2019s stomach growled again. \u201cOkay! Don\u2019t whine! I\u2019ll get you some food! I just hope I can eat something without eating someone in the process.\u201d Zephyr got on all fours and went to look for something to eat in the woods. She was sniffing the air, hoping to get something tasty as she stomped forward, her monstrous butt knocking down several trees. That was when she caught the scent of something and saw a trio of wolves picking into a deer carcass. Zephyr smelt the carrion but for some reason, instead of being disgusted, she begun to drool. \u201cThat carcass smells heavenly. Oh my.\u201d Zephyr then let out a roar and the wolves spotted the manticore before fleeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZephyr then licked up the deer carcass in one gulp but was still hungry and heard her stomach growl. She then spotted several squirrels and swallowed them all in one gulp. Then, Zephyr ate three wild boars and three live deers. \u201cYum, yum, yum,\u201d said Zephyr. \u201cA whole lot of food possibilities open up when you\u2019re a huge and fat manticore.\u201d Zephyr then let out a thunderous belch that made several birds scatter. \"Aw phooey. I was going to eat the birds next. Oh well, at least the contents of this big kitty tummy contain no traces of human flesh. It would be rude of me to eat Ava's mother at the wedding. Oh, I hope that Ava is doing alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titanically obese manticore waddled around and her ass seemed to be getting bigger as she was getting bigger as well. The manticore then walked up to a large cliffside and climbed up before she looked around. She saw the entire forest and the city in the horizon and then held up her head in order to let out a loud roar. \u201cI always wanted to do that.\u201d That\u2019s when Zephyr remembered that she had large leathery wings and flapped them. \u201cI wonder if I could fly. Probably not with how fat I am. But here goes nothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028The giant and very obese manticore woman jumped off the cliffside and flapped her wings and sure enough, she was airborne. Zephyr looked in surprise because she never would\u2019ve thought it was possible for her to fly but then she smirked and was flying overhead. \u201cOh my gosh,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m so high and I\u2019m not even on drugs.\u201d Zephyr flew past a plane and a man on the plane looked out and gasped as he spotted the lion giantess but then looked around and rubbed his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZephyr let out a laugh but then coughed because several birds flew into her mouth and she belched out feathers a few time. \"This is amazing,\" she said. \"Maybe being a giant manticore isn't such a bad idea. But how did it... Duba! That painter must've been a wizard and that painting of his turned me into a manticore. If that's true, Ava is probably a big white weretiger by now, providing that the spell effected her as well. I hope she still wants to go through with the wedding. It doesn't look like either of us is going to be human again anytime soon.\" Suddenly, Zephyr gasped because she looked down and spotted...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was Ava, all 12 tons of tiger and she appeared to have gotten bigger, so had Zephyr. Ava while the size of a building was slightly shorter than her equally transmogrified fianc\u00e9e. The biggest part of Ava was her belly that was being dragged around as she crossed the road on all fours as all around, cars were beeping at her. \"Ava!\" yelled Zephyr in shock. Zephyr flew down and landed with a loud rumble that caused a miniature earthquake and forced people to drive off the road right before the manticore ran up to the weretiger titaness. Ava looked at the manticore in shock but she immediately recognized the scorpion-tailed and shark-fanged lioness as her lover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zephyr?\" Zephyr waddled her obese frame up to Ava and Ava gave a look of surprise as Zephyr pushed her massive belly against Ava's own. \"I knew you had to be a tiger!\" yelled Zephyr. \"Oh thank goodness I found you.\" Ava just poked the side of Zephyr's massive thunder thighs with her claws as she could barely reach around Zephyr's huge belly. \"I wasn't expecting you to be a manticore, though,\" said Ava. \"You've got quite the booty, Zephyr.\" Zephyr looked back and saw how small her wings and tail were compared to her ass and noticed that an impatient motorist was continually ramming her butt crack with his car. \"Get out of the road, jerk!\" Reflexively, Zephyr showed her poisonous tail to the motorist in order to tell him to back off and he wisely backed up his car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZephyr blushed and spanked herself to listen to her butt fat shaking and jiggling. \"So I do.\" But then Zephyr smirked and held up Ava's enormous gut and put her hands through it. \"But you have quite the stomach on you. We could rent you out as a bounce house, honey.\" Zephyr then shoved her face into the tiger woman's stomach and blew into it a few times as Ava was slightly embarrassed and let out a nervous laugh. \"Uh, Zephyr. I think we should be moving elsewhere, people are starting to stare.\" The two giant obese feline lovers looked down to see that several spectators were already taking photographs and one young man even took a selfie as he loitered against Ava's titanic butt cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was there both felines decided to walk off. Ava took note of her fianc\u00e9e's height as well as her own. Ava was now 85ft tall with a 100ft butt, thighs that were each 55ft wide and a 140ft wide stomach. Zephyr in contrast was 100ft tall with a 110ft wide girth, 150ft wide butt and thighs that were 60ft wide each. \"Look at us,\" said Ava. \"We look like we should be fighting a Megazord right now.\" Zephyr then held her 200ft wide wings out and even used one to cover Ava like it was a blanket. \"I'm pretty sure that Duba did this to us. That painting he made of us must've been cursed or something.\" Ava gave a growl. \"Wait until I get my paw on that trickster. He turned me into a weretiger. Weretigers eat people. Thankfully I found a beached whale to satisfy my hunger.\" Ava let out a world-shattering belch and fishbones flew out of her mouth. \"What about you? Manticores eat everything.\" Zephyr let out a nervous laugh. \"I found some food in the forest.\" Zephyr gave a nervous grin as she showed squirrel fur stuck in her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZephyr then gave a purr. \"You know, Ava. You actually look more gorgeous as a tiger than you did when you were human.\" Ava was stunned and then looked back at her black and white striped body. The Latino tigress then gave a seductive growl. \"Gracias, Zephyr. And might I say, you make a gorgeous lioness.\" Ava licked Zephyr's face and Zephyr licked back as both titanic felines then embraced in a kiss. \"I am going to enjoy being married to you.\" Said Ava. Zephyr gave a really large grin. \"You mean you're still willing to go through with the wedding?\" \"Of course. I love you. Sure, the two of us spending the rest of our lives as Godzilla-sized mythical feline balloons may be a slight inconvenience, but we'll make it work. Just one stop though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAva spotted a tailoring shop and decided to stop up to it. Inside, the proprietor was working on a wedding dress right when he felt the vibrations from Ava and Zephyr's movement. Before he could do anything, Ava tore the roof off the store and the tailor screamed as he spotted the titanic white weretigress grinning down on him. \"Hi, Pierre,\" she said. \"Oh, you probably don't recognize me. It's Ava Ruiz. About that wedding dress I ordered, as embarrassing as it sounds, I'm going to need it bigger.\" The tailor was dumfounded but he recognized the tiger's voice as a customer and he felt that it would be no good to argue with a girl who could easily squash or swallow him or asphyxiate him with her rolls of feline flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZephyr couldn\u2019t help but laugh as Pierre was standing on Ava\u2019s left butt cheek as he retook the tiger woman\u2019s measurements for her wedding dress. \u201cHey, Pierre,\u201d said Zephyr smugly. \u201cI\u2019ll bet that this is the biggest wedding dress you\u2019ve ever had to make. Me, I was going to wear my mom\u2019s dress. But that\u2019s not gonna be possible. Do you think any skirt could fit this booty?\u201d Pierre let out a groan before Ava put him down once he had the measurements he needed. \u201cI will have your dress ready in exactly one month, Mademoiselle.\u201d He said uneasily. \u201cGood,\u201d said Ava. \u201cJust in time.\u201d Both Zephyr and Ava let out a laugh as they both walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you see the look on his face?\u201d asked Ava. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t look like he was any position to argue.\u201d Zephyr let out a laugh. \u201cHey, Ava. Why don\u2019t we get some dinner. I\u2019m hungry.\u201d \u201cAlright, Zephyr. Let\u2019s just try not to eat any humans. We may have been turned into monsters but we\u2019re not \u201cmonsters\u201d.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do Ava and Zephyr decide to eat?</span></div></div>",

She let out a giggle as Ava looked in confusion at her manticore fianc\u00e9e. \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny, Zephyr?\u201d asked the weretiger. \u201cOh,\u201d said Zephyr. \u201cAva, I just had a fun idea. How about we hit the all-you-can-eat buffet down the street.\u201d Ava blinked in surprise at her fianc\u00e9e\u2019s proposal. \u201cZephyr, you\u2019re not serious are you? People will see us.\u201d Zephyr let out a scoff. \u201cSo what? They\u2019d see us anyway. We\u2019re both as big as buildings. Besides, just because we\u2019re giant monsters now, that doesn\u2019t mean people can label us. We\u2019re still human. Uh.. kinda. Besides, this might be good for a laugh or two.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAva and Zephyr both laugh and then begin to walk away. Of course, they have to be very careful as not to crush any cars beneath their feet, stomachs and asses. At one point Ava\u2019s scorpion tail accidentally scratches the side of a truck while one motorcyclist accidentally drives into Ava\u2019s navel and gets stuck. The white weretigress has to pull out the cyclist and place him on the top of a skyscraper right as Zephyr accidentally tilts one building by pushing her huge ass into it. Inside the office building, the workers scream at the sight of manticore ass right in front of their window. Zephyr blushes and then sits down only for several cars behind her to beep their horn at her. \u201cGeez,\u201d says Zephyr. \u201cTraffic is terrible in this city.\u201d Ava gives a grunt because a helicopter landed on one of her lovehandles. \u201cTell me about it.\u201d The two fat cats let out a sigh as they get up and begin to walk towards the restaurant with the buffet. \u201cAh,\u201d says Zephyr as she licks her lips. \u201cThere it is.\u201d Ava then looked at the doorway and realized something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, Zephyr,\u201d says Ava. \u201cWe won\u2019t fit.\u201d Zephyr let out a laugh. \u201cOh, we don\u2019t need to, Ava. We don\u2019t need to.\u201d Zephyr then proceeded to rip the roof right off the restaurant. All the patrons looked in stunned silence as the felines looked down at them. \u201cOh,\u201d said Ava with a smirk. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about us. We\u2019re just in for a bite.\u201d \u201cAnd don\u2019t worry,\u201d said Zephyr. \u201cMy fianc\u00e9e and I are only here for real food so don\u2019t get overheated.\u201d The cats stepped inside as almost everyone else screamed and ran out of the restaurant.\u201d Ava let out a laugh and then gave a purr as she waved her tail and held her real into the air. Both she and Zephyr shoved their faces into the buffet and were greedily gulping everything down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne patron hadn\u2019t left the buffet and the young man seemed more baffled than afraid to see the two enormous felines and even walked up to the area between Zephyr\u2019s butt cheeks and poked it with a fork slightly. Zephyr stopped chewing on buffalo chicken briefly and tried to look back but Ava\u2019s stomach was in the way, so she shrugged it off in order to get back to eating. Ava slurped up some hard boiled eggs just as the young patron snapped a photograph of both the tiger and manticore lovers and then ran out of the buffet. \u201cDid you hear something, Zephyr?\u201d asked Ava. Zephyr shook her head right before she scarfed down some lasagna. \u201cUgh,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like Garfield.\u201d Ava gave a smirk. \u201cThen pretend I\u2019m Odie and kick my ass.\u201d Zephyr let out a roar and a purr as she held up her wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment the maitre'd walked into the main dining hall. \"What is going on in...\" The maitre'd then spotted Zephyr and Ava who just glare at him. \"It's rude to stare,\" says Ava. \"If you're going to make a fuss then my future wife and I will find some other place to dine.\" The maitre'd nervously walked back and ran into the hallway before letting out a gasp. \"Did somebody leave the gate open to Sarmoti or something? Where did that manticore and weretiger come from?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAva and Zephyr then both stood up and rubbed their stomachs. \"That was a good meal,\" said Ava. \"We need to remember this place for the wedding.\" Zephyr gave a purr. \"Now how's about some dessert.\" \"Oh, you naughty lioness, I'm all for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before Ava and Zephyr can continue...</span></div></div>",

Our story takes place in the home of a married couple, that is to say a same-sex married couple. This was the family of Elisa and Dominique Ventura. They had been married for several years now and had an adoptive son named Jeremy. Elisa at that moment was in the living room watching the television. She was a tall African American woman with long dark bluish black hair that appeared to be glowing in the light. Dominique was a tall Caucasian woman with long red hair and blue eyes that looked like they were glowing with her red mascara. At the moment she was washing dishes in the kitchen. She turned her head slightly and saw that Jeremy was busy reading a textbook of some kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJeremy,\u201d said Dominique. \u201cYou\u2019ve been looking at that textbook all day. It\u2019s time for bed.\u201d \u201cBut Dominique,\u201d said Jeremy. \u201cIn three weeks, we have a research paper due.\u201d \u201cGiving out research papers in 4th grade,\u201d said Elisa as she walked up to her son. \u201cThey should save it for high  school.\u201d Elisa looked down and noticed Jeremy was reading a textbook on wild animals. \u201cZoology?\u201d asked Elisa. \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said Jeremy. \u201cMr. Burns is having us write research papers on African animals and gave each student a choice between two different animals to choose from. That pervert is always giving these crazy assignments.\u201d Dominique dropped a plate in the sink when she heard her son\u2019s words. \u201cJeremy, do you even know what \u201cpervert\u201d means?\u201d \u201cNo. But I heard the neighbors calling him that. What does it mean?\u201d Dominique bit her lip, wanting to change the subject as fast as possible. \u201cUh, what two animals were you assigned?\u201d Jeremy let out a groan. \u201cI have to choose between writing a report on hippopotami or writing a report on cape buffalos.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElisa was suddenly very interested. \u201cWell, that\u2019s easy enough. If I were you I\u2019d go with the buffalo.\u201d Jeremy then turned to face Dominique. \u201cPersonally,\u201d said Dominique. \u201cI prefer hippos. The first thing to know about either choice however, Jeremy, is that both of those animals are extremely dangerous. They\u2019d kill you if you provoked them.\u201d \u201cReally?\u201d Elisa nodded her head. \u201cJust because an animal doesn\u2019t eat meat doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s harmless. Remember, they\u2019re herbivores but they\u2019re BIG herbivores. But mind Dominique. It\u2019s time for you to rest. Remember, you have school tomorrow and you\u2019re not staying up all night wracking your brain around this issue.\u201d Elisa kissed her son right before Jeremy smiled and walked upstairs to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Jeremy was in bed, Elisa walked up to Dominique in the kitchen. \u201cPersonally,\u201d said Elisa. \u201cI\u2019d recommend the report on the cape buffalo.\u201d \u201cAnd why might I ask would that be?\u201d \u201cBecause the African buffalo is one of the most unbeatable animals in Africa. They can even kill lions. They come in herds that contain 50 to 3000 members and protect the herd so well that nothing can get them. Anyone stupid enough to hunt a buffalo gets a violent death on their 6-foot long horns of doom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDominique let out a laugh. \u201cThat may be true, but hippos are more dangerous. They\u2019re the third largest land animal on the planet, can open their mouths at an angle of 150 degrees and when they get enraged they bite boats in half. They kill more people a year than lions or crocodiles. They can run up to 20 MPH.\u201d \u201cSo what, African buffalos reach 35 MPH. And they only sleep 2-10 minutes at a time.\u201d \u201cWell hippos secrete a blood-like sweat to protect from the sun. Did you know that they brought them to fight gladiators in ancient Rome.\u201d Elisa let out a laugh. \u201cWell, that report isn\u2019t for a while so Jeremy still has time to decide on a topic. And it\u2019s going to be buffalo.\u201d Dominique rolled her eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s what you think, Honey.\u201d \u201cOh, I\u2019m sure it will be African buffalos. You\u2019re just being defensive because hippos are your favorite animals. I\u2019m so certain that Jeremy will decide on a report on African buffalos that I\u2019ll do the dishes every night for 3 months if he chooses a report on hippos.\u201d Dominique just let out a laugh at her wife\u2019s words. \u201cOh, it\u2019s on, Elisa.\u201d Both women let out a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, fate can be a strange thing. That night, Elisa and Dominique were about to get ready for bed and as Dominique was brushing her teeth, she felt her canine teeth and noticed something off. \u201cElisa, Honey,\u201d said the redhead. \u201cDo my teeth look sharper to you.\u201d Elisa was brushing her hair as she shrugged her shoulders. \u201cYou\u2019re probably just imagining it, Dom.\u201d However, as Elisa pulled her brush from her hair, she looked in surprise because for some reason all of the teeth on the brush were completely destroyed. \u201cHuh?\u201d she didn\u2019t realize it, but she also appeared to have sprouted a long black furred tail like that of an African buffalo. Dominique and Elisa then made their way into their bed but as Dominique got into the bed, she heard one of the legs snap off. As Dominique looked down to investigate it, Elisa noticed her wife\u2019s nightie looked a little tight on her. \u201cWhoa, Dominique,\u201d said Elisa. \u201cGotta cut back on the devil dogs.\u201d Dominique then smirked. \u201cOh yeah. Look at that jelly belly.\u201d Elisa felt her stomach and realized that Dominique was speaking the truth. \u201cOh my,\u201d said Elisa. \u201cI must\u2019ve been eating too many donuts.\u201d Dominique just smirked and poked her wife in the chest. \u201cYou\u2019re starting to look like a buffalo yourself.\u201d \u201cWell, goodnight, my hippo honeybun.\u201d Both lovers let out a laugh before falling asleep, unaware that a transformation was taking place.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning, the Venturas had sat down to breakfast. For some reason, Dominique was eating more ravenously than usual and had even resorted to eating the flowers from the pot on the table. \u201cGeez, Dominique,\u201d said Elisa as she cut into her own pancakes. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a tapeworm or something?\u201d Dominique let out a rather deep grunt. \u201cI\u2019m not sure, Elisa,\u201d said Dominique. \u201cFor some reason I woke up ravenous.\u201d Jeremy could only stare because he saw Elisa pick up a flower that Dominique didn\u2019t eat and then ate it herself. \u201cAre you two feeling okay?\u201d the young man asked to his mothers. Elisa just let out a laugh. \u201cOh, don\u2019t worry, Jeremy. We both slept rough last night. I had a strange dream. One where I was a cape buffalo running on the African Plains.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s funny,\u201d said Dominique. \u201cI dreamt that I was a hippopotamus at a watering hole.\u201d \u201cWell, it felt great,\u201d said Elisa. \u201cNobody messes with you when you\u2019re an African buffalo. Remember that for your paper Jeremy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Jeremy could respond, Elisa got up and went to get milk from the fridge. Jeremy looked in shock because he spotted Elisa\u2019s tail that she grew last night. From the looks of it, Elisa herself didn\u2019t know it existed. Jeremy then turned his head and he could\u2019ve sworn Dominique had a tail as well, except that it was small and stubby. He rubbed his eyes right before Elisa groaned. \u201cDominique! I thought you bought an extra gallon of milk.\u201d Dominique gave a snort. \u201cWell, if you don\u2019t like it, maybe you should just grow an udder like those ridiculous buffalos. By the way, Jeremy, did you know that hippos only weigh 9lbs when they\u2019re born?\u201d \u201cThey do?\u201d asked Jeremy. \u201cBut they weigh more than 3 tons as adults. That\u2019s amazing.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said Elisa not wanting to lose her bet with her wife. \u201cWell, did you know that cape buffalos are among the only bovines who can\u2019t be domesticated? Oh yeah, they\u2019re wild and that\u2019s how they like it.\u201d \u201cExcuse me, Elisa,\u201d said Dominique. \u201cBut hippos are more famous than cape buffalos. They\u2019ve been board games, been to New York, been ballerinas...\u201d \u201cWhich is why it\u2019s time for a buffalo to step in. Have you noticed that in Japanese action hero shows, they use buffalos way more than hippos. There hasn\u2019t even been a hippo-themed ranger but there\u2019s been at least one buffalo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy just let out a groan. \u201cCome on you two, this is hard enough to decide already.\u201d Elisa let out a sigh. \u201cYou\u2019re right, Jeremy. I have to get to work and you have to get to school. Just let me put my uniform on and I\u2019ll drive you.\u201d Jeremy smiled as Elisa went to put on her police uniform. Dominique then snapped her fingers. \u201cOh dang,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t forget. Tomorrow\u2019s the church bake sale. I better start getting work on those macarons. While Dominique was getting her ingredients and kitchenware ready, Elisa was having trouble getting her police uniform on. Her pants were feeling too tight. \u201cUgh,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat is with these pants? I just bought them.\u201d Elisa didn\u2019t know it, but she was growing an udder just like a cape buffalo. As she slipped on her boots, she failed to realize that her feet appeared to be turning into hooves. In no time at all, Elisa had walked down to take Jeremy to school. Jeremy looked up at her more paternal mother and realized something off. \u201cElisa?\u201d he asked. \u201cAre you getting taller?\u201d Elisa rolled her eyes because she didn\u2019t know what her son was talking about. Instead, she just walked up and kissed Dominique (who also seemed to have gotten taller). Dominique then bent over to kiss Jeremy. \u201cYou two have a good day.\u201d \u201cYou too, Dominique.\u201d Said Jeremy. Dominique gave a giggle as she remembered something. \u201cAnd remember, hippos all the way.\u201d \u201cShe means, buffalos all the way, Jeremy.\u201d Said Elisa in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Elisa walked Jeremy out the doorway, her butt appeared to be getting bigger as her belt appeared to be coming undone. Her breasts were also getting larger as well as her stomach and her black hair was getting longer as she appeared to be growing horns. Dominique on the other hand was getting much larger in the rear than Elisa and that was saying something. Her skirt appeared to look smaller on her and her skin appeared to be changing color into a golden-red shade as she walked into the kitchen and bent down to reach into the lazy Susan for flower. As she did this, she also let out a loud snort not unlike the snort of a hippopotamus. \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d she said as she failed to notice her teeth had gotten sharper. \u201cAlmond powder, granulated sugar. What else do I need.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Elisa was driving Jeremy to school and Jeremy was still looking at his textbook. Elisa didn\u2019t notice it, but her horns had gotten bigger and her face had stretched out and new resembled that of a bovine with long ears. \u201cElisa,\u201d said Jeremy. \u201cWhy do you like African buffalos so much?\u201d Elisa gave a scoff. \u201cAre you kidding? They don\u2019t have to be afraid of anything. They\u2019ve got to be the strongest bovines in the world. I guess you can say I\u2019ve always been a fan of cows.\u201d Elisa even let out a moo. \u201cOh, I had no idea where that came from. Well, here\u2019s our stop.\u201d Elisa parked in front of Jeremy\u2019s school and decided to walk Jeremy out. However, when Jeremy stepped out of the car, he looked up at Elisa in pure surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElisa had transformed into a 12 foot tall cape buffalo with a 12ft belly and 8ft butt. She had D-cup breasts, an udder as big as her head and horns that had to be 8ft long. All the students and teachers looked at her in surprise but Jeremy was trying to be calm about seeing what happened. \u201cSomething wrong, kiddo?\u201d asked Elisa. \u201cUh,\u201d said Jeremy. \u201cNothing is wrong, Elisa.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028Back home, Dominique had undergone a similar transformation. She was now a 12ft tall hippopotamus with an 8ft wide belly and 12ft wide butt and D-cup breasts. She hadn\u2019t noticed her transformation either, largely because she was wearing her headphones as she was preparing the batter for her macarons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, which of the giantesses should we follow?</span></div></div>",

Just tell me something quick, and we'll discuss it later after school, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeremy looked out at the other staring kids. Everyone, from the fat bully Jimmy Hopkins to his baseball-loving buddy Timmy, looked either scared of his newly-transformed mother; or had a look that screamed <i>Get on with it, dummy!</i> He looked back at his expectant buffalo-mom and sighed. \"Might as well get this over with...Mom, have you, uh; looked in the mirror since we left home?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Kiddo, if this is leading to a joke, it better be a good one.

Jostling her son's hair with a new hoof. \"Jeremy, what are you on about? Even if that WAS possible, I think I'd notice someth--\" She broke off as she caught sight of herself in a puddle underfoot. Staring with mouth agape, she saw that her human form was indeed gone.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dominique was so deep into her music as she was preparing the batter for the macarons that she had no idea she was now a large hippopotamus and the hippo housewife was tapping her foot on the floor to the beat, in turn causing the floor tiles to crack. Her feet had expanded so wide that her high heels cracked apart and broke off. Her butt had expanded to a degree that her skirt couldn't contain it and her panties had degenerated into a sumo thong. Whether she knew it or not, Dominique's stubby new tail was shaking from side to side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Dominique gasped and let go of her spoon before turning off her iPod. \"Oh my gosh! I'm forgetting the milk.\" Dominique waddled up to the fridge and opened the door to find out that Elisa wasn't kidding about them being out of milk. \"Drat! Elisa was right! She had better not be right about Jeremy's report for my hands' sake. Guess this is one thing that buffalos have over hippos. You can\u2019t milk a hippo. Not that you can milk a cape buffalo without getting killed either, but hippos don\u2019t have udders. Well, guess I better head to the store.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDominique failed to notice that she was now a hippopotamus and when she tried to walk out the front door, her butt got stuck and she grunted as she tried to push herself out. \u201cOh come on! I skip one flipping day on the treadmill and this happens? Wait a minute, Jeremy\u2019s not here, I can swear for real.\u201d Dominique inhales before she slips out and has to use her left leg to maintain her footing. \u201cI hope I\u2019m not putting on weight,\u201d said Dominique. \u201cFor some reason, my stomach feels like it weighs at least a thousand pounds. Oh well. Better get that milk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long before Dominique reached the supermarket and was in the dairy aisle. However, everybody in the market was staring at the 12 foot high hippopotamus woman among them. Dominique noticed the staring and was very concerned. \u201cWhy is everybody staring at me?\u201d the redhead asked to herself. \u201cIs it because of my blood red hair. Or is it because I\u2019m a lesbian. Not again. I moved to Zoomtown and married Elisa to get away from that prejudice. Calm down, calm down, Dominique. You just came for some milk. You\u2019ll be in and out... oh man, why am I hungry all of a sudden. I ate so much at breakfast. But my stomach feels like a black hole. Okay, maybe while I\u2019m here, I\u2019ll pick up a quick snack. Aha.\u201d Dominique spotted a bag of popcorn and put it into her basket. But then she saw several already prepared fish sandwiches in wrappers and picked a few up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing led to another and the redhead had brought her groceries to a check out counter and needless to say, the clerk was terrified at the hippopotamus in front of him. Dominique had also seemed to have gotten bigger as she was more than twice his size. \u201cHow much do I owe you?\u201d asked the hippo giantess. The man just fainted and the other clerk gestured for Dominique to leave before Dominique had the chance to pay. Dominique stuffed her face with the sandwiches, chips and sweets she bought and was wondering to herself what had happened. \u201cWhat was that about?\u201d she thought. \u201cWell, it\u2019s lucky for me. All this food would\u2019ve cost a large wad of cash. I only wanted to pick up some milk for my macarons but I had the biggest snack attack I\u2019ve ever seen. Why am I... huh?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDominique looked down to see that she was 20\u2019 tall if the size of the cars at her feet was any indication. Her belly was 20\u2019 feet wide and her butt was even wider. \u201cWhat on....?\u201d Dominique was then left speechless as she looked into the window of a nearby building and saw the reflection of the hippopotamus giantess she had become. When Dominique saw her reflection, she very nearly fainted and gave a look of pure shock. She walked up to the window and rubbed her snout and then lifted up her large stomach before turning around and looking at her wide booty before spanking herself and making her titanic cheeks shake. \u201cOh my... O.M.G.!\u201d Dominique took out her cell phone so she could contact Elisa and tell her what happened. However, she noticed that her fingers were much too big for the buttons and lowered her pinky finger to use her long red fingernails to press the buttons and call her wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elisa,\" said Dominique to her wife on the phone. \"You're not going to believe this but I've turned into a hippopotamus the size of a house.\" On the other end of the phone, Elisa, now a cape buffalo as big as her wife and sitting on top of a donut shop, bit her lip. \"Oh... I believe you. I just got turned into an African buffalo myself.\" \"What?! How the heck did this happen!? Maybe this is just a dream.\" Dominique pinched herself on her car-destroying booty and then grunted in pain but then looked and saw her fat golden-red hands and then let out a moan. \"It's not a dream, Elisa. But why would we turn into a hippopotamus and a cape buffalo? It doesn't make any sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElisa tossed a handful of strawberry donuts into her mouth before she spoke. \"Wait. These are the very same animals that Jeremy was trying to decide to do his report on. Our bet last night. I bet he would choose an African buffalo and you said he would choose a hippopotamus. Maybe this is a psychosomatic change. Maybe somehow through our bet, we willed ourselves into the very animals we were siding on.\" Dominique dropped her very large jaw in confusion as she showed her huge fangs. \"Elisa,\" she said. \"That is the <i>dumbest</i> thing I've ever heard! We're not psychic. Oh my goodness. What will Jeremy think when....\" \"When he learns that his other mother is a hippopotamus? You should've been at the school, I felt like I belonged in a zoo.\" \"School nothing,\" said Dominique. \"You had to go to work.\" Elisa let out a groan. \"Don't remind me. Thankfully, mutating into a buffalo big enough to wear cars as roller skates <i>doesn't</i> get you kicked off of the force.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDominique let out a sigh and then tried to sit down, only to hear a crashing sound. She rose up and saw that she had inadvertently sat on four parked cars and pressed them so flat that they were tattooed to her enormous butt. \u201cWell, this is a fine kettle of fish, Elisa. What are we gonna do about this? We sure as heck can\u2019t go on with our bet. Our fingers are too big. We\u2019d break all the dishes we have.\u201d Elisa let out a sigh. \u201cWe\u2019ll figure out where we\u2019ll go from here at the end of the day. Something tells me we won\u2019t be turning back to normal anytime soon.\" Dominique let out a groan and waddled away. \"I hate Mondays.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater...</span></div></div>",

Turning, she saw her wife, Jen, leaning in the door frame. In her hands was a small paper bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen was one to easily been seen in a crowd. At 27 years old, she was a tall woman, at least 5'10'', with bright red hair and bright green eyes. She was somewhat pudgy, but with a fair hourglass figure. She was dressing in a bright blue top with a bright yellow skirt and sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly, meanwhile, was a bit less noticeable. She was 26 years old,, and was only 5'7'', with short dirty blonde hair and dark brown eyes. She was slim, and was decently proportioned. She was wearing a green tee-shirt with grey slacks and socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth were employed. Jen worked for a law firm, while Carly worked at a nearby comic shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you ever knock?\" Carly said, a little annoyed at the interruption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen giggled. \"Absorbed in your fanfictions again, dear?\" Jen asked. Carly blushed a little, which made Jen giggled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway,\" Jen started. \"I've picked up the dry-cleaning. I also got you a little something. Found this little store near the Laundromat. Kind of a curio shop. Had an animatronic talking skull. I found this in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached into the bag and pulled out something. Carly got up to look at it. It was a pair of small necklaces with a symbol she had never seen before. It looked like it was made of gold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wow, it's beautiful.\" Carly said. \"What's the symbol?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen grinned. \"The skull said it was supposed to be an orc symbol. It did have a picture of some green-skinned orc women\" She said. \"That's why I got it for you. There's one for me too\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen knew many of Carly's loves, from true crime novels to bad horror movies but one stood out among the rest: Carly had a huge fetish for female orcs. When she wasn't browsing art sites for sexy orc pics, she was writing erotic fiction with them. She even had a type: green skin, tusks, and huge, be it fat or muscled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly's face lit up, and she immediately took the necklace and put it on. Heading over to a mirror, she looked at herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks incredible.\" Carly said. \"Thanks, babe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a problem.\" Jen said, putting on her own necklace. \"Now, I gotta go finish up that report.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Carly settled back into her chair and clenched her fists a few times--a little ritual she did to get back into writing when she was interrupted...not that she minded <i>this</i> interruption, though. Smiling, she picked up Jen's gift up and turned the necklace over, examining it. It sort of looked like stylized axes crossed over a ring of leather armor and animal skulls...but not in an evil way, more intimidating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just like orcs should be,\" she mumbled. Carly was always annoyed when female orcs were depicted as being human women with green skin and fangs. They were supposed to be fearsome barbarians; that was the whole point of orcs in the first place! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly was just about to get back to writing when she noticed something. At the right angle, the axes almost looked like an orc woman's legs; the bones beneath them like...bugs? She squinted. No, like tiny people!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Giant</i> orc women?\" Carly whispered, a grin on her face. \"Now <i>there's</i> an idea! Just imagine what they could do...\" Her eyes widened and a wide grin spread across her face. She imagined unstoppable orc giantesses casually stomping human villains, swallowing arrogant elves whole; taking over tiny kingdoms as the new rulers...oh yeah, that was <i>definitely</i> gonna be her next story! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling, she opened a new tab and typed out some quick notes and ideas--one being a warrior and the other a mage; them eating or sitting on the main villain; maybe have a human kid tag along as their mascot?--before going back to her original story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The two orcs kissed, a jolt shooting through both their bodies all the while. They held the kiss for a long while, but when they parted their smiles made it clear they were both eager for more. Smirking, the warrior gestured down the hall--to the Dark Emperor's bedchamber. This was </i> their <i>castle now, after all. Why not make that official? Arm in arm, they marched down the hall...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly didn't notice a subtle green glow coming from her new necklace, or her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n========================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen hadn't examined her new necklace like Carly had, but she liked it, even if an orc-themed piece of jewlery was a bit silly. It was like cosplay--which Carly had done before, plenty of times--but it made her wife happy, and that was what really mattered. Besides, whoever made it knew their stuff: the gold was polished and sturdy, and the axes and armor were pretty eye-catching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that went through Jen's head in a flash as she sat down at her desk and pulled up the day's report on her computer. This time it was about shady antique shops facing potential lawsuits--apparently these places had been peddling weird knick-knacks that turned some customers into monsters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cop out in Texas had become a giant minotaur<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome hippy had been turned into an aligator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was even a girl who'd become a creature like the Loch Ness Monster and <i>eaten</i> her abusive boyfriend alive. (Jen winced at that, but figured the jerk deserved it.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSightings of the shop were all over the world, but they had a few things in common: all the transformed customers were women who'd bought something from the shop, the changes were permanent; and their new forms all seemed to be both fat and gigantically tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen shook her head. \"Jeez, good thing crazy crap like that doesn't happen around here...hmm? Something else is here.\" <br>\r\nShe read the report. Apparently at all the sightings, the shop had a talking magic skull that sold its wares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen blinked. Did the shop SHE went to have that? Could she have...<br>\r\n\"No, wait--it was an ANIMATRONIC skull, not a magic one,\" Jen realized with relief. \"Thing was made of plastic. Phew!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding to herself, Jen got to work. It looked like the firm could take this case, but she'd have to see about contacting the transformed women. They could be valuable witnesses, if they agreed to help out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike Carly, Jen didn't notice the glow coming from her necklace and eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n========<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time they'd sat down for dinner, both women's skin had taken on a slight green tint. This time, they noticed it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, you okay babe?\" Carly asked. \"You don't look so good.\" She took a bite of steak, but looked concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen looked herself over. \"You're right--I look like lime Jell-O! You're a bit off, too. Do you feel sick? Maybe we should go to a doctor...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno; I feel great. Not sick at all. Maybe I've just been spending too much time at the computer? Just need to get some sun.\" Carly shrugged. \"Might need a break before I start my next story, anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen looked at her greenish arms, but shrugged. She didn't feel sick either. \"Some time outside sounds great...so what's your next story about? Orc lawyers?\" She smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but I'll keep that in mind, heh. It's about GIANT orc women! Stomping around, showing those humans and elves who's boss! I even have an idea where one of them sits on a castle and crushes it with her mighty orc booty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen laughed so hard she almost choked on her wine. \"Heh, reminds me of the case I'm on--a lady cop out in Texas got turned into a giant cow monster, and when this thug tried to shoot her she just sat on him. Wham, giant cow butt comes down! It didn't squish him, though. She took him to prison wedged between her cheeks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen was so caught up in her story she forgot about the detail of the shop, and the talking skull within. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before Carly and Jen were in bed, still wearing their necklaces as they snuggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Night, Orc Queen,\" Jen said, kissing Carly's forehead. \"Sweet dreams. Sit on some castles for me, 'kay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly returned the kiss. \"Sure, Miss Judge Dredd. As long as you arrest the Cowgirl Cop.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey shared a laugh and were soon asleep, the glow around the necklaces getting brighter. <br>\r\nTheir skin became entirely green, and tusks sprouted from their mouths. Carly's tusks were smaller and curved gently; Jen's were larger and sharper, curving harshly from her lower jaw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd they grew; both in size and in girth. Carly became more and more plump, but not so fat she was obese...still, she was quite fat. Jen became more and more muscled, looking like a bodybuilder. They also grew to Amazon heights, amost ten feet tall by the end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither stirred during the transformation, even as their growing limbs knocked over lamps, kicked down the foot of the bed, or toppled a bedside table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven their clothes changed: Carly's nightgown became flowing robes and a cape--a mage or magician's outfit. <br>\r\nJen's tank top and sleeping pants became a set of bikini-like leather armor, complete with straps and a holster for bladed weapons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end, there were two Amazon orcs where two human women had once been. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, some features of Earth that are known to be harmless to humans may or may not have strange effects on alien lifeforms. This will be a story in which we see those very effects on one particular alien being. Our story begins in Chicago where a young man is about to go on a computer chosen date that he will never forget. Our young protagonist has arrived with a box of chocolates as he is walking up to a bus stop where he is supposed to be meeting with his date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy was slightly nervous so he had to look at the address that the website had given him. \u201cVenus.com has yet to have steered anyone wrong,\u201d the young man said. \u201cOr at least that\u2019s what they say. Try, Venus.com. We\u2019ll hitch you up with a date that\u2019s out of this world. Yeah, like I haven\u2019t heard that one before.\u201d But little did that young man know was that the slogan was rather literal in this case. Something strange had appeared in the sky and appeared to be glowing. The strange thing had bounced off of several buildings and then it landed in front of the young man who looked in surprise. What had landed in front of him was a strange alien creature. However, she looked female in appearance. She was a bright yellow-skinned and blue-striped alien resembling a humanoid cross between a lemur and a spider-monkey. She had a rather long neck, stood 8-feet tall with huge hips and three long tails, a pierced nose, long blue hair worn in dreadlocks, three fingers on each hand and foot and was dressed in little more than an A-shirt and a loincloth as she looked down at the young man who was understandably afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alien woman bent down and her eyes blinked vertically rather than horizontally the way that humans did. \u201cYou are Morty Landing, right?\u201d asked the alien in surprisingly good English.\u201d The boy gave a look of surprise. \u201cHow do you know my name?\u201d \u201cVenus.com,\u201d said the alien. \u201cI take it you\u2019re my date for this evening?\u201d Morty gave a gasp. \u201cYou\u2019re Skyla?\u201d Skyla nodded her head. \u201cA date that\u2019s out of the world,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cI get it now. Very funny. It would explain why I had to travel 5,000 lightyears for a date.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re an alien! Skyla let out a nervous laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d the lemur/spider monkey-like alien said as she wagged all three of her tails. \u201cI\u2019m from Planet Lemuria. This is actually my first time on Earth. I never knew that Earthlings were so short and pale-skinned.\u201d Morty just let out a nervous giggle himself before Skyla noticed the box of chocolates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are those?\u201d she asked. \u201cWell,\u201d said Morty. \u201cOn Earth, it\u2019s tradition for a young man to give his female lover chocolates.\u201d \u201cChocolates?\u201d asked Skyla. Morty handed the box of chocolates to Skyla and Skyla sniffed at them. As Skyla was eating the first piece of chocolate, Morty crossed his fingers. \u201cI really hope that chocolate isn\u2019t poisonous to aliens.\u201d He thought to himself. However, while Skyla wasn\u2019t exactly poisoned, she made a strange noise after swallowing the first piece of chocolate and something went off inside of her. Her cells were acting weirdly to it. However, outside Skyla seemed just fine, albeit slightly dazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you alright?\u201d asked Morty. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d said Skyla. \u201cThey just don\u2019t have anything like this on my home planet. Well, the date\u2019s just started.\u201d Morty and his alien date walked off, not noticing that Skyla seemed slightly taller than she was a minute ago.</span></div></div>",

However, the effect takes time in order to activate and only effects adult women but a side effect is that the beverage in question becomes addictive and drinking more of it would only feed the effects of the formula.

Don't get into any trouble, tonight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I won't...\" The honesty dripped out of her voice as her elderly janitor left her office, leaving her alone in the entire skyscraper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe anxiously twirled her pen around in her fingers as she stared down at her papers, the only few keeping her from going home. All she had to do was look over and sign a few contracts, but with any attempt to try and get her work done, the words never seeped in through the thought of the incoming night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...what the hell am I doing?\" For all the time spent training or consulting with Blake that was the first time she'd truly asked herself that. She couldn't think of an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a tired sigh she pushed her seat back so she could lean against her desk, resting her face within her ands, but that didn't give much of a help when she still managed to catch a glimpse of her own figure. Thankfully, not many of her workers seemed to give a second glance, but she could always see her apparently slim, lithe figure tightening her belt as her abdomen curved outward in a filling amount of chub, while below her thighs had thickened out with enough paunch that they now rested together, covering more of her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This whole thing just keeps getting better and better...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat back up, letting in a long, unsteady breath. This was it. All the months of training, designing, exercising, worrying, and circling dates on the calendar had finally come, right on her doorstep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a blank face she pushed herself back up and walked away from her desk, heading out of her company and into the dark of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">.....</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, so the new suit is in the bathroom, and your belt should be ready by morning.\" Blake hobbled across the room on two crutches under either arm. \"You gonna need it before then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I should be fine.\" Cassandra took another deep breath, slapping her hands against her knees. \"Well, I'd think it's about time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake hurriedly shuffled to the bathroom as his wife stood up and worked with the latch on her belt. Once undone, her stomach swelled out so quickly that there wasn't a sliver of space behind the strap, with a growing speed that tossed the belt away, allowing her to instantly double in height, and her body below surged out in a huge expansion of fat flesh that her bed nearly tore through the wall when it was pushed away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the cacophony had subsided, Blake peeked out of the door and wilted in amazement at Cassandra's full, enormous form cramped within their bedroom, filling almost half the space with her mountainous flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, MAN that feels good!\" She whooped in delight. \"You'll <i>never</i> know how good this feels!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's a valid statement...\" Blake sighed, dragging his feet out of the bathroom by his crutches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...oh.\" Cassandra blushed in shame. \"Blake, I'm so sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, It's alright. You're not the only elephant in the room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Pfft</i>...okay, add that to the one-liners!\" She snickered. \"Anyways, I gotta gear up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs large as she was, the supercharged muscles in her van-sized legs easily lifted her gigantic weight to stomp towards the bathroom, sweeping against the flanks of her gut as she pushed it forward. The bathroom doors were built tall enough for somebody of her size to step through, but her sides still managed to brush along the edges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floorboards creaked in a loud symphony from behind the shut door, accompanied by a few muffled grunts and the sound of latex slipping along her skin, being sipped up. By the hopping nature of her steps Blake could tell there was quite a bit of labor going into her task, but with two more heavy stomps she let out a contented sigh, then walked towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the doors parted away, it looked to Blake like a complete stranger had entered the room, even if he could recognize her shape. The black spandex she wore completely smoothed out the wrinkles on her skin, with singular purple stripes running down the sleeves, legs, and the front down the long curve of her belly, long enough that it packed into the tightest region of the suit in a heaving mountain that resembled a colossal, jiggly bowling ball, while the width of her breasts tugged a long crease in the rubber that reached along the length of both. The mask she wore, save for some roundness in her cheeks, didn't shape to conform around her nose and lips at all, leaving her with a completely blank and even visage with only her eyes to help emote. Above either shoulder he could see the handles to two sledgehammers affixed to her back in a cross through her hair, which was wide and long enough that it almost acted like a substitute for her absent cape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra flexed her arms to show off her bulging biceps, which forced a giddy laugh out of her. \"Oh my gosh, <i>I look like a friggin' superhero!!!</i>\" She squeed excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Intimidation and elegance,' huh?\" Blake quipped with a smirk. \"So, what're you gonna do first?\"</span></div></div>",

Due to the event that gave her her powers, her eyes permanently glow bright red and her fingernails permanently glow bright blue. As Sky Queen, she wears a split colored yellow-orange and violet jumpsuit with glowing silver stars decorated on it. She also wears a blue tiara made up of letter Qs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Description</b>: Rebecca was originally a policewoman out in a small town where a nuclear power plant stood. The power plant\u2019s was in danger of being shut down when the CEO had the idea of attempting to harvest cosmic rays from outer space and had a rather large generator built. However, due to cutting corners, the machine was dangerously unstable and caused several electrical disturbances. Rebecca and her fellow officers were called in to investigate, but only Rebecca herself was able to enter the plant. At that moment, the generator broke down and bathed the young woman with the cosmic radiation sealed inside. As Rebecca was recovering in the hospital, she discovered that she had developed the power to control gravity and cosmic forces. However, due to her powers revolving around gravity, they require her body to have a large mass and the radiation is slowly making Sky Queen larger the more she uses these powers.</span></div></div>",

She didn't feel sick to her stomach, her head wasn't splitting open, not a single bone in her body was broken, she didn't feel any different than she did when she stepped into the plant, or even after the generator inside exploded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...but they were glowing. By whatever alien parasite could've been in her body, they were glowing, blue as the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doc, come on, you gotta check me out some more! Look at me!\" She demanded, holding her hands out with fingers splayed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Hawk, I assure you that our tests show nothing's wrong with your body. After all, we'd gone through three opinions!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're gonna need to take a fourth one, cause there's <i>no way</i> nothing's wrong! I<i> hate</i> makeup!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and yet the nails on her fingers were a brilliant dark blue. It didn't even look like they were painted over, but that the sapphire hue was their natural color, down to the roots, and sparkling in an energetic aura. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to hold them against the doctor's coat to emphasize their illumination, but he shook her off. \"Miss Hawk, my only guess as to what could be wrong is a mere case of amnesia. I assume you'd put on some nail polish this morning, only to take a blow to the head hard enough to wipe away the memory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor, <i>please!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Hawk, it's not our duty to treat a patient who has nothing wrong with her.\" He walked to his desk with his back facing her, but pulled out his chair and seated himself, gazing up at her with a condescending gaze. \"If there's no issue here, then let's leave it be and have a nice day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Have a nice day, </i>Miss Hawk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca's fist tensed, but nonetheless she spun away from him and stomped out of his office in a huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's gotta be someone I can talk to about this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">.....</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...is there such a thing as fingernails glowing?...Yes, they're blue....Well, I was doing a job in this place doing research on cosmic rays, and there was this radioactive generator that exploded during our sting, and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>click</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? <i>Hello?</i>\" But the dial tone hummed into her ear, and she slammed the phone back onto its perch. \"Come <i>on!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven brighter they were, now, enough that she could see the reflection off her fingertips. At first it'd just been a quirky sight, but now she was genuinely afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could <i>feel</i> something in her fingers. It wasn't pain, it wasn't comfort, it was just some alien energy without any definition known by earth, thriving right under the skin of her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the <i>hell </i>is happening to me?\" She said worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached to grab the phone again, but a bright blue spark glittered out of the corner of her eye, followed by the sound of a plastic smash against the ceiling, forcing her to shriek and jump in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe telephone now clung to the ceiling, broken pieces of it strewn out as if the device lay on the floor, some of them still quivering from impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...the...fuck...\" Rebecca kept staring at the phone with wide eyes for a full minute, trying to process the image as a real, breathing occurence happening in her own bedroom. Looking to her desk, she carefully reached for a styrofoam cup, but even though she hadn't touched it yet, it slid straight into her hand on its own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could feel her hand naturally pull around the cups surface, almost by some magnetic force. She let go, and gasped when the cup stayed afloat in midair, drifting away from her unfurled fingers. She gave it a poke, sending it gliding through the room, only to clatter againt the wall and fall back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...\" <i>Come to think of it, this whole thing sounds like some kind of bad comic book...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe planted her hand on the wall, then the next one, somehow gripping tightly against the flat surface. Like with the phone, as though she were on the floor, she reached higher and pulled her feet away the ground, too stunned to even whimper as she easily crawling all the way to the ceiling, which was just as easy for her wrap around and hang above her room like a bat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe touched the phone, causing it to retain its original gravity and rocket away from her to the surface above her head, only back to where she once stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...uh...\" She finally murmered, the only first word she could say to match what just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her newfound abilities stole her attention from what was happening to her, far beyond the energy coursing through her body. Looking down at the floor, she couldn't see that her already plentiful breasts had expanded another cup size, going on two, along with a gently thickening layer of paunch spreading along the rest of her body...</span></div></div>",

A young Native American woman, around 21 was reading the newspaper from her college dorm room. \"A few days ago,\" she read. \"A mysterious tomb was discovered in the heart of Transylvania. The tomb was believed to be the burial ground of Rankira, the legendary vampire queen. But upon opening the coffin, there was no trace of a body, much to the disappointment of the archaeologists. But it was reported that a strange moss was growing on the inside of the tomb and begun to dissolve when exposed to air. How weird is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the young woman's phone rang. She checked the phone to see it was her friend on the other line and answered it. \"Mira,\" said the voice on the phone. \"Where the heck are you?\" \"Oh, hi Nikki. I'm sorry, I just woke up.\" \"Well for Pete's sake, get up. We'll be late to class at this rate. Get up.\" Mira let out a sigh and then got dressed before she walked out to meet with Nikki. \"Nikki?\" she asked. \"Where are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when the ground begun to shake and Mira turned around and saw a frightening sight. There was a 10ft tall sphinx right behind her. The sphinx had pure white fur but with purple hair resembling a lion's main as well as a pair of large feathery wings. The sphinx was very fat, having a belly big enough to safely fit four full grown men inside and D-cup breasts. Mira took a closer look and saw that the sphinx woman was wearing black jeans, a white shirt and had a pierced lip and nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What....?!\" \"Hello small fry,\" said the sphinx in Nikki's voice. \"What's the matter? You look like you've seen a ghost.\" \"N-Nikki?\" asked Mira. \"What happened to you?\" Nikki just licked her lips. \"Get used to it Mira, because the same thing's happening to all gals on campus. Massive, morbidly obese and monstrous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira was terrified, her roommate was now a sumo sized sphinx who could swallow her whole if she wanted to and it looked like she'd be turning into a monster herself real soon.</span></div></div>",

You don't want to be late for art history class do you?\" Nikki starts walking away, her footsteps shaking the ground. Mira gulps and then follows her friend. Not only had Nikki turned into a monster, but Mira would have to say Nikki had to weigh at least 2000lbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMIra even had to rub her eyes because to her it looked like Nikki was actually getting bigger by the second. \"So,\" says the untransformed girl. \"Nikki. How did this happen?\" \"Heck if I know,\" says Nikki. \"I woke up this morning and suddenly I was a fat titanic sphinx. How awesome is that? I always wanted to be a giant monster. And get this, I'm not the only one like this. Every girl on campus and female professor I've seen today has mutated into some form of monster or another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira looked around and saw that Nikki wasn't exaggerating. Every girl they saw had somehow turned into a monster that was enormous in both height and weight. Some were as big as Nikki and some were even larger. Mira turned and saw a cheerleader who had been turned into a 12-foot tall succubus girl with massive thunder thighs and E-cup breasts. One female teacher had been turned into a gorgon with a large protruding stomach and she was 15-feet tall. There was even one 13-foot tall 5-ton tanuki girl walking to class with her much smaller boyfriend. Mira felt utterly small compared to the monster girls and felt her chest but then she gasped because she looked and noticed her belly was getting bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki lets out a laugh. \"Well small fry,\" she says. \"Looks like you're a late bloomer. Now you get to be a monster like the rest of us girls.\" \"What?\" asked Mira. Mira then looked back and saw that she was almost as tall as a nearby tree. She was catching up to Nikki in height. \"B-But... Nikki, exactly how big are we going to get.\" Nikki let out a laugh. \"That's the best part. The university doctor said that whatever anomaly is making all the girls grow, it won't stop until we're as big as skyscrapers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira was now very afraid and her body was still transforming.

Seeing the old oak trees around campus almost level with her was just another reminder of the impossible, insane transformations going on around her--and happening <i>to</i> her. If she looked at the ground, she could ignore it. deny it, for just a little bit longer...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that also meant she had to look right at her ballooning belly that rippled with every step she took. While Mira wasn't really vain by any stretch of the imagination, she had always took some pride in staying in shape. Now, she resembled an overgrown beach ball; she'd gone beyond morbidly obese to <i>cartoonishly fat</i>. It might have even been funny, if it weren't really happening to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira flinched when she felt a paw on her shoulder. Turning, she found Nikki standing beside her, somewhat taller than her and a little more fat. \"Easy, Mira; calm down, okay?\" Nikki said, sounding more concerned than Mira had ever heard. \"I know this all seems crazy to you, but don't just drag yourself around over what's coming. It'll take some...adjusting, but you'll come to like being one of the 'big girls'. Trust me, you'll see.\" She smiled, showing off her new fangs. \"And hey, your clothes will grow with you  no matter what. So you won't be running around naked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira couldn't help but laugh, despite her stress. \"Nikki, I...thanks for that, but I don't know if I'll ever just 'adjust' to this. I <i>won't be human any more</i>! What if I turn into something....evil? Or if I have these weird monster instincts and...and--hurt innocent people?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki snorted, but thankfully held back her snark. \"Did <i>you</i> see any of the girls doing something 'evil'? Remember the girl who became a succubus? Model student. Straight A's, proud parents, big scholarship; the works. As far as anyone knows, she hadn't gone around dragging guys to hell or anything. Even studying as hard as ever, too. No matter what you turn into, Mira, you'll still be <i>you</i>, just at a different size and shape. You won't suddenly get a craving to eat babies or something fucked-up like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira rose an eyebrow. \"But...you told me you wanted to eat your ex-boyfriend. <i>Alive.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki just shrugged. \"That's more for him being a complete asshat than me being a sphinx, but...touche.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy then, the pair had arrived at the art building. Only a few students (mostly the now-tiny guys) were entering through the front doors; the monster girls were sitting outside the building, crowding around a loudspeaker and getting out their notebooks and supplies. A few were even <i>bigger</i> than the three-storey building and had smaller monster girls sitting on their laps and shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira tilted her head. \"Well...at least all this transforming won't screw up our schedules too much. And it's a nice day out, so I guess---\" She cut herself off, holding her head. Everything got blurry, then clear, then blurry again...she felt itches, burns, tingling all over her rotund body...<br>\r\nShe knew that this was it. This was her transformation, the moment where she said goodbye to her humanity and hello to her new life as a giant, chubby beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if distant, she heard Nikki's voice. \"You're finally changing! Welcome to the club, Mira and---HOLY HELL! You're gonna be HUGE!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen everything cleared, Mira had become...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But upon reaching to pull her shirt down, her eyes widened as she felt fur on her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no.\" She lifted her blobby arm to see what beast she had become, but let out a shocked squawk as she saw that her arms were covered in thick brown feathers. She quickly cupped her wing-like hands over her mouth at the avian sound she'd made, but felt that her nose and lips had formed a hard beak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing over her large shoulder, she noticed a small pond nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Scuse me, pardon me, 'Scuse me!\" Mira delicately inquired as she lumbered towards the pond, the tiny male students fleeing in semi-panic as she trudged by. Looking down at her reflection, her eyes widened as she saw her new face, now covered with brown feathers and sporting a petite black beak between two rather swollen cheeks. Despite her engorged face, her head seemed small on her enormous body, perched over two massive breasts resting on her house-sized belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes still wide in amazement, she slowly turned her apple-shaped bulk around to observe her incredibly wide rear end, which sported a feline-esque tail above two balloon-like legs covered in fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah! I'm a gryphon!\" She uttered as she felt at her belly, which she could feel and see continue to puff out and grow fatter. She could even feel herself getting taller inch by inch. \"A gryphon who can't fly...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, whaddya think?\" Nikki's voice came from behind, now standing behind her.

I actually thought you were gonna eat him.\" \"I was,\" says Nikki with an evil smirk. \"But he tasted terrible.\" Mira didn't know if her sphinx friend was being serious or not but didn't question it. She was just glad she was a giant gryphon even if she did have a body that would make a sumo wrestler look like a twig.</span></div></div>",

Having class outside was a good experience but the dean said that the college would be renovated over the next few days to accommodate the newly transformed giants. With obese monster girls the size of skyscrapers walking about, the world was in desperate need of change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day, the sphinx and gryphon had met with some friends of theirs that had also been transmogrified.First of them was Elsa, the bookworm of the group who had been turned into a giant apple-shaped gargoyle with teal colored skin and large horns on her forehead. There was also Haley, a blonde girly girl who had been transformed into a giant blue furred wereboar. Lastly was Moira, an otaku girl who was turned into a massive cerberus. The five friends had gathered in the mountainside near campus and were having dinner as they watched the school being rebuilt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's about time they did something about the infection,\" said Haley as she swallowed a handful of burgers. \"I can't believe this happened to us so fast. Elsa, how big would you say we are now.\" The gargoyle giantess felt the ground crack beneath her massive rump before she decided to stand up and answer her friend. \"I'd say each of us has to be at least 100ft tall as of now. But I can't tell if it's really over.\" \"You're kidding,\" said Mira as she downed 30 more burgers in her beak. \"We might actually get bigger?\" Nikki smirked. \"Oh well. Bigger is better. Looks like the males are the lesser sex now. I like it.\" Moira's center head let out a laugh as her left and right heads chose down on some trees. \"Guess that means we're in charge. Do you think we can still reproduce with the bugs.\" Moira lets out a laugh at her bug comment. \"The doctor said its still possible. It seems that we've been permanently altered to give birth to male humans and female titans. Though in mine and Mira case, we don't actually give birth the traditional way.\" Said Elsa as she showed her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira gagged and almost choked on the burgers she swallowed. \"I'm going to lay eggs from now on!? The gryphon giantess yelled. Elsa nodded her head. \"And so am I. Get used to it Mira, you're going to be a skyscraper sized bird for the rest of your life.\" Haley giggled at that and shrugged her shoulders. \"Well, a blessing and a curse. Just today, I accidentally sat on my boyfriend.\" The wereboar let out a snorting laugh. \"He was so adorable. Like a little tattoo. It tickled when he tried to shake free.\" Haley giggled as Mira laughed. \"Well, earlier today, Nikki put her ex in her mouth and hocked him out in a loogie the size of a comet. It was hilarious.\" Moira smirked and let out a giggle. \"I'm surprised the sphinx didn't swallow him. I would've.\" Moira's other two heads licked their lips and rubbed their protruding stomach at that thought. Haley let out a snort. \"That reminds me, you know Professor Kay, the psychology teacher who turned into a manticore? I hear she ate her husband for cheating on her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" asked Mira in surprise. \"She could get arrested for that?\" Haley let out a snort. \"It's a changing world Mira. In ten years, husband will just be a synonym for pet.\" Elsa smirked and wiggled her large body. \"That reminds me. Spring break is in a week. Mira, this epidemic has spread throughout the world. The next time you see your folks, your mom could be a monster too.\" Mira didn't even think about that. But then again, she was already getting used to herself being a monster. Perhaps this could be fun.\" Haley guzzled a barrel full of soda and Mira did the same as Nikki was picking her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Mira phone begun to ring. \"Hold on,\" she said. \"I've got this.\" Mira held out her phone and saw that the gryphon giantess had a text from...</span></div></div>",

Literally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, what's up? My BF didn't even look that surprised when I sat on him,\" Haley added with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira re-read the text message just to be safe, then turned to her fellow monster giantesses. \"Girls...I just got asked out! Out of the blue, I have a date!\" She held her phone out in her talon and showed the others, grinning her beak off. The girls read the message and let out a cheer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoria's three heads barked in joy. \"What do you know?

Tell him if he doesn't pay his share, <i>he's</i> dinner!\" the sphinx girl insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsa tapped her chin \"Maybe you could ask him to help preen your feathers?

After a pause she added, \"And no, I'm not eating him!\" The gryphon giantess rolled her eyes and focused ahead. She really <i>was</i> starting to think this transformation was going to Nikki's head, with all her talk of eating men who annoyed or wronged her. As good a friend as she was, the Goth had a vindictive streak a mile wide; her new lease on life as a giant fat sphinx seemed to be bringing it out even more. She'd have to keep an eye on Nikki, just in case...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, Mira <i>did</i> kinda like the idea of sitting on a guy as comeuppance. The whole idea was pretty funny, actually. And going by Haley's story, her boyfriend <i>wasn't</i> instantly squished under the wereboar's massive behind. (And Haley, being a porcine monster, was even fatter and heavier than Mira or the other girls!) Maybe...maybe she <i>could</i> try that out, if Mike proved to be a jerk. Being pancaked under a multi-ton feline rump would teach him some manners right quick! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd if he turned out to be a nice guy, but into....<i>that sort of thing</i>...well,what was a little kink compared to a great night? Chucking, Mira checked her cell for the address one more time, and angled her flight towards Mike's address.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n= = =<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was ten minutes into her flight that a thought occurred to Mira. \"Hang on a second...how do I even know how to fly? I just became a gryphon this afternoon, and I haven't even <i>used</i> my wings until now?\" She wracked her brain for some explanation, but eventually gave up with a nonchalant squawk. \"Ah, hell with it. Doesn't matter--this is incredible! ...Oh, here I am.\" Looking over the estate, Mira whistled as she came in for a gentle landing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>WHUMP.</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr at least as gently as someone her size and weight could hit the ground, anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike Richard's mansion <i>didn't</i> have a big sign with <i>I'm Richer Than You!</i> on it, but it might as well have. It was one of those gigantic plantation-style places you saw in magazines: big Corinthian Columns, a red-tile roof, three floors; the works. The place was ritzy six ways from Sunday, no doubt about that...though it may have been more impressive if Mira wasn't twice the size of the entire mansion. Fancy as it was, at Mira's scale it was sort of like looking at an oversized model. That, and its plantation style stuck out like sore thumb from all the sleeker, more modern-looking houses in this part of town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite the entrance, sweetheart; but next time let's have someone flag down your landing.\" a smooth voice rang out, making Mira squawk in surprise. She darted her eagle-head down...and found none other than Mike Richards standing in her shadow, smirking up at her. He was wearing a VERY spiffy grey suit and trousers, along with a pair of shined black dress shoes. \"Or maybe meet up at an actual airstrip.\" Mira's sharp (literal) eagle eyes caught a silver Rolex watch on his wrist and a cirgarette holder--not lit--in his mouth. He looked like he'd stepped right off the set of a gangster movie...but that egotistical swagger of his somehow made the overblown look work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira chuckled nervously, noticing how her landing had left craters in the lawn and road where her lion feet had come down. And given how close Mike was, she'd very nearly flattened him. \"Er, sorry Mike. Guess we had a close call...but anyway, here I am! So, how's your first monster-girl date look, Mister Thrill-seeker?\" On an impulse, Mira sat on her haunches and struck a little pose showing off her chubby griffon form--and the outfit her friends had crafted. \"Like the dress? It's zeppelin canvas.\" For a moment, she thought about wiggling her rear to show off the dress...but threw that idea out on its head instantly. She may be a giant, fat monster, but she was going keep <i>some</i> class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike Richards rose an eyebrow, his cocky swagger dropping off for a second as he took a few steps back and looked Mira over. \"Is that a...<i>train</i> around your neck, Mira? And are those earrings Ferris wheels?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira dropped her pose, rubbing the back of her head with a wing. \"Yeah...my friends just snatched this stuff up when I needed an outfit for tonight. I never thought anything else would fit me...so what do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike answered....</span></div></div>",

I just hope your new girlfriend can defend you from your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mock turtle girl snorted again and dragged her foot on the ground. Meanwhile, Mike is looking down at the city from Mira's head as Mira flies. \"I feel like I'm king of all I survey.\" \"Oh really?\" asks Mira. \"Does that make me the queen? Where are we headed anyway?\" \"There it is up ahead.\" Said Mike as he pointed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere was their date headed...</span></div></div>",

Beth grunted and then smiled at the bridesmaid. \"Thanks Emily.\" She said. \"What is with this dress? It fit perfectly last night.\" Emily looks down at her friend and noticed that her belly and ass seemed to be getting bigger. \"Putting on a little weight are we Beth?\" Beth notices Emily's stomach bulging and pokes it. \"Like you're one to talk. Besides, I've actually been working hard to <i>lose</i> weight for the wedding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth smiles. \"Finally,\" she said. \"My new life with David. I can't believe it's already happening.\" Beth walks forward and smiles before groaning and rubbing her head. She had accidentally bumped it on the ceiling and then she looked up in confusion. \"Geez, I didn't think the ceiling was so low.\" Emily then gasped. \"Beth?\" she asked. \"Are you getting taller.\" Beth gave a look of confusion at her friend. \"What are you talking about?\" she asked. \"I...\" Beth then gasped because for some reason, her friend was now half her height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother bridesmaid walked in. This time she was a redhead, from the looks of it, she was the maid of honor. \"So, my BFF is finally walking down the alter.\" Beth smiles. \"Hey Lyd...ia?\" Beth gasps and steps back because not only is Lydia as tall and heavyset as herself, but the redhead now has a fox like face and from the looks of it, nine fox tails. \"Lydia?\" asked Beth. \"You look different.\" Lydia raises an eyebrow. \"What do you mean? I know I felt heavier when I woke up this morning but I definitely wasn't as big as your mom. I mean, how do you gain so much weight  overnight. David already started to make cracks about your mom having her own...\" \"No, Lydia,\" says Emily. \"Your face, you look like a kitsune.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLydia raises an eyebrow. \"I expect Beth to be stressed about the wedding, but you? Just try not to be crazy when it's time to walk down the alter.\" As her kitsune friend waddled away, Beth suddenly had the feeling that her life was changing in a whole different way.</span></div></div>",

It's weird, <i>you're</i> the one getting married. Why am I the one seeing things?\" Beth just let out a sigh. \"Could it be physically possible for stress to cause contagious weight gain and hallucinations. I just hope we can get through this wedding without things getting too strange.\" Emily let out a giggle and walked away. As she did, Beth noticed that he friend appeared to be growing a devil's tail and gasped before rubbing her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the church at that moment, it was becoming apparent that there wasn't any hallucination involved. All the female guests at the wedding were not only expanding in height and mass, but they were beginning to transform as well, into different types of monsters. The preacher was trembling as he looked at what was going on while the other male guests only looked in surprise. The only one not unnerved in the slightest was the groom, David Harnell. \"There's an evil aura in the air,\" said the preacher. \"For what reason has this curse been cast upon us. Has He forsaken us? Is it not too late to repent.\" The preacher stepped back as the bridesmaids were all growing to the same high as Lydia who was finally realizing something strange was happening. She looked back at her monstrous butt that was riding through her dress before wagging all nine of her tails. \"Why doesn't anyone tell me these things?\" she asked with a grunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid just rubbed his chin. \"That tomb in Transylvania?\" he asked. \"I wonder. If that's the case, why is it only women were affected. I wonder if Beth if... meh, I could get used to a monster wife.\" Mrs. Harnell, the groom's mother at this point had turned into a 15ft tall cyclops and appeared to still be growing as she tried to adjust her glasses that would no longer be suitable enough as her eyes merged into one giant one. \"Perhaps the wedding should be cancelled,\" she said. \"I can still feel myself growing and I'd hate to see what kind of creature my future daughter-in-law becomes.\" The preacher was shaking. He didn't know how to respond. Part of him thought that was a good idea, but another part of him didn't like the idea of heeding the words of a demonic looking creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, David just looked him in the eye. \"Nobody is canceling anything,\" he said. \"The phrase is for better or for worse.\" \"It didn't mention anything about weird, Sweetie,\" said the groom's mother. \"It's not too late to...\" That was when she heard a hissing noise and turned to Mrs. Robinson, the bride's mother, who had turned into a 20ft tall and obese gorgon who had to keep her eyes closed to keep her deadly gaze under control. \"What's the matter, Iris?\" she asked. \"You think my daughter wouldn't be good enough as a monster?\" Iris just let out a scoff. \"And risk her turning into a snakehead like you, Jacqueline. I do not like the idea of my son being turned into a statue.\" Jacqueline let out a hiss. \"Don't tempt me to open my eyes. At least I have two of them. The two giantesses are about to fight but David holds up his hands. \"Stop it!\" he yelled. \"This is a church! Remember!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe preacher let out a groan as he knew there was no way he could escape this plague that seemed to envelop around the area. The organ played and it wasn't long before Beth was walked out by her much smaller father and at this point, she was as big as her mother. All her new weight seemed to be going to her hips and breasts as they were shaking with every step. She was embarrassed but her groom only looked on in shock and awe before letting out a whistle as his bride was walked up to his side. The groom saw that he only reached up to her knee. Beth let out a groan. \"At least I'm not a monster... yet.\" She said. \"And let's hope for a real wild once it's over with,\" said David. \"Like beauty and the beast rolled into one.\" Beth let out a laugh before the ceremony was about to commence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the preacher was speaking, both Beth and David were wondering how this monster plague started and more importantly, what Beth would turn into. Beth even turned to see that Emily had turned into a succubus and was hiding behind Lydia's vulpine hulk due to the environment being the last place any succubus should be caught dead in. Finally the moment came. \"Do you, David Harnell take Beth Robinson to be your lawfully wedding wife... no matter what she turns into.\" David let out a scoff. \"What?\" he asked. \"You think I'm shallow. Of course I do.\" The preacher gave a nervous laugh and then spoke again. \"And do you, Beth, take David to be your husband. For normal or for weird?\" Beth nodded her head. \"And now by...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the preacher could finish his sentence, Beth grabbed her head and begun to twitch as she started to grow bigger and saw that she was transforming. \"David!\" she yelled as her groom held her by the leg. \"Don't fight it!\" yelled David. \"It's better sooner or later. Now let's see that virus bring out the monster in you. All the other monsters and the human men moved back as the transformation was underway and Beth was transformed into a giant...</span></div></div>",

She let out a bird like shriek before a pair of giant pair of dark gray wings came out of her back and tore her dress. \"Beth!\" yelled Jacqueline as the gorgon giantess watched her daughter morphing. \"What are you becoming?!\" \"From the looks of it,\" said the bride's father. \"I'd say a gryphon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Robinson was quickly proven wrong as Beth's lower body turned into the thick legs of a zebra with red candy cane style stripes and a pair of hooves that could easily crush cars. As Beth reached the 40ft mark, her hair glowed red as the transformation was almost complete, all while her future husband looked up with a bleeding nose. \"Is it wrong that I find her more attractive this way that she looked before?\" he thought to himself. When Beth stopped transforming, she had become a giant hippogriff. She looked down at her equine rear that was as wide as the church would've been if the giant monsters hadn't caused it to break apart just now. She then saw that each breast looked as big as a truck and gave an uneasy look before feeling her beak. \"Couldn't I have turned into a normal monster?\" she asked. However, she then grunted because she felt someone climbing the ruins of her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down to see David having climbed up her left breast and was at level with her beak. He looked down at the preacher with a glare. \"It's rude to gawk,\" he said. \"Continue. The preacher nervously got back into place before continuing. \"I now pronounce you, man and... wife? You may now kiss the... bride.\" Beth was surprised at first but then she saw David kissing the tip of her beak and knew she couldn't fight it as everyone around clapped. \"You seriously don't mind me being a hippogriff?\" asked Beth. David smiled and looked his new hippogriff wife in the eye. \"Stranger things have happened.\" \"Liar.\" Thought Beth. Though she did have to admit, this worked out well, despite what had just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n//////////////////////////////////////<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days after the wedding, Beth and David were on their way to their honeymoon and Beth was flying through the air with her husband on her back. At this point she had grown to 80ft tall and 130ft wide and was having fun flying through the air. \"Woohoo!\" she yelled. \"And to think, I used to be afraid to fly.\" David let out a laugh as he stroked the tip of his wife's beak. \"What choice do you have now babe?\" he asked. \"You'd never fit in the most jumbo of jumbo jets. I just read the paper. Where we're going, your mutation won't look out of place.\" \"Well,\" said Beth. \"At least we can enjoy our honeymoon without worrying about any stares. Seriously, you don't mind that our children might hatch from eggs?\" \"It's too soon to think of that, Doll,\" said Beth. \"Two lovebirds just starting the chapter to their new life. The wife being a giant obese horse bird is a nice touch.\" \"Well,\" says Beth. \"With the weight gain this weird virus put on me, it's a wonder I <i>can</i> fly\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them laughed to each other before landing in...</span></div></div>",

She smiled a smile that reached all the way to both sides of her beak. \"I can't believe it, David,\" she said to her new husband. \"We're actually in Paris. I never thought that I'd actually go to Paris one day.\" David let out a laugh as he stood on his wife's shoulder. \"We only get married once, Beth. And I definitely only ever marry a giant hippogriff once.\" Beth gave a self-conscious look on her face. \"Seriously?\" she asked. \"You don't mind me mutating into a skyscraper-sized bird built like a sumo wrestler?\" David let out a scoff. \"Are you kidding, you look better now than you did as a hu...?\" David quickly shut up to avoid angering his giant wife so soon into their marriage. However, Beth simply shrugged her shoulders. \"I'm choosing to take that as a compliment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Beth was walking further and further down into Paris, David realized that she seemed to have actually gotten slightly larger since she landed in Paris. The hippogriff woman was now 110ft tall with a 150ft ass, a 130ft wide belly and huge breasts that each had to be 35ft wide. He was wondering if she had finally stopped growing as the hippogriff lady stomped down the street. Beth looked in surprise as well, from the looks of it, Paris had been completely restructured if not magically altered because all the buildings were big enough to house the giant monster women. \"Well,\" said Beth jokingly. \"This is interesting. And I was so looking forward to using the Eiffel Tower to pick my teeth.\" David let out a laugh at his wife's joke. \"I didn't think that hippogriffs had teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth was far from the only giant monster girl because every last adult woman she saw was as humongous and obese as she was. However, there was one thing that she noticed. Most of the French giantesses she saw were gargoyles. Beth turned to see that there was a waitress at the nearby cafe who was a large green gargoyle woman with fin-like wings and long circular horns in the center of her forehead with purplish red hair. This waitress was as tall as Beth but actually looked fatter and her waitress outfit looked tattooed onto her body. Beth then looked into the air and saw another obese female gargoyle, this one dressed as a policewoman. From the looks of it, she was yellow skinned with long downwards curving horns, pterodactyl-like wings, a devil's tail and golden blonde hair. She was so big and fat that Beth found it hard to believe that she was indeed flying through the air. Beth also turned to see that there were a few giant women of different species than gargoyles. One of them was an enormously obese mermaid woman with aqua-colored hair and the lower body of a kissing gourami, with the lips to match. She felt her massive belly and blew a kiss as she was posing for a painting done by a male artist who was standing on the table in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth let out a whistle. \"It would seem that Paris has had a much more successful time adjusting to this epidemic than back in New York.\u201d David then saw an orange-skinned gargoyle girl who had a beaked face and curved horns. She was wearing a pair of khakis and a pink tanktop that both looked tattooed to her enormously fat body. From the looks of it, she was carrying her boyfriend in her purse. This prompted Beth to stare smugly at David. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about it, David said to his much larger wife.\u201d Soon, the newlyweds had reached a hotel that read L\u2019Escargot D\u2019Argent and smiled as they walked in. The female hotel manager was a 250ft tall and equally wide gargoyle woman with palish blue hair, small stubby horns on her forehead, rather small wings and a long tail. She was wearing silver earrings, a black shirt that had devolved into a brat on her monstrously obese breasts, purple shorts that were coming apart at the sides and a white jacket. From the looks of it, she was also smoking a cigarette. \u201cBonjour et bienvenue,\u201d said the gargoyle woman to the Harnells. \u201cWelcome to L\u2019Escargot D\u2019Argent.\u201d \u201cBonjour, Mademoiselle,\u201d said David. \u201cIt\u2019s under Harnell. The honeymoon suit.\u201d \u201cBon, bon. Congratulations.\u201d As the manager was rooting around for the keys, Beth was looking all around and took note of all the enormous monster women all around and even saw an obese werewolf woman as big as herself who appeared to be dressed as a hooker and she was even blowing a kiss to some male guests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the Harnells were checked in, they were escorted to their room by a female bellhop who appeared to be a bright red skinned and obese brunette gargoyle with four arms. Beth tipped the bellhop before she went into the room to unpack her bags. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing,\u201d said Beth. \u201cEveryone else appears to have gotten use to what\u2019s happening. If I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d say this virus affected reality as well.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know if it is a virus so much as a curse, Beth,\u201d said David as he stood on the pillow. \u201cI guess we were starting a new life in more ways than one.\u201d The Harnells smiled and then shared a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do they do now after the lovely couple is done unpacking?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Down below, Beth looked down to see that she was flying up to Hawaii and saw that David wasn\u2019t kidding. There were dozens of monster giantesses and they were all as obese as Beth was. Some of them were even more inhumanly huge and obese. From the looks of it, the virus only effects adult women given that all the men and children were still humans and absolutely tiny compared to the monster women. There was an enormous kappa woman who was swimming through the ocean while there were children playing on her shell. On the beach there were four monster giantesses who were playing volleyball including a giant bright reddish-pink manticore girl, a golden brown skinned European dragon woman with large tusks braided into her hair, a giant pink baku girl in Gothic attire and a pitch white-skinned banshee woman with black makeup. They appeared to be bouncing a volleyball off their large girths. \u201cYou weren\u2019t kidding around, David,\u201d said Beth. \u201cWhatever happened to me apparently works fast. I wonder how the wildlife are adjusting?\u201d David then looked down at the ocean and saw enormous fin-tailed creatures moving through the water. \u201cWell,\u201d he said to his new wife. \u201cAt least you don\u2019t have to worry about the whales.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth raised an eyebrow and then took a closer look because she realized something that David didn\u2019t. \u201cThose aren\u2019t whales, David.\u201d This was true because the \u201cwhales\u201d surfaced out of the water and revealed themselves to be obese Hawaiian mermaids who immediately noticed David on Beth\u2019s back and one enormous mermaid with the tail of an amberjack even whistled at David. \u201cAloha,\u201d she said in a seductive tone. \u201cWelcome to Honolulu.\u201d \u201cForget it!\u201d yelled David nonchalantly. \u201cThis is my wife I\u2019m flying in on.\u201d One mohawked mermaid with the tail of parrotfish just let out a scoff. \u201cYou married that horse bird?\u201d she asked. \u201cI\u2019m twice as big as her and I\u2019m more beautiful.\u201d Beth just gave a smirk. \u201cBut you can\u2019t leave the water, so I have the better end of the transformation stick. The parrotfish mermaid got so mad she spat out a stream of water at the hippogriff giantess, only for Beth to move out of the way and laugh it off. \u201cI never was too fond of mermaids,\u201d said David. \u201cToo wild for my taste.\u201d However, as David looked back at Beth\u2019s striped tail, he realized that his wife appeared to have gotten bigger. \u201cUh, Beth,\u201d said David. \u201cI think you\u2019re putting on weight.\u201d Beth let out a laugh. \u201cCome on, David. I\u2019m a hippogriff the size of a skyscraper. How could you possible tell if I\u2019ve put on weight?\u201d Of course, David was not wrong about his wife getting bigger. The hippogriff woman was now 110ft tall with a 150ft ass, a 130ft wide belly and huge breasts that each had to be 35ft wide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was wondering if Beth had finally stopped growing as the hippogriff lady landed on the beach with a large thump and created a mild sandstorm. Beth blushed in embarrassment and realized that she had indeed gotten larger. \"Well,\" she said. \"I guess maybe I am getting larger. I hope that this virus doesn't turn women into planets.\" Beth then moaned in ecstasy because David climbed up her red hair and was scratching the side of her head. \"Well,\" said David. \"As far as you should be concerned, you're a planet all for me and you've got the most beautiful pair of moons I've ever seen.\" \"Flatterer,\" said Beth with a laugh at her husband. \"I definitely made the right choice marrying such a charmer.\" Beth then gave David a rather large smooch, coating her husband in hippogriff slobber. \"Dang,\" said David. \"I wasn't planning to get this wet until the bedroom.\" \"Come on,\" said Beth. \"There has to be a hotel around here somewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth walked down the street and noticed Hawaii's streets had gotten much larger, obviously reconstructed in order to best allow the giantesses to move around. The palm trees were also as big as skyscrapers, leaving Beth to wonder if the virus was mutating the world itself. The hippogriff giantess and her husband saw several couples much like them who appeared to be on vacation. Each consisted of a tiny human man and a giant obese monster woman. There was one werewolf giantess with bright reddish-brown fur and long blonde hair and a pair of glasses. She was so morbidly obese that Beth wondered how she could move. The wolf giantess was dressed in a swimsuit and from the looks of it, her husband was riding in her navel. Beth then looked out to see that on the beach, there was a hula girl who had appeared to have been mutated into a giant and obese lizard woman resembling a giant purple and orange-spotted gecko. She was catching a lot of stares in her hula skirt. This prompted David to imagine Beth herself in a hula skirt and no bra and juggling burning batons. This thought prompted David to stuff his nose with tissue to prevent it from bleeding. \"In many ways,\" he said. \"I think she looks better as a hippogriff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth then noticed a hotel up ahead and passed by a female bellhop who had been transformed into an enormous cyclops. The cyclops girl had bright blue skin with dark indigo colored hair and white leaf tattoos all over her body. Her red bellhop uniform looked more like a thong and bra trying to contain her enormous girth At the front desk, the receptionist appeared to be a bright golden-furred minotaur giantess who looked bigger than Beth. She had long brown horns, a pierced nose and long golden-brown hair with a flower worn into it and a flower tattoo right above the rolls of fat on her back. The receptionist had an enormous ass and breasts and an even more enormous udder and from the looks of it, she was completely naked. The minotaur giantess was biting away at a giant apple right before she realized that the Harnells were right behind her. The minotaur giantess didn't even bother to turn around because apparently she had been weighed down by her own colossal ass and udder. \"Aloha,\" said the minotaur woman. \"Welcome to Hawaii. We don't get a lot of hippogriffs around here.\" \"I noticed,\" said Beth. \"I take it Hawaii was hit before my hometown was.\" The minotaur giantess had eaten her apple to the core and then decided to swallow the core before talking to her avian customer. \"The curse actually spread all the way from Transylvania when some idiots tried to open a strange tomb of some sort.\" The minotaur giantesses then let out a hiccup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you probably don't care about that. Room for one?\" \"Room for two actually,\" said David. \"It's in the honeymoon sweet.\" The minotaur let out a moo as she reached for the key rack and then handed Beth the key to the room. \"Congratulations. You've the seventh pair of newlyweds we've had today. I guess these new husbands like their brides extra wide.\" David smiled and grabbed the side of Beth's face. \"Thank you,\" said Beth to the receptionist. \"We're definitely going to enjoy this.\" Beth waddled up the stairs and found the room and to her surprise, it looked like a luxury suite scaled specifically for a girl of her size. \"Whoa, Mama.\" She said. The hippogriff goddess walked up and sat on the water bed before she placed David down. He could barely stand and had to lean against his wife\u2019s zebra-striped ass. \u201cThey really pulled out all of the stops here, Beth,\u201d said David. \u201cI can definitely imagine us having fun in this bed.\u201d \u201cJust don\u2019t get too close to the pillow, David,\u201d said Beth. \u201cI don\u2019t want to mistake my tiny husband for a mint and gulp him down.\u201d \u201cWhy not?\u201d asked David smugly. \u201cI\u2019ll bet your insides look just as gorgeous as your outsides my avian goddess.\u201d Beth smiled and held her butt just inches above David\u2019s tiny form. \u201cNow you better watch it, Honey Love,\u201d said the hippogriff seductively to her tiny husband. \u201cIf you keep flattering me, I\u2019m going to flatten you under this meteor ass of mine.\" David just rubbed the underside of his wife's ass and pleasured her before she stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be right back, David,\" said the hippogriff goddess. \"I bought a new swimsuit at a store Lydia told me about that started catering to titans like me.\" David saw Lydia walking away shaking her ass as she went to try on her new swimsuit. \"Personally,\" he said to himself. \"I'd prefer if she never wore clothes ever again. Damn, I'm gonna enjoy this marriage.\" In seconds, Lydia walked out wearing a skin tight...</span></div></div>",

Aside from the messy brown hair and her clothes, she bore no resemblance to the lady she'd gone on the trip with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah\u2026what the fuck's going on here?\" Frank whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2026I feel funny\u2026\" Dana exclaimed as she held at her abdomen, which the two realized was becoming rounder and bigger. A button popped off of her shirt as her girth expanded, revealing her yellow-feathered stomach beneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two backed away in a stupor as they watched their friend inflate with speed, blowing up to obesity in an instant. She grew taller as well, making her all the more mountainous than the diminutive girl she once was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GET ME OUTTA HERE!\" Frank screamed, Dana by that point seven feet tall. Susan didn't join him as he struggled to open the door to escape, instead watching in astonishment as her friend transformed before her eyes, filling more and more of the room with her immensely obese body. Dana herself only seemed somewhat surprised; not scared or excited, but trapped in a dazed stupor as her chin rested on her gigantic breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough she was almost fifteen feet tall, her belly looking like a fat, feathered planet with huge breasts and blobby arms and legs hanging from the sides. Susan had long since joined Frank in trying to get out, Dana's expanse only within a few feet at the room grew more cramped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the telltale cracking from the floor that came as the floor beneath them buckled under Dana's monstrous size, finally collapsing and sending Dana through the floor screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn what little floor was left, Susan and Frank desperately clung onto the wall and looked down through the floor into the room below, Dana sprawled on the ground with her mountain of a belly still jiggling from the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DANA?\" Susan finally hollered. \"ARE YOU ALRIGHT?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The next thing Susan knew, golden brown fur grew over her body as her face twisted into that of a lioness and her golden reddish hair started to grow rapidly. Her fingers and toes turned to claws as she sprouted a pair of leathery red wings. Finally, she got on all fours and let out a roar as a large red scorpion's tail sprouted above her mountainous rear. She had turned into a manticore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd not a small one either. Both she and her phoenix friend, Dana, had expanded to 50ft and were pushing against the walls of the tomb. Frank tried to get out of the way but he found himself sandwiched between the fat rolls of both the phoenix and the manticore that were his friends. The two girls continued to grow and managed the crack the walls, causing the ceiling to burst as both monsters looked up and saw the moon. They managed to flap their wings and fly out of the ground with Frank clinging to Susan's tail and screaming. \"This has got to be some kind of nightmare!\" he yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth alas, it was no dream. Both titanesses hit the ground and created a slight tremor. \"Oh no,\" says Susan. \"Look at me. I look like something that should be flying in the Thanksgiving Day parade.\" \"Well,\" says Dana. \"If there's a monster sumo tournament we both...\" Suddenly, Susan grabbed her stomach and heard it rumbling. She then saw Frank standing on the ground and her eyes widened. \"Susan?\" asked Frank in concern. \"Why are you looking at me like that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan opened her mouth to show her hundreds of razor sharp fangs and begun to drool. \"Frank,\" said Susan as she wagged her scorpion tail. \"Did I ever tell you that you looked absolutely scrumptious?\" Frank gasped because he realized something.

Susan?\" Dana smiled as best she can with her new beak while Susan gave an unnerving smile that shows her hundreds of razor sharp fangs. Violet even shook at the sight before stepping back. \"Glory be.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Violet had taken a sample of both Susan and Dana's blood as both monsters, at that point, each 150ft tall, rubbed their arms in pain. \"Violet,\" said Dana. \"Did you have to take so much blood?\" Susan even begun to pant. \"Why?\" she asked. \"Why am I so hungry?\" Susan let out a slight roar as Violet took a look at their blood under a microscope. \"Well,\" said Violet. \"The good news is that this isn't a curse. The bad news is that we're dealing with a virus.\" \"What?!\" yelled Frank. Dana then realized something. \"That's right. Susan transformed right after she touched me.

This virus spreads directly into the air and infects hosts; the side effects include uncontrolled growth, rapid weight gain and finally bizarre transformation. There's no telling what the infected may become.\" Frank then realized something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" he said. \"Violet. Is the virus going to hit me?\" Violet shook her head. \"It would appear that whatever this virus is, hosts with a Y chromosome are immune to it. In layman's terms, it only affects women. \"Swell.\" Groans Susan. \"It gets worse,\" said Violet. \"The virus is incurable. By the time it stops, the damage is done and the victim will have already grown to be at least 100ft tall. It could take years, months or even days but soon, there won't be a human woman left untransformed.\" Frank, Susan and Dana gasped. \"That virus must've been created by the vampire queen to bring in another era of monsters,\" said Violet. \"I'm afraid you three made a grave mistake entering.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDana then scratched the side of her head with a wing. \"Wait, shouldn't you be transforming right now as well, Violet?\" Violet's eyes popped as she realized that and then she screamed as she held her chest and begun to transform into a...</span></div></div>",

The wind was knocked out of Dana's lungs as she struck the ground and rolled away, dazed from the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Dana pushed herself back up, the gryphon put Frank back in and gave charge with an angry squawk. Quickly she pushed and rolled herself away like a ball, just in time to dodge the gryphon's fist as it smashed into the ground. Thinking quickly, Dana pushed herself up and ran straight into the gryphon in the belly, who let out a loud \"GUH!\" as she flew back and landed on the ground, jiggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlapping, Dana leapt up and bounded herself to the gryphon, ready to attack again. But the dazed gryphon came to and grabbed her as flew within reach, standing back up and throwing her against the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith much more struggle than before, Dana pushed herself back up, her blurred sight slowly clearing up. However, a stomping noise nearby signaled the approach of the gryphon, her fist tensed as she towered over the weakened phoenix, ready to finish the fight.</span></div></div>",

The gryphon looked up in surprise but Dana lit herself on fire before she let out a shriek herself and flapped her wings to strike the gryphon and knock the bloated bird over. The gryphon struggled to try and raise her massive hulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the obese lion bird was struggling, her breasts shook and freed Frank as he slid down the rolls in her chin and hit the ground. The gryphon spotted him and reached for him, but this time, Frank ran for it while the gryphon was immobilized. By the time the gryphon finally got up, Frank had hid behind Dana's leg and Dana looked down at the smaller bird giantess and made the gryphon squawk in fear. Dana lit her entire body on blue fire and the gryphon took the hint. She let out a snarl before she flapped her wings and flew away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right!\" yelled Dana. \"And don't come back!\" Dana looked down and saw Frank sighing in relief. \"Thanks Dana,\" said Frank. \"I can't believe it, she was gonna eat me. At least Violet and Susan fought against their temptations.\" Dana picked up Frank with her feathered fingers and placed him on her shoulder as she smiled. \"Hey,\" she said. \"It's a good thing that this viral curse isn't over yet and made me big enough to scare Bitchzilla off.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, both Dana and Frank heard earthquakes and looked to see that Violet had finally caught up with them and the blobby werewolf was now the same size as her phoenix friend. She was panting and sweating meteors before she spotted Frank safe and sound. \"Thank goodness,\" said the werewolf catching her breath. \"It would seem some women are letting their transformations go to their heads and turning into cannibalistic fiends.\" \"Uh,\" said Frank. \"Hello, you were considering eating me yourself, wolf girl.\" Violet let out a nervous laugh before she remembered something. \"Susan!\" she yelled. \"That gryphon did a number on her. We better find her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDana placed Frank on Violet's back before both monster titanesses ran to check up on their manticore friend's injuries.

The now 1500ft tall manticore was being bandaged up by a monster giantess who was just as big and obese as her. This monster giantess was a titanic gargoyle with gold brownish skin and long indigo blue colored hair that shined in the moonlight and reached all the way down to her mountain sized rear. She was wearing nothing more than a black shirt that might as well be a bra on her enormous breasts as well as a pair of blue jean shorts that looked like dental floss on her thunderous thighs. She had a pair of bat-like wings growing out of her back, horns sprouted across her forehead and a long reptile-like tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gargoyle girl appeared to be applying some kind of healing aloe to Susan's wing. The new giantess turned her multiple-chinned head to face Violet, Dana and Frank and Violet responded by growling in caution. \"Relax, Werewolf,\" said the gargoyle giantess. \"I'm not an enemy. Your friend here was lucky. Nothing appears to be broken, but I wouldn't recommend moving around.\" Susan turned and faced her phoenix, werewolf and human friends. \"Elisa showed up just as soon as that gryphon left. She said she was a nurse from America who was on vacation around these parts. From the looks of it, she got monsterfied the same time we did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet and Dana were still cautious and approached slowly as Elisa smiled and held out a clawed hand. Frank nervously shook her pinky and then looked up at her. \"Kinda ironic that someone with your name ended up turning into a gargoyle.\" Elisa rolled her eyes. \"What are the odds? Well, you won't have to worry about me eating you. As far as I know, my new species is harmless to humans, or more accurately men since they're the only humans left on this planet.\" Violet gasped and held out her jaws. \"You're kidding!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" said Elisa as she rubbed her 1000ft wide belly. \"At least not in Romania. I was just in town and the entire female population was mutated.\" Frank was now very afraid and hid in Violet's hair. \"It's official,\" he said. \"The age of man is over.\" \"I don't believe it.\" Says Dana. Elisa just helped Susan up as soon as she was done treating the wounds. \"Believe it. I'll show you.\"</span></div></div>",

But that's scientifically impossible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, I'm just as confused about it as you are\u2026but that's only the half of it. Look!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four giantesses reached the edge of the woods, and aside from Elisa, the three of them gawked to see that the houses of the bordering village had grown as well, reaching half their heights. However, that didn't raise a finger to the newly blown up population, specifically the females who had shed their species into gigantic, astoundingly obese creatures of varying sizes and origins. Some seemed only large enough to live in their homes, while others were tall enough that they could flatten them under their massive rears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah\u2026\" Violet uttered under her breath, completely amazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-This is\u2026This isn't happening!\" Frank stammered. \"This is like some\u2026dream, or something! Some really, really, weird dream!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I certainly remember waking up this morning\u2026\" Elisa sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What about the guys?! What happens to us!!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2026I'm not sure. Thankfully, about half the female population are still the same people before they'd transformed, so not everything will change, but the other half\u2026well\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank gulped, a look of dread on his face as sweat dripped from his brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we're still the same. Right, girls?\" Dana insisted, which the other three seconded. \"\u2026and trust me when II say we're not gonna let anything happen to you, Frank! We'll see to that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\u2026thanks\u2026\" Frank mumbled, only barely calmed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Violet stretched her mouth open wide, giving a long yawn that bore all her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, I dunno about you guys, but I'm gonna hit the hay. We got a lot of stuff ahead of us, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm getting pretty tired, too\u2026\" Susan added, which the other two added. \"We're we gonna sleep, though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, seeing as we're monsters and reserve the right to do whatever we want, I'm just gonna excite my right to sleep wherever I want\u2026and I just wanna sleep here.\" Slipping off her glasses, Violet rolled forward and laid on top of her own balloon-like belly, rubbing it affectionately. She rested her chin on her own furry breasts, giving a contented sigh. \"G'night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, good night. The other three laid down the same way, surprised by how comfortable their own bodies were as beds. Dana placed Frank laid Frank down her gigantic, feathery breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night, Frank.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh\u2026good night, Dana\u2026\" Frank lazily replied, still unable to grasp all the craziness going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDana slowly shut her eyes with a soft smile on her face, her body rising and falling with her breaths.

He had no choice but to grab onto one of Dana\u2019s feathers that was as thick as a tree before he forced himself to stand as the monstrously large Phoenix stood up. Dana then gasped and looked all around to see that she had actually gotten larger and fatter. She was now 2000ft tall, had E-cup breasts (in scale), a 2000ft wide belly and a 2200ft wide butt. She had a prominent double chin that made one wonder how she could even move her beak. She let out a scream that woke up Violet, Elisa and Susan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girls had gotten quite large themselves. Susan was now 2500ft tall, making her the biggest of the monster girls and the manticore\u2019s wings looked so undersized that she barely looked capable of flight. She appeared to have four chins and E-cup breasts along with a 2750ft wide butt and an 1800ft wide belly. The manticore bore her hundreds of teeth as she tried to feel all around her body with her large and flabby, sausage-like claws. \u201cOh my.\u201d She said. Elisa stood up and revealed that she was 2200ft tall with a 2600ft wide belly, 2300ft wide ass, F-cup breasts and three chins. The gargoyle at this point was the only one of the quarter wearing clothes. However, her jeans had devolved into a mawashi while her black shirt was now only covering her nipples as her dark-colored hair blew in the wind. Her wings were still big enough to allow her to fly, but her tail was so thick that it looked like a bloated anaconda. Finally, there was Violet and at this point the werewolf giantess was 2200ft tall but with huge H-cup breasts, a 2300ft wide belly, three chins, a 2200ft wide rear. Her silver fur glistened in the moonlight as her naked body gleamed and her ponytail had even come undone. All she was wearing was her pair of glasses. \u201cGood grief.\u201d Said Violet. Elisa then noticed Frank dangling off of Dana\u2019s breast before plucking him off and holding him between her fleshy golden yellow fingers. Frank looked and saw that the ground was obscured by the four ginormous monster girl bellies beneath him and he could barely speak at what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell this is an interesting development,\u201d said a very nervous Dana as she fiddled with her own beak.\u201d Susan let out an exasperated growl. \u201cThis is just terrific,\u201d said the poisonous feline giantess. \u201cLook at us. We\u2019ve actually gotten bigger and fatter in our sleep.\u201d Violet let out a sigh. \u201cWell,\u201d she said. \u201cThe good news is that I think that it\u2019s stopped right now. Of course, Susan was very still, very unamused with the development.\u201d \u201cLook at me,\u201d said Susan. \u201cI have got to be the fattest cat in the world.\u201d Elisa then looked around to see that the world around them had been transmogrified and there were giant purple trees growing in the distance as well as house sized toadstools on the ground. \u201cWell,\u201d she said. \u201cLook on the bright side. At least the world is adapting to better accommodate us.\u201d\u2028\u2028Then Elisa looked down and saw that he was still between Elisa\u2019s fingers. \u201cHello!\u201d yelled the very small man. \u201cWhat about me?\u201d Elisa stopped and rubbed her fat face to think about a solution for the problem that they had with carrying the very tiny Frank. She could carry him in her cleavage, but she looked down to see that she wasn\u2019t wearing anything that would make a particularly suitable bra and stroked her flabby face a few times. \u201cElisa!\u201d yelled Violet. \u201cLook!\u201d Elisa saw a store that was selling purses and got an idea that caused Frank to look up in fear. \u201cOh, no, no, no!\u201d yelled Frank. However, Frank was not in any position to be fighting back and Elisa walked into the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElisa had soon bought a blue daisy-printed purse to carry around Frank in. Frank just pouted as he stood in the bottom of the purse. \u201cNow I know how my mom\u2019s chihuahua feels.\u201d Mumbled Frank. \u201cIf that viral curse affects animals,\u201d joked Dana. \u201cYour mom\u2019s chihuahua is probably bigger than you are, Frank.\u201d Frank let out a groan. \u201cSo, what\u2019s it like out there.\u201d The girls walked further into town to see dozens of titanic monster women. A lot of them were carrying the men who were unaffected by the curse. It would appear that the curse only effected adult women because Violet spotted a vampire mom carrying her child daughter in her shirt pocket. There were monsters all around of different sizes and species, but it would appear that vampires were the most common monster species.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe this,\u201d said Susan. \u201cDo you think there are any human women left on Earth right now?\u201d \u201cFrom the looks of it,\u201d said Violet as she saw a giantess tengu breastfeeding her tiny baby. \u201cOnly adult women are affected and child and teenage girls don\u2019t transform until they reach age 18.\u201d \u201cThank goodness,\u201d said Dana. \u201cImagine the nightmare, giant kids would be.\u201d \u201cI just hope we don\u2019t run into any creatures as hostile as that griffin woman.\u201d Said Violet. Suddenly Violet heard her stomach rumbling and Susan\u2019s was doing the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s get something to eat,\u201d said Susan. \u201cI can\u2019t think on an empty stomach.\u201d The girls noticed an inn and stupidly, Violet and Susan tried to walk in through the front door, only for their combined fat to get them both stuck. \u201cStupid cat!/Idiot wolf!\u201d they yelled simultaneously. \u201cGet your planet eating butt/asteroid-sized boobs out of the door!\u201d The giant manticore and wolf kept on struggling only to both slip through the door and Dana had to run in to help pick them up. Elisa rolled her eyes and was going to walk in the door herself, but grunted because she bumped into someone. The girl that bumped into Elisa was a very giant and very obese gremlin girl with pure light blue skin and long red hair. From the looks of it, she was 2000ft tall and had a 2300ft ass, an 1800ft wide belly, F-cup breasts and three chins. She was wearing a gray tanktop and white cargo shorts that looked painted on and showed what looked like a plumber\u2019s crack. She also wore goggles on her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOut of my way.\u201d Said the gremlin girl as she walked away. \u201cGeez,\u201d said Elisa. \u201cSome people are just so rude.\u201d However, what Elisa didn\u2019t know was that when the gremlin bumped into her, she picked her purse and stole Frank away. Frank grunted but before Elisa realized what happened, the gremlin giantess shoved Frank between the rolls of fat on her stomach and walked away with a smirk on her face.</span></div></div>",

Despite her smaller size, Violet's momentum combined with her weight knocked the gryphon off balance and pitching them forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gryphon gave an angry, strangled shriek as her huge, jiggling body tumbled over. Frank, on the other hand, gave a horrified yell as the force of Violet's attack threw him from the gryphon's cleavage. Luckily, he landed on Dana's stomach, the fat robbing his landing of most of it's momentum. For her part, Dana finally shook the cobwebs from her head and looked down at feeling Frank's landing on her person. She smiled in relief before stuffing Frank between her own breasts for safety. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDana swung her head over to where Violet and the gryphon were struggling. Violet had secured the gryphon in a headlock and was attempting to use her weight to force the gryphon down. The gryphon was attempting to push herself back up, struggling against Violet the whole way. While Violet had the advantage in position, she was so much smaller that the gryphon was starting to overpower her.

So Geoffrey, now a young man aged 24, finds himself holding a letter addressed to him, from his late great-uncle. How was this possible? He died years ago! Stranger still, it was delivered to him by a young woman, who couldn't be any older than him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there she stood, waiting for him to say something, staring intently at the beffudled youth. \"Aren't you going to open it, Mr.Bulwark?\" he lifted his gaze from the envelope and eyed the deliverer with a cocked eyebrow. She was a pretty lady, with fiery, red hair reaching her shoulders, a few curls on the tips. Deep emerald eyes gazed back at him, so deep they were they almost looked... feral. Not to mention, her petite nose dotted by a few freckles, and pouty lips that were curled into a patient smile. She was dressed in a casual manner, wearing a loose black skirt that reached her shins and a cyan cardigan that covered the black t-shirt and the wolf drawn on it. He also couldn't help but notice how shapely she was, not too thin, just... shapely, with noticeable hips and an eye-catching chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I don't know how to take this. He died fourteen years ago. Why now? And what about the rest of my family?\" he was almost exasperated. \"Why me, of all people?\" the mystery girl just shrugged nonchalantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe if you open the letter you'll find out.\" she quipped, still smiling in that odd way. With a sigh, Geoffrey relented, and gently tore the edge of the letter. Taking it out and opening the folded letter, he began reading:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"To my dearest friend and great-nephew,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeoffrey, my dear boy! How have you been? It has been ages since that last Christmas gathering, you were eleven years old, if I recall correctly, and already such a fine man! This old fool misses you greatly, of all the folks in the family, you were the only one who showed me kindness and genuine concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas, if you're reading this letter, then I have already passed away, I'm afraid. Now now, save your tears, those were the bad news. The good news will improve your mood, I hope. For all the kindness you've shown me, and the eager enthusiasm you demonstrated in wanting to hear my tall tales and stories, and, of course, for treating me like <b>actual family</b>, I've decided to leave all my worldly possessions, my mansion and my money, to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeechless, eh? You won't have to worry about a thing for the rest of your life. Just be sure to be polite to my employees, they can be a bit of a rowdy bunch at times, but at heart, they are all gentle souls. You have a spark within you, boy, of the likes I sadly could not see in my younger brother, and all those others that came from him. You will learn more from my employees, many of whom are just eager to meet you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                                                                                                                 Sincerely, and with all the affection I can spare,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                                                                                                                             Sir Gabriel Severus Bulwark</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl smiled more intensely as Geoffrey wiped away the few tears that blurred his vision. \"Crazy old fool.\" he muttered, shaken. He recognized the fine handwriting on the letter, and the signature, this was surely his great-uncle's work, as well as the rubric at the corner of the letter. With a cough, he regarded once more the girl standing in front of him. \"So... I've just became his heir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, you sure are. So as cute as that beard you have is, you might want to give it a little trim, because tomorrow I'll be here to pick you up to go to his mansion and accept the will.\" she pointed at his unkempt beard and goatee, and he felt it, slightly embarrassed. Dang, she was right, he thought. \"Gotta make yourself look presentable, at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you want me to just leave and go to some mansion I've never even been to? I mean, I knew he had one, but he never said where he lived.\" Geoffrey stated, and the girl just rolled her eyes, a hint of frustration visible in her expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were just fired from your job, right? And just this morning you got the letter of eviction from the landlord, hmm? One day left, is all you have, before turning in the keys. You're also low on cash because your family disowned you and left you. So tell me, buddy, what have you got to lose?\" this caught him off-guard. How could she know all of that, from a first meeting, no less? Was someone spying on him? Still, what the odd girl said was true, ever since he left his superficial and arrogant family, and was disowned by his father for refusing to become a banker like him, Geoffrey was one step away from being homeless. What little he had was vanishing away, and before long, he would be just another beggar on the streets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, he relented. \"Fine, you win. I'll be here, and ready, tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue to his word, after preparing his old and worn baggage with what little he had left, mostly clothes, a few art books, and a small knife that had been given to him by his late great-uncle, and giving himself a do-over, mostly shaving his beard off except for his goatee, picking his best clothes, and tying his long brown hair into a low ponytail, Geoffrey was ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasted a few minutes turning in the keys to his small apartment to the landlady, a rude, cantankerous old woman who enjoyed making life miserable for everyone around her, and was kicked out after being called out on all his imperfections.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mood brightened up a bit as he walked near the road and saw a black Rolls Royce parked on the road, the same red-haired girl waving at him with a toothy grin. There were two other people in the car as well, a senior man with a very neat hairdo and a thin mustache, dressed like a butler and a cheerful, portly short woman with graying curly locks and a kitchen apron, riding shotgun next to him. The man just gave him a polite nod whereas his chubby companion beamed a smile at him, and readily invited him in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to go to your late relative's place, laddy?\" she asked with a thick irish accent. He nodded, and she began clapping her hands in excitement. \"Eeee, he was right, yer' such a handsome young man!\" she quipped, making Geoffrey slightly embarrassed as he got in the car together with the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poppet, you're making the young master uncomfortable.\" declared the man, crinkling his nose, eyes on the road. \"So, I wager you read the old master's letter, correct?\" The uncertain young man just gave a quiet nod. \"Splendid. You may call me Charles, I am the head butler at your late great-uncle's mansion, and this is my wife and head cook, Elisabeth. The young woman sitting to your left is one of the maids there, I do believe you're already acquainted?\" Geoffrey shook his head, and the driver arched his eyebrows, peeking through the rear view mirror. \"No? Well, fret not, young master, there will be plenty of time for that later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car drive went on and on, minutes of a tense silence turning into hours, to the point that Geoffrey dozed off in the car. When he came to, he didn't know how long he was out, or where he was for that matter, but... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here.\" said Charles, opening the car door for him. As he groggily stepped out, the red haired girl presented him with his luggage, and humming a tune, went to join the portly cook heading into the mansion before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what a mansion it was. Standing like some monolithic castle on top of a hill, the thick forest surrounded its seemingly ancient walls, so tall it was, so big, for a moment, Geoffrey entertained the idea that it was made for giants. As he silently followed the senior butler up the hill, he could not help but notice the size of the doors and windows, looming above him at thirty feet, give or take. Stranger still, there was another, smaller pair of doors that were made for people on the giant doors. With a potent knock on the door gong, the smaller pair of doors opened with a eerie creak, parting away slowly. The two ladies promptly entered, and with a polite bow and gesture, Charles beckoned the youth to enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had been holding his breath as he regarded the place, so with a quiet sigh, for better or for worse, he stepped inside.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Woah... this place is huge...\" muttered Geoffrey, mesmerized as he was by the sheer size and ornate furnishings of the entry hall. To say the place was roomy was an understatement, there were halls everywhere, and two staircases that lef to the floor above, complete with an inner balcony overlooking the entry hall. Following Charles, the head butler, through a series of halls, the beffudled young man was led to a large room, a study of sorts, complete with tons of shelves and hundreds, if not thousands, of books. Just like the entry hall and the main doors, the place was huge, the ceiling so far up he could hardly see the chandeliers, and in the middle of the study were a few chairs and small tables, but that's not what caught Geoffrey's eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the maids. There was a large group of them, twenty or so, all young ladies, and all pretty gorgeous. The red-haired girl had joined them, having disappeared from Geoffrey's view as he was led by Charles throughout the house. She, like all the maids, was now wearing a short black dress with frills and an apron, as well as the customary hat most french maids wear. Noticing the way he was looking at the girls, Charles leaned in and whispered into the youth's ear. \"I may be the head of staff, but the girls were very persistent that I let them wear that for your arrival. I apologize on their behalf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... it's fine? I guess...\" Geoffrey muttered, a blush forming on his cheeks as he averted his gaze to the table and the documents on it. With a gesture, the senior butler pointed to it, and the guest sat himself. \"So... I just have to sign this document, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but first, I must give you a warning, and another message from our late master. You see, everything in that will shall be given to you, but there are a few things you must also do. You'll live a life of luxury, and be free to indulge in your arts if you so wish...\" he trailed off, looking at all the maids assembled before him. Geoffrey had a lingering suspicion he wasn't going to like the next part. \"One of the terms of this will is for you to choose one of the maids as a potential partner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, what? Geoffrey pinched himself, then rubbed his eyes, and then just made a face. \"What.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I do recall, young master, you do not seem to be in a relationship, or were ever in one, so your great-uncle thought it would be a good idea to, ahem, pardon the term, 'make a man out of you'.\" some of the maids started sniggering and whispering among themselves, but a stiff cough from Charles silenced them. With that, he turned once more to the guest and spoke in a quieter tone. \"Just for clarification, that rule is entirely optional, but these girls have been dying to meet you for a long time. You'll pardon them if they show an interest in you, or if they are a little...straightforward... with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor his part, Geoffrey just sat there with a dumbfounded look on his face, still trying to process what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The next rule will be... a bit of a shocker, to be honest. Your late relative had a very imposing job, one that required absolute secrecy. You see, this plot of land, happens to be located in a place with quite the story. A long time ago, a cult of druids began a ritual, and that ritual brought forth energies that spread all accross the world, bringing life to the supersticions, the supernatural entities, and more. It also opened a portal to a paralel universe that is now populated by all the myths and urban legends in the world.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come again?\" Geoffrey couldn't believe his ears, was this some sort of sick joke? \"So, monsters live here or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty much, yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you want me to be the guardian of this so-called portal, and live here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...okay, I'm done.\" and with that Geoffrey stood up, and grabbed his luggage. But before he could so much as take a step towards the door, Charles sighed and looked at the head cook, Elisabeth. She smirked, and snapped her fingers. With a blur, all the maids positioned themselves in front of the door, forming a semi-circle barring Geoffrey's passage. \"Please move, I've had enough of this joke, and I'd rather much not be part of whatever it is you're doing here.\" he said, but to his chagrin, they didn't budge, instead, they just traded glances among themselves, and then looked to Charles. He just pinched the bridge of his nose, and waved his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeoffrey was about to repeat what he said, but his voice died out when he looked over at the girls. They were taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that wasn't the only thing that changed. Slowly but surely, they rose, growing taller and taller, until they loomed over him at twenty feet, and then they filled out, flab and cellulite spreading like an infection on their figures, bloating them until they were obese parodies of their former model-like bodies. The french maid uniforms however, miraculously stretched with their inflating figures, looking snug on them. As if the scene couldn't get more bizzarre, they then started growing fur, or scales, or horns and tails, and most intimidating of all, fangs and claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maids, all of them, were monsters of legend. They were there, looming above him like predators looking at prey, smirking and giggling as they looked at the terrified young man, and one of them, a giant werewolf with pale grey fur and a mane of red hair, which looked familiar, strutted forward, bent over, and picked Geoffrey up. Her emerald green eyes looked even more feral now. \"Look, buddy, we went through all the trouble of looking for you when we could've just forgotten about you and left you to that life. You can be a really rich guy with a harem of beauties such as ourselves, or poor homeless guy without a cent in his pocket. It's a pretty good deal, get girls, get riches, but in turn, you have to be the guardian of this place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now, missy, that's no way to treat him, put him down, this instance, or you can forget that cake I promised I'd bake you!\" scared as he was, he turned is head to see who shouted, and was surprised to see the head cook now wearing darker clothes and sporting a slightly green skin tone, as well as a slightly fuller frame. Was she a witch?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's right, you know. Put him down before you hurt him, right this instant!\" Charles ordered, tapping his foot. His appearance hadn't changed, other than the fact he was now glowing and the tips of his shoes faded a bit. A ghost?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeoffrey's head was spinning at Mach 6 speeds, and disoriented, he just shivered and sweat bullets until the remorseful werewolf woman set him down, gently. His knees buckled and bent like paper. \"...this can't be real, I must be dreaming...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ghost knelt next to him, and placed a ghostly hand on his shoulder. Geoffrey felt a cold shiver run down his spine, and looked to the butler's face. It was sympathetic. \"I understand your shock and fear, Master Geoffrey. It's a lot to take in, so we are willing to postpone the contract business for a few days, if we must. Just so you can have time to mull it over. But remember this: your great-uncle had a great burden, and when his family, his own flesh and blood, cast him aside, even at the family gatherings during Christmas, only you went up to him and kept him company, even when your parents forbade the contact. You were like a son to him, the same way these girls are like daughters to me and my wife Elisabeth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye, don't worry about a thing, we've taught these lassies how to behave themselves around a strappin' young lad such as yerself.\" said the witch as she offered a hand to hoist Geoffrey to his feet. He took it gingerly, and got back up, still shaken. He dared to look up to the monster giantesses that filled the study, once a big, spacious room, now a little too crowded with their fat frames, and saw concern on their faces, also some aprehension over revealing their secret. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... what will it be, master? Do you want some time to think it over, or are you going to sign that contract?\" asked the red-haired werewolf, sheepishly.<br>\r\nWith a sigh, Geoffrey decided to say...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rubbing his temples, Geoffrey could only sigh at the absurdity of the situation. Monsters. Not only that, giant, freakishly fat female monsters as maids, a mansion so huge it could fit several individual houses inside, a ghost of a butler, his witch wife, and all the rest his great-uncle left behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese were going to be a part of his life now, however strange they may be, he could at least respect his deceased relatives' wishes. \"Fine, I'll stay, for my great-uncle's sake.\" he said, and there was a collective relief in the study. The giantesses traded glances with one another, cheering quietly, and Charles nodded with approval, with Elisabeth the witch/cook chuckling beside him. He cleared his throat, catching everyone's attention. \"However, could you, um, shrink back to normal? I mean, I don't think monsters are supposed to be that tall...or that fat. No offense.\" he quickly added, last thing he needed was to offend twenty giantesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his relief and surprise, they just shrugged it off, even laughed at his request. The witch went to him and gave him a playful pat in the back. \"Oh, we'll have plenty of time for that later on, lad! But for now, let's just finish the introductions, shall we? As they are.\" she winked at the girls, and they all nodded in agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red-haired werewolf strutted forward, made a seductive pose, and gave a cutesy howl. \"I'm Bellatrix, but you can call me Bella. Don't you forget it, Master Geoffrey.\" He would make sure of that, it's not like he would forget a grey-furred werewolf with red hair, green eyes, wide hips and thighs, and a large bust to match. Hourglass, yes, that was the shape. Like in a runway, she walked back to the crowd of maids, and another took her place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Bella did, she strutted in and made sure to lean right above Geoffrey, giving him an ample view of her enormous cleavage, so big they were that her plush midriff and chunky thighs were completely obscured by tit-flesh. \"Like what you see, Master? Name's Jessie, and I'm a minotaur.\" She leaned in closer, and Geoffrey took a step back, amusing her. \"Moo.\" she cooed and with that, Jessie turned around, swished her bovine tail, and walked back to the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to walk towards him for the introduction, were twins. Twin gargoyles, both identical save for the color of their skin and hair, which was fairly long and straight in a bobcut. Geoffrey couldn't help but think they had something oriental going on, oddly considering what they were. They both struck a pose, their plush bellies smooshing together in a mock hug and their wide bums jiggling with flab. \"I'm Dawn!\" giggled the one with white skin and black hair, cheerfully. \"I'm Dusk.\" said the one with dark skin and white hair. \"And together we are the Yin-Yang twins!\" both blew a kiss at Geoffrey, who had calmed down somewhat at their little routine. It was still kinda cute, he thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext up was a female unicorn, he could tell that much, with a long straight horn addorning her head with her cyan curly hair (that kept flowing gently even without any wind blowing), who in an elegant manner (for someone so wide and bloated) walked up to him, gave a polite bow, and then smiled in a warm manner. \"My name is Amanda, Master, at your service.\" she grabbed the tips of her skirt, and gave him a curtsy bow, which he retaliated politely as well, before turning around and rejoining her fellow maids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing Amanda was another equine giantess, this time sporting large wings instead of a horn, and wearing an orange ponytail that reached all the way to her plush derriere. \"Hello, my name is Azure, and I'm a pegasus. Hope you don't mind flying with me once in a while.\" she quipped, gently flapping her winds and blowing a breeze in Geoffrey's face, which blew his shirt up revealing his torso. With a blush, the youth scurried to compose himself while Azure just held a hand to her mouth and politely chuckled, amidst the chorus of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlithering forward was a creature he recognized as a naga, as she had the lower body of a snake and the upper body of a woman, or in this case, a whole lot of woman. She merely loomed over him with her massive gut and bulbous chest and hissed in a seductive manner. \"Caitlyn.\" was all she said, before sending her long tail to bop him on the head playfully. \"Pleasssed to meet you at long lassst.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the fat naga slithered her way back to the crowd, a lady with wings for hands and avian talons for feet walked forward, the brown feathers on her neck poofing a bit and her long white tail perking up. \"Hi!\" she quipped, looking at Geoffrey with big, golden eyes, like an eagle's. \"I'm Muriel, and I'm a harpy! I love flying and... and... uh...\" she scratched her head with one wing, before she remembered. \"Oh right, and I also love persimmons!\" what a thing to say, mused the youth. He also heard a slapping sound, and from the corner of his eye, he could see Charles holding his hand to his face, muttering something he didn't quite fully catch, except for the words \"airheaded bird brain\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Muriel hopped back to the crowd of monster maids, the next female stepped forward, sporting a slightly chubby and busty upperbody and immensely fat legs. Her thighs, hips, shins and butt were absolutely massive, a true pear. She smiled as Geoffrey regarded her form, and as she did, the youth saw rows and rows of sharp teeth. Curled behind her was a unique tail, like a scorpion's. Her voice was rather mature and sultry, as she moaned \"Marilyn. I'm a manticore.\" and then batted her eyes at him. Suffice to say, Geoffrey was starting to feel... weird. He had never felt so many lustful looks before, and most certainly not from monsters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tenth maid to walk up to Geoffrey was a true butterball, easily one of the fattest maids in the group. She had a belly with a deep fold where her bellybutton was supposed to be, that completely covered her privates, massive mammaries that strained her magically stretched french maid uniform, wide buttcheeks and thunder thighs, and flabby arms. \"Call me Tania, Master.\" she muttered softly, almost in a shy manner. Guess she was a little self-conscious of her girth, he mused, as she didn't even try to give him a pose or anything, she just waddled as fast as she could to the group of maids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ten down, ten to go...\" he muttered, as he readied himself for the next wave of introductions...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Geoffrey just looked on as Tania waddled as quickly as her immense body would let her, still trying to process how someone so fat could still walk. A cough from the ghost butler standing next to him brought him back to his senses, and he turned to Charles. \"Apologies, young master, Tania is much too shy for her own good. In fact, she even forgot to tell you what kind of monster she is.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, she just said her name. Well, what is she then?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bahamut, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...okay then...\" Geoffrey was about to inquire Charles over what a bahamut was, but he felt something on his back, like a breeze. He turned, and was face-to-face with a chubby reptilian snout, curled into a friendly smile. His inevitable freakout greatly amused her, and she leaned back, revealing a very long, thick neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there! I'm Becky, a cousin of the Loch Ness monster. Nice to meetcha!\" she quipped happily. Taking a good look at her, Geoffrey saw that she was a very heavy-set pear, with thick legs like tree trunks, wide love handles, a bulbous posterior...but a very petite chest. He momentarily wondered if she was self-conscious about it, but decided against asking her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, so Nessie isn't a hoax after all?\" the youth asked, beffudled. Becky stood silent for a full second, and then sniggered and laughed heartily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not! I mean, her name isn't even Nessie, it's Nelma, but close enough!\" she laughed and turned away, still jiggling from all the mirth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way, another maid stepped up and as they passed each other, they high-fived and grinned. The newcomer had the most human-like appearance of all, and he understood why: she wore a cape of smooth, blubbery skin over her own stretched and tight uniform, which hugged every inch of her wide-hipped figure, down to the curve of her gut to her moderately-sized bust. But before he could so much as say what she was, the maid smirked and gave a curt nod. \"Yeah, you guessed it, I'm a selkie, and my name is Maya.\" she then gave him a seductive look, and leaned a bit forward, hands on her chest. \"I look forward to get to know you a little more...\" she said before winking at him and walking away, swaying her hips. Once back in the crowd, she high-fived Becky again, and the two conversed excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeoffrey gulped, these girls all wanted a piece of him, they really took his great-uncle's joke to the letter. His attention was then roused as two maids walked forward, both of whom resembled furry animals with their hair tied up in two side buns. The leading girl resembled a fox with white fur, blond hair and golden eyes, with seven tails swishing behind her engorged form, even if she was more top-heavy than her companion. Her companion seemed more homely and humble, as humble as one can get with a massive gut and bloated thighs that constantly rubbed together, and she resembled a raccoon with equally colored hazel hair, fur and eyes. \"Hello, young master. I am Setsuna, the kitsune, and this is my best friend and adoptive sister, Megumi, the tanuki. I speak for the both of us, since she is a mute.\" and to emphasize on the fox woman's declaration, Megumi just closed her eyes and waved her hand in a friendly manner, to which Geoffrey replied in kind. \"She was very eager to meet you, moreso than I.\" Setsuna added, before the both of them gave a polite bow, hands on their thighs, and waddled back into the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next one was among the thinner maids, barely obese, but still quite roly-poly. She had a lime green skin coloration and sported a pair of maroon pigtails. Looming over Geoffrey, surprisingly, she gave him a glare. Why, he did not know. \"Rachel. Goblin. Watch your step, human.\" she growled before stomping off, the other maids giving her some space. Turning to Charles, the ghost just sighed and shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's got some issues to work out, I'm sorry. She won't hurt you, rather, Rachel is very closed off to strangers, and protective of the others.\" he then gave him a reassuring smile and a pat in the shoulder. \"Don't worry about it, I believe you can help open her heart.\" he said as another maid strutted forward to greet him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was similar to Maya, in which she was very human-like, minus the small horns on her head and the thick, smooth tail that peeked from under her short skirt. She had full lips, a round face with a double chin going on triple, really fat arms and body. Like Bella, she had an hourglass-shaped body, but either she was wearing a corset underneath her uniform, or she had a very, very small waist. Striking a provocative pose, she gave a sultry moan. \"Call me Suzy, boy. I'm the best succubus in the house.\" she said, before turning around and walking slowly towards her compatriots, swaying her massive hips and butt. Geoffrey couldn't lie to himself, Suzy really made him feel hot and bothered, due to her nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharles noticed his predicament, and tapping his shoulder, he offered the youth a napkin, which he readily accepted. The distraction was enough, as when he finished wiping off the sweat, a blob of a woman gazed on him, her body made out of pink slime. She had no legs, like Caitlyn, just a monumental amount of slime, although she was considerate enough to also wear the maid uniform. She beamed at him and spoke in a cutesy voice. \"I'm Helga, and I love humans!\" shifting her mass, she leaned closer to him, all smiles. \"Let's get along!\" she cheered. For his part, all Geoffrey did was nervously smile back, all the while waging an internal battle over his instinct to flee. As she slithered away humming a tune, he prepared himself for the maid coming forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first she reminded him of Muriel, what with the feathers and talons, but unlike the harpy, this maid had feline talons on both her hands and feet, and a sharp beak to boot. She stood there, her pose confident and proud, and she bent her bloated form to one knee to shake his hand. \"Heyo! I'm Sandra, the griffin. Nice to meet you, cool shirt you got on.\" she complimented, he had been wearing his favorite black shirt on, one that had a grim reaper drawn on. For the first time since he got into this crazy mansion, Geoffrey felt a bit self-conscious, even if the maids hadn't made a single mention about his clothes. Sandra side-stepped, shaking the floor a bit, in order to clear the path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last pair, just like the Yin-Yang sisters and the japanese monster girls had, came forth at the same time. They were truly massive, biggest of the group, and hand in hand, they did something that Geoffrey never expected, they started dancing a waltz. As graciously as their incredibly fat forms would permit, they twisted and turned, paying attention to form and flow, all the while swaying and jiggling their fat bodies for all to see. Their routine only ended once they reached the young man, and upon doing so, they gave him bow and composed themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leading dancer/maid was a Western dragoness, with 4 curly horns protruding from her blond messy hair and grey scales, glistening under the light of the study room. She puffed and grinned, revealing dozens of sharp teeth. \"Greetings to you, Geoffrey Bulwark, I am Maddalorastraza, or Maddy for short.\" what kind of a name was that, he mused. \"We have heard a lot about you from the former Master.\" she added, before letting her companion continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer companion, an Eastern dragoness with a mane of blue hair over her red scales, a long, chubby neck (akin to Becky's, but shorter), long, prehensile whiskers on the corners of her snout and equally winded over their 'performance', huffed a greeting with a warm, motherly voice. \"And I am Mei-Lun, her mate. We've longed to meet you for a long time, youngling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you two, that was pretty amazing, and... Wait, did you just say 'mate'? You're a couple?\" Geoffrey asked before he caught himself. Luckily, the two draconic maids merely giggled at his confusion, and nodded in agreement. Before anything else could be said, Elisabeth, the witch, spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One lesson you must learn, laddy, is that love is blind. Regardless of shape, form, gender or even species, love is love, and it is unstoppable.\" she winked as Charles stood next to her and placed a hand on her shoulder, which she knowingly took. Geoffrey had no ill-will over this matter, and simply nodded, a small smile creeping on the corners of his mouth. He then turned to the table and the contract and will on it, and sat himself on the chair, ready to sign. Both Charles and Elisabeth spent the better part of five minutes to explain the terms of the contract and the contents of the will left for him, and once it was all done and signed, the ghost sighed in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is done.\" he neatly joined the documents together, and gave them to the cook, who made them vanish in a puff of magic fire. \"Now that all that is settled, and the introductions are done, I do believe it's time for some well-earned rest. So if you follow me, Master Geoffrey, I will lead you to your bed chambers.\" he gave a curt bow and held out his hand to the doors. Geoffrey made to get up, but the looming shapes of the fat monster maids made him reconsider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, can we uh...I dunno, do something about them? I'm not entirely confortable with the girls being that tall.\" he explained. There was a collective sigh from the maids, and with one firm glare from Charles, they shrunk, slowly, to their original heights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not into their thin human forms. <br>\r\nThe maids were still in their fat monster forms, and before Geoffrey could object, Bella the werewolf spoke up. \"You said you weren't comfortable with us being tall, so now what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Geoffrey just followed the ghost butler who was chuckling over the girls' audacity. This was going to be the beginning of a very, very, wacky relationship. \"...or rather, relationships.\" the young man muttered, exhausted.</span></div></div>",

Though she was wearing a loose T-shirt and sweat pants--her usual attire for a morning jog--the fabric of both stretched against her girth, doing nothing to hide it. Her shirt had even drawn back, exposing her black middriff. As for her sweatpants, they were already showing signs of wear trying to contain Milly's overly-ample rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMilly hadn't looked like this yesterday. She'd been a healthy 187 pounds, kept that way with a nice exercise routine, even if she splurged on the occasional ice cream or fast food. But now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Now the only way I'll get ice cream will probably be eating the whole damn factory</i>, Milly thought. Sudden weight gain like this was the first sign of the Anthro Plague--soon, she wouldn't only be fat, she'd be an animal giantess--maybe even as big as a skyscraper; that had happened before--AND fat. Milly had been infected early on, like so many other women, but she'd remained human. She'd even thought she was somehow immune to the transformations. <br>\r\nUntil now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Milly pushed herself out of her chair, wobbling on her feet. \"No point in going nuts over it...this will be the new me soon, but damn of I'm going to let it throw my life out of whack!\" Encouraged, Milly slipped on her track shoes and went outside, into the morning glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of her neighbors, an anthro vixen, pranced down the street carrying a tiny newspaper in her paw. There was no room on the sidewalk, since she was easily 30 feet tall and VERY pear-shaped. Seeing Milly's \"new look\", she waved and winked--learning someone was just about to transform was a big event for anthro women, and Milly knew she'd be \"welcomed to the club\" very soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't know if she could put up with the gossip, though. Hearing rumors about the T-Rex women who'd moved in last week <i>eating</i> her ex-husband was bad enough already. Mumbling, Milly started her usual jog.</span></div></div>",

Strangely enough, although at least 300 pounds, Milly didn't find herself being exhausted by her weight. She wasn't able to run, but was still able to maintain a brisk pace that didn't exhaust her, not changing speed as her engorged frame jiggled with each step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she came to a halt as she was reminded by her stomach that she'd neglected her breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, come on! You're already big enough as it is!\" She groaned as she looked down at her stomach, only half covered by her shirt. She tried to ignore her hunger, but also noticed a giant stand in a park nearby, lead by what she assumed was a giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then again, you're not gonna get any smaller, either...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jogged into the park and entered the square wherein the huge doughnut stand was, owned by a wider and monstrously fat orca woman. Her gigantic breasts almost covered the counter, and Milly could tell the stand's size was to contain a massive stomach within. As Milly approached, the orca looked down at her with a friendly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, Miss. Whaddya need?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could go for a white frosted long john with sprinkles.\" But she paused as her stomach growled again. \"Actually, make it two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it!\" She replied with a chuckle. \"Just started transforming, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. Just woke up this morning, and <i>voila.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, don't fret over it. Once you change, you'll find it's actually not to different from being a human!\" She insisted as she handed her a relatively tiny bag in her fin, which was actually quite large in Milly's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's this come to?\" Milly asked as she reached into her purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing. It's on the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Thanks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No prob. See you round!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMilly waved goodbye as she waddled off. The bag was much larger than she'd anticipated, and each of the two doughnuts inside each seemed to be at least a foot long, and almost four inches wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn. One more snack before the diet, I guess.\" She joked to herself as she searched for a somewhat secluded area in the park, seating herself on a bench that creaked under her bulky rear end. She grabbed one of the pastries from the bag and gave it a generous bite, smiling the instant it hit her tastebuds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! That's a damn good doughnut!\" She exclaimed as she began to take another bite. As large as the doughnut was, she consumed it with surprising speed, finishing it off in just a minute. Once it was gone, she reached into the bag and pounced onto the other. It was just as good, but she tried to let it last for a little longer to savor the flavor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her meal finished, she wiped at her chubby cheeks to clean off and lick away the remaining frosting, giving her distended and full stomach a rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...maybe this whole thing won't be so crazy, after all! Might actually be kind of-\" But she instantly paused as she felt her stomach begin to puff out, her shirt growing tighter as more of her belly was exposed. \"...crap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach began bloat out with surprising speed and crept over her legs, her rear end growing bigger until she realized it was trapped in the seat. Her shirt became little more than a bra that was wrapped around her enormous breasts, her once baggy pant began splitting in various ways with almonds of soft flesh peeping through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...oh boy.\" She peeped as she bent forward to stand up, only to uproot the bench as it continued to cling to her blimp-like booty. She now towered a whopping nine feet, feeling like a monstrous balloon of fat with a behemoth of a stomach that puffed out almost as long as she was tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MILLY?\" She gasped at the familiar voice and turned her head as far as her thick neck would to see her friend nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Hey, George.\" She cringed as the bench she was lodged in burst apart, her rear exploding from both sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you were immune, or something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So did I, but clearly I thought wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap, How much longer you think till you've changed?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...probably by tonight.\" She lifted her blobby arm to scratch her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw man...Aw man, me and the other guys loved hanging out with you when you were a human!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, George, I...\" She paused to scratch at her shoulder again. \"'I know this is crazy, but just because I'm transforming into some obese animal-hybrid giantess doesn't mean that I can't hang out with you and the other guys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I just always enjoyed having a human friend who was a girl. It just'I felt like things could be'you know, equal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Equal?\" Milly slowly approached her now diminutive friend and crouched herself down, matching his eye level. \"George, like I said, this thing isn't going to change things between us!...Okay, there might be a few awkward scenes, but you're still my friend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"George, listen. Whatever I become, I'm still going to exit my house thinking of you for the nice, funny, dorky guy I love to hang out with, the same for the others!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me. And I promise that anybody who thinks I'm weird for doing so is not my friend. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge opened his mouth to retort, but all that came out was a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, these things just take time.\" She insisted as she scratched at her shoulder again. \"Just remember that...no matter...\" But she couldn't finish as the itch grew worse than worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Milly, you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My arm, it's just itching for some reason, and-\" She instantly stopped as it dawned on her. \"You don't think-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled back whatever outstretched sleeve was on her blimp-like arm and gasped to see that traveling down her arm was a growth of dark brown...</span></div></div>",

Her ears became rounded as she sprouted a stubby round tail that would be as big as a medicine ball if she had been normal sized. She growled as she held her hands up and saw her claws.

Millie's butt in fact grew so big that her pants and undies exploded off, shocking George and making him scream. Millie's legs grew thicker as they also grew longer, even if her belly was so big that it touched the ground even when she was standing up. Her hair glowed bright blonde as her face stretched into a snout and her ears moved to the top of her head. Millie grew to 150ft tall and then sprouted a long tail. Finally, a large pouch appeared on her mountainous belly By the time her transformation was over, Millie was a 150ft tall kangaroo with a 200ft wide belly, two 70ft wide breasts and a whopping 200ft wide butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kangaroo giantess waddled up to see her reflection in a nearby skyscraper and looked in shock right before turning around and pressing her monstrous butt against the building.

Look at this ass.\" Millie hovered her huge ass over George as he looked up in fear that his friend was a giant obese marsupial. \"Hey! Take it easy with that thing Millie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMillie then bent over, pressing her big belly into the ground before picking George up, seeing that she was now so monstrously huge, George was a crumb to her. \"Look at you George,\" she said. \"You're so tiny and cute now, I could just eat you up.\" Millie gnashed her teeth in front of George making him fall back into her palm. \"Don't even joke about that Millie! Some of the transformed women already have done insane things like that.\" Millie let out a laugh and then George heard a stretching noise. Before he knew it, Millie had shoved him down the pouch on her huge 200ft wide belly. It was 80ft deep and as soft as pudding. Millie giggled before she snapped the pouch shut, leaving her friend inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the obese kangaroo titan hopped down the street, creating earthquakes with each movement.

MOOOO!\" Millie was expanding so fast that George had to grab hold of her tail as she was growing and stomped down the street. As Millie reached the hundred foot tall margin, she passed a giant pear shaped obese cheetah woman sitting naked on top of a skyscraper and reading the newspaper when she spotted Millie. \"Huh,\" she said with a smile. \"Looks like a newly bloomed giantess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMillie stopped and saw she was one 100ft tall and 150ft wide and then she heard the sound of her pants ripping and then looked down to see she now had an udder the size of her head.

Don't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMillie looked at herself in the reflective surface of an office building and lifted up her belly and breasts, forcing George to climb up her long hair and rest on her new bovine snout.

So this is what it feels like to be a big anthro. Maybe this situation isn't so bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMillie stepped onto the beach and everywhere there were giant bloated anthro girls in bikinis. They were all at least as huge as she was and some were even accompanied by tiny men. One anthro girl in particular was a giant golden furred jaguar girl who was heavy in the hindquarters and looked to be slightly taller than Millie and was wearing a blue bikini with red sunglasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMillie heard shaking and saw that at the side, there were four anthro girls that she immediately recognized. They were friends of hers and she could tell who they were even though they had been transmogrified. First was her best friend, Pepper, who was transmogrified into a giant obese silver haired white rhinoceros girl. She was the leader of Millie's group of friends and while she could have a temper, she was the strongest girl Millie knew. Next to Pepper, punting at a volleyball was Nicole, an energetic but slightly ditzy blue haired Australian girl who had been morphed into a blue and belly-heavy koala girl. Then there were the two girls on the other side of the net. First was the bookworm of the group, Beth, a bespectacled nerd girl who had been turned into a gigantic and massive bootied hippopotamus woman. Lastly was the fashionista of the group, Emily who was now an enormous pink and white striped obese zebra girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Emily had jumped up and used one of her massive thunder thighs to knock the tiny volleyball at Nicole and Pepper but Nicole jumped up with a squee and bounced the ball off her belly. \"Not so fast, Nicole,\" said Beth with a laugh. \"Take this.\" Beth turned around and her huge hippo ass bounced the ball to Pepper who tried to knock it back. But the ball hit one of the large horns on the rhino girl's nose and deflated. \"Damn!\" yelled Pepper. \"Game,\" said Beth as she smiled a smug grin and twerked her big booty. \"Set and match.\" \"That's right, darlings,\" said Emily with a smirk. \"The hippo and zebra beat the rhino and koala.\" Pepper snorted and looked like she was going to charge when she heard a mooing sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the girls turned and spotted Millie with George riding on her nose. \"Hey Pepper!\" yelled Millie. \"Nicole! Beth! Emily!\" \"Millie?\" asked Pepper in surprise. \"Is that you.\" \"About time she transformed,\" said Nicole. \"Yay.\" Emily just let out a scoff. \"A cow?\" she asked. \"Really, not what I would've chosen.\" \"Let it go, Emily,\" said Beth. \"You didn't ask to become a zebra either, and I sure didn't choose to become a hippo. Personally I think that the cow look is good on Millie.\" Millie let out a laugh and shook her fat body. \"Thanks girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge couldn't help but look nervously as the four other giants looked at her. He could swear that they were 300ft tall and he could also swear that Millie ballooned to that height as she walked down the street and she had put on the weight to match. \"Hi George.\" Said Pepper teasingly. \"Uh hi,\" said George to the rhino giantess. \"Pepper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" said Pepper. \"Now that Millie's a giant like us, I propose we...\"</span></div></div>",

Millie was processing how she had transmogrified into a 100ft tall anthropomorphic penguin giantess with a 125ft wide butt, a 115ft wide belly that George was clinging to like a wood tick and huge D-cup breasts. She let out a squawk as she saw her reflection in the skyscraper in front of her. She let out another squawk and then George begun to sweat. He was sure that Millie was going to hate and be horrified of her transformation. But that\u2019s when Millie did something that outright confused him. She started to laugh and even stroked the sides of her belly, forcing George to yell as he was forced to dodge the penguin titaness rubbing her large feathered belly. \u201cThis is AWESOME!\u201d yelled the penguin girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge was completely puzzled. \u201cHuh?\u201d he asked. \u201cMillie?\u201d Millie just let out a laugh. \u201cI\u2019m perfectly fine, George. Penguins are my favorite animal. This is the best animal I could\u2019ve transformed into.\u201d Millie laughed and then shook her obese penguin hips before she accidentally bumped against the skyscraper with her large booty and made it crack. Billie looked in embarrassment before George climbed up to the penguin girl\u2019s cleavage to better speak with her. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about that, Millie,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was the last man size building left in the area scheduled for demolition. It\u2019s all anthro turf now.\u201d Millie then gave a blush before she plucked George out of her cleavage and starting to walk down the street. \u201cSo, how many more women in town are there to mutate?\u201d she asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said George. \u201cI think that you\u2019re the last one.\u201d As Millie walked down the street, she saw dozens of anthropomorphic animal women who were as titanic and obese as she was. Some even more so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMillie and George passed by a two-humped camel woman who was 200ft tall with an incredibly pear-shaped 300ft-wide booty. Given her hijab she was most likely a Muslim woman. \u201cHello, Millie,\u201d said the camel woman as she took out her cellphone to snap a photograph. \u201cI see you\u2019ve finally found your animal body.\u201d Millie let out a laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s right, Ms. Jasmine. \u201cI\u2019m a penguin now for the rest of my life.\u201d Ms. Jasmine let out a laugh. \u201cYou\u2019ll get used to it. I\u2019ve been a camel for three weeks and I love it.\u201d \u201cBy the way, Ms. Jasmine,\u201d said George. \u201cIs it a boy or a girl?\u201d \u201cExcuse me?\u201d asked the very confused camel woman. \u201cWell,\u201d said George. \u201cLast time we saw you, Ms. Jasmine. You were pregnant and...\u201d Ms. Jasmine let out a laugh and rubbed her belly. \u201cI\u2019m still pregnant, George. The little one no matter what gender is going to be human. The virus only affects adult women. I hope my baby doesn\u2019t mind having a giant mommy.\u201d Ms. Jasmine then heard her phone rung loudly. \u201cSorry, Millie,\u201d said Ms. Jasmine. \u201cI\u2019ve got to take this. Have a great day.\u201d \u201cYou too, Ms. Jasmine.\u201d As Ms. Jasmine walked away, the ground was cracking beneath her massive camel feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge let out a sigh of relief. \u201cThank goodness that Ms. Jasmine is still her friendly self?\u201d MIllie raised an eyebrow. \u201cWhat do you mean, George?\u201d she asked. \u201cWell,\u201d said George. \u201cSome anthropomorphic girls have gotten more aggressive and hostile with their transformations. The other day, my mom turned into an anthro cachalot and she\u2019s been using it to get revenge on my dad for all the times he pushed her around. For one, now she makes him sleep between her toes.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s silly, George,\u201d said Millie. \u201cYour dad was kind of rough with your mom, though.\u201d George then turned his head and saw a large grayish furred and blonde haired tapir woman, as gigantic and fat as Ms. Jasmine who was dressed as a punk. She was forcing her boyfriend to paint her toenails as she smiled fiendishly. \u201cLike I said,\u201d said George. \u201cTurning into a giant anthropomorphic fatso has given some of the female population a massive power high.\u201d Of course, Millie still saw that some anthro giantesses had managed to hold onto their (metaphorical) humanity. This was demonstrated by a titantic and obese hammerhead shark girl with bright blue skin and red hair worn in an Afro mullet style and she was smiling as her boyfriend proposed to her, albeit with a ring that would never be able to fit on her finger now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about that idea, George,\u201d the penguin giantess said. \u201cI think it depends on the people before they got transmogrified.\u201d George let out a sigh and then shrugged his shoulders. All he knew one hundred percent for sure was that the age of men in charge was over and done.\u201d Millie kept walking down the street and an anthro giantesses skated by. She was an obese anthropomorphic horse wp,am with fuschia fur and bubblegum-colored hair worn in a beehive style. She was one head taller than Millie and was so fat she looked like she would weigh two tons had she been normal sized, most of which would be in her stomach that looked wider than she was tall. The horse woman appeared to be carrying a purse designed to look like a school bus with several children inside of it, implying that the horse woman was a bus driver without the actual bus.\u201d Millie let out a laugh. \"Looks like the world is managing to adapt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe penguin woman carried George as they entered what looked like a mall built to suit anthropomorphic woman. There were dozens of enormous sumo-sized anthro girls walking the hallways and were in various species of canines, felines, ungulates, birds, marine mammals, reptiles and even several anthropomorphic girls resembling animals that had been extinct for centuries if not millennia. Now, where was Millie going in this mall for giantesses?</span></div></div>",

All around them transformed women were going about their shopping; toting  scaled-up shopping bags--mostly from clothes stores--and chatting as if nothing was out of the ordinary. Few wore full outfits, with swimwear and VERY stretched-out lingerie being the norm. A good many of the chubby animal titanesses had now-tiny men or children riding on their heads, shoulders, or--Millie and George shared a laugh--even wedged between their giant breasts. \"Guess it really is business as usual...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge's musing was cut off when he heard Millie give a sudden squawk, somewhere between a laugh and a gasp. Flinching from the volume, he followed his penguin-girlfriend's gaze and caught sight of a zebra girl about Millie's age. She was clad in a blue bikini, and though she wasn't as fat as most of her fellow giantesses, her swimwear looked <i>painted</i> on...which only made the twitching, flattened form of the poor man plastered onto her jiggling rump all the more plain. The zebra girl had obviously sat on him, and judging by the equine giantess's smirk, it <i>hadn't</i> been an accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge grimaced, a bead of sweat rolling down his forehead. \"Um; maybe not <i>exactly</i> as usual....Millie?\" Tearing his eyes away from the poor man who'd been used as a seat cushion, he found his girlfriend blushing so badly her black feathers looked burgundy. \"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quiet squawk escaped Millie's beak. <br>\r\nWith a nervous little chuckle, she whispered, \"Well...I kinda just realized I'm naked in public....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge blinked, then remembered that ALL of Millie's clothes had been ripped to shreds by her transformation. He felt himself blush, and much to his shame, wasn't sure if he should feel embarrassed or aroused. \"Maybe we should, ah; find a clothes store first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMillie nodded, then without a word waddled down the hall as fast as she dared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===========<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mall guard who'd mutated into a plump-but-still muscular alligator (AN: she worked out a lot as a human; just roll with it) watched the nude penguin scamper off. She smirked, idly checking her watch...then hissed a laugh. Two minutes! The poor girl had stood around gawking for two whole minutes before realizing she was in the buff! The gator-guard was pretty sure she would go <i>straight to hell</i> for not telling the poor girl; maybe giving her a towel or something to cover herself, but <i>damn</i>, the look on her face was just priceless!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===========<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could we forget something like...<i>that</i>?!\" Millie squawk-whined in the skyscraper-sized dressing room, slipping into a scaled-up pink tank top and white jogging shorts. Even re-sized for her new height and made of elastic material, the outfit fit VERY tightly over her form. To her great relief, they <i>didn't</i> feel too tight or look ready to rip apart. She looked down at George, who was sitting on a small bench covering his eyes. (Being a <i>women's</i> store, there weren't any rooms scaled for men, and even in her panic Millie wasn't about to leave her boyfriend out where he could get stepped on, or worse. So, she just brought him in with her as she got dressed.) \"Seriously, George; why didn't you say something earlier?\" she huffed, her fur and feathers briefly puffing out. Realizing he was still covering his eyes she amended, \"I'm dressed, you can look now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge uncovered his eyes, using a hand to rub the back of his neck. \"I...guess I didn't really process it after you transformed.\" he said lamely. \"But you just took it so well; and were so happy at being a giant penguin...I guess I thought you didn't mind.\" He gave a weak smile and laugh. \"Though since every other woman was clothed, I guess I should have taken a hint; heh-heh... Sorry you had to panic like that, sweetie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Panicked\"</i> didn't quite do it justice. Millie had all but <i>tackled</i> her way into the first store the found that sold ANY sort of clothing, nearly bowling over several customers. Only clothes that could easily stretch a bit--swimwear, latex bras and panties, workout clothes--were available for the titanic anthro-women so far, and Millie had almost grabbed a string-thin bikini, before spotting her current attire. Now that she was decent, she had started to calm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still...her embarrassment was still fresh in her mind, and if George had told her she could have avoided that little incident..... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As a smile formed on the massive penguin woman's face, George realized that he was in big trouble. \"N-N-Now, Millie,\" said George to his enormous, semi-aquatic avian girlfriend. \"Let's not be rash. After all, I'm your boyfriend.\" \"True,\" said Millie with another smirk. \"You are my boyfriend, but I am going to have to punish you for embarrassing me like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge heard vibrations and loud rumblings and then saw that Millie had turned around and her enormous, 150ft wide, white sports pants covered rear was right over him. Millie even spanked herself to made the rolls of her mountainous flesh jiggle. \"Hear comes the bun.\" \"Oh no!\" yelled George. \"Oh no! Please don't be rash, Millie! You're not like that zebra girl! Please don't sit...!\" WHAM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMillie giggled to herself as she pressed her feathery booty down on George, not enough to squish him, but definitely enough for her minuscule boyfriend to feel the impact as she laughed. Millie giggled to herself and shook her booty as George let put muffled groans. \"What's the matter, Georgie?\" asked the titanic rockhopper rather smugly and tauntingly. \"Can't handle the booty of this beast?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, he realized he was asking for it by not telling the building-sized penguin girl that she was naked in the mall. His only consolation was the fact that Millie didn't fart on him. He may have wronged her but thankfully she agreed that he didn't deserve that. At her current size it would probably be downright deadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ten minutes, Millie had decided that George had learned his lesson and got her fat feathered fanny off of his body. George was mildly plastered to his bird girlfriend's feathered behind before slipping off and taking a deep breath. \"Okay,\" groaned George to Millie. \"I will admit that I deserved that.\" Millie gave a smug grin. \"You think? Punishment ain't over, big mouth. You still have to kiss it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge was shocked at that proposition as Millie held out her large and prominent rear right on front of him. George was hesitant but he didn't want to risk angering the titanic bird again. So he simply walked up to the area underneath the penguin girl's tail and puckered his lips before kissing Millie's ass (literally) and making the colossal penguin giggle. \"Now are you done humiliating me?\" asked George. Millie smirked and then nodded her head. \"Yep,\" the giant penguin said. \"I think you've been through enough. Millie then kissed George and place him back on her shoulder before leaving the fitting room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Millie had bought a few size appropriate outfits and was paying the cashier, a large and titanically obese Akita dog girl who was the same age as Millie and same titanic height. \"I take it that you just recently transformed?\" asked the Akita girl. \"What gave it away?\" asked Millie. The Akita let out a smug grin. \"The way you ran In here naked. Personally, my mom prefers to go au natural.\" Millie took her bag and left as she rolled her eyes and then turned to face George. \"Not one word, George,\" said the very annoyed Millie. \"Not one word.\" George wisely zipped his lip. \"Okay,\" said Millie. \"Now that I won't die of embarrassment, I am hungry.

Milly had had to pull up two chairs to accommodate her building-sized behind, but otherwise she was comfortable. Thankfully the food court was overstocked with chairs, since most of the other women's new forms required such arrangements as well. Not just because of weight or girth, either--many giantesses whose forms sported long tails set the appendages up in chairs to avoid tripping someone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge was just happy he didn't see any more poor men being used as seat cushions. More concerning was what Millie had ordered. \u201cSushi, really?\u201d He questioned with a raised eyebrow, still perched on Millie\u2019s shoulder. Leaning against the side of her neck, he eagerly ate a California roll, chewing slowly to savor the taste. Surprisingly, the sushi place in the mall had food as good as any of the more expensive places in town, maybe even better. \u201cI never figured you\u2019d try it--I thought you hated seafood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe too!\u201d Millie giggle-squawked, somewhat awkwardly handling the chopsticks with her flipper-hands. But as soon as I saw the sushi place...well, I know <i>you </i>love the stuff, but I just had this...craving, out of nowhere. You think it\u2019s some weird side-effect of turning into a penguin?\u201d She managed to get a good grip on one of the spicy rolls she\u2019d ordered (scaled up to her size, of course), added a dab of wasabi and popped it into her beak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes widened when the full wave of spice hit her, and a few muffled squeaks escaped her maw before she swallowed. George couldn\u2019t help but laugh as he watched his titanic penguin girlfriend frantically grab a bottle of water and all but chug it down to quench the burn on her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a sip from his own drink, George patted Millie\u2019s cheek as she calmed down. \u201cI tried to warn you that wasabi was strong stuff, my Arctic Angel. It\u2019s not like some hot sauce you can just slather food with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMillie coughed and gasped a bit before craning her head around, fixing her tiny boyfriend with an annoyed look. \u201c\u2018Arctic Angel\u2019? Seriously? And the guy at the counter<i> recommended</i> the spicy rolls! I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d get a one-two punch to the tastebuds...gah! It\u2019s like I ate a slice of a volcano\u2026!\u201d She gulped down more water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge chuckled in sympathy, patting Millie\u2019s beak. \u201cIt\u2019ll pass, Millie. Hope this doesn\u2019t turn you off seafood for good, you ARE a penguin now, after all.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMillie tried to hold her glare, but George\u2019s comforting patting was too much...that, and he was just so cute at that size. \u201cHmm...I don\u2019t think so, Georgie. Maybe it\u2019s just the transformation talking, but I think I still like fish. And...maybe don\u2019t call me \u2018Arctic Angel\u2019 again; it\u2019s cheesy.

You were a pretty comfy cushion, Georgie.\u201d Millie winked and, just for emphasis, wiggled her ample rump on the chair. George winced and mimed zipping his lips...though he still joined her in chuckling. Millie loved how he kept his good humor even after her transformation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both went back to their lunches in companionable silence, but George\u2019s mind kept wandering to one thing.<br>\r\n<i>If Millie can do...<u>that</u>...WITHOUT squishing me like that zebra girl did to that poor guy\u2026.maybe we could try it again some time? Be an...interesting way to spend a Friday night. Maybe. Possibly.

The victims quickly gain weight...followed by a permanent transformation into an anthropomorphic animal and growing to gigantic size, sometimes hundreds of feet tall. These giant, chubby animal-women can still have children with human men, though said children can be either \"pure\" humans of either gender, or \"pure\" anthro girls. Their children's species is largely a wild card. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt has been exactly five years since the event that shook the Earth. Along with the female half of the human race who were still turning into obese anthro amazon titans, there were rumors that the Earth itself had been mutated into a size best fit to sustain these giantesses. At this point in time, almost all women had been completely transformed. At this time, in a house in Paris, there was one woman in the middle of her mutation that was witnessing the event on the television. She had pale white skin and long goldish brown hair and was wearing a pair of glasses along with a black shirt and a pair of gray jeans that could barely fit her huge body. The girl was named Bernadette and she was one of the few women on the planet who were completing their transformation. Currently, she was 80ft tall with an 80ft wide belly, an 85ft butt and two 40ft wide breasts. She had recently graduated from college and worked as a painter. However, at the moment, she was too anxious to think about her career what with her transformation nearing completion. She had already rebuilt her house to accommodate her size, but she feared by the time the mutation was over, she'd be more than twice her current height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBernadette let out a sigh and downed a handful of baguettes as she watched the television. There was a giant obese blue feathered dodo bird woman reporting the news. \"Today it has been five years since an ominous meteor shower fell over the planet. While the meteors themselves proved themselves no threat to our planet, they revealed themselves to contain some sort of extraterrestrial virus. The virus spread into the atmosphere and for some bizarre reason, only seemed to effect the female half of the human race. The virus led to massive weight gain and then caused the infected women to increase to the titanic size. Today, the smallest of these mutants stands 100ft tall. But the virus had a third effect. The infected women would transform into anthropomorphic animals, living, extinct or otherwise mythical. The First Lady of the U.S. was transformed into an anthro eagle, the queen of England into a uniform, plus countless others. Needless to say, men were no longer in charge and even today, there is speculation that men will soon be reduced as slaves or even pets to the new rulers of the planet. The virus even affected the reproduction system. All boys would be human but all girls would be the same species as their mothers. However, the transformations also came with an insatiable hunger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBernadette scoffed at this remark. \"Tell me about it.\" She said as she swallowed a handful of watermelons. \"Some giantesses have even considered cannibalizing the smaller men,\" said the dodo woman reporter. \"But thankfully, most titanesses are above that sort of...\" Suddenly, the reporter grunted and it looked like a pair of human hands were sticking out of the front of her beak to pry it open. This in turn prompted the obese avian woman to tilt her head back and swallow her defiant prey before letting out a cough. \"At any rate,\" said the dodo woman. \"It won't be long until the last umutated woman is fully transformed.\" Bernadette nodded her head. \"And it looks like it might be me.\"</span></div></div>",

She then grunted as she hit her head on the ceiling and grunted. \"Oh great,\" she says. \"It looks like I grew another 20ft. If this is how big I get as a human, I wonder what it'll be like when I'm animalized.\" Bernadette reaches the door and opens it to see nobody there before she hears a voice. \"Bernadette! Stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess looked down to see a young man around her own age right under her left foot. This was her boyfriend, Philipe. Bernadette groaned and then moved her foot out of the way. \"Damn it, Philipe, I could've stepped on you.\" Bernadette tries to bend down to pick up Philipe but her stomach gets in the way and her shirt begins to tear again as she groans. Fortunately, her boyfriend just climbs up her huge stomach before she lifts him up to her face and places him on her nose. \"I see you're almost ready to further mutate.\" Bernadette lets out a huff. \"Well, I can't wait until it's over with, but I'm dreading it. For all we know, once I turn into an animal, I could grow ten times the size I am now.\" Philipe lets out a purr. \"Then I guess I can move into your navel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBernadette rolls her eyes. \"You better be careful. There's no telling what I could turn into and would you want me to turn into just about anything? My mom turned into an alligator when she fully mutated and swallowed my dad for all the times he cheated on her.\" Philipe's eyes pop as his girlfriend gives a smug grin and adjusts her glasses. \"I hate it when you say stuff like that. Just finish transforming so I can see what you become.\" Bernadette let out a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Bernadette held her chest and groaned. \"Bernadette?\" asked Philipe. \"Ah!\" Philipe fell into his girlfriend's mountainous cleavage and fell it and the rest of Bernadette expanding as Bernadette was growing bigger and bigger, easily reaching hundreds of feet high. \"Oh geez.\" She grunts.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Bernadette kept on growing, her skin was turning a teal color and she gasped as she saw her already enormous fingers swelling up as she then held onto her throat and gasped as three more chins formed. \"Zut!\" yelled Bernadette. \"Calm down, Bernadette!\" yelled Philipe. \"Calm... whoa! Sacre bleu!\" Philipe then grabbed hold of Bernadette's hair and tried to climb up his girlfriend just as she opened her mouth wide and revealed that her canine teeth had extended into a pair of rather large tusks as the transforming French woman found herself outgrowing her house and smashing through the roof as she stepped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as she exited her house, Bernadette grunted and felt her enormous ass getting stuck as it had gotten several times bigger. As Bernadette struggled to try and get her ass free, she was shaking her hair and Philipe tried to climb her hair just as Bernadette's ears became more oval shaped and her face was stretching out as her nose was flattened and her nostrils extended. \"Whoa,\" said Philipe. \"Elle est tr\u00e9s belle quand elle est tr\u00e9s grande. Of course, at that moment, Bernadette's feet had burst out of her shoes and become a pair of giant flat four-toed pachyderm-style feet. \"Great.\" Muttered Bernadette rather sarcastically as her thighs expanded and caused her skirt to shrink into a loincloth as her bluish pale skin got thicker and bigger and she sprouted a tiny tail in between her butt cheeks as her massive rear expanded in such that the back of her skirt was ripping apart and exposing her pink panties that looked painted on. At that moment, Bernadette had finally managed to pull her buttocks free of her house but in the process, jerked forward and caused Philipe to slide down her hair and yell. Philipe fell down her blouse that was coming apart and tried to grab hold of his girlfriend's bra strap in order to steady himself. But at that moment, Bernadette's breasts had expanded and Philipe found the strap snapping and he was falling again. The young man tried to get a steady grip on Bernadette's back fat but slid down and landed with a grunt between Bernadette's buttocks and found himself stuck but still unharmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Bernadette, she had rubbed her head and then looked all over her body and found out that the anthro animal amazon she had transformed into was a hippopotamus. She had also reached a height of 300ft with a 650ft wide ass, a 450ft wide stomach, four chins and a pair of 100ft wide breasts. Bernadette gave a grunt as she held up her big breasts. \"Seriously?\" she asked. \"A hippopotamus? Of all the animals I could've turned into, I got mutated into one that was already obese before the virus struck. It's mortifying. Oui, Philipe? Philipe? Last I checked he was in my breasts so he should be okay.\" Bernadette said that as she scratched her massive butt and had no idea that Philippe was trapped in the back of her panties and was lodged between the hippo's buns, holding them apart in an attempt to squeeze himself out. But with Bernadette moving around, he found this more and more difficult. \"Good grief,\" he said. \"She must have the biggest ass in all of Paris. Whoa.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilipe had to grab hold of the side of Bernadette's enormous panties as Bernadette took out her cellphone from her pocket. \"Bonjour, ma soeur,\" said the young woman. \"C'est Bernadette. Oui, I finally completed my transformation. I turned into a hippopotamus. You heard that right. Hey, you're just as enormous and fat without being a hippo, as is every other adult woman affected by this travesty, so I would appreciate it if you didn't laugh at me. Listen. My... uh... my ass kind of outgrew my house so until I can get it rebuilt in an appropriate enough size, I'm going to have to ask to bunk with you. Merci beaucoup. I'll be right over.\" Bernadette hung up and let out a sigh. Bernadette was actually the middle child of three sisters. Her older sister, Avril and her younger sister, Chantal, had both been infected by the anthropomorphism and weight gain virus as well. However, they transformed sooner than Bernadette herself did and Bernadette didn't see her sisters in person that often so she couldn't remember exactly what animals they had mutated into. But she <i>did</i> know that neither Avril nor Chantal mutated into a hippopotamus like Bernadette herself. It would seem that the virus is random at first without initially taking the DNA of the infected women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBernadette decided to walk down Champs Elysees and noticed that she was far from the only mutated giant woman in Paris. She saw a morbidly obese bat giantess flying through the air with her husband riding on her shoulder. Bernadette turned her head around to see a walrus giantess drinking a bottle of champagne before waving at her. Bernadette then saw something really exciting up the street. There appeared to be a giant runway that had three anthro amazon giantesses that were as big and obese as Chantal herself and appeared to be working as super-sized supermodels. First of them was a giant brunette panther girl in a pair of round glasses similar to Chantal's own and was wearing a two piece cybernetic looking bikini that had a green bikini top and a light blue bikini bottom as she swayed her enormous hips. The second was a blonde haired obese eagle giantess who was wearing a black and white zigzagged cocktail dress and a pair of pearl earrings. Lastly there was a bright blue skinned and redheaded obese shark woman who was clearly a goth girl in a spider web designed jacket and several navel piercings. Bernadette smiled as she saw the model giantesses getting their pictures taken. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow those are three girls who are very confident with their new bodies. Wish that I had their courage. You feeling okay in their, Philipe?\u201d The giant hippopotamus spoke into her cleavage, completely unaware that her boyfriend was wedged between her butt cheeks and still was trying to climb his way out. \u201cJust a little more. Just a little.\u201d However, on the outside, a giant and obese African buffalo girl delivering a pizza accidentally bumped her ass into Bernadette\u2019s own ass and caused it to ripple and therefore made Philipe fall further down into his girlfriend\u2019s panties. Then he grunted because Bernadette\u2019s panties appeared to contract from her massive booty. Philipe kept trying to pound on his girlfriend\u2019s butt to get her attention but Bernadette just scratched her planet crushing bum for every time Philipe pounded on it. \"Damn,\" she said. \"Those lousy mosquitos. Who would've thought a hippopotamus the size of a skyscraper would have to worry about then. But serves me right for having such a sweet ass. Boy, Philipe, you sure are quiet today.\" Philipe was more than a little annoyed that his girlfriend appeared to be too numb to feel that he was stuck between her enormous cheeks. \"I don't know which one of her sisters she's going to be staying with, but I really hope that she feels me before she sits down.\u201d Philipe then tried to literally kick Bernadette\u2019s enormous butt and made her groan and let out a hippopotamus-esque grunt. \"I wonder if that virus mutated any of the mosquitos. That last one had to be the size of a bus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of buses, there was a bus near Bernadette's feet. Bernadette managed to lift her foot to prevent it from crushing the bus as it drove down the road but in the process stubbed her toe on the bus and grunted before she accidentally pressed her butt into the side of a building and cracked the building slightly before looking in embarrassment. \"It's going to be a long walk.\" After a few hours, Bernadette had finally managed to reach her destination and walked up to her sister's house. \"Thank goodness,\" muttered Philipe. \"Finally here.\" Bernadette walked up to the house and saw that it was more than big enough to accommodate an entire handful of ginormous anthro amazons. She let out a whistle before knocking on the door. While Bernadette was waiting for the sister she contacted to open the door, Philipe saw his opportunity to climb out of his hippo girlfriend's enormous panties and  panted as he climbed up her tail and inhaled deeply. \"At least I can breath again.\" He groaned. Then he looked up to see Bernadette's hair hanging down and tried to reach for it when Bernadette's sister finally opening the door caused him to slip and grab the tip of Bernadette's tail to keep from falling to his doom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich of Bernadette's sisters lives here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Note: the species of said sister will depend on the next writer to come along)</span></div></div>",

Rather than be filled with a plane of solid blue peppered with white clouds, the outside world was shielded away from the suburb by a large dome of made of hexagon-shaped windows. The air felt sterile in the sealed village, which certainly didn't help to curb Kim's anger. \"This is obnoxious! How're we supposed to live like this?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Kim, would you just <i>shut up</i> for once?!\" Pepper snapped, Kim's constant whining finally hitting the switch for her. \"You know you're not alone in this place, right? Constantly complaining about this isn't going to make things better for anybody!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim glared at Pepper, but didn't say anything as she left the porch in a huff and ran back to her home across the street. Pepper looked back at the dome and sighed, weighed down by everything that'd been going on for the last few months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since the anthro virus had started the world had been in an uproar. The very coarse of human nature was being thrown off the line as woman shed their own species and grew to nigh-unstoppable sizes. Her hometown was part of a rare few that were yet to be affected, and as such every precaution was  taken to assure that it stayed that way for as long as possible. Pepper was initially happy to go unchanged for a while, but being cooped up in the same circle of land for months on end with no outside contact started to wear on her. Many of her friends lived out of town, a factor that made the dome so much less lively to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pepper? You doing alright?\" She heard Keith ask as he walked onto the porch from the front door and stood at her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm...fine, I guess.\" She sighed. \"You know...It's amazing how fast things can change in such a huge way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, honey. Trust me, a lot of people are on the same boat as you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I think I'm gonna go read.\" Pretty much the only thing she did around here, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. I'm gonna go to the store, so see you later!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the den, Pepper switched the TV on as she walked past and sat in her armchair, grunting as she felt her belt dig into her waist. To her surprise, onscreen was an anthro; a brown bird dressed in a blue reporter suit standing outside what looked like a building scaled to her size. She was so fat that the camera had to stand a decent distance away to keep her width on screen, the bottom cutting off halfway down her enormous bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm standing here at Ethra towers, one of the largest resorts ever created on earth!\" She announced. \"This marks the first in many renovations designed to accomodate anthro womanhood!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wait, what?\" Pepper whispered, Adjusting a snug button on her shirt. <i>I thought they were trying to stop the disease, not allow it!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Women everywhere are in a hype when months ago they were fearing the outbreak of the anthro virus, but nowadays have reached a common concensus of approval, me included!\" She motioned the camera to a raccoon standing next to her, a head taller and far fatter. The camera actually struggled to keep both of them in frame. \"Miss, have you anything to say on this turn of events?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's amazing!\" The raccoon cheered. The voice tugged a few voices in Laura's mind, remembering it all to well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Holy crap...it's LAURA!!!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel better than ever before! I feel a lot stronger, more refreshed, and it's absolutely fantastic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you feel now compared to when you first heard of the virus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....I was scared at first, but then I found out that when it happens to you, it's not so bad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any last words before we get off the air, miss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to say hi to my friend, Pepper!\" She smiled, waving at the camera. \"We're wishing you all the best, Pepsi!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPepper shut the TV, struggling to process what she'd seen. Last time she'd heard the nation was in utter panic, but now they were treating this whole thing like it was spring break! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is going <i>on?!</i>\" She groaned. She leaned forward and held her face with her hands, but winced as she felt her jeans' button dig even deeper into her stomach. \"...huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned back into the chair and looked down at herself, her eyes widening as she observed her body. Her stomach looked to have grown larger than she'd last remembered, straining the buttons on her shirt and peeking out in a long stripe of soft flesh. Her legs had also puffed up a lot more, her hips now pressing into the sides of the armchair. With a loud <i>POP!</i> the button on her pants was torn apart, allowing more of her stomach to bulge out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...crap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The woman tried her hardest to fight the change as she got up, but in the process, her butt had expanded and had gotten stuck into the seat as she groaned. Pepper tried to run outside so as no to destroy the house but her butt and belly got stuck in the doorway. Pepper let out a groan. \"This is not good,\" she said. \"This is very not good.

She lowered her neck as she kept growing but even then, she pressed against the dome hard enough to shatter it.

From the looks of it, Kim was a giant obese anthropomorphic quagga, a type of extinct zebra but with a yellow-brown body and a butt that had not a single stripe on it. Kim was 200ft tall with a 350ft wide belly and 250ft butt and D-cup breasts. Her clothes had been completely shredded by the transformation, leaving her naked in her earrings and necklace. Pepper herself was 200ft tall with a 200ft long neck, a 250ft wide stomach and 350ft wide butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPepper lowered her 200ft long neck to get a good look at her mutated friend who had her arms crossed and gave an angry snort. \"Well, Kim,\" said Pepper. \"You had an interesting transformation. Looks like you're a quagga.\" \"What the hell is a quagga?\" asked Kim. \"I'm a weird zebra, not a ****ing quagga.\" Pepper rolled her eyes. \"Kim, a quagga is an extinct species of zebra.\" Kim let out a yell and stomped on a car in rage. \"Perfect,\" she muttered. \"Not only am I a giant fat freak, but I'm extinct. This is worse than being cooped up under that ****ing dome! Hey, where is the... ow!\" Kim stepped on a broken piece of the dome and then sat down on top of a bank, killing the ceiling as she removed the piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPepper smiled nervously. \"I kind of destroyed the dome when I grew. I guess that's what comes of having a long neck. By the way, Kim, Laura's a raccoon now.\" Kim scoffed. \"Figures. Oh and thanks for letting in more virus, Pepsi. It won't be long until every girl in here is infected. I was breastfeeding my daughter when this happened for crying out loud. It's a wonder that she didn't start crying when I mutated. Oh my gosh! You don't think that...\" \"I don't think Nora will be effected, Kim,\" said Pepper as she uprooted a tree to scratch her enormous rear. \"This disease only seems to effect adults.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Pepper heard her stomach growling. \"I hope Keith gets back from the store soon,\" said the giant giraffe lady to her quagga friend. \"I'm starving.\" Kim felt her own stomach rumbling and then waddled off before she picked up an unattended fruit cart and threw it into her mouth. \"Are you kidding, Pepsi? It would take an entire supermarket just to feed one of us. Hmm. I wonder how my ex-husband will taste.\" Pepper gave a look of shock and leaned her neck back before she let out a yell.The giraffe woman fell backwards and accidentally crushed hers and Keith's house under her mountainous butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPepper stood up and saw pieces of her house stuck to her butt and blushed.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Our story begins in a city in an apartment building built for women who were still human-sized. A young woman was busy reading the newspaper. She was a young woman with long black hair with one red highlight and one blue highlight and she was wearing a black <i>Jurassic World</i> T-shirt and a pair of tight black pants with long black gloves as she read the newspaper as she drank a cup of coffee. In the newspaper there was a giant obese green-skinned ankylosaurus woman with long green hair wearing a purple suit and black tie in front of a flag that looked similar to the American flag except that the flag's stripes were red, black, blue, green and pink. \"I can't believe she actually won,\" joked the girl reading the paper. \"This is the first time since the comet that the U.S.A. has had an herbivore as the president.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young girl then looked out the window to see one of her neighbors passing by. She was an obese redheaded parasaurolophus woman with a freckled face. She was 800ft tall with bright golden red skin and a large crest on her head, a 1000ft wide stomach, 1300ft wide ass and huge E-cup breasts. She was wearing a purple shirt, white jacket and skirt. The parasaurolophus woman turned to face her neighbor and smiled. \"Hi, Zoe,\" she said. \"Happy late birthday.\" \"Thanks, Pepper,\" said Zoe. \"I can't believe it. I'm finally 20. Won't be long until I'm as big as you. Maybe even bigger.\" Pepper leaned against Zoe's apartment and let out a laugh. \"And you're going to have to move soon. That apartment's not going to hold you for long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat both Pepper and Zoe were talking about was the fact that hundreds of years ago, a comet struck the Earth and transformed the planet into a new world that looked a lot like how it was millions of years ago when dinosaurs walked the Earth with trees bigger than skyscrapers and vegetation as far as the eye could see. The continents were also closer together. However, the most extreme effect was that the human race was effected. The women were given a strange mutation. At the age of 20, they would permanently transform into giant and obese anthropomorphic dinosaurs. The smallest dinosaur giantess was 300ft tall. Their biology had been affected so that while they could still reproduce with men small enough to fit into their mouths, they would lay eggs that hatch into human offspring of both genders, with only the female children eventually growing up to be dinosaurs as well. Needless to say, women were in charge and all government positions were fulfilled by giant dinosaur women while for the most part, men were servants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPepper gave a laugh. \"And don't forget, what your mom says. As soon as you become a dinosaur, you'll be able to marry Chris.\" Zoe looked at her engagement ring and smiled. \"I'm looking forward to being married to Chris, especially since I'll be much bigger than him. Tell me, Pepper, what's it like having a breath mint-sized husband?\" \"We make it work, Zoe,\" the parasaurolophus giantess said. \"In a few weeks I'm expecting eggs.\" \"Congratulations. And don't worry, we'll still be friends once I transform.\" Pepper smiled and waved as she stomped away. What Zoe meant was that carnivorous and herbivorous dinosaurs didn't always get along. While they were all still human and therefore it was illegal for them to attack each other, old species conflicts die hard. Pepper was Zoe's best friend despite the fact she was a parasaurolophus and the latter was the daughter of a velociraptor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe then looked back and saw that she had indeed gotten taller and her belly was bulging but her ass was now 4 feet wide. She squeezed it and smiled. In this world of obese giant dinosaur girls, the bigger you were, the more beautiful you were. Suddenly, Zoe heard a knock on her door and smiled. She knew it could only be her fianc\u00e9, Chris. Zoe smiled and tried to walk out, but her big ass got in the way and she grunted before Chris pulled her out. \"Thanks, Chris, honey,\" said Zoe. \"Damn, my ass is big.\" Chris gave a smile and rubbed his girlfriend's booty. \"That's a good sign, Zoe, you're going to transform. soon and then we can get married.\" Zoe bent over and kissed her future husband before they walked out onto the human sidewalk, just as they saw large dinosaur feet walking to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe and Chris looked to see everywhere there were dinosaur giantesses. There was a giant and extremely bottom heavy, purple-skinned and lavender haired carnotaurus woman with a Union Jack t-shirt who was rocking her human infant son on her nose and on another end of the street, there was an obese red-skinned pterodactyl girl with long white hair who was eating a skewer of roast pigs while sitting on and bending a street lamp. Zoe let out a sigh. \"I can't believe this might be the last time that I walk the human side of the sidewalk.\" Chris gave a smile. \"And I'm sure you'll make a gorgeous dinosaur.\" Zoe kissed her fianc\u00e9 and the two of them walked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the couple arrived at a cafe where Zoe wasted no time biting into an entire roast cow. At this point, she was 12 feet tall and weighed two tons and her teeth had already turned sharp, signaling it wasn't long until she fully transformed. Since Zoe's mother was a raptor, she only ever ate meat. Chris himself found it attractive though his mother was a spinosaurus. \"So how long until the transformation is complete?\" asked Chris to his future wife. Zoe let out a loud belch and then heard a tear before seeing a tail sprout behind her and noticed her skin turning green as she smiled. \"Not that long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe stood up and was getting bigger and fatter by the second, easily passing the 60ft mark as she let out a laugh and her clothes begun to tear apart. Chris gave a look of surprise and took out his phone. \"Hello,\" he said. \"City hall. Prepare yourself. My fianc\u00e9e is undergoing her transformation as we speak.\" Zoe herself had grown past 300ft tall and let out a roar as she held out her hands and they turned into claws as her underbelly turned yellow-green and her face stretched out into that of a velociraptor. She let out a laugh as the rest of her body quickly followed and her ass expanded large enough to tear apart her pants and panties. \"Get ready Chris,\" thought the currently mutating woman to herself. \"You're about to be a dinosaur's fianc\u00e9.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Soon, Zoe in her 300ft tall and 8 ton (in scale) velociraptor form was at the Registry of Transformation to have her IDs updated to suit her new appearance. The photographer was a large saichania woman with bright reddish-brown skin and ginger hair worn in a bob cut. The saichania girl was 600ft tall and with a 900ft wide stomach that she rested her camera on. \u201cSmile.\u201d She said. Zoe grinned and showed her new rather sharp fangs right before the photographer took her picture and it wasn\u2019t long until Zoe was showing her dinosaur I.D. \u201cName: Zoe V. Marshall. Birthday: October 10th. Species: Velociraptor.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Zoe grumbled because she had a piece of meat stuck in her teeth. \u201cDamn!\u201d Chris let out a sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s no big deal, Zoe. Nobody looks good in their Dino ID photograph. My cousin the suchomimas sneezed and messed up her own photograph.\u201d Zoe then smiled and gave a laugh. The saichania photographer was confused but then she saw Chris and realized something. \u201cOh!\u201d she yelled. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Your mother must be one of those girls who waits until mutation to marry. It sure makes it easy passing eggs. Just ask my sister. Good luck, you two.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe stomped out of the registry with Chris riding on her left boob. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to tell my mom that we\u2019re going to be married sooner than we thought.\u201d Zoe let out a laugh as she hugged her large boobs and Chris tried to maintain his footing. \u201cWell hold on, Zoe,\u201d said Chris. \u201cWe can\u2019t rush into this.\u201d Zoe just gave a laugh. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d said Zoe. \"I'm sure we'll be a perfect couple.\" But Chris let out a sigh. \"You do realize that my mother is going to be living with us. I hope you're okay with that.\" Zoe let out a scoff. \"Where do you think that we're stopping off first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe stomped away, being extra careful not to step on any men, children or untransformed women. She almost stepped on the human sidewalk before she remembered to walk on the dinosaur sidewalk, whereupon she accidentally bumped into an obese orange-skinned oviraptor woman dressed in a Batgirl shirt and a pair of tight khakis. \"Hey!\" yelled the oviraptor girl in a Chinese accent. \"Watch where you're going!\" \"Sorry,\" said Zoe with a blush. \"I...\" The oviraptor girl rolled her eyes and let out a sigh. \"Let me guess,\" she said. \"Newly transformed.\" Zoe blushed and nodded her head. The oviraptor girl just put her hand on Zoe's shoulder. \"Be very careful,\" she said. \"Being this titanic takes a lot of getting used to.\" Zoe gave a snort and then nodded her head again. The oviraptor girl stomped off just as Zoe noticed Chris had suck into her cleavage. The velociraptor giantess reached down and pulled out her fianc\u00e9 before she was about to kiss him. But Chris blocked with his foot. \"Hold on there, lover girl. Save it for the wedding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before Zoe and Chris returned to the house where Chris lived with his mother. Chris's mother was like they said, a 1000ft tall violet-skinned spinosaurus with an enormous fin on her back. She had a 1500ft wide stomach and 1200 wide ass that was at the moment plopped into a chair as she was busy trying to fix a quilt as Chris was guiding her needles. Chris's mother was actually blind and as such, despite being a dinosaur big enough to make her human son look like an insect, she was fully dependent on Chris to help her with everything from chores around the house to paying the bills. Not an easy task for a man in a world where all women were titanic and obese dinosaurs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe colossal spinosaurus woman let out a snort as she lowered her head. Since she couldn't see Zoe, she merely sniffed her future daughter-in-law. \"A velociraptor, huh?\" she asked. \"My son is just like his daddy. Likes fierce predatory girls. Of at least girls who look fierce. I wish I could see what kind of person my son is marrying.\" \"Mom!\" yelled Chris. \"Look out!\" Mrs. Owens stopped sewing just as she was about to poke herself in the finger with the needle. The spinosaurus giantess sniffed out her small son and smiled. \"Thank you, Chris,\" she said. \"I definitely don't want to soak Pepper's quilt with blood. I hear she's expecting twin eggs. I'm really sorry to rely on you so much. I'd also hate to shift a lot of the burden on such a wonderful girl like Zoe.\" \"I don't mind, Mrs. Owens,\" said the velociraptor woman to her boyfriend's mother. \"After all, I've got to get used to this new body. I feel like I can take on the world.\" \"Well duh,\" said Chris. \"You're the half of the population that <i>rules</i> the world.\" Both dinosaurs in the room let out a laugh at the sole human's joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Owens then gave a serious look that could be seen even with her blind eyes. \u201cRemember, Chris,\u201d said the spinosaurus giantess. \u201cDivorce isn\u2019t legal in this state so you have to make sure you and Zoe will be happy together.\u201d \u201cWhat are you worried about, Mom?\u201d asked Chris. \u201cI love Zoe.\u201d Zoe nodded her head. \u201cAnd I love Chris too, Mrs. Owens. Don\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll be perfectly fine together.\u201d \u201cI hope so,\u201d said Mrs. Owen. \u201cBecause I really don\u2019t want Chris to go through what happened with Bertha.\u201d Zoe looked in confusion and Chris gave a nervous look. \u201cUh,\u201d said Chris. \u201cMom. I just realized we\u2019re out of milk. Zoe and I will just go out and pick up some more. Zoe gave a look of confusion before Chris waved his hand to signal to his velociraptor fianc\u00e9e to leave the house. Of course, after they left, Mrs. Owens just shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019re a terrible liar, Chris,\u201d she said. \u201cYou already ordered milk this morning. Well, it\u2019s about time Zoe knew.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe was very curious and skeptical at the idea of this Bertha woman that her soon to be mother-in-law was talking about and turned to face Chris who was predictably nervous about the subject. \u201cBertha?\u201d asked Zoe. \u201cWho\u2019s Bertha?\u201d Chris let out a sigh. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to say this, Zoe,\u201d said Chris. \u201cBut you\u2019re not the first girl I dated.\u201d The velociraptor giantess was surprised to hear this. \u201cWait? There was another.\u201d Chris nodded his head. \u201cThat\u2019s correct. But Bertha, she had an awful, uncontrollable temper and made me miserable and that was back when she was a human. I knew that she\u2019d be nothing but trouble once she became a dinosaur so I dumped her while I was still legally able to.\u201d Zoe just stared at Chris. \u201cShe sounds like a bad egg. Exactly what kind of dinosaur did she turn into?\u201d \u201cI have no idea,\u201d said Chris. \u201cI never met her mother so I have no way of knowing if she\u2019s an herbivore or a carnivore. Hopefully I\u2019ll never see her again though.\u201d That\u2019s what Chris thought, but what he didn\u2019t know was at a nearby cafe, there was a dinosaur woman who was obscured by a large patio umbrella making it impossible to tell what species of dinosaur she was. However, she looked even bigger and fatter than Zoe and she was glaring and let out a slight growl as she saw Zoe and Chris walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Zoe was meeting with her mother. Zoe\u2019s mother was a velociraptor much like her daughter, except she was 500ft tall and was bright blue-skinned with purple spots and was even fatter than her daughter. She was speaking with her daughter over several roasted pigs. \u201cSo my little girl has finally grown into her dino form,\u201d said Mrs. Marshal. \u201cPretty soon, you\u2019ll be ready to lay an egg.\u201d \u201cMom,\u201d said Zoe as she chomped on a pig. \u201cMom, Mom, Mom. I\u2019m not that far in our relationship yet. But a deal\u2019s a deal. I\u2019m a dinosaur now, so that means I can finally marry Chris.\u201d Mrs. Marshall smiled and growled as she nodded her head. \u201cI hope you can bear living with that blind mother of his. It\u2019s embarrassing for a dinosaur to have to rely so much on a man. It\u2019s a good thing you\u2019re marrying somebody with a steady job.\u201d \u201cSpeaking of which,\u201d said Zoe. \u201cHow\u2019s Dad doing applying for that job at the power plant.\u201d \u201cYou mean reapplying,\u201d said Mrs. Marshall. \u201cRemember, he worked their two years ago. I don\u2019t think that place is properly run. Well, I can tell you one thing. If he\u2019s a no show at our only daughter\u2019s wedding, He\u2019ll be sleeping in my armpit for weeks.\" \"Don't worry, Mom,\" said Zoe. \"Everything is going to be alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Marshall started to pick her sharp teeth as she gave a growl. \"So, Zoe. Have you decided who you're going to invite?\" \"Well that's simple enough. I'm going to definitely invite Pepper and her husband to the ceremony. After all, Pepper is my best friend and I can't think of anyone else to be the best lady. Then I'm going to have to remember Vince, Dave and Cooper. After all, their best friend is signing himself away to a giantess.\" \"I think that Chris will take care of inviting the guys.\" Said Mrs. Marshall right before she lets out a slight belch and then wipes her face with a napkin. \"Right,\" said a very embarrassed Zoe. \"Well, Scarlet will throw a hissy fit if I don't invite her so that's a no brainer. What about Colleen?\" \"Haven't you been mad at Colleen for years?\" Zoe gave a snort. \"I'm willing to forgive her for losing that scarf she borrowed from me. Hmm, I definitely got to get my affairs in order. Oh my gosh! I've just realized something. There's so much to do to prepare for the wedding. I've got to invite everybody I can think of, get my dress ready, order a cake made out of meat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Marshall rolled her eyes and then grabbed her daughter by the cheeks. \u201cZoe. It\u2019s going to be alright. We\u2019ve still got plenty of time before we can worry about the wedding. I'm sure that Chris and his mother are having just as much to consider themselves.\" Zoe just gave a snort and smiled. \"Well,\" she said. \"Hopefully Bertha isn't invited to the ceremony.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, who should we follow as the wedding is being planned out?</span></div></div>",

In this new world, pedicures to these dinosaur giantess were done by human men much smaller than the smallest toes of these titans and at that moment, there were two specialists tending to Zoe\u2019s right foot while Pepper had two men on her left foot. Zoe couldn\u2019t help but grunt slightly as one of the beauticians filed the tip of one of her sharp bus-sized toenails. \u201cYou\u2019ll get used to it,\u201d says Pepper. \u201cJust let them do their job.\u201d Zoe just smiled nervously as she showed her sharp teeth. \u201cThanks for letting me stay at your place until I can move in with Chris and his mom, Pepper. I\u2019d stay at my old apartment but I kinda outgrew it.\u201d \u201cAt least you were outdoors when it happened,\u201d says the pregnant parasaurolophus to her velociraptor friend. \u201cWhen I first turned into a parasaurolophus, I burst apart my college dorm.\u201d One of the men working on Pepper\u2019s toes laughed at Pepper\u2019s expense, prompting her to grab him between her toes. \u201cIt\u2019s unwise to laugh at a dinosaur.\u201d Warned Pepper right before she let the man go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe let out a laugh right before she forced her head past her large stomach and saw that one of her pedicurists had already gotten out a paintbrush. \u201cSo, what\u2019s your fianc\u00e9\u2019s favorite color, Ms. Marshall?\u201d asks the man. Zoe thought about that but then smiled nervously. \u201cNot a lot goes with green skin. Just paint them black.\u201d Pepper smiles as she then gestures for the men on her foot to move on to the next foot and then speaks again. \u201cSo, the wedding is in a few days. You are so impatient.\u201d Zoe let out a snort. \u201cHello. I\u2019m a velociraptor. The name means \u201cspeed thief\u201d. I can\u2019t get married fast enough.\u201d Pepper then snorted again and then made a strange noise from the crest in her head. \u201cWell, don\u2019t you worry. I\u2019ll be the best best woman you\u2019ll ever need when it comes to say the I-dos.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, there was a stomping sound and into the parlor walked another giantess and this one dwarfed even Pepper. She was a 2500ft tall (including neck) seismosaurus woman with pitch gray skin who looked like she would weigh 10 tons had she been normal-sized. This seismosaurus girl had bright black skin and long white hair and was wearing a navy blue unitard. She also had two tattoos of a black seismosaurus\u2019s foot on each of her monstrous butt cheeks. The giantess had to lower her 1000ft long neck just to get into the parlor. \u201cDammit,\u201d she grumbled to herself. \u201cThey can accommodate the world\u2019s biggest hips, heaviest belly and roundest booty and yet they can\u2019t make a door to suit my neck. That\u2019s discrimination against sauropods. I should sue.\u201d Zoe and Pepper rolled their eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t get overheated Sara,\u201d said Pepper. \u201cYou always have to play the species card.\u201d The seismosaurus let out a scoff and plopped her enormous ass in the seat next to Pepper and rang the bell for a young man to run up to her titanic hand. \u201cThese are getting too long,\u201d said Sara. \u201cBe a dear and file them for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sara was having her nails done, she turned her head to face Zoe and Pepper. She recognized Zoe and was surprised that she was now a velociraptor. \u201cZoe!?\u201d Zoe gave a smile. \u201cHi, Sara. Guess who just finally metamorphed.\u201d Sara gave a nervous look. \u201cOh,\u201d she said. \u201cA velociraptor. Just like your mom. Yeah, guess there\u2019s no way it could\u2019ve gone differently.\u201d Sara gave a nervous smile and laughed slightly. \u201cSo, now we have a carnivore among our ranks.\u201d Pepper gave a laugh. \u201cFor once, Sara is speechless. This is going good. And to celebrate Zoe\u2019s transformation and marriage in a few days, we\u2019re taking her out to the Angry Cabaret.\u201d \u201cThat new nightclub that opened across the street?\u201d asked Zoe. \u201cWow.\u201d Pepper gave a smirk. \u201cHey. You\u2019re the one getting hitched here.\u201d Sara let out a scoff. \u201cWell that\u2019s just great. Pepper\u2019s already married, Zoe\u2019s engaged but I\u2019m still single.\u201d Pepper and Zoe laughed at their friend\u2019s expense before Zoe remembered something and bit her lip nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething wrong, Zo?\u201d asked Sara. \u201cWell,\u201d said Zoe. \u201cI\u2019m wondering about Chris\u2019s ex-girlfriend, Bertha. He told me that she was hard to get along with and had an awful temper.\u201d \u201cSounds kind of like Sara.\u201d Said Pepper smugly. Sara glared at the parasaurolophus woman before Pepper turned her head. \u201cHe dumped her before she transformed so she\u2019s probably a dinosaur by now.\u201d \u201cSo what are you worried about?\u201d asked Pepper. \u201cYou don\u2019t even know what kind of dinosaur she turned into and she hasn\u2019t even met you. That\u2019s no reason to be afraid. You\u2019re getting married to Chris in a few days. If this Bertha woman doesn\u2019t like it, she can go choke on an ammonite.\u201d Zoe let out a laugh at that comment.</span></div></div>",

(A <i>doubly</i>-impressive feat, given her plump shape typical of transformed women). Smirking and showing her fangs to the cheering crowd, she wiggled the rain-bow tinted fan on her back one last time before making for the bar, and a waiting round of free drinks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe happened to walk by a certain chair in a lounge area by the dance floor, giving the two tiny men standing on the cushion a spectacular view of her giant, leather-pants clad rump; her tail poking out through a hole just big enough to fit it without showing more skin than she wanted...not that it mattered, since her tight pants and tank top looked like they were painted on anyways. One of the guys, muscle-bound and thuggish-looking, cracked a leering grin as he stared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Hell</i> of a woman, amirite?\" The thug rumbled to his much skinnier cohort, taking a swig of his drink. \"Better views than up there in the 'little boys' club', right?\" He looked up at the ceiling and scowled. Above the crowd of titanic dinosaur women, catwalks hung from the ceiling leading to a human-scale dance floor and bar built into the club's rafters. Everyone up there, from the clubbers to the bartenders, were men. Most seemed oblivious to the dinosaur women below save for a few chatting with a brontosaurus woman who could easily get to them with her long neck. \"Buncha pussies; letting themselves get shoved to the sidelines....\" he shook his head. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis rail-thin partner shivered a bit, looking about the lower dance floor. \"Or they just didn't want to get, y'know, <i>flattened</i>. Most people who go out to get smashed don't want it to be <i>literal</i>....like how <i>you</i> want us to end up. Seriously, didn't you see the bouncers laughing when you told them you wanted to go downstairs without a girl?!\" He threw up his hands, splashing some of his drink onto the landscape-sized upholstery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Thug rolled his eyes, turning to Mr. Thin. \"It's not like we're breaking some club rule or anything; no need to lose your cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shadow suddenly covered them, and only Mr. Thin bothered to look up. Then he went pale. \"C-Can I lose my cool <i>now</i>?\" He pointed upwards with a shaky finger. Mr. Thug followed it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And they both let out a brief scream as a plump dino-butt crashed down onto them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid booty belonged to Sara. \"Idiots, should have stayed upstairs. Can you girls <i>believe</i> those two?\" She pointed down at her rump and scoffed, but couldn't help but smile, their struggles no doubt tickling her rear as it bounced and wiggled down on them as Sara bopped along to the thumping music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe and Pepper laughed at the whole scene before taking the chairs next to Sara, taking a second to check their seats for any more guys. \"I'm surprised nobody sat on them until now!\" Pepper chuckled, sipping from her soda. (Alcohol during egg-laying was just as bad an idea as a human pregnancy). \"Normally I feel sorry for guys who end up as seat cushions, but anyone <i>that</i> stupid has it coming if you ask me. Kinda wish I could have done it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw them first,\" Sara corrected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a gulp of her daquari, Zoe giggled. \"Harsh, girls! I've heard of...<i>that</i>...happening by accident; but, <i>on purpose?</i> Isn't that a bit mean, Sara?\" She thought of poor Chris getting pancaked under her own rear, and winced. \"And...I never thought you'd be into that kind of thing, Zoe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that Zoe spluttered, nearly spilling her drink. Sara let out a laugh at the parasaurolophus girl's expense as she fumbled for a napkin, coughing and sneezing. \"I-I'm NOT 'into that kind of thing'!\" She defended, looking quite embarrassed. \"I'm just a bit envious that Sara got to give them what was coming to them, that's all...\" Her eyes shifted a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe's smile turned devilish. \"Oh? Remember last week, when you bought that issue of <i>Dinosaur Woman's Weekly</i> when we went shopping? The one with that article; '10 Ways to Go Prehistoric with your Man'?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPepper groaned, facepalming. \"Don't do this, Zoe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, please do; this is gonna be good!\" Sara countered, craning her long neck down and grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seemed <i>especially</i> excited about one 'technique',\" Zoe pressed on, Sara all but cackling now. \"I could hear you mumbling about it the whole walk home: 'So a bikini IS safe!';  'good thing I already have a soft chair', 'so THAT'S how you avoid far--'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara broke into a full belly-laugh, even snorting a few times and slapping her knee. \"Oh God, th-hahahaha-at's PRICELESS! Found tips in a magazine, you were worried about <i>farting on him</i>; oh-hohoho my sides!!\" Her laughter even drowned out the music just for a second, as the DJ switched songs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPepper blushed lime green and threw up her hands. \"<i>GAH!</i> Fine; it's my kink, okay?! I just picked the idea up online a while back, and it just...stuck with me. I'd wanted to try it out since before Frank and I got engaged, but I had no idea how to do it safely--or if there WAS a safe and...intimate, way of doing it. When I saw a magazine with a how-to, I just couldn't resist.\" She sighed and slumped into her chair, casting a glance at Zoe. \"...Did I <i>really</i> say all that out loud?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be fair, I <i>was</i> riding on your shoulder on the way home, so I could hear you mumbling pretty easy.\" Zoe couldn't resist a guffaw, even as Pepper gave her a playful punch in the shoulder. \"And before you say it: no, I <i>won't</i> ask you for tips so I can try that with Chris.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not even for your honeymoon?\" Pepper shot back, cocking an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...<i>Maybe</i> I'll give that magazine a peek, if you still have it. Maybe.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara suddenly cleared her throat, catching her friends' attention. \"Not to interrupt, but...you think I should get off the idiots? They're still struggling, but even dimwits need air. Ugh, I think one of them is even trying to <i>literally</i> bite my ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Zoe or Pepper could answer, though....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was utterly massive, of course, standing with could've been a full extra third of the trio's height, and owned a stomach that seemed like some leviathanic landmass that provided an immense barrier between her and them, but that wasn't particularly what made the three all pause at once, adding (if brief) a noticeable roadblock to their smoothly flowing night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't even the only T-rex in the entire club, but it was only her firsthand demeanor that intimidated them. Rather than be endlessly gnashing and rampaging around for some imaginary meal that could truly sate her, she just stared them down with a judgmental look in her eyes, only baring her teeth by sharing them a curious pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Hello?\" Pepper whispered, but it was barely audible over the music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardon me for being nosy,\" The T-Rex began, having not heard her. \"But I think that you know somebody that I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPepper's frown deepened, but Zoe stepped in the way, showing a defensive glare. \"...what's it to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe T-rex brought her hands in the air, giving a resigned smile \"Sorry, I guess I'm just clinging to old times, specifically an old ex of mine. You wouldn't happen to know a 'Chris Harvey,' would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Pepper suddenly remembered how it felt to be shy in the face of a dinosaur, with even Zoe and Sara stepping back, the edge in their faces giving way to surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...\" Pepper began, starting to stumble over her own words. \"You wouldn't happen to be...Bertha, would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, he <i>did </i>remember me!\" She gushed mockingly, sending a chill down all their spines at once. \"So, I take it that you're his <i>new meat</i>, then? What's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyplace else, \"New meat\" was an incredibly common phrase, but it was then that hearing it made Pepper cringe, if just for the emphasis that Bertha spoke it with.</span></span></div></div>",

Will we finally be able to bring objects from the past?&gt; One of the scientists say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Hopefully. We've been working on this for months now.

Before they can catch up, a strange blue vortex opens up in the front of them. The male panics and runs away, while the female is intrigued. Before she can do anything, the vortex sucks her up and closes, leaving no trace of the female saber tooth tiger behind. The male comes back and looks for it's mate, confused.<br>\r\n----------------<br>\r\n<i>Time Corridor</i><br>\r\nThe female saber tooth tiger is flying through the time corridor at high speeds. As it does, it feels an odd change come over it, almost as if it's becoming... humanoid.<br>\r\n-----------------<br>\r\nSwitzerland, 2015<br>\r\nThe time machine dings, indicating it's brought something back.

The sight that greets them is a bizarre one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the machine is a woman, but unlike any woman they had ever seen. She was covered in tan fur and had a long tail. Her canine teeth were incredibly long, reaching past her chin. She had long, unkempt tan hair. She stood at about 15 feet tall. She was also quite obese, with a 10 foot belly, 12 foot butt, and H cup breasts. Her orange eyes looked confused and scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;What is it?&gt; The second scientist asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Based on the fur and teeth, I believe it is a saber tooth tiger, but mutated into a humanoid form.&gt; The first replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;But how?&gt; The second asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first shrugged. &lt;We will need to run tests.&gt; He said. Then he walked up to the woman. The woman backed away. The scientist made a gesture that tried to show he was friendly. That seemed to please the saber tooth woman, and she stepped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;This will be interesting.&gt; The second scientist said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, how does our mutated woman react to the modern day?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She then repositioned her massive hulk and looked over the laboratory, at the computers and the machinery embedded in the walls, right before she spotted a mirror and looked at herself in surprise. She lifted up her 10ft wide belly to get a good look at her sharp and clawed toes and then she held her 12ft wide butt that was almost as tall as she was and tapped it to make it shake and jiggle. She gave a slight growl before she turned back to face the scientists. The first one grunted as the tiger woman picked him up and lifted him in the air. The second one gasped and backed into the corner in pure fear as the tigress showed her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, from the looks of it, the saber-toothed giantess meant no harm. \"&lt;Interesting&gt;,\" she said in a Native American accent. \"&lt;You look like humans, yet you dress differently and have less fur. You also look somewhat scrawnier&gt;.\" Both scientists looked in surprise. \"&lt;It can talk?&gt;\" asked the first scientist. \"&lt;Some flaw in the time machine must've mutated the saber-toothed tiger in both body and brain.&gt;\" The tigress raised an eyebrow. \"&lt;It? That is very rude. It should be perfectly clear that I'm a female of my species. But I do feel different. For one, I walk like a human, I appear to understand human language. However...&gt;\" The tigress looked back at how fat she is. From the looks of it, she would have to weigh 4 tons. \"&lt;For some reason, I am the size of a mammoth.&gt;\" The tigress paused and licked her lips and fangs as she let out a purr. \"&lt;Speaking of which, I'm famished. With how big I am now, I'll bet I could easily bag a mammoth feast&gt;.\" The cat woman put down the first scientist before he spoke to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"&lt;I'm afraid that isn't possible.&gt;\" The tigress rose an eye and then noticed the time machine. \"&lt;What exactly is going on&gt;\" The second scientist then came forward. \"&lt;I think that there is a lot to explain. I am Dr. Cedar and this is my colleague, Dr. Edlund. We built that time machine to bring back creatures and objects of the past. We set it to teleport something from 10,000 years ago and you were what came out. Due to some flaw in the machine, you were mutated into an anthropomorphic form. We believe that there were some side effects.&gt;\" The tigress's eyes opened wide. \"&lt;10,000 years!? Where is my mate? What of mammoths?&gt;\" \"&lt;I'm afraid that the world you knew is long gone, ma'am,&gt;\" said Dr. Edlund. \"&lt;Mammoths and saber toothed tigers have all died out&gt;.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tigress gives a look of surprise and wags her tail. \"&lt;Oh my&gt;,\" she thought. \"&lt;That's unfortunate. It seems I had better get used to this new world. I need to know all I can about the world of the future.&gt;\" Both scientists looked up at the tigress and then nodded their heads. It wasn't long before the tiger woman was brought to a library room and was browsing through several history books as she devoured several raw fishes. \u201c&lt;Are you sure this is a good idea, Edlund?&gt;\u201d asked Cedar. \u201c&lt;We need to know how much she has mutated and what it has done, Cedar. She has clearly been blessed with intelligence far beyond that of an ordinary animal, especially one from a much more primitive time.&gt;\u201d The tigress kept flipping through history books and nodded her head before devouring another herring. \u201cPyramids of Egypt,\u201d thought the sabertooth. \u201cThe crusades, the Revolutionary War. A lot can happen in 10,000 years, but it doesn\u2019t seem like humans have evolved. Yikes, this book on the 20th century alone frightens me.\u201d\u2028<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the tigress kept studying, she kept on eating and it wasn\u2019t long before she was moved onto the literature section and browsed through the works of Shakespeare, all while under constant watch. \u201c&lt;This is it, Cedar.&gt;\u201d said Edlund. \u201c&lt;This will secure our funding. We took a creature from a primeval world and evolved her to human level intelligence. No. Beyond.&gt;\u201d However, Cedar bit his lip. \u201c&lt;What we\u2019re doing is dangerous. But if we send her to the past in this state, who knows what damage will occur?&gt;\u201d Suddenly, there was a cracking sound and both scientists saw the floor cracking apart beneath the tiger woman\u2019s feet. She seemed to be getting bigger and fatter as she was now 20ft tall with a 22ft wide stomach and 25ft wide butt. \u201c&lt;Is it just me, or is she getting bigger?&gt;\u201d \u201c&lt;Hmmm. Perhaps we need to look at the results.&gt;\u201d With that, the scientists left the saber tooth giantess who was evidently still growing to watch a television depicted human society. She had bloated so big she held the television on her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the tiger woman kept on watching, she rubbed her chin and thought to herself. \u201cInteresting. This world is new. Too new. Not only am I a being from a past, but I\u2019m a mutant. Alone in this new world.\u201d The tigress somehow turned off the television with her mind and then her eyes popped before she unconsciously caused several books behind her to levitate. The tigress then begun to float herself and rubbed her chin. \u201cIt seems as though there were side-effects with the transfer to the present. Hmm. I still feel out of place. I think I\u2019ll keep my new psychic powers a secret from these scientist friends. Friends. That\u2019s right. I\u2019m alone in this unfamiliar world.\u201d The tigress then looked back at the time machine and wondered to herself. \u201cI have an idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028What exactly was the obese giant sabertooth\u2019s idea?</span></div></div>",

A simple coffee machine freaked her out.&gt; He walked over to the creature and bent down to look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;It's ok.&gt; He said gently. &lt;The device won't hurt you.&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mutated saber-tooth looked up at the scientist. To his surprise, she began to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;R-really?&gt; She said, nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;You speak?&gt; The scientist said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Yes. I speak. You sure thing won't hurt?&gt; The woman replied. She seemed to still be getting used to speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, the scientist gently led the woman from the desk. Standing up, the saber-tooth placed a hand on her huge belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;So big.&gt; She said. &lt;What happen?&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second scientist pulled the first away as the saber-tooth checked her new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;We need to show this to the board.&gt; He said. &lt;This is an amazing discovery.&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Shouldn't we help her get used to the modern world? You saw how she reacted to the coffee machine.&gt; The first scientist replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do they decide to do?</span></div></div>",

Forcing her into the modern world would be a terrible idea.&gt; The second scientist said. &lt;We should help her get used to the future first.&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first scientist nodded, and walked up to the saber-toothed woman. She stepped back a little bit, scared, but the scientist just smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;My name Johan.&gt; Johan said. &lt;This is Elias. We have no intention to harm you. We wish to help you. Do you have a name?&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman stared at him, confused. &lt;Name?&gt; She asked. &lt;No name.&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohan frowned. &lt;Can you describe where you lived?&gt; He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe saber-tooth woman tried to think of her home. &lt;Big ocean.&gt; She said. &lt;Big mountains. Big valley. Two-legged beings, like you. Take home. Fled with mate.&gt; She then seemed to realize something, and looked around. &lt;Where mate?&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;I'm afraid you were the only one who... arrived.&gt; Johan said. &lt;I'm sorry.&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman frowned. &lt;Me and mate run.&gt; She explained. &lt;Saw strange things. Caves... but not caves. Wooden. Near river.&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;That sounds like Monte Verde.&gt; Elias theorized. &lt;So she must have been from Chile. Saber-tooth tiger fossils were found there.&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Fos...sil?&gt; The woman asked. &lt;What fossil?&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Johan and Elias frowned. They didn't want to reveal this, but felt there was no hiding it forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Your species, the saber tooth tiger. They are... extinct.&gt; Johan said. &lt;Died out nearly 10,000 years ago. Fossils are their bones. By all accounts, due to these circumstances, you are the last living saber tooth tiger in existence.&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mutated tiger stared, utterly confused. &lt;Died? Last living? I am... alone?&gt; She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;I'm sorry.&gt; Johan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiger-woman fell to the ground, her weight making several items shake. Tears seemed to form in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;My mate... gone. Others... gone. All alone.&gt; She muttered. Johan walked up to her, and took her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Please, do not cry.&gt; Johan said. &lt;The saber tooth tiger may be gone, but it isn't forgotten. And you are here. If we can send you back, we don't know. And we are unsure of the mutations. But we'll at least try to make you comfortable.&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman looked at him, and smiled. &lt;Thank you.&gt; She replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;We need a name for you.&gt; Elias said. &lt;You're from Chile... why not Eva? From Johan's little talk, it fits, since it translates to life.&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Eva... nice name. I am Eva.&gt; Eva said, slowly getting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Good.&gt; Johan said. &lt;Now, we need to help you understand the modern day.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The year is 2065. Scientists on Earth have made great leaps in robotics and space travel, but still have trouble understanding genetics, biology, and other related sciences. So bases were set up all over the world to find out more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne such location was Atlantic Base 9, a large research base located deep under the Atlantic Ocean. The location was chosen so any accidents could be kept out of large civilizations. The base was state-of-the-art, with automated security systems and high-end research equipment. The base contained a crew of 500 scientists, engineers, and guards, with about 150 high-end androids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne such scientists was in the genetics lab. This was Carrey Harker, a genetics researcher 6 years out of college. She was about 5'7'', had bright red hair, blue eyes, and an athletic build in lab gear. She was looking over some notes and a set of syringes when she heard foot steps. She turned and smiled at who walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking through the door was a gold colored female android. It was about 6'5'', lacked anything resembling head hair, and had LED eyes and ruby red lips. She had an exaggerated hourglass figure, with N-cup breasts and a huge ass. She also had built in high heels. Despite appearing nude, she had the smooth features of a doll<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was SIA, Carrey's personal robotic assisstant. She was giving to Carrey as a graduation present. She was programmed to help Carrey with any and all work she did. She had a degree of sentience, and developed her own personality. And that personality was completely obssessed with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carrey, my beloved, I have those notes you wanted.\" SIA said in her musical British voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, SIA. Just place them on the table.\" Carrey said, not looking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSIA complied, then took a seat next to Carrey. \"So, my dear Carrey, how is your work coming along?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrey grinned. \"I think I've cracked the genetic code. With this, we can create human-animal hybrids. Heck, if this works right, I might try it myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh splendid.\" SIA said. \"I bet you'll look great. Then again, you make anything look amazing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrey picked up a syringe. The lable read 'DNA: Great White Shark' \"Just imagine it, SIA. All the good this can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a voice rang out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CARREY!\"<br>\r\nBoth Carrey and SIA jumped up and turned. Staring at them was the base leader, Dorian Scott. He was a 6', athleticaly built man in his 60's, bald and with a medium, grey beard and brown eyes. He was wearing a NAVY captain's uniform. He looked annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carrey, I have tried to contact you 12 times. I am having a meeting with the other genetics scientists. You are to report there now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir!\" Carrey replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I come along? I get so lonely without Carrey.\" SIA asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you insist.\" Dorian replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrey and SIA thanked Dorian and left for the meeting. Unknown to either of them, when they jumped up, the syringe with the Great White Shark DNA pierced Carrey's arm, and injected the DNA into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, does Carrey start transforming during the meeting?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So much she hoped that this would finally be the gift to satisfy her girlfriend\u2019s extreme tastes, the present to end all the awkward smiles and dissatisfied glint in her eyes whenever she bought her something she really put effort into, no matter how much money it\u2019d cost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust staring up at it was enough a price to pay for, to think she\u2019d be looking at it any time she\u2019d enter the living room. Maybe there was an audience for armor to collectors, historians with a fascination for war, likely, but imagining anything that could fit into <i>this</i> seemed more fit for something the characters in an epic fantasy novel would face, certainly not medieval Scotland. Unless whoever was using it was on stilts, it would\u2019ve been impossible for <i>any</i> species alive to fit inside, the head looming on a perch standing ten feet into the air, supporting a set of shoulders each over a yard wide, immense barrels needed not just to carry the armor itself around, but, she assumed, the wearer itself. Against any earthling sense of logic or human anatomy, several feet of stomach bulged off of the suit that lay on the floor in a gigantic barrier, a massive, hollow sphere of metal big enough for her to live in, a breastplate laying on top comparable to a set of giant cannonballs bound together in a leather bra. Sticking out into view past either side were a ponderous set of thighs, both of them carrying the girths to birth a mini van.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren squinted at the head, a tall metal dome devoid of any facial features to give it any sense of humanity, or even any breathing holes; just a smooth, metal face with only two large, hollow eyes punched in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDear, god, I hope somebody breaks in and steals this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cKaren? You home?\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren stiffened up at the voice, then ran to the window, seeing none other than the of the house herself at the front door, searching for her keys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Just a minute, Amy!</i>\u201d Karen yelled back, putting on as neutral a tone she could as she ran back into the room, searching for a way to hide herself. The couch, the closet, behind the TV...no. All to cliche.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring back at the mass of metal standing with her, she questioned why it wasn\u2019t her first choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere should be a key in the backyard, I...\u201d She pulled upon the metal door, cringing at the scream of the thousand-year rusted hinges cracking open. \u201c...I\u2019m busy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...okay?\u201d Amy questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren set foot into the spacious armor and gently pulled the door closed, sealing herself in darkness. Devoid of any seams between the metal plates, it was impossible to see the outside world through the armor, completely entrapping her in the deepest of black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe through the eyes?\u201d She thought aloud, and gave a small jump to grab onto the neck...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...but her fingers slipped on her sweat by a  tint of red that flowed inside of the armor. She looked around for a source, but it seemed to bounce off the walls from wherever she looked, seemingly hovering in the air without a source.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe hell?\u201d She exhaled incredulously, reaching for the doors, but hadn\u2019t noticed till her hand was trying to push it open that the opening was fusing shut on its own, the only evidence that it was ever there being a handle<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmy?...Amy, Help!\u201d She screamed as she pounded where the door once lay, wondering where she\u2019d gone wrong. Amy, the armor, stepping inside, but no matter how hard she tried, she remained trapped.  Hearing nothing outside, she feared her arm and punched at the metal as hard as she could...and her fist remained in place, fused to the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the metal soften and contort like jelly around her hand, Karen grabbed her wrist and yanked, growing more frantic as her fist was swallowed. All around her, whatever joints once allowed the armor to flex fused together as the empty shell slowly transformed into but a metal block in its form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHELP!!!\u201d She desperately screamed, seeing her other hand get entrapped as well. She couldn\u2019t even struggle against their bonds; they didn\u2019t even feel submerged, as though the nerves inside of hem had disappeared, bonding her with the soulless metal. Rocking back and forth, she soon realized her legs were fastened as well, already sinking knee-deep in the iron. \u201cANYBODY!!! <b><i>HELP ME!!!</i></b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe metal pressed against her back and bonded to her skin, denying her even the liberty of rocking back and forth. Left with only a beanbag\u2019s chair worth of space, all she could do was watch and whimper as her arms were taken in, the floor rising up on her stomach. What movements she could make became less and less when the very last of her joints were taken, and once her chest was gone, she couldn\u2019t even breath, the metal of the armor keeping her alive to see the metal approach her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave one last squeak of fear before the metal could suffocate her, but before it could, her nose sealed shut before flattening against her face, followed by her eyes, mouth, and ears all fusing shut before the very last tracts of her skin was absorbed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">.....</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b><i>....AGH!!!</i></b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLocked in the same pose Karen was formerly trapped in, the armor\u2019s eyes lit up with a pair of white, glowing pupils. It\u2019s shoulders heaved up and down, despite having no mouth or nostrils to breath through, and yet her voice whistles in and out from where the head\u2019s lips would\u2019ve lay, only now it was filtered into a metallic echo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough muted colors, Karen could see the room of her death, still as it\u2019d been left, but she felt...different. She felt tall, exhausted, but most of all, she get heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i><b>What just...</b></i>\u201d Karen laid a hand on her head, but froze up at a metallic clang from the touch. She opened up an eye to stare at her wrist, her arm shaking as she extended it to see the musculature of the armor instead, feeling the immense weight of the metal. She shot the other one out to see but the reverse of the same, its fingers flexing at their command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes wide, Karen pushed her arms down on her breastplate, the metal mounds somehow squishing like actual flesh, then traced her hands down along her new belly, the armor globe now filled with metal, its obscene weight keeping her pinned in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKaren?\u201d Amy\u2019s voice called out. \u201cFound the key. Need any help with anything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren\u2019s eyes darted to the door, seeing the knob turn. \u201c<i><b>AMY, NO!!!</b></i>\u201d</span></div></div>",
