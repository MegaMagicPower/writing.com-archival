He loved how writers could create things out of words and paper. In a way, it reminded him on how a god felt like. He loved to produce whatever came to his head. If he had an idea for a story, he would run to find a pencil and paper to jot it down. Jeff believed there was power in words. However, he didn't how much there was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, Jeff felt happy and excited for it was his birthday. He got a call from his grandfather saying he was going to mail him his present and to expect it then. When he opened the door to walk around the campus, a heavy package landed on his foot. Jeff picked up it to see it was addressed to him from his grandfather. Beside himself, Jeff closed the door and placed the package on the nearest table. He noticed a note on the top of it. When he opened it, he knew it was written by his grandfather based on the handwriting. It said, \"The best stories are the ones in which you are part of.\"  Jeff unwrapped the package to see that it was a typewriter. Jeff thought this was the best present he ever received. He could both write and print his work at the same time. Inside the box it came in was supplies to take care of it and blank scraps of paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcited, Jeff takes the typewriter to his desk and places the paper into it. He thought about what to write. Jeff looked at the note again and it hit him. He will write a story in which he is living in his fantasy world! Millions of ideas were flowing into his brain that he couldn't organize them. He didn't know where start. He decided to dwell in to pool of thoughts and see what he can fish out. It was going to be a good story. Jeff could feel it.</span></div></div>",

Now, he placed his fingers onto the keys and began to type his first few words. But what he didn't know was how real this story was going to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeff, a college wolf who loves to read and write, majoring in English. However, he is more than just what meets the eye. For he has a secret ability. A skill, or power. Whatever you can call it. He can grow into a muscular juggernaut with a single thought!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff felt a chill run down his body, but he just shrugged it off as the cold weather. It has been pretty cloudy the past few days, and a breeze did just blow in through the window...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To any who chooses to bully this totally awesome wolf, choose wisely. Are you sure you want a hulking muscle-monster chasing you down? Not only is he super powerful, he also becomes super fast, running at speeds that could make rockets green with envy! Not only that, he can also jump at least 300 ft. into the air with a single bound!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis legs felt numb for a second, but he adjusted his sitting position until it was better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And as a bonus, whatever clothes he wears can magically stretch, to avoid any embarrassing accidents if he ever chooses to use his amazing powers. He's smart, brave, kind, but he's also very humble, and would never let any amount of fame or popularity cloud his judgement. No one knows who he really is, as he's never used his powers in public before. However, we can all be absolutely sure that we can always trust him to get the job done. For Jeff, the ordinary college student, is a real superhero.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff reread over what he's written so far. Then, he snapped his fingers. \"Of course! I almost forgot!\" he told himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And lastly, he can revert to his original, ordinary size with a single thought as well, to help hide his secret identity. But, soon, everyone will know who he is. And they'll respect him, and love him, and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff began thinking. \"Man, looks like I've hit a writer's block. Man I hate those...\"</span></div></div>",

He wanted to create a story that would go well with the character he was creating. Then it hit him. Jeff ran back to his typewriter and began writing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One morning, Jeff found himself in a whole new world with his powers. It was world where the most sacred philosophy is 'survival of the fittest'. The strongest were seen superior while the weak people were outcasts. The size of everyone's muscles is what mattered. Jeff didn't agree with this way of life and tried to use his powers to help the weak and make strong understand that weak people aren't exactly weak. But there were others who tried to rid of the weak from the world. Believing that strength wasn't enough, some have devoted their lives to the ways of magic. They use magic to trick or manipulate weak people to their destruction. Jeff knew that these magic users needed to be stopped and travels around the world to confront them. Jeff wants everyone in the world to live peacefully.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff paused for a minute to think. He was missing something. He knew he was. Then it struck him again and continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There were others who shared Jeff's thoughts and had the same powers as he did. There was Devon, a scrawny tiger who came from the slums weak people lived in. His parents were killed by muscular lion muggers. Wilson, a medium built rhino who was always picked on for not being big or strong enough. He ran away from home hoping a life on his own would be better for him. Finally, there was large dragon named Griff. Although everyone approved of him, Griff always thought that picking on little people wasn't right. After seeing weak people uprising against the strong, he was officially convinced there was more to weak people than others give them credit. Jeff, along with his friends and powers, tries to introduce a whole new way of thinking to the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff finally thought that he was done. He really liked how this story outline came out and couldn't wait to get started with the actual story. Before he could start, Jeff saw that it was getting late and he had class in the morning. The story will have to wait until after class. Jeff got ready for bed and dreamed of how his story should continue.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Okay, once classes are done, I can start writing what's gonna happen...\" he told himself. Jeff lay on his bed, ideas swimming around in his mind. It wasn't long until he finally fell asleep. The typewriter, the paper still in it, began to glow an eerie blue light. Then, the writing on the paper began glowing. \"One morning, Jeff found himself in a whole new world with his new powers...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff woke up with a start. He looked around, searching for whatever woke him up from his sleep. He saw a tiger in the distance yelling out his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeff! Wake up! We've got trouble!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother look around and he realized that he was in some kind of outskirts or field, where he was laying down on some grass. Not only that, but it was late at night, yet there were lights flying here and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what going on here!?\" he said. \"We're being raided! That's what's going on!\" the tiger said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff looked on and watched in amazement as the tiger suddenly grew to a huge 8ft. with gigantic muscles rippling with veins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeff! Look out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff turned to see a large ball of light fly right at him, and he passed out.<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\nWhen he woke up, he saw three different faces looking at him. There was a tiger, a rhino, and a dragon. He sat up in surprise, but a sudden pain in his head and backside made him lay back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa Jeff, I don't think you should be getting up after taking a hit like that.\" the rhino said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? But, who are you guys?\" was all Jeff could say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three looked at each other worriedly. \"I think he must've gotten hurt worse than we thought.\" \"You think he has amnesia?\" \"It'd be best if he should rest some more.\" \"Maybe we should reintroduce ourselves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, what are you three talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey looked at Jeff worriedly, and the dragon was the first one to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeff, we think you took a pretty hard hit last night. Maybe you should sleep some more. We'll take shifts keeping look out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? But I don't even know you guys! Could someone please explain what's going on!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time the rhino spoke. \"Wow, you do have amnesia. Well, I'm Wilson. The tiger is Devon, and the dragon is Griff. Does it ring any bells?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I think so...Agh! My head...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It really would be best if you got some rest first. We can fill in the blanks once you're feeling better.\" Devon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-alright, I guess...\"<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\nJeff didn't know how long he slept. When he woke up, the sun was close to setting in the horizon. He stood up and took the view in. He really was in some kind of grassy field, and there seemed to be a town in sight, though getting there would be at least a day's worth of walking. There were a few tents around near him, along with a place for a campfire. This must be where they were camping out until they were raided last night. There were uprooted trees strewn around, along with a few craters and boulders everywhere. Devon was talking to Griff near a tent, while Wilson was fiddling around with random stuff from a backpack. Wanting answers, he approached them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, can I ask a few things?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! If it'll help your memory, we'll be glad to help.\" Griff said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all, where am I? Who are you guys, how did I get here, and...Well, in general, what's going on here!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevon looked worried the most of all. Griff scratched his head and Wilson stopped organizing his stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, first of all, do you at least remember what the world is like now?\" Wilson asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not really. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevon began explaining. \"Well, we're living in a world where the strong rule over the weak. Muscle size is all that matters here, and the smaller people...Let's just say they're not leading very happy lives.\" Griff continued. \"The four of us don't agree with this way of thinking, so we teamed up and now we're trying our best to make the strong see the error of their ways. That way, everyone will have equal rights, and peace can come to this world.\" Wilson continued next. \"But, of course, some of them are too stubborn to give up their old way of thinking. So they try to stop us, but we're always a match for them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff nodded his head, trying to absorb all this information. \"Okay. But I saw Devon suddenly grow huge last night. What's up with that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean you don't even remember that?\" Griff asked. Jeff shook his head. Wilson decided to explain what happened. \"Okay, so you wanna know how he grew like that? Well, I'm guessing you don't remember about the incident at the energy factory a year ago then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An energy factory?\" They nodded their heads. Griff was the one to explain. \"A factory that extracts magical energy from crystals dug up from underground. The four of us happened to be there when an explosion happened inside, fusing us with magical energy. So now, we can grow our bodies to insanely large muscular sizes, to help us in our quest to change the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff's jaw dropped. He can grow? \"Wait, so you're saying I can grow? As in into a humungous, super muscle wolf? And you're not kidding?\" They shook their heads. Wanting to test it out, he focused his gaze on himself and thought of himself growing. Right then and there, he watched as his biceps began to enlarge, his chest puffing up, his abs growing, and he was growing taller. Jeff was amazed! He watched in about five seconds flat, he transformed from a skinny wolf to a total beefcake! He flexed his arm and saw the veins covering his basketball-sized bicep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is awesome!\" Jeff began trying out different poses, flexing every muscle he could think of. His happiness didn't last long when Griff got his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeff, we're only supposed to use that power when we really need to, remember?\" \"Huh? Oh! Uh, right, I guess I forgot that too.\" Jeff shrunk himself back to his original size. Griff placed a hand on his shoulder. \"Hey, it's cool. It's a lot to take in when you don't remember very much, right? We should get to the next city soon too. Who knows when a raiding party might suddenly attack us.\" Jeff nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone began packing up their camp. Jeff was given his backpack, which was surprisingly heavy. \"Hey, what's in this?\" \"Only your stuff. A few clothes and some antique typewriter, I think.\" Devon said. Then it suddenly clicked. Jeff opened up his bag and found his typewriter, right there inside it! There were also a few folded up sheets of paper. Upon opening it, he found the exact same story written there from back in his dorm room! \"This is too much to be coincidence. What if...Am I really in the story?\" Jeff read through what he wrote. The world's outline was generally the same as the story his friends gave him! Plus, the three friends he wrote about fit exactly like the three friends he met in this world! \"Okay, I'm convinced. I think either I've somehow entered the story, or the world was transformed to become my story! But that means...Does this mean the typewriter might still work if I use it here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Jeff! Aren't you finished packing up yet?\" Jeff looked up to see his three friends already ready to leave, backpacks on their backs. \"Uh, y-yeah! I'm coming!\"</span></div></div>",
