Keep in mind, this doesn't necessarily mean your ten. Most playable trainers in the games aren't ten... Anyways, back on topic! You and your class were heading towards a large science laboratory building in the city, that being the destination for this field trip... The building was in sight at this point, the group being lead there by the teacher and other adults in single file lines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin about one minute, you and the rest of the class arrive at the building, all going in... You see your teacher whispering to one of the women in lab coats working there, pointing to you as she was doing so... And looking around the main office, there were a few Pokemon in there as well... An Eevee was being fed some berries by one of the workers, an Elgyem seemed to be assisting in some experiments near the front desk, and a Skrelp was being examined by a worker near the back... A few students strayed away from the group to look at the Pokemon, but most stayed where the were...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see your teacher motioning you over to her as she and the woman she was talking to walked into a room near the back... And of course you followed since it was your teacher... But as soon as you walked through the door, the woman in the lab coat sprayed you in the face with some kind of chemical in a Repel bottle... But it definitely was NOT a Repel. As soon as you inhaled whatever it was, you immediately began to feel dizzy, and soon passed out right there... But when you awoke, you received a shocking surprised... You'd shrunken down, now only about two or three inches in height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for WHERE you woke up though... You were still in the building, likely in a basement floor based on the lack of windows... The room seemed to be a mixture of a playroom, and a place for physical check-ups and tests. It was fairly colorful with a few toys around, as well as differently sized exercise equipment such as weights and treadmills that ranged from small enough for an Eevee to large enough for a Golurk. The same woman who you assume shrank you was sitting at a desk in the corner, seeming to be on the phone. There were also two Pokemon in the room as well. There was an Emolga happily playing with some blocks, and a Riolu currently using one of the small treadmills... As for exactly where you were during all of this? You were just kind of on the floor, in the middle of the room...</span></div></div>",

While the first trip was a rather...interesting journey you partook in, it did seem too soon to go on a second voyage. \"can't we...just wait a bit?\" you insist hoping to dissuade her hunger. \"I mean, it wouldn't hurt to wait til tomorrow would it?\" Apparently, your retort wasn't the best as Ninetale's gave a pouty like face and small 'hmph' as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? are you afraid of going inside me again?\" She asks in an almost accusing tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha? No!\" you quickly reply while waving your hands dismissively. Ninetale's was not the least bit convinced of your honesty as her huge paws slowly begin to approach you. Before you could even react, she lowers her massive face mere inches away from your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then come on.\" she says with a grin before a small growl escapes her cream furred belly. Slowly, her red eyes gaze back at her abdomen before returning back to you. \"did you hear that?\" she asks. \"My tummy's lonely. It want's you back inside.\" she says in an almost seductive tone, causing a shade of red to emerge back on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a defeated sigh and small head shake, you gaze upon her red orbs. \"fine.\" you mumble loud enough for her to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" she says giddily while even giving a small leap to show her excitement. The impact of her huge paws back on the ground was enough to cause you to land on your rear end as she giggles awkwardly over her own eagerness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you seem happy.\" you muse while swiping off some dust your body collected from the fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" she giggles before giving you a long slobbery yet friendly lick. \"not only do I have a human friend, but also one who's really tasty too!\" she says before giving a toothy grin. \"now then, little snack...\" In a mere second she parts her massive jaws wide open, allowing a blast of her hot breath to blow right past you. \"Go oon een.\" she slurs before tilting her head to the side and gently chomping down on your form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith wide eyes, you were soon back within her fleshy mouth as her massive tongue soon begins to wiggle underneath you. The sudden wiggles produced by the muscle immediately send you off balance as you plummet upon the slimy wet surface. Before even having a chance of collecting yourself, you soon find your form sloshed about the innards of Ninetale's maw as she eagerly begins to take in your taste. While you had no idea just how you tasted to the tongue of a pokemon, based on the moans and giggles Ninetale's was producing, you must've tasted pretty delicious. After seconds of getting tossed about and drenched in her saliva, your small form soon ends up sliding down the surface of her huge tongue as the graceful firefox tilts her head upwards. In no time at all, an audible GULP along with the strange sensation of the fleshy walls encasing around your body begin to send you down Ninetale's esophagus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a rather tight and slimy descent, your body was soon pushed straight through a fleshy ring back into the large chamber that was her belly. As you fall and slide upon the pink walls adorning all about the stomach, you quickly begin to notice the walls wiggle and pulsate in a fast manner. Without warning, a large belch soon erupts from above, sending you and her stomach shaking about rapidly. A second or two later, the stomach begins to calm as Ninetale's could be heard giggling above. \"oops, excuse me.\" she chuckles. With a small chortle and shake of your head, you slowly get up on your feet while gazing at the familiar organic surrounding.  </span></div></div>",

Instead a bunch of muffled noises barely made it up to the large pokemons ears. You had to get out of this position or you'll suffocate. \"What's that little human? Trying to beg for your life?\" He pressed down harder on your body. \"Typical, you humans are. Get into a sticky situation and the first thing you do is beg for mercy.\" The Charizard finally had come up with a good solution to punish you with and it was good timing too as you were just about to lose consciousness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large cheek once again grinds against you, expecting the end you braced yourself but relief soon came as your body felt the pressure lighten up. You breathed in heavily but almost immediately regreted it. Foul musky air entered you lungs as you felt the heat intense around you, you knew exactly where you were. You had become wedged in between the chars massive cheeks. It was still not a comfy position, but at least you could breath in and out. Above your head was what you could only guess was the charizards massive asshole, the only splotch of light making it noticable that it was just about the right size to fit your head in and maybe a little shoulder room. It was not as gross as you had thought it to be, suprisingly it was quite clean and it didn't smell too bad. The source of the heavy musk was just beneath you, as you tired to stretch out into position, you feet brushed up against something warm and squishy, no doubt the large males heavy scrotum. Your world shook as the Charizard purred with pleasure. You were beginning to whimper in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Human, i've some up with a proposition.\" He voice was deep and lust driven. \"In exchange for your puny miserable life, you will pleasure me any way i wish. In return, i might just extend your life a little longer than i had originally wanted too.\" You can feel a sudden shift and noticed the puckered ring tighten a bit, then a large gurgle and the anus opened to release a blast of hot air. It blew into your face and you coughed at the heat, not the smell. \"You should understand human, i pretty much own you know. You are at the bottom of the food chain, no where to run or hide, and if you don't do what i say, you'll be sleeping in my gut.\" The air began to clear a bit, only because the charizard lifted his rear a bit to let you gain some air. \"not like you weren't going to any way. Now get to rubbing.\" You stare blankly at the darkness before you and gently reach out a hand to begin this disgusting demand. Your hand comes into contact with the ring of flesh and it twitches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so wrong.\" You could only tell your self as you began to push harder on the sides, careful not to let your arms anywhere near the center of that rotound ring. You couldn't imagine what kind of feeling it would be being shoved in there, it would be a nightmare at the least, estimating that if it was to envelope you, it would be a very tight fit, only room to struggle. You rubbed a little more and large growls came from above. \"Human, don;t forget to use your feet too.\" You comply and gently begin to kneed the sac beneath your feet, which of course caused the Charizard to moan out more. If you ever got out of this situation, fresh air would be your only wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Charizard was loving the feeling of the tiny humans hands on his most intemate parts. His dick grew into it's very well endowed form: a good 12 inches, dribbling pre onto the ground. 'Mmmmm, i think i need more attention...</span></div></div>",

I want to try something.\"  Charizard demands with a sinister tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a moment to wonder which would be worse: spending your final moments in his gut or facing whatever horrible, disgusting task he had planned atop the head of his penis. After an 'encouraging' growl from the lizard, you begin to scale the shaft. It's a difficult task, as Charizard's pre has lubricated his  member, and for every inch you go up, you fall back down about half. You do, however, eventually make it to the head, and, with a little help from your impatient master, got on top of his cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that you're all good and ready, you get to lick my cock hole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitate. The smell here is incredibly musky, and you consider begging for mercy...but you already tried that, and this 'Zard is incredibly horny.  Trying to talk your way out of doing sexual favors for him would be like trying to get a telemarketer to hang up first.  So, you bite the bullet, lean down, and start licking that hole.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh...that's....ah\" is all Charizard manages to get out between moans of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find that the taste isn't particularly bad. It's not good (not that you expected so), but not spit-it-out-right-now disgusting. You shut your eyes so you don't have to watch yourself perform such a humiliating task, and you don't notice Charizard reach down toward his cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now...ooh...now I...ung...time for...mmn...some real fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could get your tongue back in your mouth to ask what he meant by that, Charizard gently put his claw behind your head and pushed, causing your entire head to immediately get engulfed by his cockslit.  He screamed from spontaneous urethral trauma, but soon found pleasure in the sudden insertion, moaning as you squirmed, tickling the slimy inside of his shaft.  You try to press your hands against the penis, but the gratuitous amount of precum had left it very slippery, and every attempt you made to do so simply leaves your hand more covered in the stuff than before. As Charizard's initial burst of pleasure subsided, he begins to suck you down his cock, a feat that you would have thought impossible had being shrunk not left you more open minded. He works his way around your shoulders, pinning your upper arms to your sides.  After your shoulders are through the opening, Charizard has a much easier time getting you down his shaft.  You're soon waist deep, legs flailing, doing everything in your power to try to squirm back out. Your wiggling, however, only pleasures the dragon more, causing his penis to throb faster, accelerating your descent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time passes. You can't tell exactly how long it was because you've been blindly struggling and squirming the whole time.  You're now in to your ankles.  It's a miracle Charizard's been able to hold back his orgasm this long. Through the fleshy walls you can hear him roaring in pleasure. You assume his reason for doing so is that if he cums, you'll shoot out and perhaps have a chance to escape.  A few throbs later, and your feet are slurped inside.  The cockhole closes behind you with an audible squelch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cock continues to suck you down.  Several minutes pass and the fleshy tunnel pushes you through a sphincter into one of Charizard's balls. At this point, you don't care that none of that made any anatomical sense. You'd given up on your sense of reality as soon as Charizard showed off his ability to swallow something with his penis.  The testicle is filled almost completely with cum, and it sloshes around as Charizard finally moves toward letting himself cum. He grabs his dick and starts to pump. It takes almost no time for him to blow his load and most of the cum squirts through the muscly ring and into the shaft, leaving you behind.  Charizard lets out a soul-ripping roar as he finally let's it all loose. Even through his ball, you can see light from the massive amount of fire that shot from his mouth.  At least you weren't out there for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing you'll probably be staying there for a while, you try your best to get comfortable in the confined space of Charizard's balls. Charizard's voice booms throughout his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"that...was...incredible...\" he pants, never having recovered from such a violent orgasm. \"I don't think I'll eat you.  I've never felt anything like that in my life. I think we can reach an agreement. You be my sex toy for life, I protect and feed you. If not I can always just digest you right there and cum you out tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you say?\"</span></div></div>",

He then opened his hand and held you in front of him as his forked tongue poked out of his maw. It wrapped around your form over and over again, quickly coating it in viscous saliva.  After he finished licking, your captor closed his hand again, pinning your arms to your sides as he laid face down on the ground and pressed his tail against his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now the real fun begins...\"  Charizard muttered as he brought you around to his exposed anus.  You could do nothing but stare in speechless horror as Charizard pressed your feet into his back door.  The sticky saliva coating your body allowed your legs to slide in easily as Charizard pushed you waist deep into his tail hole, keeping your arms pinned at your sides.  He then took his hand away from you.  You started to try to wiggle your way out, but the anus held you tight, stopping you from even pulling your hands free.  You heard Charizard moan in pleasure as he stood up.  His ass continued to hold you in place against gravity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon then began to clench and unclench his anus.  With each clench, you were sucked a little further in, and with each unclench, you slid back out.  The inward movement, however was slightly further than the outward, and you were slowly sucked in up to your torso.  You continued to wriggle, but this only served to pleasure the Charizard more.  The clenching soon brought you in to your shoulders, and as they were sucked in, the anus closed around your neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Charizard's anus then stopped clenching, the tight, fleshy walls of his rectum held your body in place, squeezing around you every now and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Its irises quickly flit back and forth scrutinizing your form. A billow of a wind brushes past as the Noibat skirts around you. But still, you cannot see anything but the bat\u2019s eyes: ghostly lanterns lit by a yellow flame, its slitted irises a black something rattling from within.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah,\u201d you admit nervously, \u201cI\u2019m not used to it either \u2014 being small and all.\u201d To your left, you hear the crisp click of the Noibat\u2019s claws as they rest themselves on the hard cave floor. The Noibat\u2019s fur rustles as the bat Pokemon adjusts its unseen position. You pray that it\u2019s not preemptively preparing to block your escape routes.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u201c<span class=\"cviolet\">You always been small, no?</span>\u201d Its eyes immediately come close, far too close for comfort. They squint, examining you \u2014 slightly snuffing out your only light in the process. You hear the Noibat grumble. At least you think it\u2019s the Noibat. It could its stomach. That\u2019d be bad. You stop thinking about that.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 a long story. To be honest, I don\u2019t really know either but \u2014 you seem nice! We\u2019ve already got a little camaraderie started, right? Your small, I\u2019m\u2026 smaller. We could probably help each other out!\u201d<br>\r\nWith a hot puff of air from its nostrils, the Noibat\u2019s head retreats. \u201c<span class=\"cviolet\">I help you, I get what?</span>\u201d Its tone implies curiosity rather than indignation. \u201c<span class=\"cviolet\">What do I get?</span>\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tYour head instantly houses a whirlwind of thoughts. What do Noibat like? What do Noibat like? To your frustration, you can\u2019t come up with any decent answer. Caves? Ear-scratches? How am I supposed to even reach its ears?? Your internal voice grows more desperate as your face goes bright red. You hope Noibat are colorblind.<br>\r\n\t \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Noibat clicks, clearly confused. \u201c<span class=\"cviolet\">Did you not think of that?</span>\u201d Its funky berry-breath washes over you again. You mind fumbles for a response.<br>\r\n\t \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI, uh \u2014 you like berries, right?\u201d You jabber out. It was something, at least.<br>\r\n\t \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Noibat\u2019s eyes shift into an expression of pure confusion. \u201c<span class=\"cviolet\">What? Yes \u2014 but\u2014</span>\u201d<br>\r\n\t \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYes! I knew it! I smelt it!\u201d you announce with pride. The Noibat slowly blinks. Never before have you regretted a sentence more.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u201c<span class=\"cviolet\">Little person, little...brain, maybe?</span>\u201d You hear a whistling whine of air traveling through Noibat\u2019s nose as it sighs, exasperated. \u201c<span class=\"cviolet\">You have no berries, anyhow. Why offer what you don\u2019t have?</span>\u201d<br>\r\n\t \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You didn\u2019t really have an answer. You guess you could find them, right? Maybe? Either way, you\u2019re gonna need confidence to sell this. You cross your arms and look up to the Noibat\u2019s eyes, which were slowly donning the look of growing impatience.<br>\r\n\t \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWell,\u201d you say in a slightly-deepened voice, \u201cdo you want those berries or not? You\u2019re not gonna get anything lazing around in this cave. Honestly, I think the stereotype is true. You are blind as a bat if you can\u2019t see I\u2019m telling the truth.\u201d The truth is, you weren\u2019t. You have no idea what kind of berries Noibat like or where they\u2019d be if you did know. You might\u2019ve saw a patch of Pecha berries somewhere earlier\u2026<br>\r\nThe Noibat let out an annoyed high-pitch huff. It certainly didn\u2019t like being insulted, but did it believe you?</span></div></div>",

You can\u2019t see two-feet in front of you.</span>\u201d You feel a sudden tug from behind you as you are lifted into the air, presumably by the Noibat\u2019s claws. You\u2019re dangling in front of the Pokemon, its glowing eyes envelop your field of view \u2014 like two super moons in a too-small night sky. \u201c<span class=\"cviolet\">You know what I see? Lies! Miltank-manure. All coming from you. You don\u2019t know anything!</span>\u201d As the bat Pokemon says this, your arms reach up behind your back and your hands wrap around Noibat\u2019s gripping claws. You try to support yourself and relieve the pressure between your shoulder blades as the Noibat speaks again. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cviolet\">You know how I know?</span>\u201d You see Noibat\u2019s face turn away from you. It looks up and toward the right. You can see its right wing, lit by the ambient light from its eyes, extend past your vision and towards an unseen object, swallowed in darkness. You hear the unmistakable scratching sound of the Noibat\u2019s claw shuffling through vegetation. Then, a faint snap as a thin branch is broken as the Noibat plucks something. Its wing retracts as it brings the unknown object closer, almost in view, as it momentarily admires it. From what you can see, it looks like a lumpy cluster of blackish-blue marbles. Suddenly, you\u2019re aware of a sweet fragrant smell.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u201c<span class=\"cviolet\">I spy with my little eye,</span>\u201d Noibat says with glee, \u201c<span class=\"cviolet\">something yummy!</span>\u201d The Pokemon moves its eyes, and the object, toward you. It\u2019s a clump of Bluk Berry. Several smooth black-blue orbs bunched together and topped with a green stem. You\u2019re familiar with its sweet, sometimes tart, flavor. You loved them as a child. Many times you\u2019d close one eye and carefully search for the blackest, bluest berry because you knew that they\u2019d be the sweetest. You\u2019d pluck them from the bushel and leave the redder ones hanging, left on the stem.<br>\r\n\t \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cviolet\">If you knew where berries where, you\u2019d know! Berries! Right here!</span>\u201d Noibat swings the fruit by its green stem. Was he taunting you? Or showing off?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You watch as the fruit is pulled away from you, closer toward the Noibat. Then, the Noibat\u2019s head tilts skyward as he lifts the berry up high. Briefly, the Bluk berry is held there \u2014 looking like a fruity hot air balloon illuminated by two grounded yellow spotlights. Then, it falls. The Noibat\u2019s pupils trace its downward path until it abruptly disappears. You\u2019re puzzled for a moment until you hear the unmistakable sound of chewing. The Noibat turns to you and comes in close.<br>\r\n\t \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou know, you\u2019re\u2026\u201d the Noibat abruptly pauses to chew its food. Although you couldn\u2019t see it, from the warm sickly sweet breath that washes over you, you gather that it is chewing with its mouth open. \u201c<span class=\"cviolet\">...a bold one, in general \u2014 you be! You\u2019re so small, so full of...spirit!</span>\u201d You hear the Noibat\u2019s claw rummaging through the Bluk berry plant for a second serving. \u201c<span class=\"cviolet\">But I wonder \u2014 are you sweet?</span>\u201d You\u2019re given a brief moment to express your horror as you look into the Noibat\u2019s eyes, a mischievous hunger clearly evident. Seeing your face, the Noibat stifles a giggle, which slowly builds into a full-on fit. Amidst this, gooey bits of berry are flung in your direction, sticking to your form like syrupy mud.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cviolet\">Your face! Ohhh, your face!</span>\u201d Noibat sputters out mid-laugh, eyes scrunched in jubilarity. \u201c<span class=\"cviolet\">I\u2019ve never seen anything like it! Priceless! Unbelievable!</span>\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Hope and anger begin to build within you. \u201cWas that a joke!?\u201d You indignantly say. \u201cDid you just threaten to eat me for a quick laugh!?\u201d<br>\r\n\t \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Noibat collects itself, lets out a singular composing cough (into its other berry-filled claw), and looks at you. \u201c<span class=\"cviolet\">Of course\u2026 I\u2019m still going to eat you! Your face was hilarious, though!</span>\u201d And with that, it brings you closer than you\u2019ve ever been...and throws the berry in his other hand in its mouth. You glower at the bat as he chews loudly in front of your face. He\u2019s clearly toying with you.<br>\r\n\t \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cviolet\">Oh fine!</span>\u201d Noibat says with a berry-filled mouth. \u201c<span class=\"cviolet\">If your gonna look that way, I\u2019ll eat you quick. No fun!</span>\u201d True to his word, he starts swinging you like a swing on a swing set before letting go.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You are airborne. The caves humid air rushes past you before quickly growing far more muggy as you land with an audible splat into a warm mess of part sticky, half-chewed Bluk berry and part viscous saliva.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Yuck, you think, absolutely disgusted. You\u2019re pretty sure you got some of it in your nose.<br>\r\n\t \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Underneath your hands and your fingertips you feel the bumps and hills of the Noibat\u2019s papillae. Lumpy remains of Bluk berry drift across you as the giant muscle beneath you stirs, slightly raising. Without Noibat\u2019s lantern-like eyes, you can\u2019t see anything within this cave-within-a-cave. You can smell though, but the result is quite obvious: The same revolting combo of smells from when you first met the Noibat \u2014 nauseatingly sugary scent of berries (clearly Bluk, this time) and insalubrious bad breath. You hear the watery sound of traveling spittle as it sloshes around you and past the tongue. All of a sudden you\u2019re lifted as its tongue raises you to the roof. You groan as you\u2019re squished between its palette, wallowing in the berry mixture surrounding you. The berry mixture makes strange squishy sounds and pops as it slides past your ears, looking for space in the cramped confines of the Noibat\u2019s maw. You hear the distinct sound of the Noibat swallowing as some of the mixture is swept away and sent tumbling down into its throat. The giant muscle beneath you eases off as the bat Pokemon contently sighs, then lets out a small giggle \u2014 jiggling and splashing the contents of the strange soup you reside in. Then, the world begins to tilt. The Noibat starts to tilt its big head upward, preparing to swallow. You try to frantically wave your arms about, looking for something to grasp, but the syrupy mix is like molasses and slows your movement and kills your hope of impeding your chance of halting your fate. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Now the Noibat\u2019s head is completely skyward and your environment is vertical. You begin to slide downward along with Noibat\u2019s berry meal. The mixture that was originally in front of you comes cascading down on top of you, expediting your progress and enveloping you completely in a abominable half-solid liquid. Soon, you\u2019re at the entrance of the Noibat\u2019s throat, still sliding downward with a gooey, sluckey sound. Then the walls of the throat suddenly converge together with you and Bluk berry inbetween. The Noibat had swallowed. You\u2019re almost entirely within its throat now, only a single arm and your head remain not wholly swallowed. This soon changes as the Noibat swallows again and you are washed down with the remnants of the berry in its maw and its saliva.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Now in its throat, you are crushed between the fleshed walls of its gullet. You are forced to hold your breath, for there is no room for air between the crushing walls and within the foul slurry. You are held in place for a moment before another swallow sends you deeper. Again, this process continues. You are stilled for a brief moment, suspended, before another crushing oscillation ferries you deeper. All the while, although you can\u2019t see it, the Noibat traces your journey with two of its pointed claws.<br>\r\n\t \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Finally, you are released from the esophagus crushing embrace and inelegantly dumped into the detestable contents of its stomach. To your relief, you found there to be no burning sensation \u2014 at least for the time being.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0However, the Noibat\u2019s stomach was far from a pleasant place. The grisly sweet smell of berry is still ever present, but the funk of the Noibat\u2019s breath is now replaced with the revolting stench of the Noibat\u2019s internals. It smells like someone vomited up a fruitcake.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The saccharine and repulsive m\u00e8lange you were in begins to shake stir as the Noibat had another giggle-fit.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cviolet\">Tee-huhuhu\u2026</span>\u201d the Noibat obnoxiously laughs. Its... unusual giggle is loud and surrounds you, but is slightly muffled, \u201c<span class=\"cviolet\">Now you know where the berries are! Too bad you can\u2019t have any though...</span>\u201d The Noibat chuckles a bit at its own joke. \u201c<span class=\"cviolet\">Oh, I\u2019m sorry! You can\u2019t see anything! No light! You\u2019re blind! Isn\u2019t that funny? Someone said that about me, once!</span>\u201d The Noibat erupts into full-blown laughter. The resulting waves and tides from within the Noibat\u2019s stomach momentarily dunk you underneath the surface of the bat\u2019s belly juices. Floating in the middle of the bat\u2019s revolting stew, you tumble about as you completely lose all sense of up, down, left, and right. Your heart beats wildly \u2014 like shoes in a tumble dryer. The last thing you\u2019d ever want is to drown in a manic bat\u2019s belly.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t Fortunately, the Noibat composes itself. Now that the world is calm, you try to find your footing. You swim in an unknown direction until you bump into a soft wrinkled wall: the stomach wall! You\u2019ve narrowed \u2018up\u2019 down to two directions. You take a guess on which leads up and begin to inelegantly paddle towards it. Question is, which direction did you really pick?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A few seconds later, your head surfaces, and you involuntarily gasp for air madly, filling your lungs with the acrid smell around you. It's unpleasant. It's breathable, but very unpleasant. It's better than not breathing and staying submerged in Noibat's gastric juices, though. \"Come on, give me a break! Is this really how you treat a defenseless person?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Defenseless? I dunno. Being small doesn't mean you're defenseless, you know\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you expect me to do at this size?

Maybe you wouldn't be in this situation if you had been more careful with your words. You swim to the wall, using a hand to stay there, to not drift back to the center of the stomach thanks to Noibat's movements. \"Look, I'm sorry. I was desperate, I didn't know what to do. You have to believe me, I didn't mean harm!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Then you tried to fool me. Okay, that I didn't mind as much, it was funny to see you fumble, but you tried. It almost makes me want to see you make a fool of yourself some more. Too bad you're food now\"</span> it sounded indifferent to your fate, you couldn't find a trace of compassion in its voice. You swatted away a glob of chewed berry, it would be a problem if those stuckon you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to die, please help me! I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou beg, gasping for air, talking until you have to breathe again. You plead like you have never pleaded before. If you can get it to listen, to give you one chance, maybe you won't die or be digested. At this point you have nothing to lose. You beg for several minutes until, with a huff of exasperation, Noibat interrupts you.<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Okay, fine, just shut up! You really are no fun, not even as food!\" </span>You hoped that mean you would get out soon. It didn't happen. Instead of pressing him on, you waited, hoping it had changed its mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed. The warm melange around you got warmer and higher, the contents of the stomach churned, trying to drag you with it. You held onto the wall with all your strength, barely managing to stay in one place. The juices around you had slowly started to make you feel strange, like ants were walking all over your skin. Thankfully, Noibat's acids seemed to be rather slow, but you didn't doubt they would be lethal if too much time passed.Your eyes adjusted to the darkness. You couldn't see well, but after spending some time inside Noibat's stomach, now you could see the wall right in front of you, the surface of the liquid surrounding you, the mushy islands of chewed berries littering the place. You didn't know how long it was before you heard from Noibat again.<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><br>\r\n\"You there? Did you die?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Still alive!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Fine. You know what? I'm curious. Survival of the strongest and all that, you know that? So I thought I should give you a chance to stay alive. What do you think?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it meant not dying, you were willing to do anything. You nodded, even if Noibat couldn't see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I agree! What do I have to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"Prove you deserve to survive a little longer...by escaping! It's that simple. You get out, you don't die. You fail, you die\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Escape?\" Did it mean from its stomach? From its body? From the cave outside? You really hoped it was just from its body, because in your current state, it would take a miracle to escape the entire cave. \"Fine, I will!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\"A fair warning, because I'm fair despite everything: even if you get out of me, that doesn't mean I'll leave you alone, okay? Just saying!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo even if you did get out of it alive, it held the right to keep playing with you to its heart's content. That wasn't a fun thought, but it wasn't like you had a choice. Deciding not to waste your breath replying, you start scheming how to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe least it depended on Noibat doing something, the better. You had to do this with your own hands.

Moments later, an abominable amalgamation of spit and berry nails you with a direct-splat.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You glower as Bluk berry leaks out of your ears. You are <i>not </i>spending another moment in this deranged purple rat! You don\u2019t care if you have to crawl all the way through his guts \u2014 as long as it's the way out!<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A wave of burning determination washes over you. That\u2019s exactly what you got to do\u2026 You begin to turn the insane machination over in your head. He\u2019s not going to let you up his throat or out his mouth. Not without a fight, anyway. And you don\u2019t think you can take him\u2026 You silence your thoughts as the gravity of the idea hits you. Words can\u2019t describe the inanity of your idea. However, the <i>glorps</i> and <i>glops</i> around you describe a more macabre fate. Your fate if you decide to remain idle.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You close your eyes (out of habit more than anything \u2014 you can\u2019t see anyway) and take a deep breath. Acrid air enters your nostrils and your mouth and your lungs. Unpleasant, but not dangerous. You hold it in, tight-chested. Then, you take the plunge. You dive beneath the stomach\u2019s surface, a farrago of berries and bile, and swim downward through the m\u00e9lange. Now that you are submerged, completely enveloped in an alien mixture, you are keenly aware of its strangeness. Too solid to be water, it reminded you of oatmeal \u2014 a lake\u2019s worth of oatmeal. An eternal moment passes before your fingers brush against the bottom. You bring yourself closer, feeling the wrinkled lakebed to find the exit. It didn\u2019t take you long.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your hands slide across a band of smooth muscle \u2014 in contrast to anything you\u2019ve found so far. You hurriedly inspect it and find it to be ring shaped...and closed tight.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A mounting pressure in your chest warns you that you\u2019re on borrowed time. Without hesitation, you try and force your hands through the circle.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0To your surprise, after only a breath\u2019s worth of work, the sphincter readily opens. Like air rushing out of a can of compressed air, the \u201cwater\u201d behind you surges through. You are carried with the jet. Tumbling and spinning, lost among a stream of bubbles and semi-solid mush. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eventually, you eventually find yourself...somewhere else. You\u2019re in a fleshed tube, cramped. Prone, your left arm in front of you. Your right arm presses to your side. Liquid (thinner than the stomach\u2019s) fills half of tunnel. Fortunately, your head is above the fluid and you can breathe.<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\u25d3 \u25d3 \u25d3</div><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Noibat feels...funny. The purple bat rests within a Bluk berry bush. The sprawling, tangling vegetation completely obscures the Pokemon. Even the golden glow of its eyes cannot penetrate the foliage.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cviolet\">Belly\u2026not good.</span>\u201d A two-pronged black claw reaches down to rub the lower part of the bat\u2019s belly. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cviolet\">Not bad, either.</span>\u201d Noibat says with a huff as its stomach rumbles strangely. \u201c<span class=\"cviolet\">But not good. Not bad, not good.</span>\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Noibat\u2019s right claw slips through the green of the foliage surrounding it, its other claw continues to cradle its belly. Two moments later, Noibat\u2019s claw bumps into a berry and fetches it for its master.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The black-blue berry rests in its right claw. A dark mirror. The Pokemon\u2019s image reflects from its smooth surface, slightly distorted, tinted yellow from its gazer\u2019s scrutiny. Noibat appreciates it for a moment. Then, it throws it into its mouth, chews messily, and swallows.<br>\r\nAt this moment, the Noibat feels a small push from within its tummy. A puckish grin slides up its cheeks like an unwoven thread. It thinks you\u2019re protesting its Bluk Berry snack. Little did it know, the truth is much stranger\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoibat puts a claw to its chin, thinking. Does it know?</span></span></div></div>",

They neglect to mention what happens when you\u2019re <b><i>not</i></b> having fun: Time realizes it should be flying, but decides to call in sick. Then goes to bed, refuses to budge, and oversleeps. That\u2019s how it feels, at least.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In other words, it\u2019s an awfully wordy way of saying that it feels like <i>nothing is happening</i>.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You are still in the claustrophobic caverns of the Noibat\u2019s digestive system. The fleshed tunnels are endless. The smell is horrendous. Time is meaningless. Everything feels identical. The intestines are ridged, tiny protuberances line the walls. The \u201cwater\u201d level of the intestines has lowered a bit, but is present. Unfortunately, you\u2019re forced to lay in the stomach-scented stuff, still.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Every so often, the passage undulates and carries you forward. When this happens, the intestines compress a bit, pressing the villi against you. It\u2019s an odd experience. Like being scrunched by spaghetti.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The best indication that time, in fact, is still moving is the soundscape. You could hear the stomach grumble above (below?) its contents sloppily sloshing around. The Noibat\u2019s organs babble in a tongue of groans and gurgles. Sometimes, you\u2019d hear the muffled voice of your devourer. It sounds strangely booming. All the high-tones are dulled by the flesh surrounding you. Other times, you\u2019d hear (and feel) it move. Organs would make a strange wet sound as they moved about the body cavity. You\u2019d feel yourself move, too. The fluid in the intestines shifts, coating a once-dry side of your body. Sometimes, the tunnel squishes in as the Noibat moves in some odd position. That is the worst one...<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\u25d3 \u25d3 \u25d3</div><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Time passes, despite your earlier fears. You felt right arm press against a strange, smooth\u2026 thing. A ring? Ah, you remember. It feels like the exit of the stomach. Another exit? Your blear mind snaps to attention and you immediately try to force your way through. You snake your arm through the orifice, up to the shoulder. To your dismay, you do not feel the cool air of the cave. Only the warm walls from within the bat\u2019s depths.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nevertheless, You push your body against the duodenum. Your shoulder goes through, your face begins to, before you begin to regret your decision. An abhorrent odor smites your nostrils with an unholy scent. You push on. Now, you\u2019re halfway through. You brace your right hand on the wet wall of the strange tunnel and push yourself through. You undoubtedly know you must be in the Noibat\u2019s large intestine.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Fortunately, you appear to be the only tenant in the bat\u2019s lower complex. Small victories, you suppose.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The tube you\u2019re in is larger. There is no liquid here, but walls are still wet and warm. You have enough space to crawl, no longer subjected to its internal\u2019s sluggish pace. A fact you are most thankful for, given that you want to get out before things get in.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As noted earlier, the smell is bad. Really bad. Horrid, repugnant \u2014 simply vile. It\u2019s enough to make your eyes water. Although, they may be tears of joy, knowing that your journey is nearly at its end.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You inch yourself through the Pokemon\u2019s deepest depths. Up, down, and all around \u2014 the tunnels twist and curve but you cannot be stopped. You will escape.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Noibat does not make it easy for you. You quickly learn to fear the sound of a specific, rumbling grumble. It always starts behind you. Sometimes it starts small, its intensity quickly grows. You feel the intestines compress. Then, you\u2019re in a wind tunnel. A noxious monsoon of heated air blasts past you in a nauseating storm. Even after it passes, it leaves behind a detestable scent, like irradiating fallout from a nuclear bomb.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This...is not an exaggeration. What you would give to never have experienced this\u2026<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\u25d3 \u25d3 \u25d3</div><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Noibat is enjoying a night\u2019s walk in the woods near the cave. The sky is clear. The moon is full. The leaves on the trees above filter the descending moonlight, fracturing the white light into a speckled mosaic of light and shadow.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It\u2019s been a day since it ate the strange, small critter and it assumes they likely perished. A shame, it is. They were funny! Not as funny as Noibat, of course. But that is a high bar to reach!<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There\u2019s a skip in its step: a half-walk, half-hop. The brief moment it leaves the ground, its wings do a quick flap before the bat lands gently on soft, cool grass. All the while, the Noibat makes a nearly-silent high-pitched whistle: echolocation. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Noibat\u2019s bouncing gait suddenly halts as the Pokemon stands stock-still, an unexpected pressure in its lower body. A familiar feeling, albeit oddly timed: nature\u2019s call. <br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\u25d3 \u25d3 \u25d3</div><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Inside, you are beat. Exhausted, smelly, and longing for freedom, you are unable to find the energy to continue on. Earlier, you arrived in a strange chamber, upside-down. Its exit is blocked off by a clenched ring. You know where you are.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The moment you entered, Noibat noticed too. You felt its bouncy, fluttery movements immediately halt as you felt your surroundings momentarily tighten in surprise. Now, things are still. Your devourer takes demure, stiff steps. Suddenly, the world tilts and you feel your entire prison move slightly downward. Unbeknownst to you, the Noibat crouches. Its body is inclined, its legs spread apart, and its claws touch the earthen forest floor.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then, the Noibat pushes. Its purple belly flattens. Its round eyes close as it makes a thin treble squeak. In its innards, you feel the slick heated walls of the bat\u2019s rectum squash inward \u2014 hard. You\u2019re pushed downward, your face pressing against the tight opening, but not out. The bat\u2019s belly relaxes. It takes a small breath. Then, does it again. The crushing walls return as you\u2019re mashed by uncaring flesh. Yet, you\u2019re still not free. Momentarily, the orifice in front of you opens and the intruding light blinds you. Freedom! <i>So close!</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Noibat momentarily relents. Its clarion-like voice mutters through beleaguered breaths. Through the groans of its labored digestive tract, you catch one of its words: <span class=\"cviolet\"><i>again</i></span>. Your hostile environment renews its efforts to expel you as it squeezed and pushed you against the bat\u2019s exit. The tightened walls of the rectum twitch as they are strained. Noibat\u2019s groans reverberate through your bones as you\u2019re squeezed like a tube of toothpaste. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0No luck. Again, it tries. No dice. Again \u2014 nada. Once more. Nothing! But then\u2026<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0...Your head squeezes through! You\u2019re met with the soft tufts of hair that encircle the Pokemon\u2019s legs. The night air is frigid, but a welcome relief from the boiling depths of your former entrapment. Oh! And the light! You could almost feel the kiss of the moon\u2019s soft glow. <br>\r\nThe rest of you quickly follows, expelled with squawk from the bat above. You land on your back, the fall cushioned by the wild grasses. Your view is...interesting. You see the fluffy behind of an exasperated Noibat and a luminous circle of ivory amongst the stars. A rare sight: a double moon.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But just as you gathered your bearings, you spot Noibat beginning to stand. Its wings spread, its claws dig into the earth beside you and\u2026</span></span></div></div>",

With your heart pounding, you stared, not even daring to breathe in case it'd attract your tormentor's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly when the Noibat collapses you move. Looks like getting you out of its body got it exhausted. You don't feel bad, after all, it ate you and would have let you to perish if you hadn't forced your way out, so instead you stand up and run away as fast as you can. You definitely don't want to stay around, especially because the Noibat wasn't trustworthy at all. It warned you, even if you escaped it still held the right to play with you. That was something you wanted to avoid at all costs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run through the forest as fast as you can, navigating with difficulty through the tall blades of grass, climbing tree roots and hoping you'd put some distance between you and the crazy bat. After a while, you're very tired. You hope you're far away from the cave you encountered the Noibat in, although realistically, given your size, you can't be that far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven this short distance is better than being with the bat, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGasping for breath, you look around. The night is clear, the moon is shining, the air is crisp and refreshing, but you don't feel safe being out in plain sight. Some Pokemon may see you. You didn't want to take any risks. Frantically, you examined your surroundings, stumbling upon something that could mean your salvation: a burrow. A cursory exploration proves it's abandoned. It's not a very good burrow for most Pokemon, it's narrow and goes deep into the earth before taking a 90\u00b0 degree curve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough almost no Pokemon would like it, to you in your current state that burrow is heaven. You dive in, anxious for some safety. Once you're deep beyond the curve, you sit down, thinking about the situation. You're tired, cold, you smell exactly like anything that passed through a Noibat's intestines would smell like, and it doesn't seem like you can solve any of that except the very first one. Hoping the next day would be kinder to you, you fall asleep in the depths of the burrow, without dreaming at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you wake up the next day it seems luck is on your side. The day starts much kinder to you. A voice you don't know echoes into the burrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? I know you're in there! You're a...a tiny critter or something\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't dare to look who it was. It wasn't Noibat, that much was clear. The voice didn't belong to the bat. Despite that, it could mean danger, the owner of that voice saw you get into the burrow. the last night, apparently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay? Last night you looked like you were afraid for your life. I was \u2014 it got me worried. It must be tough to be so small. That's why I brought you gifts\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGifts?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some food, and also some leaves if you want to be warm. Come on, it's rude not to say hello\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of food and warmth is rather enticing, you must admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can smell you from here. You smell pretty \u2014 pretty bad. Is that to deter predators? Because I'm sure that'll work\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCautious, you peek over the curve of your new home. The first thing you see is a few berries on the floor, as well as leaves. Looks like the Pokemon who is there wasn't lying. Having a friendlier Pokemon to rely on could be a good idea. That was why, after some thought, you decided to approach. You were pretty sure no matter what species it is, it'd be gigantic compared to you. By your current size you were sure you'd be easy prey even to a Joltik!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging by how you weren't immediately grabbed and eaten, it indeed was a Pokemon of a kinder nature than the Noibat. Once you exited the burrow, you finally saw the species. The species of the Pokemon that's trying to talk to you is...</span></div></div>",

With it, you can eat like your larger brethren!</span>\u201d Honchkrow is currently bespeckled with little green pins as it meanders dizzily about, wings shuffling across the ground \u2014 looking for its missing hat. Looking up, the bird momentarily locks eyes with you, then breaks away.

You approach the titanic beast. Your hand brushes the bottom, outside part of his beak \u2014 reassuring the Pokemon. He closes his eyes and breathes out. A warm wind, saturated and oddly-odored, whisks past you. It mixes with the cool night air before dispersing into the wood.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You hear a ferocious sound: a strange rumbling growl.

You don\u2019t resist as he slowly bends down, as your world grows warmer, and warmer, and warmer before it is dark \u2014 Honchkrow\u2019s beak all around you. It begins close. You step off the cushy grass and onto the hard lip of his jaws. He tilts his head, no longer vertical. You fall onto the fleshed mat of muscle the lines the bottom of his maw. Sticky saliva coats you, getting in your hair and smearing itself on your face. A wet, fleshy strange thing lands on top of you. You deduce it to be Honchkrow\u2019s tongue.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cred\">If it makes you feel any better,</span>\u201d Honchkrow mumbles, trying to move the least possible, but still manages to give you a good jostling, \u201c<span class=\"cred\">you taste pretty bad.</span>\u201d With that, Honchkrow tilts his head up.

Fortunately, he\u2019s a fairly steady flyer and can manage to stay aloft mostly on the updraft alone.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It\u2019s now when you recognize a curious thing. The belly juices don\u2019t burn \u2014 strange. They don\u2019t even tingle.

This isn't how it's supposed to go!</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plan was that he'd carry that small human somewhere safer, a helpful gesture that'd cement them as friends and also would make the human not be easy prey for any random Pokemon. Easy and nice, that was how the plan was. The jet of fire that crossed the sky, trying to blast him, didn't fit at all in that plan! It was very inconvenient, to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonchkrow isn't a capable fighter, so his only choice is to make evasive maneuvers. In what may not have been an intentional move, Honchkrow dives down, loses control of his speed and flaps his wings to try to stabilize himself before he crashes once again into the pines and their needles. Honchkrow tries not to think of the possibility he's going to get covered in them again and manages to fly up in the brink of time. <span class=\"crose\">\"I'm sorry, there's something going on!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it now?!\" you ask from inside, slamming against the ceiling of Honchkrow's belly for the seventh time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"crose\">\"It's one of your brethren, just that normal size and with a fire-type!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA trainer, you deduce. You try to hold onto a wall to avoid being jostled around. With some luck this trainer is only aiming to knock out Honchkrow in a fight instead of capturing him, Honchkrow would be knocked out and all you'd have to do is wait until he recovered from fainting. Luckily for you, it seems his acids won't be dissolving you no matter how long you stay, so theoretically you could wait around for a very long while, the only problem being the boredom that'd befall you from sitting around with nothing to do other than wonder what Honchkrow ate hours ago other than the meal you shared with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could easily endure that. The problem was the other possibility: the trainer capturing Honchkrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't a Pokemon but you were currently inside of one. If the trainer captured Honchkrow, would you be sucked into the Pokeball too? You didn't want to find out! It was impossible it'd trap you to be associated with the trainer in any way, given how Pokeball technology didn't work that way, but Honchkrow was a different problem. If he was sucked into a Pokeball ad you were left behind you could be in trouble. To avoid that worst-case scenario, you hoped you'd be forced to come along, despite how much you disliked that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd if only Honchkrow was captured, then you'd follow the trainer and try to reach Honchkrow, you decided. He was the only friend you had in your current state. You'd feel bad abandoning him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try to flee!\" you advised, getting showered with the mixture in the belly once again. Honchkrow flew in a circle, trying to reverse course and get away from the trainer on the ground. Desperately, he sped up, reaching a velocity he hadn't reached ever since a long time ago. It was liberating, he felt so fast and nimble, why didn't he fly like this before?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hat falling off his head once again reminded him that was why. He couldn't hold onto his hat at those speeds. <span class=\"crose\">\"Not again!\"</span> he squaked, trying to reach it, unable to do it before the hat fell between the trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did something happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"crose\">\"My hat is gone!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain with the hat. \"Can't you leave it there and just go away?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"crose\">\"Never! My hat is my pride!\" </span>Leaving it behind was unthinkable! Without hesitation, Honchkrow landed on the ground, easily looking through the darkness to try to find the hat. It took him a moment to find it between the trees. Running and gripping it with his beak, Honchkrow flipped it into the air, miraculously catching it with his head with ease. He didn't have time to enjoy that lucky moment because that was all the trainer needed to find Honchkrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey approached slowly, a hand already holding a Pokeball. Honchkrow stepped back, fearing what could happen, until his back hit a tree. All around him there were a lot of trees, and although above the canopy was open, it was unlikely he'd be able to fly without being caught.<span class=\"crose\"> \"Go away!\" </span>Honchkrow shouted, opening his wings in what he hoped was an intimidating stance. To you inside his stomach that didn't sound too intimidating, you're already bracing yourself for what may happen now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seems to be an eternity, the trainer makes their move.</span></div></div>",

Then, he continues in a more confident voice, \u201c<span class=\"cred\">you\u2019re certain about this?</span>\u201d Honchkrow looks to you with eyes awash with anxiety. Truth be told, you\u2019re not. But <i>not-dying </i>is pretty high on your priority list. <i>Not-dying to painful acids</i> even moreso.

A claw, dark as black oak, digs into the earth beside you \u2014 leveling the green grass with a soft crunch. Another step back. This time, his right claw. You hear the ruffle and shuffle of moving feathers as he adjusts his posture. His tail feathers loom over you. A cone of snow-white, tipped with blood-red down. You see him looking back, the brim of his hat half-obscuring his half-moon eye. Suddenly, you see him slip an ebon wing between his legs, down to the ground and face-up. His wingtips brush the top of the grass. They\u2019re a gorgeous pattern of black and red. You never saw a bird\u2019s feather this close before. You see each individual barb on every feather. It\u2019s almost like his feathers have feathers\u2026<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cred\">Hop on my wingfeathers,</span>\u201d he says moving his prone wing slightly, \u201c<span class=\"cred\">I\u2019ll give you a lift.</span>\u201d <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For a moment, you falter. You see Honchkrow fluster. He begins to slump, his confidence draining. He made a new friend \u2014 and now he fears he lost them. He fears that they think he\u2019s playing some sick game. That he wants this. The worst of it all: a small part of him, deep within \u2014 does. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You\u2019re on his wingtip, second from end and soft as cotton. Your avian escalator is lifting you to your destination slightly below his tail feathers.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i><span class=\"cred\">It won\u2019t be too bad.</span></i> Honchkrow thinks to himself. <i><span class=\"cred\">They\u2019ll be okay; they\u2019ll be fine. </span></i>He reassures himself. <i><span class=\"cred\">Remember that time \u2014 long ago?

It was a horrible thing... </span></i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You hover inches away from the rear end of the bird. His shadow envelops you completely. Somehow, his feathers now seem to be darker than black. You wonder why you\u2019re not moving. Is Honchkrow having second thoughts?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You then notice a vile thing, enough to blanche your face and chill your bones. Emerging like an airplane from behind a dark storm cloud, something cylindrical, pink. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i><span class=\"cred\">...But it felt...good. </span></i>Honchkrow reminisces the feeling.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Honchkrow is turned on!? The thought is sickening to you. You\u2019re part of some sick fantasy. Nothing more than toy! Feeling angry and betrayed, you shout to him. \u201cHonchkrow!\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The bird snaps back to reality.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat is wrong with you!?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He begins to silently panic, feeling the blood drain from one head to another.

A nerve has been hit.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cLiar! Freak! I never should\u2019ve trusted you\u2014\u201c<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Suddenly, the wing beneath you rockets upward, slamming you into the bird\u2019s bottom. Your body lays flat across his rear, nearly lost amid a forest of black-blue feathers. You\u2019re dazed, but unharmed. The impact was cushioned by his soft feathers.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cred\">My type<i> does not</i> mean I\u2019m evil!</span>\u201d he cries, his acrimony granting him newfound confidence, evaporating his stutter. \u201c<span class=\"cred\">And. I. Will. <i>Help you!</i></span>\u201d You\u2019re rubbed against his tail feathers as he clumsily tries to find his backport. His movements lack the dexterity or care he had shown earlier.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You shout as you\u2019re run across his black plumule. Fear overcomes all other emotions as you become keenly aware of how much larger the bird is to you. You\u2019re helpless as you slip beneath the feathery surface. Your head comes across a strange, fleshed ring. It isn\u2019t hard to guess what it is.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then, he begins to push you in.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<i><span class=\"cred\">I\u2019m-sorry-that-I-ever-said-I'm-sorry-to-you-about -pushing-you-up-my-butt!</span></i>\u201d Honchkrow shouts, his words electric-fast due to a mix of adrenaline and pleasure.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The slimy donut-shaped hole slips around your head. Its taut as a drum and does not give easily. But Honchkrow is determined and you no longer have a choice in the matter.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You see nothing; you hear much; you feel more. His heartbeat sounds like a pair of shoes in a tumbler. You can hear it all around you. A primal sound, rich in bass. His organs groan as does he. Sounding from far away, you hear his beak chatter in orgasmic bliss. Constricting, mashing, tightening, the Pokemon\u2019s rectum bears down on you as you\u2019re forced ever deeper. The (thankfully clean) walls are slick, warm, slimy. They oscillate, growing tighter in bone-crushing pulses. Every time you believe they cannot be anymore binding, you\u2019re proven wrong.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Honchkrow feels the last of you slip inside him. There he stands, wing covering his bottom, his arousal fully arisen and in display. His beak is skyward and agape. A heart-melting full-body pulse of pleasure runs through him, starting from his rear and ending at the tip of his beak. He tenses and doesn't let up. It is enough to make his organs melt.<br>\r\nThe, it happens again. And again. Honchkrow begins to rock back-and-forth, so lost in his fantasy that he forgets all about you. His body grows tighter, tighter, and tighter still\u2026<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0From within, you beat the revolting, ribbed walls that crush and squeeze with each of Honchkrow\u2019s pleasure pulses. Soon, you can no longer move. You are completely binded as you hear the bird gasp and moan. Then, things grow tighter than they\u2019ve ever been as Honchkrow stands, his feet apart, talons inward, wing over his privates \u2014 humping into his wing.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then, relief. Everything relaxes. Honchkrow clicks dreamily.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A troubling storm cloud rolls over Honchkrow\u2019s euphoric moment. His friend! Did he really\u2014<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Back inside, you gasp for air but find only foul fumes. You cough, not even bothering to move or protest. Your entire body aches with a dull pain. No energy remains for you to lift yourself off the wretched floor. You hear Honchkrow\u2019s voice reverberating through his bowels\u2026<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cred\">I-I-I\u2026 can\u2019t believe.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Honchkrow is full of regret. With a heavy heart, he paces around, unaware of how much that's jostling you around in the deepest confines of his body. Luckily for everyone, he's too busy panicking to notice any sensations that may bring, and he has good reasons to be panicking! He just offended his friend very badly. The course of action now was clear: he had to apologize, maybe that way this budding friendship wouldn't be ruined forever. With that in mind, Honchkrow positioned his rear near the ground, intending to push out the tiny human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr should he really do that now? He promised he'd take the human away to a safer place. Wouldn't taking him out of his body now make him a liar? That would be worse than what he was now. At least if he fulfilled this promise, he could have something good to offer the human. That would help!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"crose\">\"We're leaving!\"</span> Honchkrow shouted at his rear. Inside him, you didn't hear him very well, but the feeling of weightlessness that covered you afterwards delivered the message clearly. So Honchkrow was already flying...you hoped it was to take you to a safer place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no idea about how much time was passing, and that was because you were completely focused on staying completely still. Your muscles were cramped, and your entire body ached, but in your opinion it was a worthwhile sacrifice. The least pleasure you gave to Honchkrow the better, you thought. Knowing where you were, you knew moving could rub the sensitive walls around you, and after having witnessed by yourself just how easily Honchkrow was taken by the sensations he experienced, you didn't want to give him any reasons to keep you inside of him or do this to you ever again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that you'd give him the chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least you had a lot of time to think. Now that the horror of the situation was starting to pass, you could think in a more objective, calm manner, as hard as that was to believe. You evaluated your situation. You were still minuscule, far far away from the life you had before this entire nightmare started. The chances of you returning to normalcy were pretty much nonexistent. As proven by Noibat and Honchkrow, you were easy prey for pretty much every Pokemon in the world. The only things that could help you survive were your wits and your ability to get through disheartening situations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are pretty much doomed, weren't you? That can help you survive only for a while, you figure. You needed friendly Pokemon to be on your side. With an ally, your chances of survival would increase dramatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you had thought Honchkrow would be the friend you needed. He had taken the time to give you food, and also a fork. He gave you a fork! That was a nice detail, you had to admit. It was completely useless, but the thought is what counts. You were starting to like him, and then this entire problem with him happened. Although...he had suggested it as a way to help you. He had the best intentions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, he didn't!\" you shout, your voice echoing through the bowels. It didn't seem Honchkrow heard you. If he had the best intentions, he wouldn't have shoved you inside like this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose conflicting thoughts struggled inside your mind for a moment longer before you settled on a side once and for all.</span></div></div>",

Your hands sink into the floor, you grimace at the sensations in your hands. \"Ew\" you mutter. Can Honchkrow feel this? Is he getting excited? You bet he is. He was treating you like a toy. So what if he said he wanted to help you? You don't even know if he was telling the truth! For all you know he's actually taking you to own you as his personal toy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoibat was awful, but at least the Noibat was honest about its intentions right away, and it was all because you made a mistake when talking to it. That had been your fault, you can admit that much. Honchkrow didn't have any excuse, you weren't going to overlook that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising your head, you peer towards the direction the ring sealing you from the outside is supposed to be. Could you force your way through? Most likely not, and even if you could, you're in the air right now. You shouldn't even try. All you can do is wait until Honchkrow lands and lets you free, and once he does, you'll be running away as far as possible. With some luck you'll be okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"crose\">\"Uh, hello? You have been very quiet in there...you're still angry about what happened?\"</span> you can hear Honchkrow ask. You don't even bother answering. <span class=\"crose\">\"You're still angry. I get it...look, I'm sorry. I dunno how to describe what I was thinking, I just...it wasn't that I wanted to use you or anything! You have to believe me\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't believe him at all. You gave him a chance, you had accepted to partake in the lunacy he had proposed, and he had betrayed your trust. For a moment you think of how it would have gone if it hadn't been for his unfortunate reaction. You'd have crawled into his rectum by yourself. Disgusted, you grimace. There was no reason at all you thought you'd ever do something like crawl into another Pokemon's ass ever again, but if by some unexpected reason you absolutely had to, it was going to be on your own terms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"crose\">\"I'm sorry. I promise I'll apologize more when you're out. It's not too far, we'll get there in no time\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wanted to apologize more...a small part of you wanted to believe him, but the rest of you stomped on it. You had made your decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed, and your mood soured more and more. You keep thinking back about how badly you're likely to do by yourself, and the constant smell around you doesn't lift your spirits at all. You feel like the stench's going to stick on you forever. Realistically you know it's something a few nice, long baths can get rid of, but right now you feel like you'll forever smell like you passed through two Pokemon's waste systems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich you did. You very much did. At least things can't get much worse than that, you decide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we there yet?!\" you yell, your voice echoing into the bowels once again. This time it seems Honchkrow heard you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"crose\">\"Yes, we're close!\"</span> outside, Honchkrow is flying as stable as possible, making sure not to lose his hat once again <span class=\"crose\">\"You'll like the place, it's safe, there's plenty of friendly-\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just tell me when we're there!\" you interrupt. Something about the way you said that tells Honchkrow you didn't want to talk at all, he whimpers pitifully and shuts up. Inside, you're glad. It's matter of time before you're out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything around you feel different, though. It all feels slimier, somehow. It's nothing too bad, thankfully, but it does feel like everything's getting coated in preparation for...something. You can only guess what it is. You haven't forgotten where you are, after all. You hope Honchkrow arrives to the destination before anything gets anywhere near the space you're occupying right now. If any unwanted visitor from the rest of Honchkrow's digestive system creeps on you, you're definitely blaming Honchkrow for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no other option than wait, you slide down the rectum towards the ring you came from, hoping it's not going to be long before you can get out.</span></div></div>",

In response, the steady wingbeat outside goes a little offbeat. Honchkrow\u2019s innards tighten slightly. You\u2019re unsure whether it's in discomfort or\u2026<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There is a gradual slowing, a feeling of weightlessness.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A snap \u2014 like that of a whipped bedsheet, fluttering feathers, a sudden halt.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Thump.</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A percussive whomp shakes your prison and sends shockwaves through your bones. Has Honchkrow landed?<br>\r\nHonchkrow sighs. You hear the great rush of air bellow above you, rushing from his breast and out his beak. Then, your surroundings jump as Honchkrow straightens and clears his throat with a glottal cough.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWell, I suppose that \u2014 um, we\u2019re here.\u201d Honchkrow blathers while looking down, under and past his wings: your general location. He waits for an answer. No response. He restlessly preens a feather. \u201c<span class=\"crose\">Are you\u2026 still mad?</span>\u201d He says. He adjusts his footing and turns a bit, his eyes still locked on his behind. \u201c<span class=\"crose\">I\u2014 uh, did a bad thing, yes. <sup><font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">A very, very-no-good-bad-thing...</font></sup> <b>But!</b> I want to make sure you\u2019re...okay. Y\u2019know...alive. Not dead. So, yeah, that\u2019s\u2026 um\u2026say something, please!</span>\u201d He seems genuinely repentant. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For a second, you feel a small twang of sympathy. Then a repugnant fluid oozes onto you from the ceiling. Whatever was tugging at your heartstring is yanked away.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"crose\">I can\u2019t hear you! You\u2019re o-okay in there, right? Two taps for yes, one tap for no!</span>\u201d You hear the Pokemon\u2019s heartbeat drum faster. \u201c<span class=\"crose\">Wait, shouldn\u2019t it be no taps for no? You can\u2019t do much of anything if you\u2019re out cold...</span>\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You fervently wipe off the ooze, and in the process, inadvertently tap the fleshy walls three times.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"crose\">Three!?</span>\u201d the crow crows. \u201c<span class=\"crose\">What does three mean!?</span>\u201d Honchkrow is panicking at this point. The birdbrain is no longer thinking. His thoughts are cloudier than the skies during an Alolan typhoon. Everything whirls and twirls as Honchkrow spirals chasing his own tail in hopes of \u2014 somehow \u2014 seeing what is wrong with you.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0...But given that there is no light where the sun doesn\u2019t shine, even you can\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with you. That doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t experience it. You are pinned to the side of the Pokemon\u2019s rectum by centrifugal force. It\u2019s like those spinning top rides with the wheel in the center: the ones where you spin the wheel and the tops spin faster and faster until you\u2019re sick and you regret everything. Except in this ride you\u2019re fastened on the wall and it\u2019s gross and squishy. And you can\u2019t stop the spinning. And it smells like bird butt.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0All the while, Honchkrow is squawking incoherently.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You\u2019re granted the power to speak with Pokemon and the two clowns you\u2019ve talked to were a sadistic vexatious Noibat and\u2026 Honchkrow. Truly, you\u2019re blessed.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<b>Stop spinning!</b>\u201d You shout as loud as you can, your vocal cords vibrating like a violently strummed guitar.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0By a miracle, Honchkrow hears you! He struggles to halt his momentum, tangling his feet and ends up hitting the ground with a solid clunk! Judging from sound of the floor\u2019s timbre, you can guess it\u2019s made of\u2026 timber: wood.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You\u2019re also thrown to the floor but yours is a bit more padded. You lay there, dazed, trying to think up a scornful name to call Honchkrow, but it seems you\u2019ve lost your wit. Thank goodness you had a better handle on your lunch.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"crose\">Oww\u2026</span>\u201d Honchkrow groans, \u201c<span class=\"crose\">hold on friend. Give me a moment to stand,</span>\u201d Honchkrow sucks in air in pain, \u201c<span class=\"crose\">and I\u2019ll get you out.</span>\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You feel Honchkrow slowly, clumsily rise to his feet. Everything swings from right to left as he tries to find his footing in off balanced steps. <i>Clack, clack!</i> His talons click on the wood floor. Through the ambient noise of the crow\u2019s bodily gurgles and groans, you hear him take a great breath. His lungs, great industrial bellows, inhale. Hold. Then, exhale. Everything tilts, 45\u00b0: down. You slide slightly but are stopped by the grip of muscle. A push, an oscillation, drives you further. You are held tightly, a bit too much so. You find yourself roughly driven face-first into a tight orifice. Your right cheek is smeared against the tight ring of flesh but you are not pushed through. Honchkrow relaxes. The rectum\u2019s grip relaxes. You are released. The big bird takes another big breath and strains once more. You\u2019re seized for a second time, mashed against the bird\u2019s tailhole. This time, you breach through. You\u2019re blinded by the early morning\u2019s light. Its color so vibrant: orange and yellow, you could almost taste it. It\u2019s citrus-y.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Honchkrow\u2019s rear end\u2019s tight embrace hugs your head as it slowly passes over. A few starts and stops and pushes later, you\u2019re free. You plop to the ground, soaked in abominable, stinking anal fluid \u2014 but alive!<br>\r\nWhen your eyes adjust, you see Honchkrow\u2019s beaked face above you and looking down. His black form a silhouette backed by brilliant sunlight.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You can only muster a few words, \u201cwhere am I?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Honchkrow replies, \u201c<span class=\"crose\">you\u2019re\u2026</span>\u201d<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When you heard 'PokeCenter' you thought maybe you'd be able to get help from someone!  If you had to be honest, you really preferred the help of humans instead of Pokemon. The two Pokemon that had \"helped\" you so far had caused you more trouble than it was worth. What was the point of being able to communicate with Pokemon when it led to you being inserted into the ir bodies?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came the rest of that sentence. One step forward, two steps back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Can you leave me alone now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Th-That's what I was going to do! I brought you here because  you'll be safe here!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said there are Pokemon here! How would that make me be safe--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't finish the question. Your very ereasonable concern was interrupted when, with a noise that almost made you jump out of your skin, something hit Honchkrow's hat, pulling it right onto one of the walls of the room you were in. The hat stayed stuck there, you were able to see what exactly was holding it against the wall: an arrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis had to be a joke! When you paid more attention to the arrow, you noticed it was a feather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonchkrow squaked, terrified, and clung onto the arrow, trying to get it off his hat. While he was pulling, you heard another voice, male, from behind you. The scraping of...claws? On the floor freaked you out, you couldn't turn around to check who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"I told you to never come back here\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"I know, I know! I'm just passing by!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"You're not staying not even one minute longer. Get out!\"</span> The last two words startled you, here was so much vitriol you felt yours was dwarfed by his!  Apparently Honchkrow was getting on more Pokemon's bad sides too. Honchkrow, having finally unpinned the hat, put it on and fluffing up. Whether it wasn an attempt to look larger than he was or harmless you didn't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"I was bringing a friend!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"I'll deal with whatever you're scheming.  Now scram\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonchkrow turned around and ran, extending his wings and flying through a window, disappearing into the sky outside. A tense silence followed, filling the place,. You felt someone's intense stare right on your neck, making your skin crawl. It was such an intense stare  you imagined all sorts of Pokemon looking at you. What would happen? Had Honchkrow thrown you into the fire, instead of saving you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"You have stared into space enough. Turn around.\"</span> After a small pause: <span class=\"cgreen\">\"Please\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease? Alright, that was a bit encouraging.  You did so, finally seeing who had shooed Honchkrow away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was another bird, much taller than Honchkrow. White, brown and green was all you could see, held tall by a pair of formidable talons and long legs. That was certainly an owl -- a Decidueye, if your memory was accurate. This was a one-in-a-million find! Wild Decidueye were unheard of where you lived! The owl aimed at you with one of his arrows for just a moment, before sighing and drawing it away. He probably judged you weren't dangerous at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wasted no time in explaining your situation, although you omitted how exactly Honchkrow brought you there. The more you talked, the more something started shining in Decidueye's eyes. Sympathy? Once you were done, Decidueye crouched, looking at you with far more kindness than he showed Honchkrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"That pest took you here because he believed you'd be safe. I say that because I cannot help you return to normal\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" The bad news were nothing surprising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"There has been no human in this area in a long time. If your intention was to get in contact with them, you're not finding them anywhere here\" </span>Where had Honchkrow taken you to?! You had to sit down, the weight of Decidueye's statement almost crushing you. <span class=\"cgreen\">\"I can promise you safety, but I cannot help you\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what am I supposed to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"I don't know. I apologize, but I don't have the answers you seek\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't sound like he held you any malice, but you didn't like that at all. \"I don't know what to do anymore! I'm small and now I'm far from all of humanity. Why is this happening to me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDecidueye tilted his head. <span class=\"cgreen\">\"Again, I don't know. But as I said, if you don't mind sharing your space with a few Pokemon, you will be safe here. I can guarantee it\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetter than staying out there. You nodded, although not very happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"I thought you'd be happy. Hop on\"</span> Decidueye extended his wing, the tips lying right in front of you. Nothing to do but hop on. The feathers, so fine and with gaps it felt like they were made specifically for you to climb and hold onto. You held onto the feathers, entangling your fingers amidst the tiny strands that formed them, feeling your stomach fall down to your feet when Decidueye lifted you up to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed that, although he was willing to tolerate your presence, he had no idea how to be careful with someone as small as you. You hoped that wouldn't bring you trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe definitely had no idea how to take care of someone as small as you. You were starting to have doubts he had even seen a human before. That was the only conclusion you could arrive to when you saw the berry right in front of you. The berry was of an intense purple, several times larger than you, and enveloped with a thick, dry crust you had absolutely no hope getting through of. Decidueye, standing right beside the counter you were on right now, stared at you expectantly. <span class=\"cgreen\">\"So?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...big\" you tried to think of the right wording to use. You feared you'd be too much of a bother for Decidueye to deal with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"It'll last you for a while. These are my favorite, so I thought you'd like them\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to dig your nails into the shell, unable to do a thing. \"I think I'm not hungry right now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"It's going to be interesting to take care of a human. I'd leave this to my assistant, but I have judged it'd be better for me to watch over you personally\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this place?\" you asked, looking around. The PokeCenter had been abandoned for a while, you could see a thick layer of dust all over everything. The machines, having stayed unused for ages, seemed like it wouldn't work anymore. Abandoned Pokeballs ere strewn all over the floor, a layer of grime in the corners of the lobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDecidueye spread a wing, showing everything in the room. <span class=\"cgreen\">\"This is a place for travelers to rest at in their journeys. We have food, places to rest at, and guidance for any nearby place. I'm the one keeping it working\"</span> Was he...good at his job, then? His heart probably was in the right place, but maybe he was a little over his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you said you have an assistant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"I sure do. My assistant does all the errands and handles everything I don't have much time for. They also deals with the cleaning, but as you can see, they're not very good at that\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n...well that explained that, at least. You hoped the asssitant would be able to handle you a bit better, Decidueye was starting to seem a little too unreliable to be a good caretaker. Having decided it was time to continue, the owl raised his voice. <span class=\"cgreen\">\"Rattata!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"I'm on my way!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard skittering coming closer and closer! The sound of tiny claws grabbing onto acrylic surfaces got louder, until from a side of the counter you saw a purple, furry form arrive. Those large ears and whiskers definitely indicated that was a Rattata! The assistant sat on the counter, looking up at Decidueye with mirth. For a moment the grim, completely unwelcome thought that Rattata usually were prey for larger birds like the owl invaded your mind. Thank goodness they got along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDecidueye gestured at you with a wing. <span class=\"cgreen\">\"This human is going to live with us for an undetermined amount of time. You should introduce yourself while I go upstairs for a moment\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Of course! I'll introduce myself and--\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith what you pretty sure was a smile -- hard to tell when the Pokemon has a beak! -- Decidueye pet Rattata's head, the little rat chuckling and stretching up to make it easier for their boss to pet them. \"Good! Get along, will you? I'll return in a moment\" with a flourish of his wing, Decidueye hopped on the counter, gliding across the lobby and towards the staircase, leaving you alone with Rattata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou faced the rat, smiling timidly. \"...well...I hope we get along!\" you said. Handshakes were a thing for Pokemon? You tried, just in case, extending a hand. The rat stepped towards you, sniffing your hand, and stood on their hind legs, staring at you with attention, until their expression changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew right away how things would be like.</span></div></div>",

Their left paw awkwardly tries to clasp against your outstretched hand\u2014but just as you\u2019re distracted trying to maneuver your hand for a better grip\u2014Rattata\u2019s right paw swoops in for a boop on the nose. The surprise attack is gentle, but the sudden pressure causes you to fall back on your bum!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cKeheheh!\u201d</span> Rattata merrily laughs. Laughter sounding like a chittering chipmunk, their paws reel back to his chest, resting against their chortling belly. <span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cYou\u2019re the third in a row that\u2019s fallen for that!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You dust yourself off as the Rattata regains their composure. <span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cSorry, sorry!

You slap your hand on and with a grunt and pull, you\u2019re standing tall. <span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cBesides, introductions are for chumps! Laughter\u2019s the window to the soul. You learn a lot about someone by the way they laugh! ...What does your laughter sound like?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You turn a little red. Not only from your ungraceful flop. But your vantage point got you an awkward eyeful of the particularities of Rattata genitalia. Good news: you can say with confidence that this particular prankster is female. And though it looks like the rat\u2019s train of thought is a little squirrely, you don\u2019t see any true malice. Only a veritable whirlwind of hasty, impulsive, impish energy. So, you do your best belly laugh! It comes out a little forced. But Rattata seems pleased!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cNice! Sounds a little hollow, though. Been through a lot, lately?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You nod. \u201cThe past days have been\u2026 something.\u201d You don\u2019t feel like getting in the details.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cOh! I think I get it. Mm-hm. Yes. You just need something to keep your mind busy!\u201d</span> Rattata falls back onto all fours, a small cloud of dust puffs from the dingy floor. It floats down, settling around you both as the dust particulates glimmer in the lights shining from the PokeCenter machines. With the dust swimming all over, you can\u2019t help but ask, \u201cif your job is to keep the place clean, why is it all\u2026 grimy and stuff?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rattata hardly seems fazed. <span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cI like it this way! I\u2019m a rat, y\u2019know? Kinda homey. Also, cleaning is boring. I don\u2019t like boring. Can\u2019t you tell? Am I giving off that kinda\u2026 aura?

Rattata hops from one subject to the next, practically dragging you from room to room as she gushes about just about everything his little mind can conjure about the topic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cThis is the rest area! We got a couple guests in there now, but they\u2019re probably resting. We shouldn\u2019t bother them\u2026 yet. Keheha!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cOoo! Isn\u2019t the courtyard great? No, no, no! Don\u2019t step out into it you dolt! Admire, don\u2019t inquire! It was originally a 'play park' for the littlest Pokemon in the center. Now all kinds of creepy critters are crawling up in those tunnels and slides!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cThis is\u2026 the food court! Yeah, I know\u2014real drab. It\u2019s standard issue. White tables, boring benches, metal food stands. But the grub\u2019s good! Berries, all you can eat! And plenty of that dry purple stuff Decidueye likes. Wiki Berry, is it?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her frenzied tour leaves your mind in a whirl. Riding on the scruff of her neck, your eyes are swirling from all the bouncing around on her back. When it\u2019s all done, you flop onto the ground.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This rat is a mischievous one, that much you could see. You being in this PokeCenter for an extended period of time meant you were going to be the target of a lot of her shenanigans, you know that. Still, you didn't expect her to start that so quickly. While you were still dazed from her movements -- why couldn't anyone here have any consideration for your diminutive size? -- she returned, still holding you in her paw, to the berry Decidueye had left for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Oh, this is perfect. This is fate, you'll see\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's fate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"This berry! It's perfect!\" </span>and without further ado, she went to town with the berry. Her sharp incisors hit the hard shell, breaking through in matter of seconds. Another confirmation you'd never be able to penetrate it by yourself! Rattata, displeased, stuck her tongue out, she looked like she was going to spit. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Ugh, I have never liked these ones\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't follow\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Don't make any noise!\"</span> she said, lifting you towards the hole she had made with her teeth, a rectangular hole that went deep into the berry. For a brief moment you thought she had cracked it so you could try the pulp and finally eat, but instead, she turned you around so your head was towards her, and shoved you into the hole. It was tight, even for your size! Before you could see her expression of excitement, and then it all was replaced by purple, with only a small hole showing you the outside world! Your head and face was right at the surface, you could see outside with some effort. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Perfect. He won't notice you\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Decidueye! Who else?\"</span> she lowered her voice, whispering to you. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\"He's not going to resist once he sees<i> two </i>Wiki berries. He'll think I left them for him\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take you long for you to realize what she was planning. This betrayal...! She was planning to make you get eaten by the owl! You immediately started struggling, trying to worm your way towards the outside, like a worm trying to get out of a cocoon. \"Are you crazy?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"What? No, you don't get it. This is normal for me. I have been inside Decidueye more times than I can count\"</span> That didn't really make you feel any better. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\"His insides are my own personal playground. I even got a couple objects in his stomach to make it cozier, but don't tell him that!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't be serious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"He doesn't like it very much, so it has turned into a game for me: come up with new ways for me to get into his stomach. No trick works twice! And I guess his belly is sensitive or something, because he always can feel when I'm in there before even a minute passes -- but once I'm in, he just lets me stay all I want\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou increased your struggling. \"You're not afraid of being digested?!\" Rattatas were prey for so many Pokemon! How could she not be concerned about that?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRattata shrugged. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\"His system is slow as molasses. It'd take me a day to start feeling the effects of acids. Sure, that means that being carried by his intestines takes ages, but--\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have gone all the way through?!\" This was sounding worse and worse with every word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Only three or four times. The first time he was trying to throw me up, but instead it pushed me further inside him. It wasn't clean, but since then when I feel like it I take the long route out instead of crawling upwards\"</span> Rattata looks at you with admiration, her eyes sparkling with bravery. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\"I didn't think you would be interested in going that far! You must be as much of a daredevil as I am!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh. So that was it. Not only she was mischievous, she also was an adrenaline junkie. Not a great combination, really. That explained why she was so fearless about the possibility of getting eaten by a creature that in any other situation could have been a predator. You sighed, feeling yourself drained of energy. This rat really could be exhausting. \"That's not what I meant--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Really? Well, tell me if you change your mind. Now I better hurry!</span>\" Rattata disappeared from your line of sight, vanishing to parts unknown. Taking advantage of her absence, you started wriggling again, trying to get out of the berry before she came back -- or before Decidueye did, which would have been worse. During the process your face was smeared against the purple pulp of the berry, giving you a taste of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRattata was right: Wiki berries weren't very good. You tried hard not to taste it ever again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hadn't done any progress at all when Rattata returned a couple minutes later, carrying what you recognized as two halves of a Wiki berry shell. She tapped one of them with a paw, the sound proving the halves were still as tough as ever. \"Look at this. It took me so long to get the pulp out, but it's perfect\" She set the halves on the surface, settling into one of them before grabbing the other and positioning it to close the berry, making sure her tail was inside instead of slipping out. The berry was barely large enough to accomodate her if she curled and made herself as small as possible. You hoped Decidueye would notice something off about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we change our mind?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Aw, don't be like that! I'm giving you a tour of this place, and that includes a place I like. It's like a secret between you and me\" </span>her voice sounded through the berry shell, muffled by the hard material.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't really the kind of tour I was looking forward to\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"You know, I'm glad you're here\"</span> she suddenly said. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Everyone who comes here leaves shortly afterwards. Even Pokemon I befriend leave. So having someone else to share these things with...it's nice\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n...what were you supposed to say to that? She sounded so truly excited, so truly happy to have you there, you couldn't bring yourself to say anything. Rattata continued, her voice sounding a little nostalgic -- or perhaps it just was the reverberation of her voice inside the berry shell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"I'm looking forward to us having fun. There's so much we can do together. We can tend to the garden Decidueye has up in the second floor...we can play pranks on any guests that come here...we can go to the roof and watch the stars...I'll come up with everything I can to keep you entertained. Because if you're having fun, maybe you won't leave\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOuch, that one hit you hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"So let's have fun!\"</span> you heard a tiny gasp. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Oh, I forgot! I'm supposed to be showing you around. I guess I should have a word or two about what's going on.\"</span> you heard her clear her throat, before she started, sounding a little more professional than before. She wanted to give you a good impression about this, you guessed. \"<span class=\"cmagenta\">Decidueye's beak is merely the entrance to his body. Make sure to not get your arms or legs out there, because his spit sticks to your fur like glue! Oh, right, but you don't have too much of that. Then nevermind, but it still feels weird when the tongue touches you!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nScratch that, it wasn't terribly professional either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"We're going to be there for just a few seconds, so if you'll look around, you better do it fast!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smushed your cheek against the pulp, a little conflicted. Perhaps...you should feign excitement while being inside Decidueye's stomach? You were sure you weren't exactly going to enjoy being eaten by him, but Rattata seemed so earnest, so excited about this, it was hard not to say no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeez...</span></div></div>",

Berry jelly squishes up your spread arms, plastered to the fruit\u2019s inner shell lining. The shell is slightly softer on the inside, which lets you get a better grip to keep your head above the pulpy gush. The berry\u2019s weird scent tingles your nose. It\u2019s kinda like blackberries. But not quite. It\u2019s got a bit more of that sweet-sour tang. And you swear, there\u2019s almost a hint of\u2026 pineapple?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t<i>Click. Click. Click.</i> Decidueye is on the approach. His talons dance upon the hard floor as he walks with a steady, controlled rhythm. His pace is casual\u2014unhurried as he checks on the duo he left behind.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tYou hear Rattata whisper from beyond the fruity walls. <span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cThis is it!\u201d</span> She murmurs, <span class=\"cgrape\">\u201che\u2019s coming, he\u2019s coming!\u201d</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tAnd that he is. Peeking through the slit gouged in the berry\u2019s shell, you see Decidueye. His round owl head is cloaked in the shadows of his grassy cowl. His circular eyes are near-perpetually half-lidded by dark eyelids. His brown irises encircle red pupils\u2014almost glowing in the shade. His fluffy brown wings reach down for Rattata\u2019s berry, brushing their feathers along its bumpy surface.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t<span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cTwo?\u201d</span> He hoots, \u201c<span class=\"cgreen\">hooo, I can\u2019t resist. It was hard enough giving one berry to the miniature fellow! There\u2019s a bit taken out of the one down there, too. So they must\u2019ve had their fill.\u201d</span> His beak parts slightly. A smile? <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cOh well, more for <i>moi!\u201d</i></span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tUnable to peel your eyes away, you watch as Decidueye lifts the hollowed-out berry past his down-covered white body. He raises it to his hooked beak\u2014which opens with an eager start. His avian tongue is slightly thicker than expected. Though it still has its trademark tapering form, it\u2019s plump. It\u2019s almost like a pillow squished into its form like Pillsbury dough. But while it looks comfortably soft, it isn\u2019t anything you\u2019d want to lay on. It\u2019s absolutely slathered in gooey, sticky spit. Even for saliva, the foggy liquid is abnormally gluey. A thought comes to mind. Decidueye typically eat small rodents\u2014and berries. Given that rodents are off the menu for this particular owl, that means he\u2019s been subsisting on an entirely fruity diet. And his spit\u2014it\u2019s saturated with those sticky juices. Cloudy with fruit juice, you watch as long sticky strands glue to the berry\u2019s shell. Thick mucousy ropes connect the shell to his mouth and tongue. The flabby organ washes over its surface, spreading thick drivel all over in a revolting film.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tDecidueye hums, squishing his beak into the gummy-yet-tough surface. As his beak closes, you see Rattata peek from her shell. Grinning widely, eyes squinted as bird drool squirts over her face, she sees her chance. She springs forward, skating along his tongue like a slip-and-slide. Her body shoots into his throat. And his eyes go wide. Before he can even squawk, he swallows. And the rat vanishes into his throat.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tHis surprised eyes gradually drift into a look of annoyance. Talking with his beak full, he mumbles. <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cOh, pellets. Blast her. <font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">I\u2019ll finish the meal.</font> <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">I hope it splashes on her snout\u2026\u201d</font></span> And with that, mashes the rest of the berry shell in his beak. Chewing it into a pulpy goo, he swallows it. Then, he looks to yours.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tYou\u2019re whisked up, floating high as your berry is cradled between his wingfeathers. His maw opens. Inside, purple berry residue slathers across interior. He tongue rises from the goopy purple waters, arcing slightly\u2014poised to strike.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tYour berry is too big to fit in his beak all at once. So he tears into the front. The roof tumbles down as chunky gloop, the berry pulp gushing past his keratin beak. You\u2019re swept along, riding the gelatin stream as your arms pinwheel backwards like mad. You gush onto his tongue, splatting as thick drool cements you to the plappy organ. Funky berry washes from behind, drenching you in a wave of foul goop. Decidueye\u2019s beak is awash with odd scents. Sweet Mango Berry, sour Rawst. Even the nose-tingling aroma of spicy Cheri Berry wafts from his murky spit. But the gluey liquid is mostly sweet. It smells like candy. Which would be delightful if you weren\u2019t covered in warm glue.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tDecidueye takes another bite. Pulp and berry globs flood his beak like a smashed pumpkin. You\u2019re punched by the outpour, falling under his tongue as it smears around his mouth. It presses against the roof and sides of his beak, licking up all the sweet nectar. Dribbles of purplish spit cascade off the organ, plattering on you. The heavy weight of the cascade cements you to the floor, gushing in your ears and nose. After an entirely-too-long tasting, Decidueye washes his funky spit along his mouth. You\u2019re picked up in the riptide, slushing over and under the drool-vovered organ as you\u2019re rinsed in the washcycle. Old berry grime dislodges from his beak\u2014flecks and remnants of his previous meals. The speckles of berry skin and pulp batter you while you ride up along his smooth tongue.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tEverything rocks backwards. Decidueye\u2019s head tilts. Your tumble down his tongue, head-over-shoulders. You roll off his tongue. A flood of berry grime kicks you into his throat. The horrible conglomerate fills your mouth as the light snuffs out\u2014Decidueye\u2019s beak closed and out-of-sight. Each of his swallows jostles the slurry you\u2019re housed in, mushing it up as you\u2019re thrown around by the squishy, heartless walls. His digestive system is unsympathetic. You\u2019re mushed into chewed berry. You\u2019re treated no different than any other food.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tDecidueye\u2019s throat mushing you into applesauce, your feet squish against a ring of flesh. Soft, but held tight. It yields after a few moments of simmering in owl spit and berry mush. The buildup of the owl\u2019s meal pours into his stomach, carrying you along with the ride.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tInside, it\u2019s unlike anything you\u2019ve ever seen. Even Noibat\u2019s stomach. Here, multiple days worth of berries have fermented into a goo not unlike a melted taffy candy\u2014like gooey Starbursts. Horribly sticky, it\u2019s a rainbow-blend of every color in the rainbow, plus a few others. Blackish Bluk Berry spirawls amongst a conglomerate of pink Pecha and blue Chesto. Digesting in the soup, a paleish-yellow Aspear oozes a thick yellow secretion\u2014as if it\u2019s melting into gummy paint. But most surprising, is that you can see! The syrupy stuff is lit by a pendant of Mystic Water contained in a teardrop glass charm wrung around a familiar Rattata\u2019s neck. Beslimed in thick taffy, Rattata\u2019s fur twists into little dripping triangles of matted fur. Her original purple color is barely visible beneath the sticky, gummy layer of thickened berry slime. She\u2019s a mixture of many colors, drenched in shiny, thick slop.<br>\r\n\t \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her paw splurts above the goop\u2014another Mystic Water pendant. It glows blue.<br>\r\n\t \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cTake it, take it, take it!\u201d</span> She chitters excitedly. You struggle to paddle over. It\u2019s like swimming through molasses! But you get there. She sets it in the sap, plucks you up, and puts you aboard\u2014letting you ride it like a raft.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tLooking up, you see there\u2019s a couple objects floating amongst the goop. A couple balls, a hilariously tiny plastic Wailord. There\u2019s even a soggy hammock! It\u2019s sides are glued to the belly wall via natural berry glue, treated in order to resist digestion. It\u2019s made of burlap and rests above the waves.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t<span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cThat\u2019s where I sleep if I want to stay longer!\u201d</span> She chirps, viscid stickiness running over her cheeks.<br>\r\nThe stomach jitters as Decidueye sighs, <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201coh, I should\u2019ve known you were going to try that, my dearling. I\u2019m assuming our guest is in there too\u2026\u201d</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cYep!\u201d</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cUm\u2026 yeah\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cOh, no, no, no...\u201d</span> Decidueye puffs.

You had barely known each other for...what, an hour? An hour and half? Not really enough time to trust you with knowledge about his love prospects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, Decidueye sounded really uncomfortable. Even though he seemed to have been trying to make himself look imposing and a bit distant to you not that long ago, now he was rising his voice, flustered. <span class=\"cgreen\">\"This is exactly why I don't like when you do that randomly! You don't know what plans I have when you decide to get inside me!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paddled towards Rattata through the thick berry muck, clinging to the amulet she had given you, having such a hard time advancing you thought you weren't getting anywhere. \"You should apologize\" you told her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"I know, I know. I screwed up this time. I'm sorry, Decidueye, I didn't know\"</span> at least she seemed genuinely embarrassed about this. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\"When's your date?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"In a few minutes.

As you saw it, there was no way he could get both of you out before it was date time. While you weren't exactly eager to stay swimming in a melange of molten berries, you weren't going to get in the way of Decidueye's seemingly rocky love life. The owl seemed to have realized the futility of it all, because he sighed and groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"Human, please don't make this a hobby too. I have enough with Rattata doing it\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, I won't\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything around you shook. You guessed the owl was moving somewhere else. <span class=\"cgreen\">\"You two better stay quiet and don't make a ruckus in there. I don't want to have to end the date because I get a stomachache\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"When have I ever caused even a bit of pain?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"I remember the time you decided to try playing rock climber with the walls of my stomach. I'm sure my liver hasn't been the same since you clung to it from inside the stomach\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"I know! I learned my lesson back then\"</span> Rattata said, right while she was climbing the stomach wall towards her hammock. Was that painful incident when Rattata had hung that hammock from the wall? You had a feeling what Rattata had learned wasn't exactly what Decidueye hoped. She carefully got on the hammock, letting it sway like a boat suspended over the stickiest ocean ever. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Now listen here: you better make yourself nice and tidy for your date. You can't let this chance go, got it?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"I wasn't planning on showing up dirty\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Of course not -- but those white feathers of you better be so clean they'll glow in the dark. I'll be taking a look once I'm out after your date!\"</span> she joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wished you could make yourself tidier. You were pretty sure you'd have berry juices and seeds stuck to you for the rest of your life, given how extensive this dunking was being. The liquids were swaying back and forth, gently taking you around like a piece of wood adrift the ocean, making sure you were getting familiar with all the sides of the roundish sac you were in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Hey, human\"</span> Rattata called for you while outside you heard noises that probably were Decidueye preening his feathers and leaves. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Psst. Come over here\"</span> You tried your hardest to ride the tiny waves, bumping into the plastic Wailord and finally reaching the side of the stomach where Rattata was at. She was holding onto the edge of the hammock, leaning towards you all she could. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\"How good are you at dates?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm no Casanova, but I guess I'm...okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"What's a casanova?\"</span> she seemed confused. Perhaps Pokemon didn't have that concept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, human stuff. Anyway, why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRattata's whiskers twitched. You watched a sticky drop fall from there to near you.<span class=\"cmagenta\"> \"Decidueye isn't the most graceful 'mon ever. Knowing him, he's going to get all tongue-tied at the worst point. Since we're here, how about we lend him a hand?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Decidueye said we should be quiet\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Decidueye says a lot of things. That doesn't mean we have to listen, if it's for his own good\"</span> she said. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\"So how about we give him a tip or two if he gets stuck?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she was pretty much asking you to help her play matchmaker. That was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...well perhaps it'd be fine. Apparently it was a rarity for Decidueye to be in this kind of thing. It'd be such a pity for it to go badly. Besides, it wasn't like you had anything better to do. What else could you do -- count the wrinkles above the sticky mess all around you? \"Sure, I guess\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRattata grinned. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\"I knew you were fun. Don't worry, I want him to have a good date. I'll try my best to be of help -- between the three of us, there's no way Decidueye can't do well!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wished you could share that optimism.</span></div></div>",

Splattering onto the canvas hammock, you and the berry goop form a puddle next to Rattata\u2019s cream-colored underbelly. She shifts to the side, making sure she doesn\u2019t roll over you, and lays lengthwise across the canvas. With her still dripping with berry gluck, it forms little rivers that cascade down the hammock. You\u2019re able to resist being swept away into the slopping waters, shaking as Decidueye rushes to finish his preening. His stomach contents shuddering and swirling like an industrial vat of syrupy sugar, you hear Decidueye\u2019s cool voice echo from above.<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cThe clearing. The one with the white and yellow flowers. Half-moon. Ohhh!\u201d</span> He mutters nervously, <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cI think I\u2019m going to be late!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cCalm down!\u201d</span> Rattata chirps, <span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cit\u2019s okay to be fashionably late!\u201d</span><br>\r\n\tThe gooey stomach slop jumps violently. You and Rattata are pressed to the soaked canvas as Decidueye jumps. <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cNo it isn\u2019t! That\u2019s for parties! Dates, uhm, you\u2019re supposed be on time, pronto!\u201d</span><br>\r\n\t<span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cGeez,\u201d</span> Rattata sighs,<span class=\"cgrape\"> \u201che\u2019s getting worked up about this.\u201d </span>She says to you in an aside. Her ears are low, but they spark right back up when she hollers again.<span class=\"cgrape\"> \u201cDon\u2019t get nervous. Dates can smell your fear!\u201d</span><br>\r\n\t<span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cEeep!\u201d </span>Decidueye finishes tightening his hood\u2019s strings. <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cAlright. No fear. No nervousness. Nothing, nothing, nothing. No, no, no...\u201d </span>He chants before scurrying off out the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAn open clearing. The starlight shines dim. But the bright moon makes the white flowers glow. A mild breeze passes through the trees, warming the cool night. The flowers sway in a hypnotic dance. A natural circlet cuts into the flower patch, like a clearing within the clearing. The dark canopy provides a nice private shade. And while the towering trees may seem imposing, the quiet sound of their leaves rustling in the wind? It could placate the heart of a rampaging Tauros.<br>\r\n\tSitting amidst the flowers is a very nervous Decidueye.<br>\r\n\t<span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s coming!\u201d</span><br>\r\n\tHis nervous belly feels full of butterflies. But in truth, it\u2019s only got two occupants. His stomach\u2019s anxious churning kicks slop up to your perch. The stomach walls indent when Decidueye sucks in his belly, allowing the sticky waves to kiss the bottom of the hammock. When they recede, a long gum-like sticky trail of goo strings to your bedding\u2019s underside.<br>\r\n\t\u201cDecidueye\u2014it\u2019s okay! You\u2019re probably early. You practically ran here\u2026\u201d you look over to the drenched Rattata, still dripping from the tsunami born from Decidueye\u2019s haste.<br>\r\n\t<span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cHalf moon. The place with the yellow and white flowers\u2026 or was it the red and white flowers? Oh no! Am I in the wrong clearing\u2026\u201d</span><br>\r\n\t<span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cNo, big guy\u2026\u201d </span>The stomach\u2019s churning slows with the rodent\u2019s words. <span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cGive her a few minutes. Err, him?\u201d</span><br>\r\n\t<span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cHim\u2026\u201d</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\t\u201cHim!\u201d</span><br>\r\n\t<span class=\"cgrey\">\u201cA-hem!\u201d</span> Decidueye practically leaps out of his skin. You and Rattata fling off the hammock as if it is a trampoline. You make a noisy splashdown, instantly sinking into the berry sludge. Sticky and gross, you both look like you\u2019ve been dipped in melted cotton candy.<br>\r\n\tA voice, barely heard from the outside, high-pitched yet proper and stiff, <span class=\"cgrey\">\u201cthis appears to be the one, Master Altaria. Decidueye. Male. Five-foot-three. Albeit, he fails to match your lofty descriptions.\u201d</span><br>\r\n\t<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 thank you, Indeedee.\u201d</span> A wispy, shy sound barely breaks through Decidueye\u2019s stomach\u2019s barrier. It rings through the sweltry belly air like twinkling piano keys. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cThat\u2019s him\u2026\u201d</span><br>\r\n\t<span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cA-altaria!\u201d</span> Decidueye\u2019s stomach goes hard as iron. It doesn\u2019t even churn as he speaks.<span class=\"cgreen\"> \u201cI\u2014I was waiting for\u2014you\u2019re not late\u2014hello!\u201d</span><br>\r\n\tYou sigh. You\u2019ve got a good feeling he\u2019s going to need a lot of help\u2026<br>\r\n\tThick silence. Then\u2014a giggle. High as bells, Altaria is laughing. <span class=\"clblue\">\u201cHa ha! Sorry I\u2019m\u2026 late. I would\u2019ve flown\u2026 but\u2026 Indeedee can\u2019t fly. And he\u2019s\u2026 terrified of heights.\u201d</span><br>\r\n\t<span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cOh!\u201d</span> Decidueye perks up, his fluttering belly bounces, swallowing you into the gloop. <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cI\u2019m afraid of heights too! I can\u2019t fly either! It\u2019s cool to\u2026 not fly\u2026\u201d</span><br>\r\n\tRattata erupts into laughter, despite being covered in berry goop. But just as soon as she\u2019s begun, she shoots into a spitting fit. Some of gunk got in her mouth. <span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cEch. Keha~! <i>Blech!\u201d</i></span><br>\r\n\tYou look at her in bewilderment as you hear the <i>ploof!</i> of Altaria sitting down next to Decidueye. Rattata gains a bit of her composure. <span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cThey\u2019re both so awkward! They\u2019re made for each other!\u201d</span><br>\r\n\t<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cUm\u2026\u201d</span> Altaria speaks,<span class=\"clblue\"> \u201cIndeedee, can you\u2026 drop off the berry wine here\u2026 and the snacks and\u2026 leave?\u201d</span><br>\r\n\tA lengthy respire, <span class=\"cgrey\">\u201cMy lord, it\u2019s quite important that I don\u2019t leave you unattended.\u201d</span><br>\r\n\t<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cB-but it\u2019s my date\u2026\u201d</span><br>\r\n\t<span class=\"cgrey\">\u201cAnd you are a very important person. Imagine a ferocious Pokemon attacked. Now where would we be?\u201d</span> Indeedee\u2019s stick-in-the-mud attitude is already grating. <span class=\"cgrey\">\"You're safety is more important than your privacy. Besides, I have to make sure you're not 'mucking around' too much with the commoner! Ho ho! But with your current date, I won't have to be worrying about any illegitimate heirs.\"</span><br>\r\n\tRattata bats away a goopy Wiki Berry and flashes you a look. The glint in her eye looks ever familiar. <span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cThis Indeedee's a jerk. We need to get 'em out of here! And I think I know just the way!\u201d</span><br>\r\n\tRattata swims over the rumpled wall and places a sticky paw on a gummy fold. She cups her other paw over her mouth and shouts, <span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cYou know Spirit Shackle, right?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cWhat!\u201d </span>Decidueye whispers as softly as he can. Even inside him, you barely hear him.<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cDon\u2019t hit him with it! Glue his shadow to the ground and scurry off!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cHow in the <i>world </i>is that supposed to make Altaria like me!?\u201d</span><br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d you say, \u201cI think Altaria\u2019s tired of having him chained to his ankle. He\u2019ll might think it\u2019s freeing!\u201d<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\"><i>\u201cMight!?\u201d</i></span><br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cWho are you whispering to?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cAh!\u201d </span>You can\u2019t see it, but Decidueye lifts his head out of his wingfeathers and rotates it 180 degrees.<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cEeep!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cNo, no, no! I\u2019m sorry!\u201d</span> The owl apologizes,<span class=\"cgreen\"> \u201cI\u2026 should\u2019ve waited \u2018til we knew each other better before I did that!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrey\">\u201cYou might nary know him much longer if you keep that up.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cOhhh\u2026\u201d</span><br>\r\nRattata hisses into the humidity, <span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cdoooo iiiiittttt!\u201d</span><br>\r\nDecidueye sighs, straightens his gaze, and\u2026<br>\r\n<i>Poof, poof, poof, poof! </i>Lets loose a barrage of feathers into Indeedee\u2019s shadow.<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrey\">\u201cHey! What\u2014\u201d</span><br>\r\nDecidueye stammers, turning towards Altaria, <span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cwe, uh\u2014\u201d</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\u201c\u2018Gotta run!\u2019\u201d</span> Rattata chimes.<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cGot to run!\u201d</span> His fruity belly goop flings high as he stands with a start. A giggle, chiming, follows. When his belly becomes a chaotic mess, claws stomping on the ground as he runs, those small giggles become chiming laughter.</span></span></div></div>",

Is there\u2026 something darker about Decidueye that you don\u2019t know? Or did Honchkrow pull a mean stunt in the past?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cred\">\u201c...Ooo! Berries!\u201d</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0...That\u2019s not good.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cUm,\u201d</span> Rattata raspily whispers, <span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cwho is that? How did he get in here? Why does he sound like he\u2019s got a Joltik in their tummy? When\u2014\u201d</span> Rattata\u2019s voice cuts off with a sudden mushy <i>squish!</i> as your berry\u2019s roof abruptly collapses. You\u2019re punched with G-forces as you\u2019re whirled into the air, gravity pinning you to the berry shell wall. Juices oozing around you, you whip your head to the ceiling\u2014getting an eyeful of berry mush in the process. You see the top-half of Honchkrow\u2019s beak amongst the berry\u2019s roof\u2019s rubble. You light in surprise. Rattata had to take her time puncturing the hard shell. But Honchkrow did it so casually\u2014like it was nothing! Apparently, he\u2019s stronger than he looks.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Peering out your fruity capsule, your heart instantly sinks. You\u2019re in his beak. The curved roof above is a dark maroon\u2014ridged and shiny as latex, wettened with spit. His pink slender tongue slithers beneath the cracked berry, plastering its gooey surface along the shell\u2019s bumpy outside. You\u2019re splashed in the face by a flood of saliva surging inside the fruit, pouring from above and below. The mucky, pulpy berry-and-saliva slushie spirals you around the snack\u2019s interior. All the while, you\u2019re protests are silenced from the (frankly disgusting) berry slush spurting into your mouth. Your stomach falls to your toes as you hear a crunch above. Honchkrow is chewing. The berry roof falls in chunks. You\u2019re thrown out of the ruined shell, splatting on the bird\u2019s tongue as he swishes his mouth juices around.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cred\">\u201cHmm!\u201d </span>He mumbles, <span class=\"cred\">\u201cnot bad!\u201d</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Chunks of pap and paste glob against your cheeks. The sticky mixture adheres to your exposed skin, twisting your hair in gooey knots. <i>Squish! Squesh! Squash!</i> The Wiki Berry is crunched into swallowable chunks. Each mastication splatters you in a sludge bomb. It\u2019s like being pie\u2019d in the face. Only the pie had a bomb in it. And it\u2019s raining. So it all runs down in gluey chunks, flowing and squirting into absolutely everywhere.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Honchkrow bobs his head forward. You\u2019re thrown to the tip of his tongue, bashing into his closed beak before his chin bounces up like it jumped off a springboard. You float amongst the Wiki sludge before toppling onto the back of his tongue. Chunks of fruit shell barrel into you, pushing you past the point of no return. Your body slides along Honchkrow\u2019s slippery tongue, slopping over its edge\u2014plummeting into his throat.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Glrrk!</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0From the inside, his gulp sounds nothing like it would on the outside. It\u2019s like having two sopping wet slabs of steak pound into your ears. Because frankly, that\u2019s what happens. You\u2019re crammed into his crushing throat. Mushed into a ball of viscous gluck and tough shell, you\u2019re squeezed too tight to scream. Grunting and eeping, another harsh swallow contracts around you. Crow spit flows into your cramped chamber, lubing your up\u2014causing you to slip and slide amongst the other bits of his meal. You\u2019re mushed up against the food chunks, swamped in a blend of slurried spit. Painted purple, Honchkrow\u2019s final gulp squashes you face-first into a band of muscle. Its doughy flesh molds around your face as the crow\u2019s esophagus squashes in from behind\u2014oozing you through as the passage kneads the pulpy mixture under your arms and between your legs.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your face breaches into the beyond, accompanied with a spurt of Wiki Berry. Inside, it\u2019s nearly pitch-black. But alighting the rumpled, churning chamber\u2014floating amongst the gloppy porridge soup of the bird\u2019s belly\u2014is a soggy clumping of Luminous Moss. Bioluminescent, the crow\u2019s stomach is lit by its feeble green glow. The patch is broken up into smaller bits, each bobbing freely amongst the brownish-yellow gruel. Thick as oatmeal, it\u2019s the result of your meal before: when you first met the big bird\u2014and from his snackings before. Seeds melt into unrecognizable goo. Old berries are nothing but colorful mush, spreading throughout his paunch like colored dye in cookie dough. Streaks of batter are flung across the walls, flowing into the wrinkles between folds. Frothy bubbles align along the border of the soup, with thicker bubbles sputtering at the broth\u2019s center.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And then there\u2019s the smell\u2014it\u2019s horrible. No two ways about it. It smells like crow vomit. Hot, reeking, digestion saturates the air as you\u2019re helplessly thrust into the broiling belly air. You splat down into belly slime, sinking into sludge\u2014only to be buried beneath the waves as Honchkrow\u2019s rolling belly throws more slop atop your entry point. But survival instincts take over. You flail wildly as you flounder in the mush, breaking the surface as his stomach grumbles and moans.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Outside, a faint voice, <span class=\"cgrape\">\u201chey! You\u2019re not Decidueye!\u201d</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The melange jiggles violently as Honchkrow leaps in surprise. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cAh! Who are\u2014oh! You\u2019re Decidueye\u2019s helper!\u201d</span> His stomach sucks in with worry. You\u2019re battered by a surge of slop as the bird\u2019s heart beats fast. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cI need to know: where\u2019s the little one!\u201d</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cUh, they were in a berry. A berry that you ate. That\u2019s in your stomach.\u201d</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A pause. Honchkrow holds his breath.<span class=\"cred\"> \u201cA c-clever trick!

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When you heard him mumble that, you knew right away what Honchkrow meant. You had experienced it not that long ago, after all. \"Stop!\" you shout. \"I'm here, I'm here! Leave her alone!\" Perhaps if the crow realized she wasn't lying, he wouldn't make her undergo that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was useless. It didn't seem Honchkrow could hear you. He either just couldn't, or he was too frenzied to realize you were right there. Either way, Rattata was doomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Wait what? What's that supposed to mean?\"</span> you faintly heard. You really hoped by now Rattata was getting ready to run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I'm desperate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Hey! Stop that--you're gripping me so hard!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just--stop moving and this will be done quickly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh no. He had caught her. You could picture the scene outside: Rattata trapped in one of his black talons, squirming and trying to escape but unable to. Honchkrow looking around with worry, trying his best to position himself to make it all easier for himself. Where was Decidueye? Did he really not hear the commotion going on down here?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stomach tilted backwards, you were thrown amidst a tsunami of gruel, towards the back of the stomach. The concoction all around you almost pulled you deep into it, but you were able to get out by clinging to the wall and using it as a guide to the surface. Once you surfaced, you coughed, trying to wipe that thick gruel out of your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Wait, you're not going to do what I think you're going to do, right?!\"</span> you guessed she was looking upwards, at Honchkrow's back end positioned right above her. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\"I don't think I'm even going to fit!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh. That was right. Decidueye was taller and larger than Honchkrow, and although Honchkrow wasn't exactly small, when you had gone in his system sometimes had given you quiet some bearhugs. Rattata was going to be almost immobilized. You hoped she was too big to be inserted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I have experience! This will go fine, it will!\" you detected a hint of uncertainty in Honchkrow's statement. Even he wasn't sure if this would go like he hoped. Suddenly, the entire stomach moved downwards, forcing you to bounce in the air and splash into the soup, bits of moss clinging to you like velcro. It had started! Honchkrow was already trying to force her up his butt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"crose\">\"Ow! Ow ow ow ow!\"</span> Honchkrow had regrets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true he had done this before. Twice, in fact. First with a Joltik when he was still unevolved, and not that long ago with that tiny human. Both times it had been so...so enjoyable! It made him feel terribly guilty afterwards, but at the time it was great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, though, it wasn't. Maybe it was the position Rattata was in -- she was trying to make herself as wide as possible -- what made it so uncomfortable, even painful. Honchkrow's vent had opened, enveloping her head very slowly to lead the way into his cloaca, but her paws were trying to get her head out, and didn't care it was stretching things a little too much. Any pleasure he could be getting was diminished by a lot of discomfort. <span class=\"cmaroon\">\"H-Hey, if you keep doing that this is going to take much longer!\"</span> he pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRattata couldn't reply, her head already getting enveloped by the oily walls of the rectum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"Can you even hear me? Uh...you can't? One knock for yes, two for no?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only response he got was more struggles. This wasn't going to work as communication! Seeing no more option, he kept moving downwards, towards the talon he was gripping her with, and tried to ignore the increasing urge to stop and reconsider. He couldn't reconsider, he was past the point of no return, as far as he was concerned! Trying to finish this as fast as possible, he pressed himself downwards, his butt hitting his talon. Once that was done and he had three-fourths of rat already up his rear end, he leaned forward, trying to use gravity to make her slip further inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt worked. Rattata slid in with a nasty sound, her back legs and tail disappearing into Honchkrow's vent. Oh, this was heavy. Too heavy. And his body was already giving him urgent requests to void his bowels, mistaking Rattata for something else. No, this wasn't going to go well! And it was making him unbalanced, to boot. He had some trouble to stay on his feet, flying was going to be a lot of trouble. He shouldn't have done any of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what option did he have now? He needed to find the human, and Rattata was only going to, well, rat him out to Decidueye. After the welcome he got, he didn't want to see the owl again for a long time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut first, he had to gather his strength. <span class=\"cmaroon\">\"I have to stop using that area for this kind of thing...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen everything had tilted forward, slamming you to the front of the stomach, you feared he had succeeded. All you could do was call for your new friend. \"Rattata! Can you hear me? Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"I'm...urgh. I'm fine?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, she could hear you! Good. With a lot of difficulty you swam through the melange to the back end of the stomach. \"I heard everything. Are you hurt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"No, I'm fine! I just...can't believe this is happening to me\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could sympathize with that. You didn't have fond memories of having been in Rattata's position mere hours ago. \"Don't worry, you'll be fine. Decidueye will help us\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"It's so--tight!\"</span> you heard a noise like Rattata was struggling to talk. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\"The walls are closing in--too many times!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hoped for her sake she didn't have to share her space with anything. That would make an already tight space even tighter. \"Okay, we'll think of something. We should get Decidueye's help somehow. You know Honchkrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"I...well, the owl always told me to beware them. I think it's because of this one\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRattata had to take a few moments before she could answer. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\"You'll keep this a secret, right? I'm telling you because I trust you\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it'll be a secret\"<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\"><br>\r\n\"Decidueye is...well...this place? It's kind of a front.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A front?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"A <i>front</i>\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh. You caught onto what she meant. That meant Decidueye was, well...a criminal of some sort? Rattata continued. You imagined she was trying to push the walls away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"It's nothing bad! We just are facilitators. It's true we welcome travelers, but some of the people that come aren't travelers. Some shady things can happen here, and Decidueye turns a blind eye to it. We get rewarded for it. It's--it's nothing too bad, I swear!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure you liked very much what you were hearing, but...well, you had to give some credit to that neither Decidueye nor Rattata seemed like they were bad 'mons. Just...willing to overlook stuff. It was bad, but it wasn't like Decidueye was shattering kneecaps or encasing anyone in concrete. Perhaps you could turn a blind eye as well?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you had to. Not that you could do anything -- what would you do, stroll to a dangerous Pokemon and tell them to stop doing whatever they were doing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but where does Honchkrow fit in all this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"So, before Decidueye set this place up and before he even had evolved, he had a friend. I think it's this Honchkrow. Or Murkrow, I dunno. Decidueye told me he cut their friendship after the crow ruined a few of the things they were doing, and told him to never come close to him again. That's all I know\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh. You were starting to see why Honchkrow was looking for you. He had brought you here, perhaps hoping to rely on an old friend to take you in, only to be received with an arrow to the hat. Forced to leave, last he had seen of you was Decidueye aiming at you as well. He may have gotten worried Decidueye would hurt you because you had come with the crow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all a misunderstanding -- and now, well, it sure had spiraled out of control. You slammed your forehead against the stomach wall, receiving a gurgle in response. What a disaster this was starting to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"Hey, can you s-stop reciting my backstory to yourself? It's starting to freak me out a little!\" </span>you heard Honchkrow said. He could hear her? She was further away from his ears than you were! You hit the wall with your forehead again, the rubbery wall almost giving you a headache. <span class=\"cmaroon\">\"Anyway, let's go. I have to--I have to leave before Decidueye sees me. And I have to think of a new plan to find that little one!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, great. You weren't sure if things could get worse, but knowing fate, it always could. You heard Honchkrow extend his wings, ready to fly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Honchkrow opened his wings, his head pivoting around. He seemed at ease now that he was back at this abandoned manor, and although you could see some nervousness in his movements, he was trying hard to compensate you for the rather bad experience. You weren't going to be deceived at all. You looked around, seeing that indeed, you two weren't alone. Most were asleep, a few were looking at you with disinterest, as if a tiny human among them wasn't that big of a deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a crowd of sleeping Pokemon lining the walls of the attic Honchkrow had landed in. A lot of Murkrow, a couple Raticate surrounded by Rattata, a few Salandit in a corner, alone. Other small Pokemon were further into the attic, you couldn't see them well. It was a surprising variety of Pokemon, and among all them Honchkrow was one of the largest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas he the leader? You found hard to believe he'd be the leader of any kind of flock, he simply didn't have the personality for that. He did say these were \"roommates\", not his flock. He was just one resident more of this group. That was good, if nobody in that attic was obligated to defer to him, then you'd have a chance to slip away without them bringing you back to him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonchkrow waited for your reaction, receiving a chilly stare in response. \"Everyone here is nice, they'll leave you alone. Just in case you should stay away from the rooms in the ground flor, there's a Nidoking there. He's nice, but he's huge and you are not huge. What do you think?\" Fretting and fearing you hadn't forgiven him yet, he stepped towards you, lowering his voice. \"<span class=\"crose\">You're still upset? About what I did?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think?\" you blurt out, not feeling like softening the blow. Honchkrow recoiled, squaking at the vitriol in your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"crose\">\"I'm sorry, I just wanted to help!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wasn't helping, you were using me as your toy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"crose\">\"It wasn't like that, it was that you...you were...\" </span>Honchkrow blushed. He sure had a tendency towards blushing. <span class=\"crose\">\"It was a sensitive part of my body, of course that happened\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made a face of disgust. \"I don't want to talk about this\" The tense silence that followed your refusal to listen to him only made things worse. Starting to panic and not wanting to lose your friendship because of his actions, he flew into the air, hovering in circles above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"crose\">\"Wait here, I can fix things! I know, I'll bring back the food trident. We had good times back then, remember? It's a sign of friendship, so I'll bring it to you. Will that help?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course it wouldn't help! A fork wouldn't compensate what he did! But now that you thought about it, that fork was left all the way in that den you had invaded. It'd take Honchkrow a few hours to retrieve it and return, and a few hours of advantage to get away from him could be your saving grace. Smiling eagerly, you nodded. \"It'd help\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy there could be a chance to fix things between you, Honchkrow flew towards a window. \"I'll be back soon, I promise!\" he shouted while flying away. As soon as he was far away, you turned around, ready to make your move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for you, none of the Pokemon around seemed to be interested in approaching you, instead sleepily looking in your direction. That was better than getting attacked. Getting quickly to the stairs that led down from the attic, you slowly start descending them. Your diminutive state meant descending a single stair was quite the ordeal, you had to gather all your courage to jump off the edge of each stair. Thankfully, your size also meant the fall didn't hurt at all, not that it made it any more pleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you got to the ground floor, you heard noises coming from the lobby. That wasn't the place with the Nidoking, was it? Now that you thought about it, Honchkrow had told you to not go to those rooms...the Nidoking was nice but large. Therefore, Honchkrow wouldn't suspect you were with him. With some luck you could ask the Nidoking for help and protection from the crow, and if things went south, perhaps you could return to the roost upstairs?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, getting far away from this abandoned manor could be better. The problem was that you needed to put distance, and with your size that was going to take a while. Could it be the noises from the lobby could show you a way to get away quicker?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering your options, you take a decision.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Right now your priority was getting away from Honchkrow no matter what. The problem was finding a hiding spot. You were a tiny human, Honchkrow was a Pokemon with pretty good eyesight and an interest in keeping you around, for reasons you suspected were not good for you. Unaware of Honchkrow\u2019s sincere regret, you decided your best chance to get away from him would be two different options: either you hid in a place he wouldn\u2019t ever think you\u2019d be at, or hide in a place he\u2019d refuse to enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you played your cards right, you could hit both ideas at once! And what better to scare Honchkrow than a larger, more dangerous Pokemon? Surely due to your size it wouldn\u2019t be as dangerous to you as it would be to him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs long as you kept your distance, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour best option was right there, you decided. Honchkrow had said the Nidoking was nice, but you hoped he wasn\u2019t so nice he\u2019d just give you back. While you entered, you pondered if you really should let yourself be seen by your so-called new protector. Maybe it would be safer to seek refuge in his room without his knowledge?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like fate liked your decision. When you entered the rooms on the ground floor, you found out their owner wasn\u2019t there. Good! This was your chance! Taking time to walk around without falling through the crevices on the floor, you examine the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large pile of cloth and other soft things are piled against a wall. A bed? You take some of the cloth scraps, intending to keep the as a blanket and bed of your own. Not too far from there, there are many bones and a large slab of meat. All of those are much larger than you are, you shudder at the thought of finding yourself on the Nidoking\u2019s bad side. If he could eat such large meals, then you would be no problem. At least that mean you wouldn\u2019t be lacking in food, although you sure would like to cook it beforehand. You\u2019d cross that river when you got there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other end of the room there was a half-opened door, leading outside. Many scratches and gouges on the wood and stone of the walls showed a certain someone who passed through there often had quite the sharp claws. Great, as if you weren\u2019t nervous enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall it was a basic room. Bed, food, protection against the elements, and from what you could see, a bathroom some distance away you didn\u2019t intend to examine much. Everything was large, as expected of Nidoking. Thankfully, this all meant there were plenty of hiding places. Having taken some supplies, you searched for a hole on the wall near the floor, finding one near Nidoking\u2019s bed. That would be good enough. Dragging everything inside, you piled your scraps of cloth in a corner of the tiny hole and settled on it, somewhat satisfied with your work. You didn\u2019t like the thought of living here for months, but it was good enough to stay for a while. Better this than being with Honchkrow or Noibat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter everything that had happened that day, you were so tired you fell asleep, even though you hadn\u2019t been planning to rest yet.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So quiet, in fact, that along with Nidoking\u2019s hagged breaths and your own tumultuous heartbeat, you could hear the soft breaths of the sleeping Pokemon upstairs.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nidoking shatters the silence with his gravelly voice. \u201c<span class=\"cmagenta\">Was your momma a Taurus, bug? \u2018Cause I smell 100% fresh bull crap.</span>\u201d Nidoking wrinkles his nose. \u201c<span class=\"cmagenta\">Among the other ghastly scents you\u2019ve been cultivating.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was obvious Nidoking was already thinking of some rather unsettling thoughts. His voice and tone didn't foreshadow anything good for anyone you mentioned now. Nidoking didn't think kindly of bullies, that was for sure, and although you weren't sure Honchkrow fit that label entirely well, you doubted Nidoking would care to make a distinction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment you considered not saying anything. Then the events of not too long ago repeated in your mind: Honchkrow welcoming you while you were seeking for a place to hide, he deceiving you into accepting a proposal, with his reasons being quite perverse in nature - as far as you knew - and finally, your stay in the lower confines of his digestive system. You remember the humiliation, the slimy environment, his attempts to appease you once he finally let you go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou barely kept yourself from saying his name. You were starting to get rather upset, but you also had to keep in mind Nidoking clearly was going to take action. Were you going to condemn Honchkrow to whatever punishment Nidoking had in mind, even though it could be too much?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes. If only because you knew lying to Nidoking was futile. He would know immediately you were lying. Better not to anger the giant Pokemon you're currently with. He said he wasn't going to kill you, but you sure didn't want to get on his bad side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNw you understood why Honchkrow had been afraid of someone who was said to be nice. Nidoking certainly was nice enough to be welcoming when he wanted, but the moment you made him angry with you would be a moment you'd regret bitterly. You quietly promised yourself you'd do everything in your power to stay on Nidoking's good side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honchkrow\" you said. A growl of acknowledgement shook you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"That was not a name I expected. Despite the fame of his species, he always seemed to be quite the meek bird\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not lying\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"I know. I believe you. I will deal with him promptly, that I can assure you</span>\" you shuddered at the way he said that. Should you really have said anything about Honchkrow? You could have named Noibat and it wouldn't have been a lie. Too late for regrets, regardless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wait for Honchkrow's arrival was eternal. Nidoking had placed you on his head, beside his horn, where you sat down to wait. The more you waited, the more regret gnawed at you. At some point you voiced your concerns, but Nidoking shut you up with a rather blunt: <span class=\"cmagenta\">\"I believe I mentioned I don't take kindly to bullies. I can tell something happened to you, and although I'm surprised it was Honchkrow, I won't be deterred\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed. \"Thank you\" you said without much sincerity. \"Just please don't hurt him\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"What I shall do is none of your concern. Just trust me, you shall be safe from now on\"</span> he scraped his claws against the floorboards, leaving more gouges on the wood. \"<span class=\"cmagenta\">You should tell me what he did to you\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to talk about it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"It was <i>that</i> bad?\"</span> there it was once again, the sympathy in his voice. He must have gone through some rough experiences in the past, you supposed. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\"I won't force you to tell me, don't worry about that\" </span>You briefly wonder if he would even believe you. Maybe you're lucky he's blind and can't see you're a human. It makes this much simpler if he thinks you're a small bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the ear near you twitches. You don't notice anything, but Nidoking seems to have heard something, because he walks to the entrance to his room, and looks up the stairway. At the top, with a fork in his beak, was Honchkrow, looking around, undoubtedly looking for you and wondering where you were. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\"You\" </span>he said. Honchkrow squaked and turned around, passing the fork to one of his talons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Oh, h-hello! I hope I didn't wake you up!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"You didn't. I was waiting for you. There's something we need to talk about\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were hiding behind Nidoking's horn, but even from that point you saw how Honchkrow's eyes turned into pinpricks.<span class=\"cnavy\"> \"Really? Can it wait? I spent the entire day flying around, I'm not sure if-\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"If you know what's good for you you will come here right now\"</span> without awaiting reply, Nidoking walked back into his room, settling on the center. It didn't take long for Honchkrow to fly into the room, having decided making Nidoking upset would be a bad choice. You heard him swallow nervously.<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\"><br>\r\n\"I'm here\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Do you know why I'd like to talk to you?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"H-Honestly I'm not sure why\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Back then, when you and everyone else in your flock arrived, I made quite clear you would have to behave\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonchkrow seemed to relax a little, he scratched his head with the fork<span class=\"cnavy\">. \"Oh...has any of them been messing around? I will talk to them, I think I can-\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"I'm talking about you\"</span> Nidoking stepped closer. Honchkrow looked down, you had a feeling now he was starting to realize what Nidoking would be upset about.<span class=\"cmagenta\"> \"I heard you have been treating a new resident in a rather unpleasant manner, to put it lightly. Is that true?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Unpleasant...I-I didn't...\"</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\"><br>\r\n\"I also have reasons to believe it's true. Do you have anything to say in your defense?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"It's not like you're thinking!\" </span>he flapped his wings in a panic, inching towards the wall. <span class=\"cnavy\">\"I was trying to help, I swear I was trying to help!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Then why was I informed your \"help\" has caused distress to someone?\". </span>You wonder if you should have gone into detail about what happened. It was true it was a rather nasty situation, but now you didn't know what Nidoking was picturing. If you said anything, how would Honchkrow react?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for you, it seemed Nidoking had enough of a cool mind to not rush into action without giving one last chance: <span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Honchkrow, until today you were a good guest. In respect to that I will give you a chance. Admit to everything you have done today. Everything. If you try to hide anything, I won't tolerate it. If you are honest with me, I will spare your life\"</span> you felt cold all of a sudden. He would have taken such a harsh action? You hoped that was just his way of trying to scare the wits out of the crow.<span class=\"cmagenta\"> \"So tell me:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did you do?\"</span></span></div></div>",

An oversized claw snatches the bird by the neck and pins him to the ground in an wince-inducing blow.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cmagenta\">You\u2019re weak.</span>\u201d Nidoking says to the squawking bird that\u2019s struggling, flapping, and kicking beneath his claw. \u201cTo think a flock would follow you: a leader without morals and strength.\u201d Honchkrow reaches in vain for his hat that has fallen beside him.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cplum\">I\u2019m good!

Soaring through the air like a black comet, Honchkrow yelps in pain when he crashes into a wall. The impact shakes the earth like a mini earthquake as you clumsily try to back away from the impact site. The crash itself leaves a cloud of choking dust that slowly settles, cloaking the dark bird with a dusky layer of powder.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cmagenta\">You need to learn to keep your beak shut before I break it off!</span>\u201d Honchkrow cowers in a little black ball. Nidoking takes his time to march thundering steps towards the trembling bird. You hear skittering and confused chattering from behind the walls and in every direction as Pokemon scatter in every direction away from this room. It seems everyone is now awake \u2014 and wise enough to stay far, far away.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This is getting to be far too much for you.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHey!\u201d you shout at the top of your miniscule lungs, \u201cstop it!

I hate bullies and now \u2014 I hate you.</span>\u201d Nidoking reaches down to pick up Honchkrow. He fumbles at first but quickly corrects himself and clutches the crow by back, suspended at eye-level. Honchkrow has no choice but to look Nidoking in eyes and let his stinking breath wash over him and weave its way through his feathers.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cmagenta\">I thought you were a well-intentioned fool.

I hope no one remembers you.</span>\u201d Nidoking shoves Honchkrow into his jaws.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0No! You remain speechless in horror while your mind screams. Nidoking stuffs his cheeks with your former feathered friend. Honchkrow puts up a weak struggle, exhausted from his earlier flights and recent beatdown. Adrenaline gives him the strength for a few frenzied flaps but he quickly tires and falls limp in a pitiable lump.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nidoking lowers his head parallel with the ground. For the brief moment he does this, slobber slithers down Honchkrow\u2019s twitching body. Gravity slips the bird a few inches toward freedom but then Nidoking raises his head skyward. Honchkrow\u2019s body slides down Nidoking\u2019s mouth and into his throat like a fluid motion, like a greased up turkey in a slippery slide.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You watch as Honchkrow, now an indistinct bulge in Nidoking\u2019s purple neck, is compressed by the Pokemon\u2019s powerful throat muscles. A muffled cry of horror (or is it pain? Betrayal?) is all that escapes the beginning of Nidoking\u2019s digestive system. Soon enough, Honchkrow descends past his collarbone \u2014 and disappears. Not even a bulge graces Nidoking\u2019s pale belly. Indistinct, muted speech emanates from within; muffled splashes and sloshes sound the crow\u2019s feeble attempts to resist.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You find the courage to speak.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do that to him!\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nidoking tongue clicks satisfactorily. He pulls a feather from between his teeth and turns to you.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cmagenta\">Do what to who now?</span>\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHonchkrow!\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cmagenta\">Hmm, doesn\u2019t ring a bell.</span>\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A gurgling cry from within the Poison-type\u2019s belly.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou just ate him.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cmagenta\">Did I now?

I don\u2019t bother to remember ruffians and rogues.</span>\u201d Nidoking does another of his dark chuckles. \u201c<span class=\"cmagenta\">Don\u2019t you worry bug. This bad egg will be an omelette by the end of next night. By that, I mean dead. Digested.</span>\u201d Nidoking pauses as he holds a clenched claw to his face before letting out a toxic-stenched belch. \u201c<span class=\"cmagenta\">Please pardon my manners. <i>It</i> might only last to the end of tonight if it keeps getting on my nerves. Rest assured, it won\u2019t be badgering anyone anymore.</span>\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIsn\u2019t that too much?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nidoking...smiles? That\u2019s the closest emotion you can gleam from the twisted shape of the Pokemon\u2019s weathered maw.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cmagenta\">You\u2019ve got a big heart in that little body, bug. This bird doesn\u2019t deserve it.</span>\u201d Nidoking\u2019s expression saddens a bit, \u201cI\u2019m not even sure I deserve it. Go find someone else who does.\u201d With that, Nidoking sits down and blindly reaches beside him. By happenstance he finds Honchkrow's abandoned hat.<br>\r\nNidoking frowns. He takes two claws and casually rips the hat in half down the middle before resuming his search. He finds a femur of a creature unknown then chews on the bone absentmindedly, \u201c<span class=\"cmagenta\">feel free to sleep in my bed for the night. I will rest on the floor.</span>\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0What to do? Is it even possible to convince Nidoking to spare Honchkrow\u2019s life? Is it worth it to you?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You don't have to think it much: you don't want to be near the Pokemon that ate Honchkrow right in front of you. You also didn't dare to say that to Nidoking's face, even though you felt he wouldn't try to hurt you. As soon as Nidoking fell asleep and started snoring, you got up from his bed, and walked to the door that led to the outside. The evening air was brisk, cool, cleansing. The moon was shining high in the sky. Honchkrow was gone, but Nidoking still existed in the manor. You didn't want to stick around anymore. With a heavy heart, you decide to brave the dangers outside. <i>Rest in peace, Honchkrow</i>. He didn't deserve such a fate, even though he had treated you so badly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the forest in the middle of the night was scary, but you gathered your courage and ran into it. You hoped to find a fallen log or any similar place to seek shelter in for the night, and when morning comes, you'd think of what else to do. A couple hours pass while you search for a good resting spot. The moonlight is bright enough to show you the ground of the forest, and thanks to it you're able to avoid any Pokemon in your path. That was the one good thing your size had -- it was easier to be stealthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you felt the ground beneath you tremor. An earthquake! You yelp and run to the base of a tree, but soon you realize it's not an earthquake. You can see many small Pokemon running through the trees, scattering in many directions, like they're...running away from something? A lot of Pokemon had to be running to make the ground shake like that! One of the Pokemon runs towards where you're standing, terrified, and hides behind the tree. They're so close you can see they're trembling and breathing quickly, gasping for air. You recognize the gray Pokemon as a Mincinno. \"Uh, is everything fine?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mincinno looks at you with surprise, not having seen you before, and shakes their head. <span class=\"clgrey\">\"They're coming!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is coming?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"The..the...you seriously don't know?\"</span> you inform them you don't know what they're scared about. Looking around like they expected something awful to appeal soon, the Mincinno gives you a hurried explanation:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"Around here there's a ravenous, hungry Pokemon that eats everything that gets in its way! Some call it the Beast, and I heard it's coming to this part of the forest!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh. That sounded rather bad for you! You were small and certainly very edible to anything that wanted to have you as a snack. You hoped your diminutive size would make you unappetizing. You square up, trying to not look as fearful as you actually felt. \"Okay, I see. How does this Pokemon look like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"...um...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What species is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"I...don't know...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at the Mincinno in disbelief. \"What do you mean you don't know? Someone must have seen it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"Everyone who has seen it gets gobbled up, obviously!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo you this whole hubbub about the Beast was starting to sound like a rumor, something blown out of proportion. \"So you don't even know what you're running from? Couldn't it be just a random big herbivore or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"It could be a predatory herbivore!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds kind of contradictory\" you said. This was starting to sound ridiculous. This Mincinno couldn't even confirm the fearsome, horrible Pokemon they were running from was a predator or anything like that! Mincinno opened their maw to explain more, but a noise like the crunch of sticks got its attention. It was so loud even you heard it. Something was clear: there was <i>something</i> coming your way. The Mincinno stepped back from the tree, brown eyes wide open, and started running away again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"Hiiiide!\"</span> they wail, leaving you behind. Right afterwards, you heard the rustling of leaves. Something was right there! And you were standing right by a tree, in plain sight. A quick glance around showed no hiding spots, you had the bad luck of standing right in the middle of a barren clearing. You stood out like a neon sign, now that you thought about it. The rustling got even closer, you wouldn't even have time to run into the forest to hide!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the few seconds that remained before the so-called Beast appeared, many thoughts crossed your mind. Maybe that rumor about the Beast was just that, a rumor. It was hard to think absolutely nobody knew how it even looked like! Rumors had its way of growing in size and twisting until it barely resembled how it started, it was possible this \"Beast\" was no more than a kind Pokemon who was getting slandered around. It may even not be a predator! For a moment the fleeting mental image of a Mareep  so big it reached the treetops flashed in your mind. You basked in the amusement that mental image brought you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand...what if there really was a reason to be afraid? What if that Beast indeed was a voracious Pokemon who caused a widespread reign of terror? You didn't want to think about Pokemon being devoured. True, it was an unavoidable part of life in the wilderness for Pokemon, but after witnessing Nidoking eating Honchkrow...it felt like a sore spot. It'd take some time before you could leave that particular memory behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long you can see a silhouette among the trees, getting closer and closer. Griped by a sudden fear, you start running across the clearing. Literally any Pokemon would be bigger than you, Beast or not! But given your size, you don't reach the other end of the clearing. You're standing right in middle of it, in plain sight, when the Pokemon steps onto the edge of the clearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...I hope I'm not doomed...</i></span></div></div>",

It heard you.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tWhat is it? What could it be? What do you do? Your mind scrambles to decide what to do, juggling a baker\u2019s dozen of half-baked plans.

The faint starlight shines just bright enough\u2014letting you see the long, dark passage of his hungry throat, quivering from the force of the escaping wind. A strand of saliva, stretching from the bottom of his mouth to his pointy canine, pops in a splatting \u2018splosion of spittle.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tFurret recomposes, watching you wince\u2014sprinkled in saliva.<span class=\"cdorange\"> \u201cMy, oh, my.

Can\u2019t you tell?\u201d</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u201cUh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tFurret burps\u2014just a small one. He opens his mouth just enough to let a black-and-white Fletchling tailfeather flutter out from his mouth. The smell that creeps from his maw bespoke a foul fate.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cMmm. I forgot about them.\u201d</span> Furret admits with the amount of care of someone noticing an untied shoelace. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cAnyway, I want those Minccino. They\u2019re fast, but wondrously naive. Lure a few out for me. Tell them it's safe. Then I\u2019ll let you go. Maybe.\u201d</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tYou gawk at Furret. Your disgust is plain on your face. \u201cI\u2019m not tricking those Minccino into being your supper!\u201d Furret clicks his tongue.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cWell, I suppose I could just snack on you instead.\u201d</span> You try to back away, but find your back pressed against a fuzzy wall as you nearly vanish in the monster\u2019s hairs. A scary-sounding grumble rumbles from deep within Furret\u2019s stomach.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cYou know, I think that Fletchling might still be kicking in there.\u201d</span> Furret says, grinning as he watches you squirm in discomfort. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cKey words: might be. Not quite sure. It could just be their ghost trying to give me indigestion.\u201d</span> Furret laughs cruelly as a sick revulsion pools in the pit of your belly.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cWho knows!\"</span> Furret says. <span class=\"cdorange\">\"If you\u2019re not up for this job, maybe you can play the hero and save the poor birdy!\u201d</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tWith Furret casting you in dark shadow from the moon\u2019s glow, you make your decision...</span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The tailfeather lying near you only brings something very familiar to mind. Looking at Furret, for a moment you flash back to Nidoking and Honchkrow. There in front of you was a large Pokemon who ate a bird and was now presumably digesting it. The memory fades right away when you realize Furret is worse: Furret wasn't eating a Pokemon who had hurt you. Furret was asking you to go fool a few innocent Pokemon so he can feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I'm not helping you!\" you yell. You're surprised by how loud your voice can be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurret gives you the good ol' puppy eyes. <span class=\"cdorange\">\"Why not? That's the circle of life, 'mons eat other 'mons\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't just eating for food, you're...eating for fun, or something! That's just wrong, you can't do that! Are you even supposed to be eating meat?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\"Rattatas are a staple food in any self-respecting Furret's diet, if you're wondering that\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, fine, but this is far more than any random Rattata\" you glare at him. \"You have been eating so many Pokemon they're all scared of you! You're <i>evi</i>l!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurret's ears went flat on his head, while he stared at you bemusedly. His face slowly got closer to you. <span class=\"cdorange\">\"That was quite the speech. If only you were as big as your morality seems to be, you would fill me up for days\"</span> You hadn't expected to convince Furret to change his ways, but it made you shiver with fear anyway. <span class=\"cdorange\">\"I guess this means you're not helping me. That's fine\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...you're not letting me go, are you?\" your shoulders slumped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\"Do me a favor and get digested. You can do that much for me\"</span> he says before lunging at you. Having some of Furret's body behind you, like a predatory snake cornering you, there was no place for you to run. Before you can even blink half of your body is enveloped into Furret's mouth. The tip of his tongue hits your face, slobber slathering you, before your world turns upside down. Suddenly you're airborne, making a flip in the air, Furret's open maw underneath you. Not only he was going to eat you, he also had to be tossing you in the air like the prey you were now! The world freezes for a moment before you freefall, straight into Furret's jaws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe impact is like hitting a very wet trampoline. Instinctively you try to grapple what you hit -- the tongue, you realize belatedly, but you can't do it, it's too slippery for you to grab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\"By the way, if that Fletchling is still alive, say hi for me. Don't worry, you're so small there's plenty of space for you two!</span>\" Furret says, giving you a good jostle with his tongue. His gentle-sounding voice contrasts with the nasty intent in his words, so much you have to wonder how he can be doing this and not feel grossed out with himself. This time you manage to grab onto the tongue but, Furret sensing you had done that, you're lifted high until you crash against his hard palate. Not wanting to be smothered between the tongue and the palate, you let go. That was your mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he felt you had let go, Furret tilts his tongue backwards, funneling you towards his throat. You slide while you're still dazed, your body scraping against the rough papillae underneath you, until you fall into the gaping pit of the throat. You barely notice the esophagus cradling you, carrying you deeper into the Furret's body, until you feel your feet touch something. That something slowly opens up, giving you access. A strong, acidic and foreboding smell envelopes you even before you enter the stomach -- clearly the chamber is hard at work right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way...\" you mutter, once your head crosses the threshold and you fall. You expect to crash into a pool of acids, but instead you fall onto something else. You blearily touch around. This feels like...feathers. A lot of very wet feathers. What it means hits you immediately when you remember you're not supposed to be the only resident in Furret's stomach right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit up immediately, your heart beating a hundred miles per hour. You can see...not very well, but you can faintly see, your eyes adapting to the darkness. The walls of the stomach are moving a lot, stirring the stew, and Furret's walking does that as well. Furret didn't even say a word to you. You're just a bitesized prey for him. Beneath you there are a lot of gray feathers, and you're somewhat glad to find out it's not a pile -- it's a body. A feathered body, Fletchling. You get onto your hands and knees and crawl in direction of where you see the head is. Thankfully, Fletchling's head is over the surface of the belly juices. Their eyes are closed, and their beak is half-open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\"Hey. Fletchling! Come on, you'll be...fine!</span>\" you whisper, unsure if you should raise your voice. You don't want Furret to hear you. <span class=\"cdorange\">\"Fletchling!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo response. <i>No, no, please don't be dead!</i> you plead. You don't even know Fletchling, but your empathy is making you worry for their sake. You didn't do a thing about Honchkrow. Now you were in a similar situation, and to tell the truth, you didn't want to make the same mistake. Not if you could do something about it, for someone who is innocent!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put your ear against the soaked feathers of Fletchling's back, trying to listen inside. You want to find out if they're still alive! There, you hear it: a heartbeat. You feel your own heart on your throat when you realize Fletchling's heartbeat is way slower than it should be. Their breathing is also very labored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFletchling is on the verge of death. You don't want to find out how things are like underneath the surface of the acids. The mental image of a corroded bird grips you, you hope the fact Fletchling is alive means they haven't suffered much physical damage yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'll help you. I'll...think of something, I promise\" you whisper, patting Fletchling's back. How careless of you, promising such a thing. Merely breathing the air inside Furret's stomach is painful, you feel your nose tingling. It's bothersome, but it's a reminder you're in the middle of a sac of acid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's some space around. Fletchling is small, there's enough space to accomodate at least six of them. You can see the pool of acid extending from wall to wall, greenish liquids that sway and make waves. You really don't want to fall in that -- you survived Noibat, you hope that means you're hard to break down. Still, you sure would rather not to find out the hard way if you're more vulnerable than you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was your situation now. A daunting task laid ahead of you, and you...you had to think. Think! How do you save not only yourself, but also a bird? Even though Fletchling is small, they're still many times your size! At least it seemed you had an advantage: Furret wasn't bothering to keep track of what was going on in his stomach. Your predator's cockiness was something you hoped would continue happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it's only a matter of think something to do, and fast...!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The pitter-patter of Furret's steps along with the slithering of his long, noodly body cook up quite the storm. The slop sloshes side-to-side, slathering the walls of his belly with acrid slush. The stomach itself undulates, ever-moving, churning the chemical vat below. Flecks of slurry are flung into the air and dribble back down in acid rain. All the while, Furret\u2019s belly keeps on making the horrible sounds of digestion.<i> Glorp, glop, slorsh\u2026 Glip, glap, grumble...</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The acidic fumes are overbearing, setting fire to your nostrils. And the heat\u2014by goodness the heat! It\u2019s boiling! And the humid, sweltering air presses down on you as a 100lb weight, making you feel like Atlas: holding the weight of all the world on your back.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But the heaviest burden of all is that of Fletchling's. If you can't think of a way out of here, they're going to be nothing but goo. Just thinking about it makes your blood run cold!<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But how in the world are you going to get out of here!?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Going up is impossible. And you don\u2019t even know where to begin in making Furret have an upset belly. You even consider taking the\u2026 scenic route. But you\u2019re not sure if Fletchling could fit! And even if they could, how would you push them in there?<br>\r\nThat left only one option.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHey! Furret!\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0No answer. The muck of his stomach burbles like a hot mud bath.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cFurret! I know you can hear me!\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Still no answer. In the dead silence that follows, you hear Fletchling wheeze a raspy rattle. Your chest is instantly gripped in an iron vice.<i> No, no, no!</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<i>Please,</i> Furret! Come on! Listen to me! Just\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Abruptly the stomach seizes. The formerly-cavernous space quickly crunches in, surging the marshy, quaggy sea up over your head. The digestive soup swallows you, the entire chamber now squashed to far-too-small size. You bellow in the broth as the wet muscled ceiling forces you under the tide, mashing you against the bird Pokemon\u2019s sodden-down chest. The vile belly juices slather your skin and plaster your hair. You try to form words, pleadings to Furret, but your words are lost in the soup.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And then Furret releases. His stomach sags back into a relaxed position. You flop back onto your feathery liferaft. You can\u2019t help but cough and sputter, racking your lungs and rasping your throat. And throughout it all, one thought is on your mind:<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He did that on purpose!<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You reclaim your breath\u2014just in time to shout one last pleading to your devourer.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know what I have to do\u2014what I have to say! Just save Fletchling! I\u2019ll do anything!\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The moment the words leave your mouth, you already regret it. Especially when things get far too quiet. The rapping of his footsteps silence\u2014Furret stops. All you hear is his breathing, great bellows of wind, and the all-encompassing drum of his heart\u2014distant thunder. Your own heartbeat begins to pound in your ears as your mouth goes dry and your throat grows tight. The gurgling and growling of his stomach grows ever-louder in the silence.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Squalid waves crash into you again as he stomach tilts to the side, sweeping you and Fletchling away. The bird tumbles in the stew, spinning and flopping. Rolling over limply as they are lapped by beating waves, Fletchling\u2019s peeps a half-conscious squeak as they toss and turn. You grip the bird\u2019s feathers, bleached by the digestive acids, and hold on for dear life. You\u2019re dunked under the waves as Fletchling flops. The sheer force of the waves threatens to peel you off, but by luck, you manage to hold on. Now on the former side, now floor of Furret\u2019s gut, you smush yourself against the bird\u2019s down as you watch the tumultuous waters of the predator\u2019s stomach settle.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0At last, a silky-smooth voice drifts through the hellish air. Along with a\u2026 spattering of water?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cAhh~.\u201d</span> Furret sighs with relief.<span class=\"cdorange\"> \u201cWas holding that in for a while\u2026\u201d</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your face grows beet-red. He can\u2019t be\u2014!<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The gush-and-splatter of liquid slows to a trickle before Furret\u2019s stomach pitches back to its original orientation, mopping you along with the contents of his belly. When the dust settles, you\u2019re back where you started\u2014only a little more humiliated.<br>\r\n<i>He\u2026 he didn\u2019t hear me at all\u2026 </i>You feel your heart drop like an iron ball. <i>We really are nothing but food to him\u2026</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It would be lying to say you didn\u2019t cry. But because of your black thought:<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>I don\u2019t know how to save them.</i> You look down at Fletchling. They\u2019re barely moving, but you don\u2019t even know if they\u2019re alive anymore. It could just be the bobbing of the waves.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And then, you hear a noise. A burbling, gurgling, draining sound that reminded you of a shower drain. You didn\u2019t connect the dots until you notice the slop level slowly lowering. Furret\u2019s belly-stuff is leaving.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You gaze into the dark pool, then back at Fletchling. <i>There\u2019s nothing you can do\u2026 </i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You don\u2019t remember plopping into the slosh, but next you knew, you find yourself in the middle of it all. An inescapable force sucks you downward, drinking you deeper to the bottom of Furret\u2019s sloppy belly.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Down,<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Down,<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Down.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You plow through well-digested muck as you submerge, head-first, the blood rushing to your head. The tingle of acids prick your skin the same way Pop-rocks fizz in your mouth\u2014a harmless feeling, but an unnerving one. A great pressure bears down around you, as if you passed through an unseen porticule. And shortly thereafter, you\u2019re in free fall: ejected from duodenum behind. You\u2019re sputtered out with a gushing of sludge, plummeting toward the ground like someone\u2019s spat up drink. And when you land, it\u2019s in roily water\u2014filthy and yellowed.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You burst to the surface and greedily gulp stained air. Little tubes cover the passage for as far as you can see. The hideous fluid plashes against the protuberances as the passage slightly writhes, stirring the broth within. All the while, the wibble-wobble of Furret\u2019s now restarted gait causes the entire tubing to rock like a baby\u2019s cradle.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And as if you couldn\u2019t feel any more horrible, Furret begins to softly hum an upbeat tune, filling the small intestine with its mirthful melody.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The flow of belly slop behind you starts to diminish. One breath later, it stops. You\u2019re all alone in the depths of the meat-eater\u2019s tubing.<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\u25d3 \u25d3 \u25d3</div><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You\u2019ve never felt crappier.

He lounges, bounds around, sings some songs, but worst of all\u2014he hunts. Every time he pounces, pinning some poor Pokemon to the ground\u2014you feel like your soul is being ripped in half. You can still hear them\u2026<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cpink\">\u201cNo!\u201d</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"clkhaki\">\u201cGet awa\u2014\u201d</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cHelp!\u201d</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You didn\u2019t know what was worse.

If it wasn't because you felt so much revulsion towards him, you'd think he was pretty damn cute. \"What do you want?!\" you yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\"Nothing! Right now. I should be the one upset here, you couldn't even get digested like I asked you to. You're serious about not wanting to do anything for me\"</span> Furret sighs. <span class=\"cdorange\">\"But I'll deal with that later. Right now I have other things to do\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? Like eating half of the forest's population?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\"It's called having a varied diet, snacko! So I thought I should stick around to give you a word or two before I leave for now\" </span>Furret sniffs you for a moment. <span class=\"cdorange\">\"Oh yes, this worked. You smell just like me\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure what to expect, you give yourself a cautious check. Indeed, you have a rather unusual scent on you. It reminds you of one time you stuck your face onto a stuffed Pokemon plush toy you once had, just that much stronger. It's nothing close to how you expected to smell after having passed through Furret's digestive system. \"What...how did you do this?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\"Do you really want to know?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn second thought...maybe not. A series of unpleasant scenarios cross your mind, ranging from the harmless to the humiliating. You decide ignorance is bliss. \"No, thanks. Now what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\"You do whatever you want to do, I don't mind. I'll find you later through my own scent. Could be tomorrow, or in a week, or maybe in just a couple hours. I dunno. And when I do...we can mess around some more\"</span> You don't want to know what exactly is Furret's concept of 'messing around'. You're sure you won't have any fun. <span class=\"cdorange\">\"You turned out to be the most interesting thing in a while, what with not being digested and also being so small. I figure there's more stuff we can do together\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to do anything with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\"Aw, but it's like we're pals now! Or at least I'm counting you as one. Just maybe ranking lower than the rest\"</span> What a honor. <span class=\"cdorange\">\"I'm leaving now. Don't die, okay? I hope to have some fun with you later!\"</span> he says as a farewell, running among the trees. There goes Furret, to continue wrecking terror through this area of the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you can do for a moment is glare in the direction where Furret left. He didn't even say a word about any of the Pokemon he had eaten before and after you, all he cared about was getting to have fun with you later. Somehow, you had risen above the rank of 'prey', and into the dubious rank of 'pal'. Rage and frustration boils inside you, you shout a few profanities, letting steam out. For a while all you do is stomp around on the rock, until you feel all the energy leave you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe...maybe leaving the abandoned manor was a mistake. You're in a lot of trouble now. You're not sure you'd be able to find the manor anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"...umm...are you...done?\"</span> a meek voice asks you. You turn around, startled, and see a Mincinno. Is that the same one that had warned you about the Beast? <span class=\"clgrey\">\"So that's the Beast? He looks...less scary than I expected...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? Well let me tell you: the rumors are true. He's eating 'mons left and right\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMincinno would hide behind their own tail if they could. <span class=\"clgrey\">\"I knew it! I knew it was true! But...you survived? I know you did. I saw Furret...uh...let you out?\"</span>. You're glad you were sleeping when you were expelled from his body. <span class=\"clgrey\">\"And then he took you and went to wash you off. I'm not sure it's good he's interested in you\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to accept it just like that! There must be something I can do!\" you're so full of frustration you're seriously considering revenge. The horrors of Furret's stomach could only be understood once you witnessed a harmless Pokemon get digested inside. Now that you think about it...Fletchlings and its evolutions aren't common in this part of the world, no? Maybe you could find one and tell them what Furret did. You ask Mincinno if they know about them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMincinno's brown eyes light up. <span class=\"clgrey\">\"Not too far from here there's a red tree! That's where Talonflame and Fletchling live in their nests. They're siblings, Fletchling is the elder but you'd never guess because they never wanted to evolve. Why do you ask?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think this Talonflame would want to talk with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"I...guess...? Talonflame is kind of...super protective, though? So if you talk to them...try not to let them get attached to you\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuper protective, huh. Good! As you saw it, if the Fletchling Furret ate was Talonflame's sibling, then that big falcon would have a reason to go after Furret. It'd be justice, you think. All you wanted was for someone to go after Furret and give him what he deserved! Surely the forest had to have strong Pokemon who would want to take action against Furret!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you had to do was find one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"Wow, when I look at you you look just like a tiny little human\"</span> they say. Looks like your size makes everyone around here think you're just a human-looking bug, you guess. <span class=\"clgrey\">\"Why are you asking? Are you...wait, I know what you're thinking!\" </span>Mincinno gets closer, climbing the rock to get close to you. \"<span class=\"clgrey\">You want revenge because Furret ate you!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaive as Mincinno was, at least they were somewhat observant. \"Something like that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"No, no, you shouldn't! That's not going to end well for you or for anyone! Please, don't do that!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clench your fists. \"There must be something I can do! Look, in the time I was inside Furret I'm aware at least four Pokemon got eaten. That's just wrong!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"I-I-I guess...but instead of going after him you could...maybe seek safety?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Safety?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"Yes, other Pokemon you can stick with. Hey, why don't you stay with my group?\"</span> Mincinno suggests. They sound so earnest you can't bring yourself to reject such proposition immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean other Mincinno?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"Oh. Oh, no, not really...I'm not part of any of those. A few friends and I travel around and...generally try to not get in anyone's way. They're all so cool, you'd love them</span>\" Mincinno extended a paw towards you. <span class=\"clgrey\">\"You wouldn't ever guess what they are!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if I should...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"It's...better than going after Furret, right? And maybe if you stick with us he'll think twice before coming for you again. Just...please, please join us. For your sake, so you're safe!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel Mincinno is begging you so you wouldn't go down the probably dangerous path of revenge, instead of because they think you'd be safe with their group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to make your choice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could either do everything in your power to get somebody to fight Furret, you were sure you could find any Pokemon who'd want to do it. Talonflame seemed to be your best option, thanks to their possible relation to Fletchling and because you knew where to find them, but you were sure you could pick a direction, walk, and find a strong Pokemon to fight Furret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr you could go with Mincinno and try to forget your desire for revenge. Stick with Mincinno and their friends, hope for the best, and dread the moment Furret decided to find you again. You'd be safe, but the threat of Furret playing with you again would still be present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep breath, weighing your options in your head with a clear mind. You're not entirely sure if you're making the right choice, but you tell Mincinno what you want to do.</span></div></div>",

You packed up your non-existent belongings and hurried off into the forest\u2014but not before saying your goodbyes to the teary-eyed chinchilla.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You weave between blades of grass, clamber over wood chips and stumps, and rush into the underbrush whenever you hear the stomping footsteps of a giant Pokemon nearby. With every footfall, your heart leaps in your chest. Your bones rattle with thunderous vibrations. And whenever those gargantuan creatures crash their stompers right in front of you, inches away, you whisper a silent prayer under your breath. If they see you, it's over. Even if you survive another 'Mon's digestive system, you'll be lost\u2014with no way compass to point you the way toward the fire bird's nest.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Fortune smiles upon you. Every scary-sounding creature clomps away, you not daring to leave until their stompings echo into nothing. You confidently heed Minccino's directions, stowing your unease over the possibility of you being lost. The clawed tree, the half-leaved bush, the sky-scraping pine\u2014yes! These are the landmarks Minccino told you. There's no question: you're on track.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You slap away the leafy fingers of the brush, peeling them apart to reveal a magnificent sight. A great oak, with a trunk thicker than a Machoke's neck, and with branches that extend far and wide\u2014with a million rustling leaves. Looking up into the orange evening sky, you see that the oak is home to a great menagerie of life. Just from a glance alone, you see Rowlet, Burmy, Pidgeotto, and even a Noctowl just rousing from its slumber. You make your way closer, in awe of the picturesque sight.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But you stop. You notice a something strange.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Stationed near the base of the tree, its body massive and powerful, is a grumpy-looking Stoutland\u2014male. Resting on his belly, he keeps a half-lidded eye out. And in front of the great creature is a single-file line of Pokemon, waiting patiently, looking up at the Pokemon atop Stoutland's back.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It's a Smeargle. Speaking with a high-class cadence and affected accent, he addresses the first 'Mon in line: an overcast Cherrim.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"ctan\">\"Good evening, good Cherrim.\"</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cplum\">\"Hello...\"</span> the Grass-type mumbles.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"ctan\">\"You wish to enter, yes?\"</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cplum\">\"Mm-hmm...\"</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"ctan\">\"Would you mind showing me your identification mark?\"</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Cherrim slowly peels through the veil of their petals. Painted on the downcast body of the Pokemon is a small scribbled mark\u2014inked in the same color as the Smeargle's paint.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"ctan\">\"Very good. Welcome home!\"</span> Smeargle waves the Pokemon on; the Cherrim waddles behind the oak, out of view. <i>Where did they go?</i> You think to yourself. Is there a passage behind the oak? Does it lead into the trunk? Under its roots?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The next Pokemon in line walks up. It's a Metapod.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"ctan\">\"Good evening, good Metapod.\"</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cgreen\">\"Mmmph.\"</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"ctan\">\"You look as if you want to enter. But from a cursory look at your body, I don't see your mark.\"</span> Smeargle clicks his tongue rudely.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cgreen\">\"Mm-mph.\"</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"ctan\">\"Well then, I'm sorry to say I cannot grant you passage. The exit is that way.\"</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cgreen\">\"<i>Mph</i>!\"</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"ctan\">\"You had your mark as a Caterpie? And your shell is covering now that you're evolved? How unfortunate! You still don't have a mark, though. Run along, now.\"</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cgreen\">\"Mhm-mm.\"</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Smeargle huffs, losing a bit of his cool. <span class=\"ctan\">\"Look\u2014if I let you in, any schmuck without a mark is going to want to come barging in. And if one of those unknown Pokemon happen to be a predator, every one of the Pokemon in this tree is suddenly in mortal danger.\"</span> Smeargle puffs his cheeks.<span class=\"ctan\"> \"And also I would be out of a job. Now get out of here before I order Stoutland to detain you! Trust me\u2014it <i>won't </i>be pleasant!\"</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0At this, the Metapod blanches and quickly hops their way out of line.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As Smeargle greets the next 'Mon in line, you rub your chin in thought. You don't have an \"identification mark\", but you could always try to snag a spot in line and try to convince Smeargle to let you in\u2014or even just to send a message up to Talonflame!<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Or your could try and sneak around back. That Cherrim had to have went somewhere, given they couldn't fly. Problem is, you'd be blindly searching the place without an alibi of if anyone questions why you're there...<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Or maybe\u2014just maybe\u2014you could hitch a ride on another Pokemon! You could ask them or sneak on yourself. Either way, all you need to do is avoid Smeargle's watchful eye. It doesn't look like Stoutland's paying all that much attention, anyway.</span></span></div></div>",

That's just getting yourself into troble gratuitously, and frankly, you really don't think anyone here would give you a lift. Not if it meant getting caught by Smeargle. No, you decided it'd be better to sneak around back. There had to be a way in, no? You stepped back away from the queue, deciding to walk around, no matter how long it took you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty minutes later, you were close to the other side of the tree. You couldn't see the guardian dogs anymore, although the queue was still visible. Slowly, you walked out of the underbrush, ready to approach your target and seek an entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou barely had walked half a meter when you heard the sound of wings, and then something pushing you roughly back into the underbrush. You roll ungracefully until you stop into a pile of leaves, dizzy and with all sorts of aches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"Be careful! You could be seen if you step out there!\" </span>a voice, way louder than it had any right to be, startled you. You rub your head, looking up at whatever kooky 'mon had decided to make your life a mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiterally any Pokemon is a giant when compared to you -- and this one was no exception, but you could notice it wasn't one of the larger species. While you were smaller than even one of its talons, the bird wasn't as imposing as, say, Honchkrow. Chatots weren't really what you imagined when you thought about intimidating birds, and maybe that was what got you to relax quicker than you usually would. \"You saw me...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"Of course I did! What are you trying to do?\"</span> it asked. They didn't sound upset, just curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou consider for a moment how much you should tell. \"I'm trying to visit someone in there\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"And you don't have a mark?\" </span>they asked. You couldn't discern their gender, their voice made it rather difficult. You admit you don't. Chatot flaps their wings. <span class=\"clblue\">\"That's no good! If anyone catches you you'll be kicked out!\"</span> Nothing you weren't aware of already, really. You were about to stress how important if was for you to enter the tree, when Chatot added: <span class=\"clblue\">\"So let me help you. I can help you!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...you can? How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"We bird Pokemon can go in anytime we want. Getting checked is like a code of honor thing!\"</span> That made some sense to you. Smeargle didn't have any way to check any flying Pokemon that didn't land and go into the queue, you guessed. <span class=\"clblue\">\"I can take you straight to the treetops!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you...you don't mind that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChatot laughed. <span class=\"clblue\">\"Of course not! You're so small and so strange. You wouldn't harm anyone\"</span> It seemed Chatot was naive, but they weren't wrong, and this was your best chance to get in there. You didn't have to mull it for long before you accepted. <span class=\"clblue\">\"Now I just have to carry you somehow up there. You're too small for my talons, so...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh. There it was coming. After your experience with Honchkrow, you were kind of expecting this. What was it back then? Be gobbled up, or be shoved into the bird's butt? Better cut that short and make your choice right away, you figured. After what happened with Honchkrow, you weren't looking forward to getting involved with any bird's cloaca. Time to get eaten! You open your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"...I guess you'll have to get on my back\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown, confused. \"Wait, really? That's an option?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"Sure! It's from here to the treetop up there. That's just a minute or two of flying, you should be able to hold onto me that long! Right?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Right, I just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChatot tilted their head, a bit puzzled. <span class=\"clblue\">\"Were you thinking of a different idea?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not really\" you said immediately. You weren't going to give the parrot any weird ideas!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing up Chatot's back was harder than you both thought it'd be. They had to position themselves into a rather uncomfortable position so you would be able to climb onto their tailfeathers, right to the base of the longer feathers forming its tail. Slowly, you manage to climb upwards, grabbing feathers much larger than yourself, pulling yourself upwards. Once you were close to the parrot's neck and you were holding as strongly as you could -- holding onto those feathers was almost impossible, admittedly -- you decided it was time to fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"Don't let go!\"</span> Chatot said to you, starting the flight. You almost fell right away, swooped away by the wind, but you held onto the feathers at the last moment. No wonder you had to be stored inside the bird for longer distances! This was incredibly dangerous! The treetop got closer and closer, until you and your feathery carriage flew right into it, entering a maze of branches and leaves you wouldn't be able to explore by yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of the other birds paid any attention to Chatot. Good! You'd be fine, it seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"So who are you going to visit?\"</span> Chatot asked, gliding through the branches. You tell Chatot you planned to talk to Talonflame. Chatot look around to orientate themselves before saying: <span class=\"clblue\">\"Oh. You're late. Talonflame left the tree just a few hours ago\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"They said they had something to do, and vacated the place! Too bad\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were too late. Getting into the tree would have been pointless. You risked this...you even managed to find a way in...and it was moot now. Disheartened, you go silent. Your silence must have spoken volumes about how downtrodden you felt now, because Chatot said:<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\"><br>\r\n\"Since you're here why don't you hang out with me for a while?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"You're here and it's not like I have many pals to be with. And you look like you need a pal too. What do you say? Want to hang out?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chatot, I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"I have a huge stockpile of nuts, like you wouldn't believe it. Do you like nuts? I could give you as many as you want!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChatot sounded so friendly, so welcoming, you just couldn't say no. Telling them to take you down to the ground...it'd feel like you were turning your back on a Pokemon that wanted to help you out of the goodness of their heart. You would have patted Chatot's back if you weren't worried about falling down. \"Yeah, I'd like that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"Awesome! Come on, my home is right there. You'll dig it, it's--it's not amazing but it's home. Look, can you see it!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I can't\" All you could see were blue feathers you were holding onto, and black feathers upwards, from the parrot's head. Chatot landed on a place you couldn't see, you were so glad to not be flying anymore. At least this time you were outside the avian Pokemon instead of inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"Welcome!\"</span> Chatot shouted while you descended from their back. While you were getting down, you finally saw what kind of home Chatot had.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After seeing how Smeargle refused to even give Metapod the benefit of doubt, you're pretty sure he wouldn't hesitate before telling you to scram. You cannot expect him to be lenient, you figure. Sneaking into the tree or...wherever they're going is tempting, although you're worried about <i>Stoutland</i>, in that case. Smeargle was busy making sure everyone had their marks, Stoutland wasn't doing much. There was a chance he'd see you trying to get in, and the jig would be up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting a ride seemed to be the only sensible option, even though...you could be caught by both Smeargle and Stoutland, but you'd be passing right in front of them without them being none the wiser. In a way it had to be safer. You're not even sure if what you're thinking is logical -- the growing nervousness is skewing your thoughts somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere aren't that many Pokemon awaiting entrance, only five. You take a good look at them and decide to approach the one you think is least likely to try to make a meal out of you. The Bunnelby was staring forward at the tree with bored expression, the tedium of having to go through a familiar process everyday is obvious. You approach, unsure how to even ask such a favor, but you have to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bunnelby's ears swivel around, trying to locate where the voice came from. Only when they look down they see you. The rabbit's face scrunches. <span class=\"cgrey\">\"Yes? What's up?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to enter the tree but I accidentally washed my mark off. Can you help me go inside?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrey\">\"That's a very obvious lie. Smeargle's paint doesn't fade at all\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n...just what was that paint made of, then? You pinch the bridge of your nose. \"I don't mean harm, I just want to visit someone who lives in there\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrey\">\"Then ask that someone to tell Smeargle that you're allowed inside! I'm not risking getting in trouble with the guards because of you\"</span> with an exasperated huff, the Bunnelby turned their head around and refused to acknowledge you further, despite your attempts. Was Smeargly really that bad? Apparently so. It was likely everyone else would react similarly. Quickly, you return to the underbrush, reconsidering your plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsking someone nicely wasn't working. The other option...was to hitch a ride without that Pokemon knowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sky above turned from a nice orange into a beautiful purple by the time a Pokemon you could ride appeared. You had discarded many options so far. Most of the Pokemon trying to enter were unevolved, and therefore were small. True, to you they were giants anyway, but them being small meant there were less ways to hide. How could you conceal yourself into an unevolved Pokemon's fur? Even with your size you'd be visible enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, a viable Pokemon to hide on, a species you had never even heard before, but you didn't care about such details right now. A blue chameleon-like Pokemon crawled forward, moving rather slowly. Good, with how slowly it moved you'd be able to get on it. Carefully and as stealthily as you could, you reached the creature, throwing yourself onto one of its hind legs. You already have a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing a moving Pokemon is tough, but its rather low speed when moving works on your favor, and it's even easier when it has to wait on the line. The chameleon doesn't seem to notice you at all, even though you're grasping its scales as strongly as you can to keep pulling yourself up. You're glad you're not too shabby at rock climbing, it made this much easier. Soon you manage to crawl onto the Pokemon's lower back, taking a breather. All around you there's just blue scaly skin, and in the distance there's the head, still looking forward, the Pokemon unaware there's an interloper currently lounging on its lower back. Once you rested enough, you decide to get into your hiding spot -- there were only two Pokemon between the chameleon and Smeargle, you had to hurry. With that in mind, you turn around to face your target: the Pokemon's curled tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not the best hiding place, but you figure it'll help you go unnoticed -- and also won't be a problem to get off it later. You don't want to alert the 'mon you were riding it, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stay on the center of the tail, making sure not to deviate at all. It's not too difficult, thanks to your small size there's quite a distance between you and the edges of the tail. You get on all fours and start dragging yourself up the tail, to the point where the tail curls on itself. Slowly, you wedge yourself into the curl, turning around and pushing yourself on your rear until you can't go up any longer. All around you is just blue, and a rather thin sliver from where you can see the outside. It's official: you're hidden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wait isn't long. It takes just a few minutes before the Pokemon walks to where Smeargle and Stoutland are waiting. You relax, thinking it'll all go fine. The chameleon's scaly skin is surprisingly soft, and the sections of tail above you aren't pressing on you. You congratulate yourself for the comfy choice of hiding spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Good evening, good...Stoutland, which one was this?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Sobble\"</span> Stoutland says. It's the first time you hear him say a word since you have been around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Right, Sobble. Good evening. Please show me your identification mark, if you may?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Um, right\"</span> another voice joins the group -- Sobble's, you figure. An approving hum could be heard, Smeargle seemed satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"I see you're a visitor. Welcome once again. Go ahead--\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Wait.\"</span> Stoutland stops Smeargle and Sobble before any of them can finish the conversation. Suddenly he sounds alert <span class=\"cnavy\">\"Something is off\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"What? The mark doesn't lie\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"It's not that. There's some kind of scent in the air here\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's silence for a moment while you hear someone take a deep breath. <span class=\"ctan\">\"You're right. It doesn't seem familiar\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight then, you realize with horror what they could mean. Furret. Furret had ensured you'd have his scent. Surely your scent was lingering in the air, and now it was getting the guards' attention. Dang it! Even when he wasn't around, Furret was causing you trouble! Why did the guards of the tree have to be dogs? Why couldn't it be something without a good sense of smell?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"I'm sorry, did I do something wrong?\"</span> Sobble sounds rather worried, almost like they're about to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Smeargle, I have seen this Pokemon many times before. They don't have any sort of malice. Even if there's something wrong it can't be their fault\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"I know, I know. Geez.\"</span> said Smeargle. \"Stoutland, keep guard for a moment. I'll handle this. Through the sliver you were able see the bark of the tree, as well as dirt. All that is gone. All you see now is white fur -- Smeargle was right beside Sobble. <span class=\"ctan\">\"Listen, you have done nothing wrong, don't worry. No crying, last time you cried near me I had watery eyes for hours. You'll be fine\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"What's going on?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">I dunno, that's what I'll find out. Don't worry, it's routine and we'll be done right away. Follow me</span>\" he said, leading Sobble to a side, away from everyone else in the queue, at least having the decency not to badger a Pokemon right in front of others. All the time you have been holding your breath, like you're afraid Smeargle's sharp hearing would detect you that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really, really hoped Smeargle would fail to find you. You hoped he would think they were wrong, or that the scent came from somewhere else in the forest. It had been a while since you felt so nervous. With bated breath, you hear Smeargle start looking for anything odd on Sobble.</span></div></div>",

You're careful to keep yourself steady, propping yourself against Sobble's soft scales.<br>\r\nSmeargle clears his throat with a one-two cough. <span class=\"ctan\">\"<i>Ahem</i>. Sobble.\"</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"W-what?\"</span> You feel a nervous tremor wrack the shaking Pokemon. Your eyes remain glued on the curtain of white-tan fur standing right outside the small crease of the chameleon's tail.<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Would you mind unfurling your tail?\"</span><br>\r\n<i>No! Oh no!</i><br>\r\nYou're helpless as the teary Pokemon obeys. The blue spiral you're wrapped in begins to roll itself open. The sliver of light rapidly expands, bathing you in cool blues and purples of the nightime air. You cling to Sobble's scales as you're lifted high in the air. Dangling from the rounded, deep-blue tip of their tail, you're flipped upside-down as Sobble's tail completely unfurls\u2014presenting you at its tip. You're splayed out on its surface, belly to the sky and eyes locked onto an inspecting Smeargle, looking down from above.<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Ah! The culprit reveals themselves!\"</span> He sniffs once. Frowns.<span class=\"ctan\"> \"We're quite in luck that our smelly little criminal forgot to bathe themselves.\"</span><br>\r\n\"Hey!\" You blurt, standing up. You're tempted to smell your armpit. But you don't. Because that's stupid.<br>\r\nSmeargle lowers a paw down to your height. He waggles his digits impatiently. <span class=\"ctan\">\"Hop on, now. Chop chop!\"</span> You throw out your arms and plead to Painter Pokemon.<br>\r\n\"I know this looks\u2014really\u2014bad. But\u2014\"<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"No 'buts'. Hop on.\"</span><br>\r\n\"Look at me! I'm a tiny human! Aren't you surprised?\"<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Criminals come in all shapes and sizes.\"</span><br>\r\n\"Not <i>this </i>size!\"<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"<b>Quiet!</b>\"</span> Smeargle bellows. The blast of sound knocks you on your butt\u2014and causes a certain blue chameleon to start sniffling out of fright.<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Look what you did!\" </span>Smeargle furrows his eyebrows, giving you a mean look. <span class=\"ctan\">\"You made Sobble cry.\"</span><br>\r\n\"I didn't do that! You did!\" Smeargle blows hot air out his nose, dousing you in the fumes.<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Enough!\" </span>He shouts before picking up his paw and hovering it over you like a claw in a crane game. You're about to scurry away, but fail to kick yourself into gear; Smeargle pinches you between his paw. You flail your arms, trying to slap away his digits, but find your blows are cushioned by his coarse fur. He brings you up between his eyes.<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"You are <i>rude</i>!\"</span> Smeargle waggles his paint-coated tail in your direction.<span class=\"ctan\"> \"And rude criminals are the worst! Crook-Pokemon like Nickit and Murkrow at least have charisma\u2014charm! <i>Sniff, sniff.</i> You even smell a bit like a Murkrow!\"</span><br>\r\n\"I'm rude!? Go pick on someone your own size!\"<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Shut it!\"</span><br>\r\nSobble's sniffles become tears.<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Oh no\u2014ah\u2014Sobble! You're free to go!\"</span> Smeargle starts to rush away before Sobble's eye-watering tears wet the beagle's peepers. <span class=\"ctan\">\"And you, <i>speck</i>, are in so, <i>so much trouble!</i>\"</span><br>\r\nSmeargle scampers along, you dangling between his pinchers. The quickly cooling evening air whips you with windchill as you swing in the breeze. Looking ahead, you see Smeargle round the trunk of the tree. Stoutland stands sentinel at the head of the line. Only a few Pokemon remain\u2014waiting for passage.<br>\r\nHearing the plap of Smeargle's footsteps, Stoutland flicks his eyes toward his partner before swinging them back to the queue. <span class=\"cnavy\">\"Found 'em?\"</span> The dog gruffs.<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Found them. They're an indignant, mouthy little thing.\"</span> Smeargle slows his pace, walking up to the hound. Stoutland gives a single guffaw of a deep chuckle.<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"They need to be detained?\"</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Ohhh yes.\" </span>Smeargle lowers his eyes towards you\u2014and smiles smugly. <span class=\"ctan\">\"Modus Operandi C: <i>Colo Edere.</i>\"</span><br>\r\nA gruff chortle causes the hair around Stoutland's mouth to lift up. <span class=\"cnavy\">\"Bad egg, eh?\"</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Very.\"</span> The poisonous way Smeargle chews his words causes your gut to drop.<br>\r\nStoutland grunts. <span class=\"ctan\">\"Put 'em up back. Poor bugger.\"</span><br>\r\nYou struggle, kick, and cry out as you continue to dangle in Smeargle's grasp, swinging to-and-fro like a tiny pendulum. Smeargle tromps over to Stoutland, humming a private melody to himself. He's happy, you think. Why is he happy!?<br>\r\nYou're question is answered when the beagle finishes his journey to the big, blue-brown coated guard dog. He circumnavigates the ginourmous creature, holding you close to Stoutland's indigo fur\u2014causing you to skip across his coat and be exposed to his crude dog-like scent. Abruptly, Smeargle pulls you away and holds you at his white-furred hip. You look up at your captor. Smeargle opens his mouth and closes his eyes, smiling as he makes an announcement that curdles your blood and stands your hair on end.<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Stoutland: lift you tail\u2014if you'd please.\"</span><br>\r\nYou spin your head toward Stoutland. You can't see his face. You can only see his planet-sized behind, dressed in a forest of deep blue fur. The tuft of his tail lay limp, but at the behest of Smeargle's words, it lifts\u2014parting his tangled, wild wool and revealing a pudgy mass that brings bile up your throat. Dust and dirt cling to the edges of dark, fleshed hole\u2014or at least you hope it's dirt...<br>\r\nSmeargle swings you up to his face. <span class=\"ctan\">\"You could've had a cozy cell.\" </span>Smeargle seethes.<span class=\"ctan\"> \"But you had to make Sobble cry. Besides\u2014you could've got them in deep trouble. Your stink almost barred him from going inside. Do you think that they could survive out here at night?\"</span><br>\r\nYou punch the air, taking out your frustrations at a target far out of your reach. \"You're just looking for excuses!\"<br>\r\nSmeargle rolls his eyes. He flips you around, turning you to face Stoutland's derriere. He drops his paintbrush tail, letting it drop to the floor, and places his free hand on the lower back of his partner. He brings you closer to the horrible prison. Stoutland's musk swells to near-unbearable levels. You wriggle and worm, but it's useless\u2014you're going in.<br>\r\nYou're centimeters away. A foul scent brews from within. The frightful gurgle of his organs are clearly audible.<br>\r\nSmeargle positions you on his thumb.<br>\r\n\"Wait! Don't\u2014\"<br>\r\nHe pushes you in.<br>\r\nThe horrid bundle of muscle squelches over you, the normally taut flesh yielding to Smeargle's intruding thumb. You're pressed against the disgusting flesh, rumbling with Stoutland's suppressed, grumbling moan. The cool night air is gone\u2014replaced with nauseating fumes and torrid heat. Moist flesh hugs your face as the evil pudge of the dog's asshole embraces you in a vile hug.<br>\r\nThe beagle's thumb relentlessly pushes you deeper\u2014until the crook of Smeargle's paw catches Stoutland's behind, unable to venture further. Smeargle has pushed his thumb up to its root: enough to imprison you deep in Stoutland's tract\u2014with no way to escape unless the big dog wills it. Slimed with colon juice, baked by heat, and abused by the dog's colon walls, you're thrust into a miserable cramped space. A sickening stench invades your nose, causing you to let loose a wheezing gag. Smears of brown horribleness stain the walls. You try to crawl away, avoiding the scattish rump scraps that gum the folds of Stoutland's rectum.<br>\r\nYou bounce as the dog's intestines twitch and quash, the big dog straining\u2014trying to hold his pleasure and keep his professional composure. You hear the dog release a fat sigh. <span class=\"cnavy\">\"Sorry y'all had to see that. Only the real bad folk get sent there. Don't know what they did\u2014but you bet they deserved it.\"</span><br>\r\n<i>No you didn't!</i> You're innocent! Smeargle just seems to have a real bee in his bonnet for \"criminals.\"<br>\r\nYou strip yourself off the grimy colon floor, your face red-hot. This is disgusting! How long do you have to be in here!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last Pokemon in line\u2014a Swellow\u2014shows her mark that's painted on the pale underside of her wing. After a hasted verification process, she's approved. The Swellow immediately takes to the skies, but not before flashing the pair a mildly disgusted look.<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"And\u2014that's all of them.\"</span> Smeargle says with a relieved finality. <span class=\"ctan\">\"Hoppity Hoppips, that was a long day...\"</span><br>\r\nStoutland harumphs. <span class=\"cnavy\">\"You're telling me.\" </span>The great hound rises to his feet and stretches his legs, back arching\u2014rear in the sky. <span class=\"cnavy\">\"I'm damn happy I was laying belly-down when you stuck 'em in. Popped something embarrassing...\"</span><br>\r\nSmeargle pats the dog's fluffed side. <span class=\"ctan\">\"Hush! Look: another visitor!\"</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Hm? Oh. Two, actually.\"</span><br>\r\nYou're broiling in the fetid heat of canine bowels\u2014surrounded by the sickening odor of dog shit. The dog's bowels pulse rhythmically, timed with his heartbeat. Large clumps of scat lay deeper within, but you're able to stay far far away from them\u2014thank Arceus.<br>\r\nBreaking through the musty swelter of his shitpipe\u2014a voice. Your veins abruptly fill with ice.<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"H-h-hello...\"</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Ah! A Mincinno! You have your mark, yes?\"</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"Y-yes...\"</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Excellent! And your friend there?\"</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"They don't have a m-mark. Th-they're my g-guest...\"</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"<i>Guests </i>aren't typically allowed. They either have their mark or\u2014\"</span><br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\"Don't worry,\"</span> a silvery, male, oh-so-horribly familiar voice chimes, <span class=\"cdorange\">\"I'm their best friend. We had a wonderful meal just a little while ago. I introduced myself to her friends and we got <i>quite</i> close. Poor things, they're very sick. And If I don't meet a special little birdie Mincinno told me about, well\u2014\" Furret pauses.<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid they'll just <i>melt.</i></span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suffer in Stoutland's fetid bowels, heart in your throat, waiting for Smeargle's response...</span></span></div></div>",

At least Smeargle was as much of an impenetrable wall with Furret as he was with you. You breathe shallowly, thinking about the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously Furret found Mincinno and most likely is forcing her to get him into the tree. You're not sure what he stands to gain picking a fight with a bird that's likely strong enough to give him a good fight, but him reaching Talonflame can't be good. Right now you're more concerned about Mincinno, though...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...too bad you're currently trapped in a guard dog's colon! That seriously limits your options, there's little you can do when all that's around you is a tube of filthy, greasy walls. There's only one thing you can do, you realize: plead. Plead to Stoutland to do something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get on your knees, weakened by the heat and the unpleasantness, and smack the wall with a fist. \"You...Stoutland, you have to listen to me! Don't let him into the tree! Mincinno is in danger! <i>Please, listen to me</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMincinno's reaction to Smeargle's refusal to let Furret in was of despair. She cried with horror, approaching Smeargle and pretty much clinging to one of his legs. \"<span class=\"clgrey\">P-Please, I invited him to...to spend the night because he really needs it. There must be something I can do!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cdorange\">Aw, it's not that big of a deal. I'll return any other day</span>\" Furret said, nonchalant. \"<span class=\"cdorange\">Too bad about your friends, I hope they get better</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\">Wait, don't leave, I can do this!</span>\" Mincinno shouted at Furret, who had already turned around to leave. \"<span class=\"clgrey\">Smeargle, he's my guest!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cdorange\">Guests need to go through a process before they get accepted and are painted with a mark. I know you haven't been here in a while, but that's the policy</span>\" Smeargle shrugged, seemingly not having noticed the urgency of the situation. \"<span class=\"cdorange\">We can get that started tomorrow</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\">I need it tonight!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Mincinno begged, Stoutland felt a little voice coming from deep inside him. Ah, that tiny thing Smeargle had found sneaking around. The big dog had been about to tune out from that when he noticed the voice in his innermost depths wasn't pleading about being let out, or anything similar. Stoutland stepped away discretely, unnoticed by everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery time you hit the wall, the flesh quivered, but you didn't know if the dog was feeling any of it. You were shouting as loudly as possible, trying to overcome the noises that saturated the tunnel you were in. Was Stoutland even listening to you? \"...can you even hear me? Arceus, if it turns out I'm shouting at the void I don't know what I'll do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shout loudly, for someone so small\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood, Stoutland heard you. You step away from the wall. There was no time to waste. You shouted everything you knew about Furret. How they had eaten so many Pokemon, how they were feared by anything small enough to be prey, how if he got into the tree, everybody inside could be eaten by him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also lied, saying you had tried to sneak in so you could <i>warn</i> Talonflame about an imminent attack by Furret. It was a lie you could get away with, thankfully -- besides, if it helped make them take the threat seriously, it was worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you were done, nothing happened for a moment. You just stood there, right in the center of the tube, staring at the depths that led into Stoutland, nothing more than wriggling walls, rancid air, and piles of waste far, far away in the distance. You awaited for Stoutland to say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Fine. We will have to do something about that\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made you so happy you may as well be standing on a field of fragrant flowers, with lots of sunlight all over you. It was the best news you could have heard in a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a rather unsettling accusation. That speck was claiming Furret was a dangerous predator and that if he got into the tree everyone inside would be in danger. That Furret was looking for Talonflame. Really? If that so-called dangerous predator was going to pick a fight with Talonflame then it wasn't too smart, but if everyone else in the tree was in danger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cnavy\">If it turns out you're lying, you'll be in so much trouble</span>\" Stoutland turned his head around and whispered to his backside, thankfully without anyone noticing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis had been a long and stressful day and Smeargle wanted nothing more than go retire to his home. But noooo! Now he had to deal with this mess. The whole day he had to stand around and sit on Stoutland's back and check the marks for hundreds of Pokemon. It wasn't a hard job, but he took it <i>so</i> seriously it was stressful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least the tiny human was novelty enough. For a moment Smeargle's thoughts wander to the tiny human he had inserted up Stoutland's rear, as it was their agreement when dealing with those who got mouthy<i> and</i> put anyone in the tree in danger. That small human deserved it, no doubt. Mouthy idiot, getting Sobble involved...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Stoutland always enjoyed that modus operandi a bit too much. Smeargle briefly wondered how it felt to have something crawling up your rear like that. It was a thought that crossed his head every time Stoutland imprisoned someone like that, just around a dozen times a year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head, he focused his attention back to Mincinno. He had been about to tell her she could go in but Furret wouldn't, when he turned his head to look at Stoutland, who was staring at Furret. His partner seemed...wary. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Anything wrong?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cnavy\">We could let him in through the entrance for visitors</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmeargle got alert. The 'entrance for visitors' was their moniker for a dead end in the forest, against a cliff and in the opposite direction to the red tree. They led serious threats in there to be dealt with before being locked away. If Stoutland was suggesting such a thing, then this was a serious situation. \"<span class=\"ctan\">If you say so then that's fine</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgrey\">Oh, thank you, thanks!</span>\" Mincinno sounded so grateful, unaware this wasn't what it sounded like. Furret was standing there, tail swishing from side to side, having read the air and noticed the guard dogs were tense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurret nudged Mincinno. \"<span class=\"cdorange\">Lead the way, my friend!</span>\" he said, excessively cheerful. Now that Smeargle was alert, he started to notice something was very wrong. Stoutland had to be right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the Pokemon walked into the forest, Mincinno to the front following a trail, Furret following just a few steps behind, and Stoutland and Smeargle on the back. Smeargle was on Stoutland, lying with his chin on his partner's head, fiddling with his paintbrush tail. \"<span class=\"ctan\">So do you plan on telling me what's freaking you out about him?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cnavy\">You didn't notice anything wrong?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">...Mincinno is real desperate, now that you mention it</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cnavy\">That speck I have in me right now has been yelling a lot</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">About how they want mercy and to be let out, I guess</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">No. It's about Furret. They say he's extremely dangerous</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmeargle almost hit his own face with his tail. \"<span class=\"ctan\">And you believe them?!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cnavy\">They say Furret has been eating 'mons around, and that one of them may have been from the tree. They say Furret may want to attack Talonflame</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrap. When put like that, there was no way Smeargle could just ignore any of that. The safety of everyone living in there was his priority, after all. He had to take the human's warnings as if they were true. There was no way he'd apologize, though. Trying to get into the tree like the human did was reprehensible, he had been justified in treating him like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entrance for visitors was just like usual, a semicircle formed by the rocky face of a cliff, trees standing so close together passing through them would be impossible, and open sky above -- and the guard dogs at the only way in and out. Furret tilted his head. \"<span class=\"cdorange\">Is the entrance a tunnel?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStoutland advanced very slowly, ready to pounce at any moment, while Smeargle stood on the trail, intending to block it any way he could. \"<span class=\"ctan\">You have one chance to tell us what's going on</span>\" said Smeargle. Furret said nothing. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Did you think we're stupid? I dunno what you threatened Mincinno with, but there's no way we're letting you into the tree!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cdorange\">...that's too bad. You heard them, Mincinno, you can't blame <i>me</i> now</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear there had been a threat of something. As much as he hated to admit it, the human had been on the right. Even worse, this meant once this was dealt with Stoutland would have to let the human out of his system. Hell would freeze over before Smeargle admitted fault, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh well, first he'd have to deal with the problem right in front of them: they needed to incapacitate Furret before locking him away. Stoutland was strong, and although Smeargle had far less strength, he was too large to be eaten and wasn't really in any danger -- although he'd stand aside from any fighting. The only one in serious danger here was Mincinno. They had to finish this before Furret did anything that could harm her. \"<span class=\"cdorange\">Stoutland, knock him out!</span>\"</span></div></div>",

The stocky hound is getting into a fighting stance; his feet spread, shoulders raise, and his head lowers. A growl brews in his throat.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Inside, your knees buckle as the dog rapidly shoots forth, flying forward in a wild charge. You slap a hand on a greasy wall, searching for a handhold to brace yourself as the dog's bowels jump up and down in his ferocious stride. The crash of his stomping on the ground sends a shockwave through the squishy flesh of his bowels, causing them to ripple and shake. You can only last a couple seconds before you collapse to your knees, one hand pressing against the quavering floor. Your legs wobble as you try to unsteadily rise to your feet.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But then Stoutland hard swerves left. An invisible marionette string tugs at your back, flinging you through the fetid air and splattering you against the right of the canine's colon. Centrifugal force pins you to the slime-soaked side. Every inch of your body feels like it's held by heavy lead. You try to lift a hand\u2014and you do so. Trembling and shaky, your hand tries to peel yourself away\u2014but your pitiful strength makes that impossible.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Stoutland stops. You're unshackled from the wall and sent hurtling to the grimy floor. Your body makes a horrible fleshy plap as it flops onto the ground. Bones aching, stomach queasy, you struggle to your feet once more\u2014but then Stoutland flashes to the right. Dodging an attack, maybe?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Either way, you find it impossible to find your footing. As Stoutland and Furret engage in an unseen\u2014but not unfelt\u2014battle, you're tossed around the place like the world's most ill-loved ragdoll. You're grimy, bedraggled, and smell like you just got finished rolling around in dog sh\u2014<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b>SLAM!</b><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Stoutland is swept off his feet from a particularly powerful attack. You're sent hurtling in another unfun flight. You squish into the colon's abhorrent roof and stick there, your body held tight by intestinal lubricant. As Stoutland clambers to his feet, you begin to fall, gravity pulling you down. Strings of the stuff connect you to the ceiling as you slowly descend before snapping. You fall like a miserable meteorite, crashing into a quaggy, squishy earth.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Stoutland growls. You hear Furret.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cdorange\">\"Oh, and here I thought someone your size could've been a challenge!\" </span>His smug voice pierces your prison and fills you with ire.<span class=\"cdorange\"> \"It's a shame, really. If your stuffy friend here was a little bit smaller, I think I would have myself a victory snack.\"</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A faint protesting voice. Smeargle? You listen closer. You barely hear him. <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\"><span class=\"ctan\">\"Get up, Stoutland!

You like the taste of chinchilla?\"</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A powerful growl booms through Stoutland's body as he suddenly springs upright. Without pause, he plows his body into the monologuing ferret in a brutal Take Down.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cdorange\">\"Waaugh!\" </span>Furret cries.

Two heavy thuds sop onto the grass.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cdorange\">\"Nooo...\"</span> Furret moans, forlorn. You hear Stoutland's heavy steps as he approaches the recovering Pokemon and stomps his heavy pad on his now-empty belly.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cnavy\">\"You're... under... arrest.\"</span> Stoutland breathes heavy between his breaths, barely conscious after the recoil from his desperate attack. You feel the blood of his crazily-beating heart pulse through the echoing catacomb of his body. You feel your prison wobble before you feel yourself fall. One second later, you're thrown up high as Stoutland crashes on top Furret, spirals in his eyes.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cdorange\">\"Get him off!\"</span> Furret wheezes as he wriggles around, his tail writhing around like a wiggling cat toy.<span class=\"cdorange\"> \"He's... <i>really </i>heavy...\"</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A small pattering of feet. To your surprise, it's not Smeargle. Minccinno approaches.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"clgrey\">\"You are bad!\"</span> She shouts, holding back tears. Furret groans, annoyed.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cdorange\">\"Yup. I'm bad. Great observation, Sniffles. Your friends were delicious, by the way.\"</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A sharp smack rings out like music to your ears.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cdorange\">\"Ow!\"</span> Furret yelps. <span class=\"cdorange\">\"Did you just slap\u2014\"</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Another resounding smack. Then another. And another. Despite having having literal bowel slime dripping over you like syrup on flapjacks, you smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It's been one hour since Furret's arrest. After Smeargle sped away for backup, he returned to find Furret unconscious\u2014a beaming Minccinno standing beside him, her pain-giving paws cutely slunk behind her back. Her friends were resting on the grass, drenched in belly juices.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You're still in Stoutland's bowels. The big 'Mon still hasn't woken up. He's very clearly still alive. His heart still thumps, his organs still grumble. Worst of all, his intestines didn't get put on pause. The dog crap that once lurked far in the twisting abyss of his colon steadily grows closer. His busy bowels pounded it into an indubitable log. Its stinking fumes are already starting to fill the passage with its horrible stench.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For the better part of the hour, you tried to pry your way free. Lodging your hands into the folds of the dog's arse, you pull and pull\u2014but it's stuck tight. You look back at the clay-like mass and a shiver runs down your spine.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"How much longer is he going to be out...\" You mutter into the stinking air. The dog\u2019s guts burble as a breeze of fart-ridden air wafts into your wretched chamber.</span></span></div></div>",

You really hope you're not going to be there when it enters the rectum, you calculate it won't be more than a couple hours before it does. Did Furret hit Stoutland that hard? You sure hope not!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, you're lucky for once. Everything around you trembles when the big dog stands up, shaking his head. He aches, but he's fine. He awoke just in time to see Smeargle return once again, Mincinno and her friends aren't anywhere to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"About time, big guy. Mincinno is in the tree, and I just finished making sure Furret is taken away and those he had eaten are on their way to Sanctuary\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Sanctuary is rather far away\"</span> Stoutland said, strethcing his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"They were in Furret's stomach for a while. They're okay, but it'd be good to get them some attention just in case.</span>\" You're really glad to hear that. Against all odds, Mincinno and her friends are safe. <span class=\"ctan\">\"Now we have to deal with the human\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"The human...?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"The speck. It's a small human\"</span> And since they had warned them of the danger, there's no option but to let them go. Smeargle approaches Stoutland's rear. Your entire world turns ninety degrees, your heart soars when you realize what it means: it's time to exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Stoutland's anus open you don't waste time to jump down through it, exchanging the stench of the bowels for the fresh air outside, without even noticing you'll fall into Smeargle's cupped paws. When you land, you look at the beagle's face, just for a second before he forms a fist. \"Hey, I'm free, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"What are we going to do with them?\"</span> asks Stoutland. For a moment there's silence. You thought Smeargle had already decided what to do, the silence makes you uneasy, until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"I'll take care of this. Don't worry about it\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't expect Smeargle to bring you to his home inside the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Smeargle opened your fist after a bumpy ride, you were surprised to see a small-sized place, looking like it was exhaustively carved into the tree's wood. There even is crafted furniture, and the floor has several splotches of paint -- paint that dripped from Smeargle's tail, you figure. It's a modest place to live but it seems rather comfy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy did he bring you here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Okay, get a bath before anything else. You really need it\"</span> he said, bringing you a wooden bowl with water. You didn't hesitate to get in there and start removing all the filth you had accumulated during the day. It's cleansing, you even feel Furret's scent finally leaving you. It feels like you're removing shackles off yourself. You're free!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you were done, Smeargle once again took you in his paw, enclosing it around you. When he opened it again, he was lying down on what seemed to be a couch, and he placed you on his torso. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Turn around\"</span> he commands, grabbing his paintbrush tail. <span class=\"ctan\">\"You better not move. With your size there's only one try\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you're going to give me that mark you were looking for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"You got a problem with that?\"</span> You certainly didn't. Soon Smeargle was painting on your back, the tip of his tail sketching a rather complicated mark on you with his paint. <span class=\"ctan\">\"I'm the one in charge of security, if I say you're allowed in then you are\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's why you brought me here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Not really. There's something else.\"</span> Smeargle gets comfy, lazily reaching for a bag of berries near the couch, and offers you a berry. Not having eaten anything the entire day, you accept it, Smeargle eating the rest of the berries and showering you with bits of it while he talked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"I dunno what was the whole thing between Furret and you, but you warned us about him\" </span><i>Munch munch</i> <span class=\"ctan\">\"You should have told us instead of trying to get into the tree yourself, so I'm not apologizing for your stay in my partner's body\"</span> You're not surprised to hear he's not sorry about it. You magnanimously decide to stay silent. <span class=\"ctan\">\"So I decided to make you welcome into the tree as a small reward. You're not a guest, though\"</span> <i>Munch munch </i><span class=\"ctan\">\"You're my roommate\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Don't make that face! The tree is a good place to live in, why do you think so many Pokemon try to sneak in without a mark? And since you're so small you're not going to be any bother. And I want to keep an eye on you anyway, so you don't cause trouble around\"</span> So that was the reason: he didn't want you running around in the tree or its nearby areas without authorization. You had exchanged Furret for Smeargle in terms of what Pokemon had some sort of grip on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be frank, you were glad for that. Smeargle was unpleasant, but he sure wasn't eating innocent 'mons!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you had your fill of berry, you let it go, Smeargle doesn't hesitate and eats it too, letting you rest. You lean back on the coarse fur of his torso, putting your hands behind your head, and close your eyes. The nice coolness of the hovel, the late time at night, and the muffled sound of Smeargle's stomach digesting berries underneath you are making you feel relaxed, maybe even happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a rather long and stressful day, a day you spent worried about a monster eating innocent Pokemon. Despite everything, now that the day was over, you realized you were rather lucky. Not only Furret was defeated, you also had managed to somehow earn a safe place to live in -- and Smeargle wasn't...that bad? You were willing to get along with him, as long as he made some effort too, and in your opinion, giving you food was a good step forward. Yes, for once, you feel like despite your size, your situation isn't bad at all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blast of warm air hits you. You open one eye, seeing Smeargle's snout very close to you. Smeargle is staring right at you with what you interpret as an uncomfortable expression. You have the sudden feeling he's been staring at you for a while already. \"Sorry, did I do something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"...I'm about to go to bed\"</span> he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay. I'll stay on the couch--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"I want to ask you a favor\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, what is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmeargle swallows. You didn't think he could look hesitant, yet here he was, like he wasn't sure how to talk. <span class=\"ctan\">\"...I want you to spend the night inside my butt\"</span> All that comes out of you is a funny noise like confused babbling. Smeargle bops you on the head with a finger. <span class=\"ctan\">\"Listen and please don't interrupt me, it's hard enough to say these things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery time the situation warrants it Stoutland imprisons unwelcome invaders inside his butt. At first I didn't pay much attention to that, but then I started wondering why he likes that so much\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Everything down there is for pushing things <i>out</i>, why would something crawling <i>in</i> be any good? It doesn't make any sense!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh...\" you repeated again. You're pretty sure you know where this is going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"And it's not like I can just ask any Pokemon to do that for me, because nothing would fit in. But I was just looking at you and then I realized: you...you're the smallest thing I have ever seen! I'm pretty sure you'd fit inside me! If there's someone who can help me with this, it's you!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...\" you saw that coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmeargle continues: <span class=\"ctan\">\"I'm just asking you to be inside for the rest of the night, until the morning\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not sure why, but you don't immediately veto that. Maybe it's because you're in a very good mood right now, or because he fed you and pretty much gave you a place to stay in, or maybe just that you don't want to sour the budding...tolerance you have towards each other. The hope you see in Smeargle's eyes isn't helping either. If it wasn't because he's asking you to go into his rectum you'd think it was adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just...one night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Only one. That should be enough\"</span> At least he was honest about his motives. Pure curiosity was better than many other reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your head around from your vantage point on his belly, giving a cursory look at his size. Smeargle lacked Stoutland's massiveness, but he wasn't <i>small</i>. His head easily reached Stoutland's shoulders, after all. You calculated that, if you were to stand inside Smeargle's colon, you could extend your hand upwards and reach the ceiling with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really hated by now that kind of calculations were easy for you to make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if I should...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmeargle sighs, his breath washing over you. You smell berries. <span class=\"ctan\">\"I know. If you say no it's fine. But I'd appreciate if you accepted\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're very relieved to find out he doesn't intend to shove you in if you don't want to partake in this. You turn around. You see the expanse of Smeargle's belly, before it curves down. It's almost hard to believe that, if you chose so, you could feasibly reach Smeargle's tailhole in a minute or two of walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you take your decision.</span></div></div>",

Your words aren\u2019t the most confident, but they prick Smeargle\u2019s ears all the same. His ears rise, looking like two loaves of brown bread sliding up the sides of his face. His words, however, don\u2019t exude the same amount of excitement.<br>\r\n\t \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cYou don\u2019t sound sure,\u201d </span>he says, voice low. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this.

It becomes quieter than it ever has been. All you can hear is the sound of both your breaths\u2014and gurgling of his tummy below. His berry-scented breath blows past you in a sweet wind, enriching the air with a sugary scent. You watch his fur ripple with the breeze, reminding you of the windy barley fields in all those old samurai movies.<br>\r\n\t \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Smeargle looks at you expectantly. He doesn\u2019t say a word. Judging from the blooming blush on his face, he probably doesn\u2019t have a clue of what to say! His tongue is probably tied up in a flustered knot, and if he opened his mouth, all that would come out is blabberings. Quite a scary thought for the ordinarily articulate Smeargle!<br>\r\n\t \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You spin around, leaving his puppy dog face to admire your newly-painted mark. You start your stroll down his belly fur, meandering across the meadow of white. His soft fur yields underfoot as you brush it aside and stride through. Even outside his body, you can hear his rapidly-quickening heartbeat\u2014faint yet clear. Ba-thump, ba-thump, ba-thump\u2026<br>\r\n\t \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You snap awake when you realize you\u2019re nearing your destination, the breadth of your memories of the trip already melted away. You\u2019re by his crotch now and the air is heavy with his incense. You sense Smeargle shift uncomfortably as you pass by his intimate regions, and despite you not necessarily wanting to look, you do so anyway. You see it: his cock. Still nested in his sheath, a pinprick of pink already rising from its furry confinement. It twitches slightly. You don\u2019t know what you expected. You continue on.<br>\r\n\t \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You find yourself at the slope of a fluffy hill. With a second\u2019s hesitation, you slide down it like a snow-kissed slant. It\u2019s like sledding! Except, well, it smells a little bit like butt\u2026<br>\r\n\t \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eventually you find yourself at the base of his tail, nested between his legs. His long, spaghetti-strand tail slinks off into the distance, cascading off the fabric couch like a wooly waterfall. You balance yourself on his tail, which is rather easy considering your size, and toddle closer to your journey\u2019s end. A pink-flesh ring, tickled by hair and shaded by the shadow of his looming balls, patiently awaits your entry. You move closer, feet clomping against Smeargle\u2019s tail fur. The puckered muscle is clean\u2014thank heavens\u2014and it doesn\u2019t emanate a sickly odor. It doesn\u2019t smell great, but it doesn\u2019t make you want to turn yourself inside-out either.<br>\r\n\t \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You\u2019re next to it now. You\u2019re questioning all of your life choices that lead up to this moment. But you\u2019re already here, so....<br>\r\n\t \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You wriggle your hands inside, worming your way past doughy flesh. Smeargle peeps a grunt as he feels your intrusion. It isn\u2019t a hearty growl or a throaty moan. It\u2019s just a surprised peep, the beagle perceiving an odd tickle in his backside. You part his flesh as the Normal-type hums a pleasured <span class=\"ctan\"><i>mmmm....</i></span> That was a different sensation.<br>\r\n\t \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You press your face against the flexing muscle as your wriggle your way in. His tailhole strains, trembling, as his toes curl\u2014the beagle trying his best to not clench his backdoor.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The sensation! It\u2019s unparalleled. Smeargle feels the room grow hot as a newfound pleasure lights a fire in his belly. It licks his veins with spouts of flame, injecting them with electric energy and sending a rousing pulse coursing through his body. Smeargle shivers. He has never felt this way before.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Back to you. You\u2019re just finishing up worming your way into the dog\u2019s backdoor. His tailhole nibbles around your waist as you kick your legs, inching yourself in. On the inside, you see the ribbed walls of Smeargle\u2019s colon, relatively clean and mostly free of scat. Thank goodness the beagle is the one Pokemon with good anal hygiene\u2026 <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The rest of you pops inside with a sticky slurk. You enter prone, belly on the slick floor. The familiar muggy anal environment welcomes you, dousing you in a heat rivaled only by the most sweltry of rainforests. Once you\u2019re all in, you hear Smeargle gasp above. His voice booms around you: the head of security now the voice of Arceus. You pick yourself up, standing tall, and reach up toward the drippy roof. Your predictions were correct. You reach it easily.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cMy\u2026 my goodness!\u201d</span> Smeargle hushly gasps. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cI think I feel you! Barely but\u2014\u201d </span>His words crash to a stop as he curiously prods his lower belly. The oscillating walls grow slightly tighter, not from his finger, but his blooming excitement. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cAre you okay in there?\u201d</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDoing\u2026 peachy!\u201d You shout. The air still smelled a lot like the other butts you\u2019ve been in. But this time there\u2019s the distinct scent of Smeargle. And from the bit you\u2019ve stayed with him, the smell oddly brings a warm fuzzy feeling in your bosom. You walk around a bit, exploring the end of his colon, your feet squelching across the ground. Smeargle\u2019s breathing is getting louder. You place a hand on the rectum walls.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAre you okay, Smeargle?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0No answer\u2014for a moment.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cI\u2019m fine! I\u2019m just\u2026 a little steamed up.\u201d</span> The big beagle exhales.<span class=\"ctan\"> \u201cI\u2019m trying not too\u2026 mmm\u2026\u201d</span> Smeargle quiets down, humming deeply. You sense the ground beneath your rise slightly before settling back down. Did he just thrust his hips?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSmeargle, are you\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cNo! No I\u2019m not! <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Not anymore\u2026</font>\u201d </span>The Normal-type respires a whistling breath. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cI\u2019ll\u2026 mellow myself down now. I\u2019ll try not to move much. Stay safe. I\u2019m going to nab myself some naptime\u2026\u201d</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Smeargle\u2019s inner cave rolls about as the Pokemon makes himself comfortable. Soon enough, amidst the sound of his rushing blood, his groaning organs, and his digesting berries\u2014you hear his snoring. Goodnight, Smeargle, you think to yourself as you begin to make yourself comfortable. You squish around his rectum, looking for the driest spot you can find. You find a \u201cmodestly\u201d comfy patch, heated by his body warmth, and rest your back against the spongy wall. It smells to high heaven but at least it\u2019s warm\u2026<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It\u2019s a long while before your eyes begin to wink. But given time, you\u2019re seeing the Sandman, too.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But during the long night, does anything happen?</span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You hardly can believe what you're thinking: you're having a surprisingly pleasant night inside Smeargle's backside. Wait...if you're aware of that, then you're awake...? Did something rouse you up? You roll over, trying to find a comfortable position amidst the quivering flesh holding you. You vaguely feel weightlessness, and a voice you have never heard before:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Up you go!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't hear anything else. Even Smeargle's stomach was silent. Good, that'd help you sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, you wake up for real, and this time you're aware what made you wake up: Smeargle's bellowing. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\"WHAT--\"</b></span> he shouts so loud the walls of the rectum shake. Alarmed, you look around yourself, as if at the end of Smeargle's system you'd find clues of what's going on outside. There's nothing, other than the surroundings looking somewhat dirtier, but it wasn't nothing you couldn't handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening?\" you manage to ask before Smeargle starts thrashing wildly. You don't get to brace yourself before you bounce from one wall to the other, like a ragdoll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Smeargle has found himself in an outrageous situation. It was dawn, and he had just woken up, only to find himself lying on his tummy in a familiar place he shouldn't be at: a wine storage. Barrels he knows are full of berry wine are strewn all over the place, and he's amidst them. The beagle's hands are tied behind his back, the rope extending to envelop his legs and feet. In front of him there's a small card, with colorful letters:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\"GOTCHA!\"</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmeargle stops thrashing around and informs you of his situation. You turn pale and sit down, freaking out: \"Wait, you have been kidnapped?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"No! That's not it! This is a prank!\"</span> Smeargle spits the word with outrage. <span class=\"ctan\">\"Some 'mons in the tree think it's funny to play pranks on me, they even take turns! This must be one of those pranks\"</span> he tests the ropes. Those on his legs are tight, but those on his arms seem to be meant for him to get free with some effort. <span class=\"ctan\">\"Whoever thought this one up has gone too far! I'll give them a piece of my mind!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed Smeargle was in quite the pickle, indeed. You crawled on your hands and knees towards the dog's anus. \"Let me out, maybe I can help.\" Smeargle tried, but given the way he was tied, he was unable to -- his back was curved, he couldn't strain enough to open his backdoor enough for you. You saw his sphincter twitch and move, you could tell the dog had tried his best to let you out. \"...okay, that's fine. I can wait. You just focus on getting yourself untied\" you say, kneeling down onto the floor and bracing yourself for what was to come. As you expected, Smeargle continued his attempts to untie himself, twisting and rolling and trying hard to snap or undo the knots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next hour was hell. You slid all over the place, gathering more slime on yourself, so much you were sure you were leaving the walls of the rectum spotless with your movements. All you could do was curl and be thrown around like a shoe in a washing machine, every movement dazing you and making you wish you were unconscious, but the walls -- soft and of a dark red color -- were too bouncy to do you that favor. You were at the mercy of inertia, Smeargle unwittingly condemning you to a whirlwind of movement you couldn't get out of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point Smeargle had to rest, chance you used to take a deep breath and try to snap out of your dizziness. Only then you noticed that during the last hour something had progressively changed. The air inside Smeargle's large intestine never was fresh and nice, but it used to have the beagle's scent. That comforting touch was gone, replaced by something acrid and noxious. You sniffed the air, having a bad feeling of what it was. Investigating, you stood up and ran into Smeargle's colon, turning the corner until you face the source of the smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Smeargle, I think your dinner from last night is getting too close for comfort!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Wait, do you mean there's a bunch of...\"</span> you confirmed it. The large clumps of waste being pushed by peristalsis were unmistakable. You had just enough time to make your way back into the rectum before Smeargle restarted his efforts once again, with renewed vigor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a lot like deja vu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother hour had passed, and this one was worse since you knew there was a time limit -- for you. You had made a herculean effort to stay in the rectum despite Smeargle's movements, and during the moments of respite you evaluated the situation. Smeargle's unforgiving digestive system had turned food into a lot of crap that was starting to peek its way around the corner, slowly getting ready to pass into the rectum. The putrid smell emanating from the logs of dog shit was a nightmare -- it was hard to believe the otherwise clean beagle could produce something so foul! And the farts that came along with it didn't help at all, either. The rectum was your personal trial now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"I'm...almost done!\"</span> Smeargle had said not long ago. Minute after minute, the waste kept approaching. You held yourself right against the backdoor, hoping that just like it had happened with Stoutland, something would happen that'd spare you from what was coming. The situation was just so similar, surely something would happen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly when the crap was two of your arms' distance away from you, you realized such a miracle wouldn't occur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to do what you could to avoid the unpleasant situation from turning any worse. If you stayed where you were now, the dog shit would mash you against the tailhole, its weight pressing you mercilessly. To avoid that, you crawled forward, making your body as flat as possible, and wedged yourself between the logs and the rectum walls. Slowly, you dug your fingertips into the tissue and propelled yourself forward. You could feel the surprisingly solid waste scrapping against your back -- thankfully nothing was sticking to you. Small mercies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour idea was simple: since you were doomed to witness how Smeargle's bowel movements were like, you didn't want to be on the front and suffer everything else falling on you. You'd try to let as much of that go out before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walls compressed, forcing you to be sandwiched between unrelenting tissue and stinking refuse. <span class=\"ctan\">\"Speck, that better be you trying to get out\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Smeargle's eyes widened, his ears folded against his head. He was feeling the call of nature, loud and clear. For a moment he felt his heart sinking into a deep pit of embarrassment. There were some things that should be private, and pooping seemed like it should be one of them! The thought of having to do that while the human was right there...it was mortifying. The embarrassment twisted into ire. Whoever thought this sick joke was funny would have to do a lot to compensate him for this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, you had just lodged yourself into a fold of the colon, your feet and the front of your body touching the log of waste in front of you. You shared Smeargle's annoyance. If it wasn't for this prank, you wouldn't currently be sharing your space with your newly-gained friend's refuse! Simmering in your own anger, you looked up. You hadn't managed to be the last in the queue. Looking down, you saw the unfathomably long column of shit extending down and out of sight, filling the rectum from wall to wall. There was nothing else you could do now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly fifteen minutes later Smeargle got his arms free from the rope. He immediately got them out and worked on the knots holding his legs, undoing them in no time. He was finally free, fact he informed the human about. \"Alright, then please get me out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"I'm not going to take a dump at any random corner--\"</span> he had been saying, with a paw on the doorknob to open it so he could go down to his home. <i>Clack clack.</i> His blood ran so cold you were sure you could feel the squirming walls behind you turn into ice. <span class=\"ctan\">\"No way! The door is locked!\"</span> The prankster had done that, no doubt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By now Stoutland must have noticed you're late for work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Of course he has! But he can't leave the entrance unguarded. He's not going to look for me until late at night!</span>\" and Smeargle certainly didn't want to spend an entire day in the wine storage. Once again the beagle felt the urge to relieve himself -- a reminder his roommate was in there too.<span class=\"ctan\"> \"It's all up to you, speck\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Nobody ever comes here, so after you're out of me, crawl under the door and go search for the key. When you find it bring it back to me\"</span> Breaking the door down wasn't an option, he had made sure the door was the sturdiest they could get. Getting the key was the only way to open it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, already knowing this would be a long ordeal for you. \"Alright, but first can you get me out of your body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"I know, I know!\"</span> he said, but you didn't feel him move at all. He was completely still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLosing some of your patience, you yell: \"What are you waiting for?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"It's so awkward to have you watching me take a shit!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, great. He was self-conscious about that. You hoped that wouldn't be a problem. \"Smeargle, I'm not in front of you. I'm inside you <i>with</i> the shit\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"I'm aware!\"</span> he shouted. You felt bad about how embarrassed he must be feeling. Smeargle was moving now, trying to get as far away as possible from all the wine barrels. In the meantime, you pondered your new ordeal:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere would that key be? Taking it to the wine storage was going to be easy, the hard part was finding it. It couldn't be in the storage. There were two possibilities, you thought: either it was hidden near the storage, or the prankster had it with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to decide what your course of action would be. While you waited for Smeargle to start voiding his bowels, you took your decision.</span></div></div>",

The thump of his footsteps shudders a shockwave up the winding passage of his bowels, causing them to flutter\u2014imprinting you with an intimately-close encounter with his still-warm dung. Smeargle\u2019s colon reels away, recoiling as if even it is disgusted by its current occupants. You\u2019re left stunned. Touching that thing almost disintegrated you. It was solid, but mushy. A horrible, horrible thing that threatens to consume you if Smeargle clenched too tight. If Smeargle\u2019s waste ever manages to swallow you, dragging you to its revolting depths, you would have waking nightmares for the rest of your tiny life.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tSmeargle\u2019s plodding stops. His innards stand stock still. His gut gurgles above.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cAlright\u2026\u201d</span> he says, his voice vibrating through the squalid walls and filthy flesh. He coughs, momentarily pinning you against his waste. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cThis\u2026 is as good a place as any.\u201d</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tA powerful ripple travels up from the belly of his bowels, hugging his scat as the ripple flows through the length of his intestines. You kick against the log of shit in front of you, plastering your body against his heated flesh\u2014trying very hard to not press against browned, stained remnants of digested berry. The peristalsis of the intestines pushes the crap forward, your feet dragging a groove through its reeking outer rind. A dim light comes from the right as Smeargle\u2019s waste peeks through his tailhole. You almost try to squeeze out with it, but one look to the left shows you the massive length of Smeargle\u2019s crap, snaking through his bowels. You quickly decide you\u2019d rather be the last coming out rather than have all that on top of you.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tAnother crushing round of peristalsis smears you between dog crap and scummy walls. The detestable garbage-dump of waste slides forward. As it slowly passes you endure the repeated clench-and-release of Smeargle\u2019s colon. Every clench grants you new insight of your roommate\u2019s past meals. The forbidden knowledge burns your nose and turns you green. It\u2019s sickening stench worms its way into your nostrils\u2014fouler than anything you\u2019ve ever experienced. It even beats your stay in both Honchkrow and Stoutland\u2019s ass. There it was simply unclean: horrid tunnels furnished with slime and reeking of shit that was long since voided. But here, it is fresh. The pungent odor that made you gag in Stoutland\u2019s colon is dialed up to eleven. It\u2019s technically a different smell, differing diets and all, but\u2014to you\u2014it didn\u2019t matter. Its ungodly, sickening stench punches you in the gut every time you take a breath. It\u2019s a cruel bully that continues to beat you up, even after you\u2019ve thrown in the towel.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tYou\u2019re pressed up against it again. It\u2019s revolting surface grazes your belly. You can\u2019t even put into words how sickly this makes you feel.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tOutside, Smeargle grunts. A cherry-red blush warms his face. He nestled himself in a dusty old corner of the wine cellar. Right next to him is a wooden wine shelf carved from the bark of the tree up above. The wine cellar was chipped from the stone and soil that was nestled between the roots of the great oak. Smeargle, trying to distract himself from the embarrassing task at hand, started reading the labels of the fermented-berry wine.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t<i>Veno Volo</i>, <i>Cherubi Cherry</i>,<i> Early Mountain Roserade...</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tSmeargle feels a tickle near his tailhole: your struggles. He looks back. His breath catches when he notices the dreadfully-long log hanging from his derriere.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t<i>Sweet Appletun</i>, <i>Bayleef Creek...</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tSmeargle bears down, crunching his guts. His tailhole closes. The stool clips off and plunks to the ground. He lets out a little whimper when he still feels the ring-a-ding of nature\u2019s call.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t<i>Ch\u00e2teau Le Budew</i>, <i>Straight From Servine...</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tA new head of an old meal makes a reappearance, inching from his hole like a belly-child emerging into the world. Smeargle shuts his eyes tight in hot embarrassment. Even with his eyes closed, he could see his tiny Speck: squashed by his freshly shit-stained walls and pinned against\u2014<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tSmeargle snaps his eyes open. He can\u2019t think about that! Distraction! <i>Dis-trac-tion!</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t<i>Gossifleur Pinot Noir...</i><br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tYou\u2019re afraid that Smeargle\u2019s bowel movement is like a World Serpent: a never ending snake that would slither past forever. A tiny easement sets upon when look over and see that rounded end of the mud-colored monstrosity. A few more rippling clenches\u2014and it\u2019s gone. You watch, sullied and slathered in dreck, as the tip of the thing is ejected with a sickening sllleecch. Checking twice to make sure you\u2019re that only resident in this corner of the beagle\u2019s behind, you pick yourself up and hurriedly tromp over to gatekeeper\u2019s exit.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tYou pound your palms on the puckered flesh, which reactively tighten as Smeargle stiffens up. You\u2019re nearly knocked on your butt. You don\u2019t care. You just try to part the unclean thing, still stained by fresh crap.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tAnd when you do, you throw yourself through. Smeargle\u2019s paws mericully break your fall as you land in his pillow-soft fur. He swings you to his face. His sensitive nose wrinkles as he flinches in disgust.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cWithering worlds! Oh no!\u201d</span> He looks at you in abject horror. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cH-hold on!\u201d</span> He sets you down on the wooden wine shelf. He then snatches an unopened bottle, pops the cork, and gives you an impromptu wine bath. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tIn the end, it leaves you smelling like the insides of a Shuckle: fruity and tooty. The strong scent of fermented berry masks the\u2026 other scents you\u2019ve accumulated.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t<span class=\"ctan\">\u201c...Are you okay?\u201d</span> Smeargle asks at last, staring at you with tiny pupils and wide eyes.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u201c...\u201d Your look tells Smeargle all he needs to know. \u201cI am <i>so </i>going to go find that asshole!\u201d You growl.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tYou scamper under the doorway and sneak through the passage of the underground, the area beneath the oak\u2019s trunk. The hallways are carved from its hollow roots. There appears to be no one around.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You hid again behind the corner, having taken a look at who you had to deal with. There are two Pokemon, one small and the other large. You recognize the species at a glance. The small one is a Purrloin, the purple cat is distinctive. The other one, though...that's a Munchlax. What surprises you, though, is its size. Munchlax aren't known for being a large species, yet this one seemed to be halfway towards having a Snorlax's size. It was impressive in its own right!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe talk of wine gets Munchlax to hum appreciatively. <span class=\"cteal\">\"I'd love to have some wine right now...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"It's precisely because of 'mons like you that they lock it so well. You'd drink everything in there in thirty minutes</span>\" the Purrloin said. Her smile extended all over her face, clearly she was having a lot of fun. <span class=\"cgrape\">\"But after this I'm getting you a bottle, you deserve it. This should make Smeargle lighten up a little!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMunchlax laughed. <span class=\"cteal\">\"No problem...glad to help.\"</span> Their conversation continued. From what you understood, Purrloin and Munchlax were a bit of a team, Purrloin being the one to scheme while Munchlax carried it out -- as long as he didn't get distracted. During the conversation he often got lost in thought, and Purrloin had to bring his mind back into what they were talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"At this rate Smeargle is going to stay there the entire day! Can you imagine how angry he'll be if that happens? I bet he'll be so angry his fur will turn red\"</span> Purrloin said. You felt a surge of anger, but you didn't go confront them. Smeargle and you got off the wrong foot, but you certainly would have never thought about locking him somewhere! It was a nasty prank, that was what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMunchlax scratched his head. <span class=\"cteal\">\"Heheh...but you know...if he misses the entire day and he finds out we locked him, he'll kick us out of the tree\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"Relax, at sunset we'll pass the key under the door and get away from here. He'll never know it was us\"</span> you took the quiet decision to inform Smeargle when you were taking to him the key yourself. Sunset was still so far away!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Isn't that too long? I'm not sure I like that...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"Ugh, you always get cold feet. Fine. If you're so scared about it then we'll give the key at noon. Happy now?\"</span> Munchlax nodded sleepily, eyes closed. Although he had cooperated in this, he seemed far less passionate than Purrloin was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"That's better\"</span> Munchlax yawned widely. <span class=\"cteal\">\"Now we won't have to wait for so long...doing nothing while we wait is boring\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"I told you to bring something to keep yourself busy with!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"I forgot\"</span> he tilted his head, eyes closed. <span class=\"cteal\">\"I'm sorry, Purrloin. My bad\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPurrloin puffed her cheeks. <span class=\"cgrape\">\"You always forget something! And here I had thought we had finally done something without you screwing up\"</span> she shrugged. <span class=\"cgrape\">\"Well as far as mistakes go, this isn't that big of a problem. I'll see what I can find at your home\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Thanks, Purrloin. Do you think Smeargle has untied himself already?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"Probably, but he can't leave the storage anyway. You can wait for me here until I return.\"</span> Purrloin's tail swished. Thanks to the movement, you noticed something you hadn't seen before: the key had been hooked on the end of her tail. Taking the key, she extended it towards Munchlax. <span class=\"cgrape\">\"If anyone sees me with the key they'll ask questions, so you keep it until I'm back. Got it?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Sure</span>\" Munchlax took the key, turning it around in his hands.<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\"><br>\r\n\"You better not lose it! If we lose that key we're in deep trouble\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMunchlax tucked the key in his fur. You remembered hearing before that Munchlax tended to hide food and stuff in their fur, it made sense it'd be hidden in there. That was going to be a problem -- although now you knew where the key was, that fur was a daunting obstacle. From where you were standing you could see how long and shaggy that fur was. You were pretty sure if you were in middle of it the fur would tower far above you! How could a Pokemon have so much fur?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPurrloin didn't seem to be convinced about what he did. <span class=\"cgrape\">\"Are you sure you can just stick it in there and you won't lose it?\" </span>Munchlax didn't reply, just staring at her with dopey expression. Purrloin reconsidered: <span class=\"cgrape\">\"Then again, by now I think a quarter of your weight is from stuff you have there...fine. But you better not move!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"No? I wanted to check on Smeargle...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"No, don't move from here! If you move you may lose the key. I'm not taking any risks!\"</span> her tone left no room for discussion. Munchlax sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Fine...I'll stay here and just stare at the roots of the tree...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"Good, that's what I wanted to hear. See? Everything goes well when you listen to me\"</span> Purrloin winked. <span class=\"cgrape\">\"I'll be back with something for you!\"</span> and without looking back, Purrloin hurried away, intending to bring something for Munchlax to entertain himself with until it was time to give Smeargle the key and run away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was your chance, you thought. There was absolutely no possibility you could reason with Purrloin -- you understood she had been the one to plan this whole thing, and judging by how joyful she had sounded while she mocked Smeargle, it was very unlikely you'd get her to change her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMunchlax, though...perhaps you could do something there? He was coasting along with Purrloin's ideas, a lackey of sorts. He may not be as invested as Purrloin is in. While he did seem willing enough to play pranks on Smeargle, you thought there was a chance he'd have pity on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, he had the key somewhere in his fur. That was the most important factor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly and carefully, you turned the corner, intending to come closer. Munchlax yawned again and sat down, reclining onto the wall and crossing his hands over his chest, staring at the empty air with contemplative expression. <span class=\"cteal\">\"We're not getting caught, right...? We won't get kicked out...right?\"</span> he says to the emptiness. Nothing replies. <span class=\"cteal\">\"I hope she will give me some wine later...that should make this worth it\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if a bottle of wine would be worth what <i>you</i> went through!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're getting closer and closer to Munchlax's sitting form. It likely wasn't going to be long before Purrloin returned, so you had to hurry. By now you have already decided what approach you will take.</span></div></div>",

Your feet make the faintest of thuds against the hardwood floor, but the sound dies long before it reaches Munchlax\u2019s ears. The giant Pokemon stares blankly into space, eyes half closed. Daydreaming about booze? Probably. His paws hang by his side, draped slack against his pelt. They\u2019re too high for you to reach. But as you get closer, you\u2019re relieved to find that there\u2019s no shortage of hand-holds on the Pokemon\u2019s body.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tYou\u2019re right under his massive paws. You stand beside the tuft of his coat. His slate-blue fur rolls from his body like an unfurled carpet, draping onto the floor like a too-long curtain. You step onto the tips of his hairs. Munchlax does not stir.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tThe key is under his fur\u2026 You softly click your tongue, thinking. Climbing the outside of his fur isn\u2019t going to do much. I won\u2019t have a clue where it is\u2026<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tYou nose your way past Munchlax\u2019s shroud of fur. Your hands part his wooly coat as if you\u2019re performing an open-air breaststroke. His fur parts to reveal a second layer of curly hair. You let the first coat close behind you, draping you in darkness. The outside air left behind, the scent of wild Munchlax grows strong. It\u2019s not horribly unpleasant. It smells exactly like what you\u2019d expect if you buried your nose in the fur of a wild Pokemon.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tBut you also catch a whiff of something strange. Smothered by Munchlax\u2019s scent, is a grab bag of odors. A metallic tang, a fragrant sweetness, a spicy prickliness. You\u2019ve been hit by a Dizzy Punch of aromas. Is it all from the stuff Munchlax has hidden underneath his fur?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You brush past Munchlax\u2019s second coat. For a long moment, you stumble in near darkness. Underneath, your hands tickle his undercoat\u2014his final layer of hair. While not as shaggy as the fur that\u2019s tickling you from above, his undercoat still soars above. Each and every hair is larger than you. The good news: you\u2019re sure they\u2019ll support your weight. You grab a fistful of hair and pull yourself upwards. Your upper arm strains as your muscles tremble. After you successfully lift off the ground, your arms and feet gripping Munchlax\u2019s hair like a thickly-spun rope. Goodness! This is going to be harder than you thought\u2026<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You clamber up your hair-rope like you\u2019re Jack and the Beanstalk. Grunting and muttering as you scale the blue-furred mountain, you whisper a prayer that the Pokemon\u2019s hair muffles your words\u2014hiding them from Munchlax\u2019s pointy ears. As you scramble on upwards, hair drapes over you like a jungle canopy. Higher, higher, and higher you go. When one hair ends, you leap to another. Hopping from hair to hair leaves you exhausted. But you feel like you\u2019re making progress! If you have to give a wild guess, you\u2019d wager you\u2019re crawling somewhere around Munchlax\u2019s belly.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That sweet smell from earlier? It gets stronger. You\u2019re too tired to care though. You single-mindedly continue to climb, stopping only when your hands clasp onto something sticky.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWh-what?\u201d While you struggle to pry your hands free, you stretch your head up. You see a pink-frosted Poffin\u2014a luxury baked good for pampered Pokemon. Most curiously, it is slathered in golden, dripping honey. You can\u2019t help but wonder, <i>did someone give this to Munchlax? Did Purrloin steal it? How long has it been sitting here!?</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You\u2019re tired muscles sob as you strain to free your sticky hands. No dice. Looking back at the sweet treat, you see a new dribbling of honey begin to sluck off the poffin\u2014heading towards you. A swear shoots between your clenched teeth as you just manage to unstick-ify yourself. But before you can scramble to another hair, that glob of sickly sweetness plunges down\u2014dumping itself onto you.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The weight of the heavy liquid is enormous. And the weight threatens to strip you off the strand of fur and send you oozing down the Munchlax\u2019s belly. You try everything in your power to hold on, but is it enough? Does an outside force swing by and add another snarl in the already chaotic mix?</span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before this moment you had never thought of honey as heavy. Right now, with just a dollop of it flowing over you, at your current size, it feels like someone is trying to put an entire world on your shoulders. The liquid is surprisingly heavy, you feel like it's going to stick on you forever. Despite that, you close your eyes cling to the hair you're on as strongly as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps you would have managed to cling successfully if the hair hadn't started to bend too. It bends under the weight of the honey, forming a curve. <i>I can't let it happen...not when I have gotten this far!</i> You had climbed a lot, you couldn't let the honey drag you all the way to the floor!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe honey had gotten between your fingers. That was what at first made you not notice you had been carried down. It's when you feel yourself moving down that you realize you're currently traveling down Munchlax's belly. You open your eyes, seeing a lot of teal fur pass by, the honey parting the way like Moses. Strands of hair you could stand on breeze by, the honey passing around and between them you think there's nothing that could stop your descent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, you're proven wrong. The drop of honey you're on settles on something. You pull yourself free from the honey, taking advantage of the respite, while the honey starts to bifurcate, trying to get past the obstacle that got in its way. You manage to unstick yourself right when it continued flowing. You're safe! But where had you stopped at. You look around at your surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWay above you the dome of Munchlax's other two layers of hair, and underneath you there's something covered with short hairs. Seems like something jutting out from Munchlax's undercoat, some sort of cylinder. It takes you some thinking to realize where you have been forcibly taken to: you're currently standing on Munchlax's genitals. Part of the reason why it took you a moment to realize that is that the fog of scents all over you masked the smell of musk that would otherwise coat the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment you freak out, not liking it at all. This wasn't part of the plan to find the key! You really doubted it would be anywhere on Munchlax's sheath! You take a moment to calm down and evaluate the situation. The skin and fur in front of you is still full of honey, you wouldn't be able to climb it. To your sides there's the circumference of the Pokemon's sheath, extending a dozen meters to the sides. Approaching one of the edges, you look. There's quite the long drop going down, so far you can only see fur and more fur going down. You're not getting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe realization hits you: you're stranded. The only option you can think right now is wait for the honey to dry up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarely two minutes have passed when you hear a voice you dreaded to hear, muffled behind the thick curtain of fur: Purrloin is back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPurrloin was some kind of machine, bringing it with her.<span class=\"cgrape\"> \"Why do you have so much junk? Are you collecting it or what?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMunchlax, not having seen her approach, blinks blearily, recognizing what she had brought: his miniature Poffin machine. She better be careful with that! <span class=\"cteal\">\"Something like that...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"I brought you this because it's the only thing I didn't know about. It must be interesting to you. What is it, anyway?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"It's for...for good food. But you didn't bring me ingredients\"</span> Purrloin muttered a '<span class=\"cgrape\">oh</span>'. So she had dragged that thing as big as her all the way down, for nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"...W-Well that's not my fault. I dunno about this kinda thing! Let's go to what's important: do you still have the key?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMunchlax scratches his chest, tilting his head. <span class=\"cteal\">\"I think so?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"You <i>think</i>? You didn't move, did you?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Nope, I sat here all the time...\"</span> he started searching in his fur, finding a menagerie of things, most of them food. Berries, candy, interesting rocks, random items, very old and moldy bread, a bottle of hot sauce. A sweet Poffin! May as well take that. He hadn't found the key yet, but since he hadn't taken it out -- and he was sure he hadn't eaten it by accident, as far as he knew -- then it must have been somewhere in there. There was no hurry to find it, he thought, biting into the Poffin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPurrloin didn't want to stand around and watch Munchlax eat, though. She put the Poffin machine down. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">Come on, stand up! And move!</span>\" She intended to check if the key was anywhere on the ground. Obeying, Munchlax stood up, moving aside. While Purrloin checked the ground carefully, he looked wistfully at his portable Poffin machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">I'm putting this aside</span>\" he said, taking his machine with his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Take it with you to the wine storage. I have a plan to make Smeargle never realize we had anything to do with the prank</span>\" Since the key indeed was nowhere on the ground, she judged Munchlax still had it. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">I'm really good with voices. I can make him think some strangers got into the tree and did that to him</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">Do you think that will work...?</span>\" not even Munchlax seemed convinced about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Of course it will! I know what I'm doing, so let's go!</span>\" she said, getting behind Munchlax and pushing him forward. She'd walk behind him, in case he let the key fall down somewhere along the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMunchlax standing up certainly didn't go unnoticed to you. Until now, Munchlax's dick had been level, like a platform you didn't want to think much about, but now that he had stood up, the formerly stable ground had turned into an incline, a steep 60\u00b0 incline that threatened to throw you off. You laid down immediately, grabbing onto the surface of the sheath like your life depended on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery step Munchlax gave rocked your world, making you feel like you were in an earthquake. Your teeth clattered, you felt like all your bones were threatened to be pulverized just from the movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe incline proved to be too much of a problem, though. Slowly but surely, you started sliding down the sheath. Your arms were not even close to hugging not even the top part of Munchlax's dick, much less all of it to stop you from sliding, you felt yourself go down. Looking downwards, you saw the end not too far away -- the curve of the tip of the sheath leading to nothingness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurviving that fall was going to be quite the challenge! And even if you did, you would be in danger of Munchlax stepping on you. Being small gave you some toughness you didn't have before, but you weren't sure you wouldn't survive something like Munchlax stepping on you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pressed yourself against the sheath, trying to stop your descent, just managing to slow it down somewhat. It was only matter of time before you'd be sent careening off Munchlax's dick and towards the ground. It didn't help that the surface of Munchlax's sheath was covered with short, pointy hairs. Trying to cling on it felt like you were throwing yourself on blunt needles, the sensation being almost painful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one thing you had clear, though: you had to do everything in your power to not fall down!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried once again to slow your descent, succeeding somewhat. Your mind races, considering what could happen. Looking behind you, the tip is merely an inch away. A desperate idea crossed your mind: the tip meant there'd be a hole there. If you could get into it, that'd save your life. You weren't looking forward to getting in close quarters with Munchlax's dick resting inside the sheath, but if it saved your life...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you left that as your very last option. Instead, you grasp the surface of the sheath again, praying Munchlax would stop walking anytime soon.</span></div></div>",

The end of your fuzzy, short-haired slide is fast approaching. Another one of Munchlax\u2019s footsteps jostles his sheathe, quaking your Earth and sending you that much closer to a long, long fall.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tYour feet kick air. Your hips hang on the lip of the fuzzy slide. The side of your face pressed deep into the musty fur, you look to the right. You see the unmistakable shimmer of Munchlax\u2019s undercoat as his great legs shift the hairs around\u2014moving in for another step. If that foot crashes to the ground, you\u2019re a goner. Unless\u2026<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t...You take shelter.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tThinking at light-speed, you allow yourself to slip further down. Holding on to the top of Munchlax\u2019s sheathe by your fingertips, you come face-to-dick with the rounded opening of the Big Eater\u2019s sheathe. It\u2019s like the wrinkled top of a pulled bag, the type you tighten the top with strings. It\u2019s teal; darkness and furry flesh hide the revulsive thing that lurks within.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tYou don\u2019t have much of a choice. You grab onto a hair\u2014longer than the others. You kick off but hold on, building momentum in your swing. When it's time for you to come boomeranging back, you let go\u2014praying your momentum is enough to send you further in. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tIt is.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The puckered opening swallows your view as you come crashing in. You\u2019re consumed, readily. The menagerie of wild scents that mingled in Munchlax\u2019s fur disappear. You\u2019re punched with a musk beyond imagining. It\u2019s a masculine scent, brimming with testosterone and spiced with the nose-wrinkling smell of sweat. The walls are yielding, but cramped. Inside, the fur coats everything like a musky carpet. Soft skin squishes at you from all sides. Your vision is blocked from wandering too far within by pressed together walls of short-haired flesh. Thank the stars above; you can\u2019t see the pink terror that\u2019s surely further down.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0All is good\u2014for a moment. Munchlax\u2019s footpaw stamps down, sending a bone-jostling rumble through his lower body. His dick flops up and down\u2014not a big deal to Munchlax, but most certainly for you. Your legs and hips, still free, begin sliding backwards\u2014taking you with them. You panic, scrambling in the only direction you know: deeper. Your fingers drum against the wool, dancing as they look for a handhold to pull you in. They do\u2014and you\u2019re very lucky Munchlax did not feel that. Your elbows bend 90 degrees as you strain your chest, hoisting you in with their microscopic muscles. You\u2019re gobbled up to your belly button, then your waist. Soon enough, only your legs remain. You waste no time to move those in too, making it look like Munchlax\u2019s genitals slurped your legs in like spaghetti.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Now completely enveloped, from your head to your toes, you brush away the sweaty hairs that poke you from every which way. You\u2019re lost in them, nearly blinded in the darkness. You grab fill your fists with fur, holding onto the musky stuff as your cylindrical constrainment bobs up and down, shuffling freely with Munchlax\u2019s gait. Sweat pricks your brow, surprising you as you come to notice the heat. It didn\u2019t occur to you before\u2014but where you are now, it\u2019s a lot like a greenhouse. You\u2019re hidden away in a musky grotto, sealed beneath thick lard and fur. And above that, his privates broil beneath a triple-coat of husky fur. The heat worsens the smell, which was not pleasant to begin with. Now, you realize, it\u2019s clear: Munchlax does not know proper hygiene. That much, you can smell. Unwashed, musky fur peels open your nostrils, allowing the pungent funk old seed to waltz right in. It\u2019s sweaty, greasy, and overall unpleasant. And once your hand happens upon a suspiciously crusty section of fur\u2014you immediately wish you took your chances with the drop.<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\u2014 \u2014 \u2014</div><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Purrloin\u2019s plan goes swimmingly. She dons a goofy voice, cartoonishly evil, declaring that she\u2014Meowth\u2014was Smeargle\u2019s dastardly pranker! (Who always worked alone and never had a Munchlax partner!)<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Afterwards, she waits a minute, slaps on a cute, squeaky voice, and asks if anyone is behind the wine cellar door.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cYes! Hello! Help!\u201d</span> Smeargle shouts with cupped hands, or at least you assume. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cI\u2019m locked in here! Blessed Gracideas, please tell me you have the key!\u201d</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cMm-hmm.\u201d</span> Purrloin hums, still in a false voice. <span class=\"cgrape\">\u201cI\u2019ll unlock it! But don\u2019t rush out right away! I\u2019m small\u2014you\u2019ll crush me!\u201d</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cOh dear,\u201d</span> Smeargle\u2019s voice wavers through the door, <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cthank you!\u201d</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Back in your musty, hairy world, you\u2019re sweating more bullets than a SMG. The hair around you is wet; you\u2019re drenched. Worst of all, you\u2019re pretty dang sure most of it's not yours\u2026<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You sense your dripping universe lift as Munchlax adjusts himself. You hear scratching ring out from below you. Yep\u2014it\u2019s exactly what it sounds like. Your chest deflates. You just got an intimate listening of Munchlax\u2019s ball scratching.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A hissed whisper somehow pierces through Munchlax\u2019s sweltering sheathe. \u201cMunchlax! The key!\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cteal\">\u201cOh.\u201d</span> He says. You hear the scritch-scratch of his claws digging through his fur before it stops\u2014looks like he\u2019s found it.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Click and clack. The key fits perfectly. You hear a rapid-fire pattering of feet as Purrloin speeds off, faster than wind. Munchlax is left in the dust. You feel his body shift as he tilts, looking left, then right. He realizes he should be moving. He plods away at a gentle pace.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cHello?\u201d</span> Smeargle meekly says,<span class=\"ctan\"> \u201ccan I come out now? Is\u2026 the door unlocked?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\u2014 \u2014 \u2014</div><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0By counting your unaware captor\u2019s steps, you\u2019re able to keep track of the time. It\u2019s been about thirty minutes. It feels like it\u2019s been thirty hours. Somehow, the mustiness of this Arceus-forsaken realm has increased. You think it\u2019s because the stench has been wearing you down, worming into your head\u2014simply making you more aware of the repugnance of unwashed genitals. At least, that\u2019s what you hope. The other implications are\u2026 unpleasant.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You wash your lungs in funk as you swallow a deep breath. Munchlax has been walking for quite some time. Where is he going? Is he meeting up with Purrloin for a rendevouz at some previously-established place? Or is he clomping back to his room\u2014retiring early for the day?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0An abrupt halting smushes you against a moist patch of wet fur. You feel your world wobble as Munchlax tottles, kicking his legs wildly as he tries to keep his balance. A clatter crashes through the air. Munchlax falls on his butt, sending a planet-rippling shockwave right through you. Once he finds his bearings, you hear a voice\u2014concerned.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</b> You have a hard time discerning the gender.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cteal\">\u201cUh\u2026 I think?\u201d</span> Munchlax fumbles.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry!

Seriously, I'm so sorry\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMunchlax subtly passed a claw over the food that was splattered over his fur, tasting it. Not bad! He turned his head to glance at the Pokemon who had pretty much bathed him with a free lunch. Raichu, was it? What was it Purrloin said about this one? 'Raichu has gotten so clumsy since they evolved. It must be their feet, they turned huge'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetter not comment about those feet. Munchlax let himself be pushed towards the couch, where he was asked to sit. Not long afterwards, Raichu returned with a towel, giving it to the Pokemon they had inconvenienced so much. <span class=\"cdorange\">\"Here, you really need it\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"...I guess? I didn't really mind\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\"I'm so sorry about this, I should have watched where I was walking</span>\" Raichu sat on the other end of the couch. <span class=\"cdorange\">\"I promise I'm going to give you something special. Purrloin is getting something too\"</span> oh, Purrloin was getting something too? She was going to be glad to hear that. Munchlax tried again to say she was waiting for him, but Raichu once again stopped him. <span class=\"cdorange\">\"Wait, let's tak a little. It's the least I can do for you! So, tell me</span>\" Raichu's lackadaisical tone changed, acquiring a seriousness that was still tinged with concern. <span class=\"cdorange\">\"This Purrloin...how has she been treating you?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething is going on, you can tell that much. Munchlax apparently couldn't, but you did.You wormed your way to the hole of the sheath, listening attentively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Um...my friend?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\"She treats you well, right? I have heard she's not the nicest Pokemon around\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"She is my friend. I like her and we have been friends for years\"</span> Munchlax sounded genuinely fond of her. <span class=\"cteal\">\"The other day she brought me this shiny thing she had found, and she said that was my part for...something I did. I don't even remember what it was\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\"Oh. That so?\"</span> Raichu's voice hinted they were annoyed. That wasn't what Raichu had hoped to hear? You admit you were a bit surprised to hear Purrloin treated her lackey with what seemed to be friendliness. She had seemed a little too rough to do that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Yep. You bringing her? You said you're giving us something special\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\"...I said that, didn't I\"</span> you heard noises outside. While Raichu rummaged somewhere else, they kept asking:<span class=\"cdorange\"> \"Are you sure there's nothing you want to tell me about her? I have heard she has been stealing stuff around in the tree and other places. Have you helped her?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Sure. Why wouldn't I?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\"Because...thievery is kinda bad\"</span> Raichu mumbled. In that moment you had the nagging suspicion the whole thing about hitting Munchlax with food was a ploy to get him into this room, and talk to him about Purrloin. Perhaps Raichu had expected something different? Like a reason for Munchlax to tattle about many, many crimes Purrloin had done?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Smeargle disliked criminals so much then he really managed to screw up when Purrloin was accepted as a resident in the tree. You hoped she got there before the beagle had his current job as head of security.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\"But I guess you don't really want to talk about her...that's fine. I will give you something nice and special for your time\"</span> they sounded so disappointed. <span class=\"cdorange\">\"Here. This is kinda my specialty\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">All that? For me?</span>\" you could practically hear the tears of joy in Munchlax's eyes. Whatever meal Raichu had just offered must be really worthwhile!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\"Of course. I just ask that if you remember anything you tell me. I really want to know more about her\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever Raichu had in mind must be rather important. You take a decision rather quickly:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince you're so aware of Purrloin's devilry, you could give Raichu the information they wanted. If what they wanted was someone to tell them about what that cat had done, you were more than willing to speak! Just today she had done enough to warrant some justice, in your opinion! And you were sure there had to be more in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe problem was reaching Raichu. You doubted you had much time to do it, just until Munchlax was done eating whatever food Raichu had just given him. You peered outside of the sheath. Since Munchlax was sitting down, you judged there was a good chance you'd be able to descend without being in mortal danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you could get out, sneak through Munchlax's fur, and get on the couch, you could let Munchlax leave and then you'd have a nice talk with Raichu. They seemed to be nice enough, although a little deceitful, judging by how they had lured Munchlax in this room with a scheme. You had no reason to believe you'd be treated badly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact you were in a hurry to leave your current filthy transport was another factor, you had to admit. You were willing to take your chances by descending now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving taken a decision, you start getting out of the sheath, intending to descend and talk to Raichu.</div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next hour passed by incredibly slowly. Just like he said he would, Nidoking settled on the floor, curling and starting to snore so loudly you idly wondered if you'd be able to sleep. You wouldn't, regardless. The guilt was gnawing at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the time telling Nidoking was your only choice. You knew that very well, but if you had the chance to turn back time and be on that exact moment again you wouldn't have mentioned Honchkrow. Chances are you would have instead chosen Noibat. Unlike Honchkrow, Noibat had absolutely no redeeming qualities you could recall in the brief time you knew it. On the other hand, Honchkrow had shown concern for you and not a hint of aggression at first. You had believed his friendliness and, even after having offended you greatly, he tried to appease you by going back all the way to where you met, all to pick up a fork that would be useless to you anyway. That was meant to be a sign of apology, wasn't it? You peered at the fork lying to a side, forgotten. Maybe he took so long to return because finding it was difficult. You wonder if he had thought he couldn't return without it because you wouldn't forgive him. Quite presumptuous of him to believe a fork would be enough to solve the ill will you had towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Honchkrow was on the verge of death, and you were pretty much complicit for it. Despite how upset you were, you really had hoped Nidoking wouldn't go this far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bunch of cloth that was your bed right now seemed oppressive to you right now, so you got off and walked around, trying to clear your mind. Nidoking continued sleeping, oblivious to your turmoil, and there were no other noises in the entire manor. It was like you had the entire place to yourself. You were sure you'd have to stay in this place for quite some time, given your size and the hostility of the world outside. The thought of being in the vicinity of Nidoking after this was disquieting, even though you knew Nidoking had nothing against you, but it was freaking you out nonetheless. You approached the slumbering Nidoking, until you were so close you could place a hand on his leathery purple hide on his bacj.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere underneath that hide was Honchkrow. You kept remembering vividly the moment he disappeared inside that formidable, humongous body. The purple skin...although different in color, it was close enough to the Noibat that had eaten you not that long ago. That Noibat had forsaken you to the same fate Honchkrow was suffering now, a horrible death inside a stomach. Back then you would have been very grateful for someone helping you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonchkrow would be grateful now. Frowning, you walked around him. THe trek took you quite the considerable amount of time, until you were facing his belly. There was absolutely no hint of Honchkrow. Not surprising, given Nidoking was extraordinarily large. Somewhere beneath that hide the bird was...was he still alive? You approached, until you placed your ear against the belly. Nidoking was fast asleep and seemed to be a heavy sleeper, and even if he wasn't, you doubted someone of your size could ever wake him up. Closing your eyes, you listened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first all you hear are gurgles. When you were about to give up, you hear something else, a faint shuffling of feathers. That had to be him! \"Honchkrow?\" you said aloud. Would your voice even get through the thick skin?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently it did. <span class=\"cnavy\">\"Help me!\"</span> Not even a greeting, he went straight to the help request. Things must be getting rather rough in there. \"I don't want to die, you have to help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't want you to die, I just...\" things had just gotten out of control, that was all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"I'm sorry, I'm really sorry, I-I just wanted to help, I swear I was just trying to help!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about your...your...\" you felt so disgusted you couldn't even mention it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Look, that was an accident, I'm sorry, I didn't want to use you as a toy! I really, really wanted to help you!\"</span> he pleaded. You were sure he was crying his eyes out. <span class=\"cnavy\">\"You can't-You can't leave me here!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was right. You couldn't. Not if you wanted to be able to ever sleep again. \"Do you think you can resist for a while longer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Everything feels itchy in here!\"</span> That couldn't be a good sign. It would be matter of hours before the bird would get digested. Stepping back, you consider the situation. Nidoking was incredibly large, so much his insides would be monumentally roomy for you. The problem was that you didn't know what you could do. Entering Nidoking would be very easy, doing anything of use would be the difficult part, given your size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, Honchkrow was in a slightly more favorable position to escape. You had managed to do that when you were in a stomach, but you were much smaller than Honchkrow, and had a more level-head than the bird did. You were sure that, without help, Honchkrow would perish. Maybe you could give him instructions so he would attempt a escape by himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth were much easier said than done, you realized. You...</span></div></div>",

You never thought you'd see the king on the verge of a panic attack that most likely would be violent. Nidoking shuffles away from you, dragging his feet, and closes all the doors of the room, making sure nobody could open them from the outside. After that, he slams his head against one of them, grumbling:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"You cannot tell anyone about what you saw\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? That's all you have to say?\" you said caustically, your voice almost as venomous as Nidoking's poison. He turns his head around, his blind eyes pointing in your direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Look, this is not good. Not only the rest cannot find out about this for obvious reasons, I cannot keep that birdbrain inside my gut where he is. Don't you get it? If he gets stuck for too long, we <i>both</i> die. I have lived for a very long time, the last thing I need is to die because some idiot got lodged in my intestines!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd say that would be quite the karmic death, but you refrain from commenting that. \"Can't your body, you know, push him along?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"He's too big! It would take ages, and I already told you he could get stuck!\"</span> he places a claw again on his lower body.<span class=\"cmagenta\"> \"I can feel him moving very slowly. We'll have to hurry things up, and you will help me\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What exactly are you asking me to do?\" you asked with some trepidation. Nidoking hurried to a shelf rather high in the air and passed a claw over it, taking all the contents in his hand. You hadn't seen before what was up there, so when he approaches and tosses everything in front of you, you take a good look at the very bizarre objects. They were bizarre not because they were strange, they were bizarre because of their size. They were tiny objects. Industrial clothing, a gas mask, a helmet with a light, a pickaxe, several other mining tools, rope, other assorted resistant clothing that was frayed and corroded. You weren't sure what to ask other than: \"What's this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"A long time ago, back when I hadn't evolved not even once yet, there was a human in this area. A miner, I believe. They and their stuff were shrunk for a reason I don't remember and they lived around until their untimely death. Among their stuff there was this electric rod, I want you to take it\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe it. Someone had gone through your same situation before! And...apparently they had died. That sure didn't make you feel any better. Still, this was something you needed to remember. You pick up the tool you were indicated. \"Now what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat followed was better than you expected. Nidoking laid on the floor and placed you on his belly, indicating a spot amidst the armored stomach. You walked to that point and pressed the point of the tool against the tough hide. Nidoking had said they'd need to stimulate his guts so they would push Honchkrow along, so you obeyed and pressed the button to send an electric zap through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing happened. You tried again and again, all the sparks emerging and disappearing almost instantly. It didn't take you long to realize what was going on: Nidoking was part Ground-type! Of course this wasn't going to work on his skin. You inform Nidoking of that.<span class=\"cmagenta\"> \"No, no, no! This is unacceptable!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't my fault!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"I know, I just...</span>\" the king had the good grace not to move suddenly.<span class=\"cmagenta\"> \"Alright. I didn't want to ask you this, but these are desperate times. I want you to go inside of me and do it from the inside. That should work\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere it was. The request you were dreading all along. \"What?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"All you have to do is enter through my rear end, reach Honchkrow, and lead him along by zapping the walls of my small intestine with that stick. I believe once he reaches my colon my body can take care of the rest at its own pace. There's more space, so-\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you crazy?!\" you blurted out. \"You know what you're asking me to do?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"I'm aware! That's why I'm willing to do anything you ask afterwards. You'll be rewarded!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least the offer of a reward was there. You decided to take advantage of this.<span class=\"cmagenta\"> \"I have three conditions. If you don't accept any of them, I won't help you\"</span> you were tempted to say they were demands, but you didn't want Nidoking to think you were cravenly taking advantage of his pain, even if you totally were. Nidoking grunted, but listened nonetheless. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\"One. I want you to spare Honchkrow once he's out\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I feared you would ask that of me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Promise it!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNidoking was silent for a moment before nodding. \"Fine. What are the other two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"I also want to stay in this manor for a while. I'm not sure how long\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going to offer that anyway\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"And last, I want you to tell me everything you know about the small human from long ago. Understood?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat one Nidoking didn't expect at all. He raised his head, glancing at you with what you interpreted as an inquisitive expression. Had you perhaps blown your cover? Nidoking was silent for a rather long minute, until... <span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Alright. I shall tell you everything. I accept your conditions\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe preparations for the rather unpleasant task you signed up to do were quick. Nidoking, being afraid something could happen to you, encouraged you to root through the miner's shrunken items. \"You should take the helmet with the light. Does it fit you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"It's tight, but I can handle it\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed to be an answer Nidoking expected now. Now you were sure: he definitely knew now you were a tiny human. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Take the gas mask and the gloves too. Those can save your life\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How, exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Have you forgotten? I'm a Poison-type. Almost everything inside me is <i>toxic</i>. Honchkrow should be okay, if a tad ill for a few days, but you're much smaller. You may not resist like he can\"</span> That made sense to you. You donned the gas mask. It was certainly not going to protect you against smells, but it would at least keep you safe from airborne toxins.<span class=\"cmagenta\"> \"Do you remember the plan?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou held high the electric device. \"Poke the lining of your intestines with this every time Honchkrow gets stuck. It will contract the walls and push him further along the way\" You tested the lamp on the helmet. It was rather strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Exactly. Push him to my large intestine and then you and him will go along for the ride. I...\"</span> he apologetically bowed his head and sighed, like what he was going to say was rather painful for him. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\"I'm sorry I'm making you do this. This is rather humiliating for both of us\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not getting any kind of pleasure from this, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Of course not! What are you thinking?!\"</span> he roared, offended and bewildered. That was a relief to you. You really preferred someone reluctant instead of someone who was looking forward to having you inside their body. Having made the preparations, Nidoking extended his hand on the floor, beckoning you to ride it. You held onto his thumb while he raised his hand to his face for a few last words. <span class=\"crose\">\"I wish you the best of luck. I promise you I will fulfill all of your conditions\"</span> and with that, he positioned himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Nidoking laid on his belly on the floor, grunting at the discomfort, and barely managed to move his hand to his behind. He laboriously moved his tail aside, and held his hand in front of his anus, barely open for you. You were right in front of the muscular slit that would lead deep into the king, and he was doing you the courtesy of letting you do this at your own pace. Now that you were about to start, you made sure the gas mask was well placed, turned on the light on the helmet, and went all over the plan in your head again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, this seemed like an herculean task to you. You had fit in Honchkrow's rectum. It wasn't big, but you had managed to fit in with more than enough space to move. Now that giant-to-you bird was inside Nidoking, and Nidoking was many, many, <i>many</i> times larger than Honchkrow. The width of the small intestine would be humongous to you, you doubted you would even be able to jump up and reach halfway, or even one quarter towards the ceiling. If one of the narrowest passageways inside Nidoking was that big, how would the more spacious areas, such as his colon, be to you? How long would it take you to traverse so much of his guts and reach Honchkrow? It could take you hours! Maybe even days -- or not, you guessed, but it would be a rather long time before you made progress. You wished you had climbing gear, in case any slope or wall proved to be too much for you to handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was the other option of entering through the king's mouth. He could easily swallow you, but then there was a big problem: his stomach. Any contents inside would be like a lake to you. Would you even be able to dive to the bottom? Diving through Noibat's stomach had strained your lungs, this would be almost impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really hoped Honchkrow's survival and anything Nidoking could tell you about the human who went through your same fate would be worth it.</span></div></div>",

And, despite all you\u2019ve witnessed, you\u2019re not going to let two Pokemon die. A grim determination sparks in your breast. Soon, it blossoms into a burning valor.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>You can do this!</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You stick your hand in. Regret.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0An awful warmness and a sickening sensation assaulted your hand as it slipped in with a repulsive squishing sound. Your fingers wiggle inside, tickling wet flesh that writhe in reciprocation. Your hand glides deeper as if it had a mind of its own, drawn in by slipperiness of the lizard\u2019s backport. Now you\u2019re up to your elbow as the muscles inside ripple and twitch, coaxing the foreign object to head ever deeper.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cmagenta\">...Can you speed things up just a notch?</span>\u201d You can feel the rumble of Nidoking\u2019s voice through his pliant flesh. \u201c<span class=\"cmagenta\">The faster this is done, the less memories for the both of us.</span>\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You sigh and do as he asks. You wedge your other hand in, prying a miniscule opening for yourself to slip into. You see two pink walls, slick with slimy lubricant: the king\u2019s inner tailhole \u2014 the final barrier sealing his innards from your reluctant invasion. A world-destroying odor leaks through and threatens to devour your soul.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You press on anyway. You shove your head in and are met with a execrable combo of overpowering heat and monstrous stench. The result of their sinful synergy is so unpleasant that it\u2019s comparable to a hell \u2014 it feels as if the fumes could burn your skin to the bone. Darkness yields to light as your miner cap reveals secrets best left to the shadows.  A behemothic tunnel of horrid flesh breathes with life of its own, shifting, oscillating, and stirring as it continues to serve its fetid purpose as the end of Nidoking\u2019s abhorrent system. The soppy and slimy sounds of muscle-on-muscle saturate the foul-smelling hellscape, conducted by the steady rhythm of a bass-rich heartbeat.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You go deeper. You wriggle your way in, carving your way through an ocean of flesh. The circlet of muscle chews around your waist like toothless gums. An all-encompassing groan besieges you as Nidoking\u2019s tail arches and lifts as his anal muscles clench. You\u2019re effortlessly swallowed. Sucked in like a slurped noodle.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You are ejected onto an organic floor with a splat: prone. You brace your hands against the colon, giving you the support to stand. Nidoking's innards are gigantic. The intestinal ceiling looms above, shiny from its coating of foul fluid. Veins and arteries dance along the cavern\u2019s surface, painting a twisted pattern of muted red and blue. You see the passage curves downward but that\u2019s all you can discern before your light dissolves into darkness.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cmagenta\">Best of luck,</span>\u201d Nidoking\u2019s voice booms as if he were the voice of Arceus itself. \u201c<span class=\"cmagenta\">And thank you.</span>\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You take some steps forward. The sound of your bare feet slapping against the organ that is now your earth echoes through your mind. There is no doubt in your mind now. You left your old world behind. Now you are at the mercy of a world of meat. So small, that if Nidoking hadn\u2019t helped put you in himself, he would never know you are there.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nidorous air, the poison filtered but the stench remaining, burns your nasal passages like acid. Yet, you soldier on. You broil as you venture deeper, down the bend of the rectum and up an incline that would be slight if you were not the size of an ant. You struggle to clamber over. The intestinal floor, slick with natural lubricant, causes your hands and feet to skate across the glossy plane. Only by finding handholds in the wrinkles and ridges of the king\u2019s flesh are you able to surmount your first trial.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You\u2019re greeted with soul-crushing revelation: you only passed the rectum. The incline goes on for far longer, its true distance obscured in shadow. Now you are in the large intestine. Your journey is far, far from over.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For you, this is like climbing a mountain. You toil through the night, or at least you assume the night. Your skies are sunless. Daylight does not fall \u2014 only revolting slime. The only way you know it is still night are the baritone snores of Nidoking. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Just as you pull yourself into a fold in the monster\u2019s flesh, you feel everything move. Turning, rotating \u2014 Nidoking is flipping himself over in his sleep. You hold on to the intestinal wall for your life as the entire world works against you. You can\u2019t let go! All your work will be undone! All of your blood, sweat, and tears as you toiled \u2014 wasted. You can\u2019t! <b><i>You can\u2019t!</i></b><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You let go, plunging into the darkness as you witness hours of work evaporate.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You plummet. Your slam into the soft wall and splatter into slime. Gravity peels you off as you descend further until your descent is halted by the colon floor. You\u2019re back at the beginning. But you\u2019re not beaten \u2014 not yet. You got to stand before a distant, familiar, and dreadful rumbling fills you with despair. Nidoking\u2019s great organs groan as you watch a rapid contraction speed towards you, carrying a malodorous payload. He farted. Even filtered, the miasma poisons your soul.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0May Azelf grant you strength\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">    \u25d3   \u25d3   \u25d3   \u25d3</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It\u2019s almost been a day. ...At least you think it\u2019s been that long. You remember the grueling ordeal that was making up for your lost progress. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You remember being assaulted by fumes, heat, and all the evils that fester within the deepest depths of the Poison-type. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Worst of all was when Nidoking awoke. The belabored groans of him and his tummy alike fill your ears with a deep rumble. His thunderous, quaking steps rocked the world, wobbling his innards and bouncing you every which way as if you were trapped in a bouncy, inflatable castle during an earthquake. Your tiny calls for help failed to reach even Nidoking\u2019s sensitive ears. It\u2019s clear: nothing was ever meant to live here.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But somehow, you made it. Nidoking fell asleep again and that was when you made most of your progress. You scaled the twisting internal mountain, against all odds. Now \u2014 you see it. The entrance (or is it exit?) of Nidoking\u2019s small intestine. The ginormous sphincter lays tightly closed but you\u2019ve come too far to be stopped.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAlright birdbrain,\u201d you mutter, \u201cyou better be thankful\u2026\u201d You scale to the sealed opening of the orifice and force your way in. You groan as you\u2019re squeezed by its stauch grasp and mashed by its unyielding muscle. Enveloped wholey, surrounded by pink crushing walls, shrouded in darkness, the light of your cap blocked. For a moment, you fear you\u2019ll be stuck there forever \u2014 blind and binded with only the grumblings and groans of Nidoking\u2019s organs for company. After what seems like a forever-and-a-half, you breach through. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You fall into another fleshed tube: Nidoking\u2019s small intestine. Landing into a tickling barrage of threadlike villi, you\u2019re held aloft like a crowd surfing rockstar. The horrid stench of the colon abates greatly, much to your relief. Little fluid exists graces this part of the intestine. Either Nidoking\u2019s anatomy differs greatly from Noibat\u2019s or Honchkrow is a darn good plug.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The intestines are winding, far more than the colon. Much to your relief, you find that villi\u2019s presence to be an invaluable climbing aid. You trek through the living forest of villi, combating the natural flow and peristalsis of the intestines. A fire reignites in your belly. You are <i>not </i>going back the way you came. Not without a big bird in tow.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It\u2019s impossible to say how far you traveled. You could\u2019ve traveled halfway, a quarterway, you could\u2019ve even been right at the end of the monarch\u2019s royal tract. Distance is unfathomable and time doesn\u2019t exist. All you know is that you knew you arrived at your destination when you saw a big black taloned foot emerge from the darkness. It\u2019s Honchkrow!<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He\u2019s stuck fast, the loathsome tunnel suctioned around his form like an air-tight bag. To your relief, you notice his feet kick and his tail sway slightly, brushing the roof of the cavern. He\u2019s alive, even if he might be wishing he wasn\u2019t.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHey Featherbutt \u2014 it\u2019s me!\u201d You shout at his, well... feathery butt. Instantly the bird\u2019s struggles renew.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cplum\">Mm-<b>mmph!</b></span>\u201d The crow hails you.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cListen up: this is going to be weird\u2026 but I\u2019m going to get us out.\u201d You whip out your electrical rod and set it on the intestinal wall. \u201cIt\u2019s probably going to take a while so, uh, hang in there!\u201d You activate the tool\u2026</span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The entire reason why you're inside Nidoking's guts was because his skin impided the electricity from reaching his organs. Now that you were inside the organ itself, you definitely could see everything was squishier, much wetter, and hopefully much easier to zap. If this didn't work, you were ready to just lie down and curse everything and everyone. Crossing your fingers for a favorable result, you activate the rod. Sparks shine at the end, spreading through the wall. The reaction is immediate all around you. The walls contract, compressing Honchkrow and making him try to protest, a weak whisper being all he manages to say. He can't even do the \"mm-mmph\" noises from how tight it is. Thankfully, you being so small, you don't experience the contraction of the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your light, you see Honchkrow start moving. Relieved, you extract the rod. \"This will work! We'll get out of here!\". You tell Honchkrow. You climb one of his talons, clinging to it like it's a lifesaver in a tumultous sea. \"Don't worry, I will keep everything moving\". It was a promise you intended to keep no matter what. True, the return trip would also take a while, given you had to lug the crow with you, but the fact this was going well was enough to lift your spirits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonchkrow must have felt you get on his foot, because he doesn't move as much from there on, or at least you hoped it was because of that instead of because the constant compressions knocked him out. That was just as likely, you had to admit. Maybe that would be for the better. Less resistance would make this easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like Nidoking had feared, although the intestine kept moving its oversized contents along, Honchkrow did get stuck a few times along the way. Every time you leaned and stuck the rod into the wall, activating it and forcing the muscles to do their job. You were glad Nidoking was currently asleep, the sensations you and Honchkrow were causing couldn't feel good at all. Despite that, to you it felt almost like a leisurely ride down a river. The sounds of sloshing and gurgles close to you contributed a lot to the impression you had of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it wasn't because you were inside a creature and in the middle of its digestive system, you almost would find this pleasant. Alas, the reminder you were currently getting something unstuck from Nidoking's guts was always present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now you had lost track of time. You had no idea how much time passed when you saw in the distance the sphincter that divided the small and large intestine. Now that there was a much larger object about to pass through it, you hoped it would be enough to coax it to open far more than it did when you were trying. \"Okay, you'll have to stay completely still, birdbrain\" you advised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Mmmmph?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll have a little bit of freedom in just a moment\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like a slow-motion collision. The talons hit the sphincter, but the round hole did not budge. You were forced to ascend up Honchkrow's leg until you reached his thigh. This wasn't supposed to happen. Maybe you'd have to use the rod here too? You extended the rod forward in that direction, with enough bad luck it slips through the pinprick hole on the sphincter. Having received something, the muscles snatch the rod off your hands, passing it into the colon. You're left without it. \"Oh, come on!\" More of Honchkrow is pressed, until you yourself experience it as well. The sphincter hits you, pressing you against the feathers behind you. You have wet flesh against one side of you, and soaked feathers on your other side. It's by far one of the most unpleasant sensations you have experienced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a battle to see what will yield first: Honchkrow, or the sphincter. Luckily for you - or perhaps unluckily, later you'd ponder - there's a build-up of liquid following Honchkrow. The pressure of not only the crow's body, but also the day-old stomach contents Honchkrow kept blocked from going through, forced the sphincter to open violently, finally letting you and Honchkrow go inside, fast like a cork. You're thrown off Honchkrow, falling to the spongy floor while the bird twists around, trying to adjust his position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou barely had time to shake your head when something enveloped you. It was like thick tar flowed over you, like treacle of a rather unpleasant acrid color, the former stomach contents pooling at the start of the colon, ready to start being processed. You can't move, and you're on borrowed time. This can't be how it ends for you! You were still trying to get out when something scooped you out, tossing you a safe distance away from the pooling sludge. Trying to get as much of the fluids off yourself, you see Honchkrow saved you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crow had managed to turn around, his head in the center of the colon. Nidoking was right, there really was a lot more space here. <span class=\"cnavy\">\"Are you okay?\"</span> it asked, genuinely concerned. You nodded. Honchkrow wheezes: <span class=\"cnavy\">\"It stinks it here!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you waiting for? Start crawling!\" He didn't need to be told twice. Much to Honchkrow's chagrin, there was still a constant trickle of sludge leaking through the ileum, the sludge level raising more. After letting you get on his wing, he tries his best to worm his way through the colon, with you clinging to him. It was no wonder Honchkrow could get stuck, his usually fluffy feathers felt like they had absorbed a lot of stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a lot of effort from Honchkrow, but he only managed to crawl for a short while before collapsing. \"I can't-I can't keep moving! I'm exhausted!\" he complained, slumping over. You sighed, resigned. The intestine would have to finish the job for you both, you guessed. And so it did, albeit at a glacial pace. <span class=\"cnavy\">\"So...so now what?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we wait\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Do you think it'll be for long? This place, it...it reeks! It's worse than the stomach!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't in mood for inane comments, especially not after having been in this exact place for quite a while already. \"You know what this place <i>does</i>, don't you? Of course it's not going to smell like a bed of roses\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"W-w-wait, that's bad, right? We entered with something but that doesn't mean we'll get out with it, right?\"</span> You didn't answer, strangely numb to such thought. Waste leaving alongside you and Honchkrow would be one disgrace more in a list that was already long. Still, you hoped Honchkrow's crawling had outrun that sludge enough to give you time to get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just hope Nidoking lets us out first thing in the morning. Less likely his digestive system is done with his food if he does\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation died, until it restarted when Honchkrow asked something you didn't expect:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Was it...was it like this when I pushed you inside my butt?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty much\" you lied. It had been bad, but this was worse, you judged. Honchkrow's beak clicked, he seemed to be on the verge of crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Oh, Arceus, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. I had no idea it'd be this bad\". You appreciated the apology, but you didn't acknowledge it. \"...listen, when I offered to carry you there, I really didn't think of you as a toy\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what I saw, Honchkrow\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"I know! I just...look, it made me remember something I did when I was just a Murkrow\".</span> Honchkrow then started explaining how that similar situation, retouched to make that Joltik sound much more willing than it actually was. You listened, not having any other option, and although it all had a lot more detail than you'd have liked, it was a bit of a relief. Honchkrow hadn't intentionally used you, it was an unfortunate coincidence. You patted Honchkrow, distant and aloof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get it. Let's just forget that ever happened\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"I'm really sorry, if I can do anything to compensate you...\"</span> he wiggled, an idea coming to mind. <span class=\"cnavy\">\"Wait, I could be your bodyguard while you stay in this manor!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I doubt anyone will mess with me if they know I have Nidoking's favor\". Besides, you didn't have much faith in Honchkrow being a good bodyguard. The crow didn't give up:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Then I'll be your...your vehicle? Yes? Yes! If you ever need to fly anywhere I'll take you\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was more appealing, you had to admit, with one condition: \"I'm not letting you eat me in any manner. Think of a way to carry me that doesn't involve being inside you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"I will, I'll think of something! But...does this mean we're friends again?</span>\" you looked up. Through the light from the helmet you saw Honchkrow's hopeful expression. There wasn't even an ounce of hard feeling, just an eagerness to please.

Despite the sweltering heat of Nidoking\u2019s internals, you feel a certain \u2014 different \u2014 warmth bloom around your heart.

It was like this, except um...uh...</span>\u201d a blast of foul-smelling air blows past you, disturbing your fleshy enclosure as the world rumbles with the sleeping lizard\u2019s accompanying satisfied groan.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c...Except everything.\u201d You finish. Honchkrow silently shuffles forward. Hopefully he\u2019s staying quiet out of agreement and you didn\u2019t ruin your friend\u2019s \u201cbest\u201d moment. Although, Nidoking seems to be trying his damndest to ruin it too. Honchkrow is doing his best to crawl along, fast as he can. But the purple lizard\u2019s guts, sensing a new heavier object in the colon, continually squeeze Honchkrow with a relentless and mindless ardor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Honchkrow shuffles forward through the never-ending tunnel, his feathers soaked with stink. By now, his beak began to clatter again. A bit ago he was chronicling a tale of how his tail feathers once caught in one of the manor\u2019s doors, leaving him stuck for hours. Now, you have no clue what he\u2019s talking about. You tuned out long ago. One word, however, rang loud and clear.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cplum\">Aaaah!</span>\u201d Honchkrow cries as the wall close in on him again. Their cruel grip pushes the bird forward, his form sliding around a bend and getting smeared with intestinal juices. Another wave of peristalsis knocks the wind out of the Dark-type as he\u2019s thrust forward once more. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And then you\u2019re upside down \u2014 the both of you.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The colon walls lock your feathery vessel in place with a slimy, powerful grapple. Suspended in air, Honchkrow hangs above an abyss. Your weak light petters out long before it reaches the bottom. All it reveals is the glistening walls of Nidoking\u2019s colon tightening and loosening, ebbing and flowing...<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You hang from Honchkrow\u2019s neck, your fist full of the soppy strands of his down.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHonchkrow!\u201d You shout, \u201care you okay?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cplum\">I\u2019m fine!</span>\u201d Honchkrow croaks, reluctant to replenish the air he lost with the choking reek of Nidoking\u2019s interior.<br>\r\nThe body of the Poison-point Pokemon takes its sweet time to pass you two along. Meat and senseless tissue do not care to accommodate you \u2014 for they are used to passing refuse and, to Nidoking\u2019s callous body, you are nothing different.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Contractions press you further as if you\u2019re toothpaste, plastering you with the unforgettable scent of Nidoking\u2019s musk.<br>\r\n  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>How long can this go on...</i>, you lament in your mind. The horrors Nidoking\u2019s body has put you through, all while the king himself sleeps unaware of your current torture. He certainly knew it would be unpleasant, but you\u2019re sure his mind could never of conjured the detestations his body has subjected you to. With uncanny timing, you hear dull scratching coming from beyond the pipings of the Pokemon. Nidoking is scratching his belly-plates in his sleep. It\u2019s rather petty of you, but you hope Nidoking isn\u2019t having nice dreams.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cplum\">Owww...my head...</span>\u201d Honchkrow interrupts your thoughts, \u201c<span class=\"cplum\">all the blood is rushing to my head\u2026</span>\u201d Honchkrow gags as he inadvertently tastes the air (if you could call it that), \u201c<span class=\"cplum\">I don\u2019t feel so...good\u2026</span>\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A pang of worry hits you in the chest. Are the toxins getting to Honchkrow? Or has he just been hanging upside-down for too long? A small bit of your fear is abated when your light reveals the long-awaited bottom of this hell-hole. You light up as you remember early on you had to scale a great vertical segment of the intestines. That means\u2026<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0...You\u2019re almost free!<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eventually Nidoking\u2019s colon deposits the blackbird down onto the intestinal floor. You never have seen a bird look so happy to be on the \u201cground.\u201d Despite the twinkle in Honchkrow\u2019s eyes, he still looks rather green between the gills.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cplum\">I\u2026 think now\u2019s a good time for naptime...</span>\u201d Honchkrow mumbles with a tuckered sigh.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBuddy,\u201d you say with a firm, but caring, voice, \u201cI need you to crawl just a bit further.

An frightening sound bounces from the intestinal walls behind you: a squelching, yucky, mucky sound accompanied by gurgles and groans.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t think we have five minutes, Honchkrow!\u201d Your dire tone temporarily snaps the avian out of his dreamy stupor. \u201cAnd even if we do, we\u2019re not going to risk it!\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cplum\">Risk what? What\u2019s behind\u2026</span>\u201d Honchkrow trails off. \u201c<i><span class=\"cplum\">Oh.</span></i>\u201d He says as he promptly begins to scuttle through the dark tunnel: the final stretch toward freedom.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And in what feels like no time at all, your light reveals your way out of this horrid place. Barely illuminated, the tunnel of flesh tapers to a comparatively small point. A tight ring of muscle, much like the one blocking the path to the small intestine. It was your entrance, now your exit. The smallest pinprick of light shines from the outside, penetrating this place of filth and sorrow.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A week ago, you\u2019d be uncertain of what you\u2019d say the happiest moment in your life was.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You\u2019re pretty certain you know what it is now.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A tenacious flame flickers in Honchkrow\u2019s eye as he summons the last of his energy to crawl forward. He doesn\u2019t stop until he is an inch away from the disgusting bundle of flesh.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He squawks with the last of his energy and all of his breath, \u201c<span class=\"cplum\">Nidoking!</span>\u201d All that replies is the gurgling of his internal symphony.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You join Honchkrow in protest. \u201c<b>Nidoking!</b>\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0No answer.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>No, no, no!</i> You\u2019re <i>so </i>close.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was no secret Honchkrow was exhausted by the ordeal. Not only he had flown for a long time in a round daytrip, he didn't even have time to rest before he was shoved into the cruel, uncaring digestive system of their host. Since then he had been struggling almost nonstop in one way or another, and in the time he wasn't, he was being pressed from all fronts by powerful, unforgiving muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and he knew he deserved a lot, but that didn't mean he had to like or want worse. To you, he had long ago received more than enough punishment. To Honchkrow, he had learned his lesson back when Nidoking demanded answers. \"Listen to me, if you don't get us out, we'll have a bad time in here\" you press on, wishing you could do more to help. Why couldn't you be bigger?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"I-I know, I'm trying my best!\"</span> almost feverishly, Honchkrow inches forward, until he's pressing his head against the gateway to your long-expected freedom. Over and over, he headbutts the unyielding muscle, trying to force his way out. It wasn't working at all. Every attempt tired him out more, until he collapsed in a heap. You couldn't believe it. Everything you both had done, it would fail at quite the crucial time...<span class=\"cnavy\"> \"I can't move anymore\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you feeling? Is everything okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"I'm fine, I just am...so tired and sleepy...\" he says blearily. \"It has been a long couple days, you know, buddy?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I do, but this isn't the time to rest!\" not when the gurgles behind you were getting closer. You pat Honchkrow. \"One last attempt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"...you know, you're very small. I bet\u2014 I bet I could get <i>you</i> out! I just would have to open this enough and...\"</span> the bird coughs. Nidoking had said the crow would resist better all the poison and fumes, but you were pretty sure extending the stay for too long would take a toll on Honchkrow's system. Yet despite that, he was trying to get you out, even if it meant he'd have to stay inside for longer. You were grateful, but you didn't like the thought of abandoning Honchkrow inside for who knew how long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"No? W-What do you mean by no?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not leaving you here. We're getting out together\" as if to punctuate your will, you kick the unrelenting sphincter. Touched by your solidarity, Honchkrow headbutts the flesh again, even pecking at it. That seemed to be somewhat more effective, if only because of how uncomfortable that must have been for the king. Everything shifts around you, the tissue contracts, it all feels like the world's going topsy-turvy when the entire environment moves. Behind you, the gurgling stops miraculously. You cling onto Honchkrow while the behemoth containing you wakes up. \"Nidoking!\" you shout. As expected, your voice doesn't reach him. Honchkrow's cawing is deafening to you, but maybe Nidoking could...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing Nidoking noticed when he woke up was the strangely pleasant feeling of emptiness inside of him. The day before he had spent the entire day with a constant weight inside him, always sending pulses of discomfort. Several times he had feared the tiny rescuer would fail or even lose its life. The thought of something happening to the maybe-not-a-bug was harrowing. It had no fault in anything that happened! Now that all sensations were gone, he felt like a new Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least until he noticed the weight didn't go away, instead it relocated. The moment of surprise turned into subdued elation. It had worked! The bug was extremely capable, this was a feat! And then came the urgency of having to let them out. His body had its needs, and among them was not keeping inside the refuse. What would usually be routine was extraordinary now, as now instead of refuse it would be a very-much-alive Honchkrow. Thrilled for your success, Nidoking hurried to the bathroom, slamming the door open and settling against a wall. A cracked toilet nobody ever used, the large clean pile of sand and gravel that would usually receive his needs, and a chipped bathtub were the only objects left. Almost crawling, Nidoking settled on the pile of sand. First he decided to check on the passengers inside of his rear: <span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Is everything in order there?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Let us out!\"</span> he heard Honchkrow's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's your friend?\" even though Nidoking had great hearing, he couldn't catch anything you said. Part of him feared something happened to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"We're both okay, we just want out of here now!\"</span> An understandable request, he judged. Satisfied everything was okay, Nidoking started the laborious task of getting the crow and the bug out. He still couldn't believe this had happened, but a promise was a promise: he wouldn't harm a feather off that stupid bird's head, out of respect for the most-likely-not-a-bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, the contractions had gotten stronger. Honchkrow felt like he was once again in the middle of the small intestine, while you held onto the feathers and kept your stare at the obstacle in front of you. You feared the contractions woul push nearer whatever had been following you. Thankfully, instead of that, the anus started to open. Slowly at first, you see it widen. A circle of sand greets you. \"We did it...\" you say with a whisper, already feeling the cold air entering your location. Few times in your life you felt so free and looking forward to something. Honchkrow's eyes are shining, again with unshed tears, forgetting the almost bone-shattering pressure enveloping him. Slowly, he's pushed outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see the rim of the tailhole go over Honchkrow's head, red and pale pink being replaced by the more vivid color if Nidoking's skin. Lucikily for you and your friend, your prolonged stay inside Nidoking covered you in a rather slick coating, letting you pass easier than it usually would be. There's still some trouble when Honchkrow's midsection gets stuck, he tries to propel himself forward and all he manages is get a wing out, making it flap around wildly and smacking Nidoking's tail a few times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"Watch what you're doing. Stop moving before I make you\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nidoking, no\" you say firmly. Nidoking growls but yields, resuming his efforts to get Honchkrow out. More and more of the bird's body slides out until the legs are left inside. By then Honchkrow can get himself out, he smoothly gets his talons out and rolls around, covering himself with sand and gasping for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Freedom! At long last! I'm alive!\"</span> he yells, ecstatic. You are thrown off him, falling onto the sand heap, and you stare upwards at the king, who is turning around to face you. He looks rather embarrassed, you figure if he wasn't blind his eyes would be full of shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"That must have been a harrowing ordeal for you\" </span>he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have no idea. Let's not do it again\". Nidoking eagerly agrees, and turns his head towards Honchkrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"You're lucky you have this human on your side</span>\" he says. You gulp. The gig was up, apparently. Your silence says more than Nidoking thought it would. <span class=\"cmagenta\">\"I wasn't certain, but I figure if it wasn't true you would have said something already. Now I see why you demanded that of me\"</span>. He talking to you about the past, he meant.<span class=\"cmagenta\"> \"A promise is a promise. See me when you're ready\"</span> with those parting words, Nidoking left the bathroom, stomping towards his bed. You and Honchkrow are left alone on the sand pile, to gather your strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had earned a hard-fought victory. You toss the gas mask off your face and take off the helmet, taking deep breaths. To your side, Honchkrow didn't seem to be too bad. His feathers were covered in muck, sand, and slime you hoped he would manage to get off himself, but overall intact. Now he was staring upwards with relief. <span class=\"cnavy\">\"Now what?\"</span> he wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sure knew what now. May as well get done with this now. It was true whoever went through your past situation didn't survive to tell the tale, but you hoped there could be something that could indicate how to return to normal.</span></div></div>",

It had been a close call all this time, but you really thought right at the last moment there would be a miracle that'd save you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose hopes are dashed when Honchkrow collapses. \"Honchkrow, no!\" you plead. \"We have to keep going!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"Sorry, I'm sorry, I just am...so tired...\"</span> he said, right before falling asleep. He even dares to start snoring softly. You stare at him, powerless, until the ground underneath you shakes violently. Oh. Right, something was coming. You really needed to be on safer terrain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou certainly hoped it wouldn't come to this. You had climbed Honchkrow's prone body, settling on his back. It was a tad callous to use your newly-reconciled friend as a raft in what you were sure would be an unpleasant situation, but it was far better than being amidst the incoming matter. It all trickled inside the rectum slowly, like a extraordinarily slow avalanche. When it started, you just took a glimpse at the earthy bunch of solidified sludge, like a mass of many balls of mud, before you decided to turn off the lights. Some things are better not seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonchkrow stays asleep, unaware of what was going on. You hoped he was having pleasant dreams, at least. The refuse lifts him off the surface of the rectum, the mountain of waste mercifully keeping Honchkrow up instead of enveloping him. You stayed on your friend's sleeping form, waiting with a patience that surprised even you. Maybe it was resignation, knowing there was nothing you could do right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed. You tried to sleep, but the stronger stench, having increased by the feces all around you, kept you awake. Exasperated, you sit up again and turn on the light on your helmet to survey the situation. Everything you could see was halfway-full by a large field of waste, reaching from side to side of the living tunnel. There was no way Nidoking wouldn't feel any of this when he woke up. That was your only consolation, that when the king woke up, your stay would be cut short. \"At least one of us can't see any of this\" you say, Honchkrow still sleeping peacefully. You were about to turn off the light when something shone in the distance, a glint of metal, the light having bounced on the surface of whatever it was. It was some distance away, too far for you to get there by staying on Honchkrow. Even though you didn't like having to get off Honchkrow, you decided to get off and retrieve that object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou never thought you would ever do something like willingly stepping on the compact remains of Nidoking's food, but you were now. It was surprisingly solid, a fact you were most thankful for. At least you wouldn't sink into it. You tentatively step forward, finding it easy to walk on, until you reach the object you had seen. It was surrounded by fish bones, it was possible Nidoking had eaten a fish that had previously eaten the object you were now trying to get. You grab it, trying to touch as little as possible the surrounding matter, and push it out with an audible squelch. \"Oh, gross\", you mutter, turning in your hands the object. It was a camera. Would it even work now? Curious, you managed to turn it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt worked. The camera turned on, the battery still worked. Wouldn't this mean it had been shrunken somewhat recently? The photo function was busted, so instead you checked the photos and videos on the memory card. The most recent one confirmed it was from a week ago. A video of a person, presumably a hiker, walking through a landscape similar to where you were before you were forced to hide in Noibat's cave. It wasn't the same, but it was similar enough you wondered if it was a coincidence. The video continued until the person holding the camera turned around, their attention caught by something. They immediately started running. All you see is a flash on the lens of the camera before it falls to the grass. The angle is awkward, but you see the hiker running away. The image, though, shows incredibly large blades of grass. The camera itself was shrunk. You were rather glad the person didn't undergo that same fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe video stayed on that position until everything shook, something was rather close to the camera. The camera is picked up by something you can't see\u2014 a Pokemon, definitely. You hear a voice. \"It's so small!\" Had that Pokemon caused the camera to shrink, or was it just a bystander who had approached? It sounded pleasantly surprised, but not like it was seeing something like this for the first time. The video cuts off, the Pokemon may have turned the camera off. You feel a sudden burst of joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was invaluable! A lead onto your situation! Somehow your current disgrace had turned out to be a blessing in disguise. What were the odds this camera would still work, that it would be eaten by Nidoking, that it would survive the onslaught of strong acids and a trip through this digestive system, that it would reach you because you couldn't get out in time, that you could even see the camera in the first place among the large amounts of shit filling everything? If you and Honchkrow had managed to escape, it was possible you would have never found out this was here. Nidoking's memories would be of use to you, indeed, but now you also would have a more tangible lead. Maybe Honchkrow or Nidoking would know where the place in the video was, or maybe even what Pokemon's voice that was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour elation stopped when everything around you gurgled and contracted. For a moment you feared Nidoking was once again going to pass gas, but instead the place changed. Everything tilted, a groan resonated from far above you. The heartbeat that had always been present during your stay inside Nidoking intensified. The king had woken up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike you had predicted, Nidoking immediately felt the heavy load inside him. The king yawned widely, standing up and trudging slowly into the bathroom like it was his routine. His mind didn't make the connection between the weight in his rectum and you and Honchkrow until he was almost on the sand pile. Any sleepiness vanished instantly. Nidoking touched his lower gut, hoping what he was feeling was the crow and nothing else, but no, focusing on the increasingly urgent sensations deep inside of him, it felt like there was more than just the bird. Nidoking's heart saddened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmagenta\">\"That poor human\"</span>. Nidoking couldn't imagine how unpleasant the situation inside must be for you. He had to make up for this somehow. Knowing you'd like to be out as soon as possible, the king opened the faucet of the chipped bathtub, starting to fill the tub with some water. He had a feeling you and Honchkrow really would want a bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe change was very noticeable for you. You fell on your back, splashing and leaving an indentation in the waste, you clutched the camera against you. No way you would lose it! Some distance away from you, the commotion seemed to have woken up someone else as well. Honchkrow moved weakly, raising his head with closed eyes. <span class=\"cnavy\">\"Huh? Is it...is it time to fly already?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's time to leave!\" you said, struggling to stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cnavy\">\"We're leaving already? Wait, why does it smell like something died in here...\" </span>apparently Honchkrow was still in the middle of snapping out of his dreams. You shakily stood up, only to be thrown off your feet again when the walls contracted. A squawk from Honchkrow indicated he was fully awake now, having noticed what was going on. Any potential discussion was extinguished when, slowly, the tunnel filled with light. Ahead of Honchkrow, the anus had opened, illuminating the sickeningly red insides of the rectum and all the crap filling the place. Luckily for you, you were rather small, so the walls didn't compact you against the surface, you still could move somewhat. The waste train was now going to leave the station. You tried to run to Honchkrow.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While the thought of possibly having a fearsome Nidoking as an ally that'd keep you hidden from Honchkrow was nice, it didn't change the fact he resided in the same abandoned manor Honchkrow lived in. It could be matter of time before Honchkrow found out you were there, and then would he try to retrieve you? He did do some drastic stuff that involved carrying you in parts of his anatomy you didn't want to think about. There was a chance he'd try to do something drastic to take you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetter to avoid taking risky chances and just get as far away as possible. You run towards the lobby, away from the rooms in the ground floor. Even if whatever was making noises in the lobby wasn't useful, the main door should be there. It'd be your way out! It takes you a few minutes to reach the lobby, and indeed, the main door was wide open, showing a stone path that leads into a forest. You could hear the sound of water rushing outside. A river! Better not to fall into the water, you weren't sure how well you'd be able to swim in a current.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe source of the noise was an explorer -- a Pokemon rooting through the wodden planks of the floor, trying to pry some of them up. Looking for a way down? You took a good look at the explorer. Orange fur, twin tails, a sac that resembled a flotation device...Floatzel? Wary but deciding taking a risk could pay off if it meant getting away from Honchkrow, you approach. The more you approached the more nervous you felt. You couldn't tell what this mustelid's personality is like. Would it be kind, or would it look at you as a toy like pretty much all Pokemon so far had thought of you? As much as you didn't want to admit it, the odds of you ending inside its stomach was higher than zero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding your breath and trying not to show how nervous you were, you stepped closer, not bothering to mask your steps. Despite your size, the Floatzel heard you coming. Alarmed, it raised its head, turning around and curling into a ball in a defensive stance. That was a good sign, the less aggressive it was, the better. <span class=\"corange\">\"Really?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"Are you what Honchkrow brought?\"</span> slowly, Floatzel uncurled and crawled towards you, until its snout was mere inches away from you. Gusts of wind pushed you back, even its breathing was enough to push you off-balance. <span class=\"corange\">\"I thought he'd have found something cool, but it's just a small human?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of you was offended at that. Since when was a human dozens of times smaller something to not even be intrigued about?! Floatzel snorted, looking around as if expecting something else more interesting to appear. <span class=\"corange\">\"Usually he brings stuff from far away and hides it around. It's like hunting for treasure! But never before it was a human\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I speak now?\" you interrupted it, hoping to get a word in. Floatzel's eyes widened, and he shut up. \"Listen, I need to get away from here. I don't want to be anywhere near Honchkrow\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"Really?\"</span> the orange mustelid sounded surprised.<span class=\"corange\"> \"I heard it's not so bad up there\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't matter, I don't want to be here! Can you help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloatzel's tails swished from side to side, it was considering your request.<span class=\"corange\"> \"What do I get in exchange?\"</span> The question made you shudder involuntarily, it reminded you too much of that Noibat. You had answered this question incorrectly, one thing led to another, and you got eaten. You weren't going to repeat the same mistake this time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened your mouth to admit you didn't have anything but were willing to listen to proposals or something when a scrapping noise echoed from the rooms not too far from you. Someone was coming! Floatzel turned its head at the direction of the sound, fur standing on end, and then got on all fours. <span class=\"corange\">\"Good luck\"</span> it said to you before bolting towards the front door. Not having expected your potential savior to just leave you behind like that, you stood there for a moment, flabbergasted, and snapped out of it once the urgency of your situation struck you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey, wait! Don't leave me here!\" you shouted, running. Floatzel, having heard you, stopped in front of the steps that led to the front door, his head on level with the floor. Was it hesitating about leaving you behind? Heartened, you sped up as much as you could.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Floatzel had stopped, you were sure you'd reach it in no time...or so it seemed before you were tackled by a Pokemon. The impact forced the air out of you, the Pokemon and you rolled away from the entrance, behind a wall of the manor. In the entranceway, Floatzel looked back, trying to see you, but since you made no attempt to signal to her you were still around --- something partly to blame by you reeling from the force of the impact, it left the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't even notice that happened. By the time you gained enough of a semblance of strength to realize your situation, Floatzel was far gone, and you were already deep into a new and disquieting situation. You were face-down on the dusty floor, flakes of dust bigger than yourself surrounded you. Even if you wanted to stand up and move, you couldn't, because a black, scaly paw was holding you down. You could see two of the digits near your head, and the weight of the paw over you. What was more, whatever was holding you down was currently smelling you, with remarkable enthusiasm, if the sounds were anything to judge by. You felt a snout pressing on you in intervals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strong, thick smell of smoke had invaded your nose. That must be the breath of the Pokemon holding you down, you realized. \"Hey, please don't hurt me!\" you plead. You'd feel calmer if you could at least see what kooky Pokemon is bothering you now! From behind you, a rather raspy voice mumbled:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"Hurt? No. I'm not hurting you. No worries\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a weight off your mind, if not off your back. After a couple minutes more of enthusiastic sniffing, the Pokemon backed down enough for you to turn around and take a good look. It wasn't hard to identify it as a Salandit. Its purple eyes were focused on you with a mirth you found a tad disturbing, and its tail was slowly wagging back and forth. It was pleased, for some reason. \"How nice...well, I think I should get going\"<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\"><br>\r\n\"Wait! Not yet. Please.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really have to go\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"I heard what you were talking. You know, with that orange Pokemon. I'll help\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...seriously?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"Can't get you away from here. But I'll keep you safe. Promise\"</span> its pupils widened a little in what you interpreted as sincerity. You were going to say no, but before you could even say a word, the Salandit had grabbed you in his paw, and this time it was running back upstairs, babbling all the time while it climbed up to the beams holding the rooftop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"No worries. You'll be okay. I promised\"</span> it stopped for a moment to nudge you with its snout. <span class=\"cgrape\">\"Salandit, nice to meet you\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lik-Likewise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next hour went by in a flash. Salandit had introduced itself once you were set on the thick wooden beam. It had said it was male and had arrived to the manor since not that long ago, and that he was just getting settling in. You had barely stepped away from him when he dragged you closer, surrounding you with surprising care, and patting you on the back of your neck with its large paw. Everything was rather overwhelming, and the fact the Salandit was so much bigger than you didn't help. At least he was very friendly and willing to help. If you didn't know better, from the way he was leaning against you, and the way he was looking at you with a joy you don't remember in anyone looking at you before, you'd think he had a crush on you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis tail curled around you in an affectionate embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Salandit <i>liked</i> you. Somehow, you had gained the affection of a male lizard much, much bigger than you. Your life was turning out to be a mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis conversation was easy to follow, even if it was peppered with short sentences. Salandit narrated to you how he had ran away from his group for reasons he didn't want to talk about, and that this manor was like a haven for Pokemon who need shelter. He promised once again with him you'd be safe, and that he'd do everything he could to keep you happy. You couldn't detect any kind of ill-natured intentions on him, even if you certainly didn't reciprocate his feelings, you at least could be certain he was truly invested in your safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now he was happily lounging around in silence while you leaned on his tail, staring at the beams of daylight that were starting to creep from slits on the roof. While this wasn't going at all like you thought it would, it wasn't really too bad. A companion who cared about you would be nice, and you made sure to tell Salandit that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"Thanks. Told you you'd like being here\"</span> he replied with a smile that looked a tad creepy for you. A Salandit's face wasn't really made for expressions that weren't sly, apparently. You were about to reply when a flap of wings announced the arrival of someone you knew, a couple beams away. Honchkrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crow was looking downwards, trying to find you with his excellent eyesight. While you were looking, it hopped around. You felt your blood run cold, that bird was certainly someone you'd rather not to deal with every again. Over you, the Salandit had placed his head over you protectively, staring intently at the Honchkrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew it was matter of time before Honchkrow looked in the Salandit's direction and saw you, and you really didn't want that to happen. You had to get out of sight right now, but how to do that? Where could you hide that Honchkrow wouldn't be able to ever see you?</span></div></div>",

You were still fastened to the top of the Pokemon\u2019s mouth but you did began to slowly drip down along with a globule of spit.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tongue free, Salandit spoke. \u201c<span class=\"cgrape\">You\u2019re bad!

Your old friend Darkness came to greet you again.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A dreadfully long moment came and passed.

Once in Noibat was plenty bad, repeating the experience was a bad thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of your hopes were dashed rather quickly when Honchkrow stepped forward. He was trembling slightly, but he felt he had to do something, all for the sake of the human! He still had yet to apologize and make sure the human didn't hate him. Salandit, being completely on your side, just knew he had to keep you away from the corvid. Which was why, although he hesitated a lot, decided to just make the inevitable happen. He planned to run away as far as he could, and in his opinion the movements would make you fall down his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you were doomed to be swallowed then it'd be on his terms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasped when the muscle underneath you shifted. \"W-Wait!\" you pleaded. It all went too quickly for you to react. Everything inside the mouth tilted, and soon you found yourself enveloped in Salandit's throat.

The smell of burning wood and of smoke intensified the deeper you went, like you were being dragged into a forest fire, until it was the only thing you smelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Honchkrow squaked with panic when he heard Salandit swallow. <span class=\"cmaroon\">\"No! You can't do that!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\">\"Already done!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"Spit them, now! If something happens to them I dunno what I will do...\"</span> he begged. Salandit blinked, feeling a bit of pity for the crow, but what you wanted was priority -- leaving aside that you didn't want to be swallowed in the first place. Compromising on that issue was necessary. Still, if you wanted to be away from Honchkrow, then he had to run away. While Honchkrow restlessly paced around, Salandit quickly turned around and started running as fast as possible on the ceiling beams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, you were done descending down Salandit's gullet. You were starting to get used to the smoke smell, until you fell into a larger chamber. You had finally arrived into Salandit's stomach. While you fell you anticipated the splash against juices, like it happened inside Noibat, but instead you fell onto spongy floor, bouncing once and splashing onto a very thin layer of slime. Looking around you, you sigh, relieved. The stomach was mostly empty. All around you there was nothing but empty space and wrinkled walls. You guessed anything Salandit had eaten had already gone ahead down the intestines, mercifully leaving the stomach empty for you. Lucky you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Salandit got his feet on the ground he started running forward, as fast as he could. Behind him, Honchkrow flew through the air, pursuing with speed. Not too far from there there was a crack in the wall. If he could get in there, he'd escape from Honchkrow! A safe place! Just a couple meters more! Right before Salandit could get into the wall, a talon gripped him, stopping him on his tracks. Honchkrow had caught up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"Spit them up, quick!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\">\"No!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonchkrow pressed down with the talon, pressing on Salandit's back. The lizard gurgled, feeling the pressure. It was a tad hard to breathe, but he refused to let the human go if it meant being captured by the crow. Salandit really feared for your safety! <span class=\"cmaroon\">\"If you don't, then I will...I will get them out myself!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cplum\">\"You don't even know how to do that!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">\"I will...I will get my beak in your throat and pluck them out!\"</span> he bluffed. That was impossible, but he hoped Salandit wouldn't realize that. Unfortunately for him, Salandit did realize and refused to budge. Maybe pressing a bit more would make you pop out Salandit's mouth? Honchkrow pressed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, you were feeling the pressure too. Lying down against the hard floor of the beam and with Honchkrow pressing on Salandit, the ceiling of the stomach descended until it reached you. The stomach compressed further, enveloping you in an uncomfortable embrace. It was like everything was trying to squeeze you, you found it hard to focus. What was happening outside? You placed your hands on the floor of the stomach and tried to get some space, but it wasn't working, Honchkrow was just too heavy for you to do anything. Giving up, you collapsed, only hearing Salandit's labored breathing and Honchkrow's threats. You were confident Honchkrow lacked the malice to really harm anyone on purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dense air tinged with smoke, the pressure on you, and the rather oppressive heat made you feel woozy. At least I'm not getting digested... you thought groggily</span></div></div>",

The formerly-unrelenting pressure vanished instantly. Both you and Salandit wasted no time to gather your breath.  With you in his stomach, situated between his great lungs, his breaths sounded like a squall. Meanwhile, the smokey air tickled your throat coaxing you to cough briefly.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tOn the outside, Honchkrow outstretched his wings trying to make himself look as big as he can be. \u201c<span class=\"cmaroon\">See!</span>\u201d He said, standing strategically between Salandit and the oh-so-close crack in the wall. \u201c<span class=\"cmaroon\">I mean business!

Another escape\u2026<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tGranted, it was a bit away. He\u2019d have to hop three beams to get there. The alternative, however, was to stay here.

He craned his neck down until he was beak-to-face with Salandit. \u201c<span class=\"cmaroon\">My eyes are on you! Can\u2019t take them off! Not for nothing!</span>\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tSalandit stared for a moment.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tHe promptly knocked off Honchkrow\u2019s feathery hat.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u201c<span class=\"cmaroon\">N-no! No!</span>\u201d Honchkrow fumbled as he hat fluttered to the floor. The bird practically fell head over talons as he struggled to retrieve his fallen hat. Salandit took this to escape. He scrambled across the beam and rocked his body as he judged the distance he had to leap. He jumped and landed with a perfect 10.<br>\r\nThough your experience differed a bit. You too were flung through the air. Except you careened through the air, clearing a path through the smoke, and splattered onto the lizard\u2019s stomach\u2019s wall. As you slid down the slippery, slimy wall of the belly, you hoped that was a one-time thing.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Unfortunately, your hopeful expectations were dashed as you were flung into the air twice more, bouncing about belly walls like a flea performing in a flea circus. Things quieted down briefly as Salandit was perched on the ledge of his escape, peering down to see how far he would have to fall.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He looked back to see Honchkrow finishing brushing off his hat, his beak going wide in shock as witnessed what Salandit was about to do.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cplum\">Farewell, featherbrain! <i>Thhhhpppt!</i></span>\u201d Salandit stuck his tongue out mockingly and blew a raspberry. He then jumped aiming for a (hopefully soft!) bush adjacent to the mansion. As he sailed through the air, he could hear the indignant words of the bird behind him.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cmaroon\">I am <b><i>not </i></b>a featherbrain!</span>\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0To you, everything was in zero-G. For the brief moment you two were airborne, you closed your eyes and awaited the inevitable landing.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Salandit plompf\u2019d into the bed of the bush. You plopped onto the bottom of his belly and bounced a few times more. When things were still, you let an exasperated breath. No more, you say!<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cplum\">Sorry!</span>\u201d The lizard apologizes. \u201c<span class=\"cplum\">Must run <i>now!</i></span>\u201d Salandit sprinted off as fast as his legs could carry him. In his speed, centrifugal force drew you to the back of his belly but, thankfully, you were not pinned to it. Salandit didn\u2019t say anything in his frantic scurry. The only sounds he made were of his beating heart, labored breaths, and the ever-constant <i>plip-plap</i> of his footsteps.<br>\r\nBy now you were starting to get used to the strange, smokey air of the Salandit\u2019s body. Harmless embers flitted about, lighting the bellyspace like fireflies. It was dim, yes, but the atmosphere is almost tranquil. It was an evening fog, the last of the sun\u2019s light filtered through murky smoke. The burnt-wood-smell bestowed a rustic touch. Closing your eyes, you easily imagined a burning wood stove awaiting you in homely--with a promise of a home-cooked meal. And the heat! Once nearly unbearable, now relaxing: sauna-like. The sounds of Salandit\u2019s body morphed to those of the forest as you were swept up in your fantasy.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was so nice, you just felt\u2026 a little\u2026 sleepy\u2026.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2026<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2026<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When you awoke again, something had changed.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You heard voices. One was a much muted voice you didn't recognize yet, the other the Salandit in whose stomach you were in right now. You shook your head, holding onto the walls of the stomach to get your bearings. The stomach seemed to have less smoke than before, possibly having been exhaled at some point. Thankfully for you, there was still nothing else in the stomach, so you had it all for yourself. \"What happened?\" you ask, deciding to make sure Salandit knows you're awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe effect was immediate. The stomach tilts ninety-degrees, Salandit must have gotten on his hind legs. \"There they are. They're awake\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you talking to?\" was it someone in the manor? No, that couldn't be it. Salandit had been running, by now he had to place some distance between the manor and wherever he was now. You were rather relieved, you had to admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Friend. I dunno what to do to help you,\" Salandit admitted. He liked you, but you were a bit more of responsibility than he was used to. He didn't feel like he could handle you alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it someone I can trust?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" he sounded very sure about it. You relaxed, leaning against the stomach walls and listenin more. \"Human inside me. Ate them to keep them safe,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again, are you sure you did that to keep them safe? You know what happens in stomachs\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Human not food!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I understand. I won't say that again.\" you heard the other Pokemon say. You frown, focusing. For some reason the voice sounded familiar, but you were having a hard time remembering who it was. High-pitched, teasing...for some reason the more you listened to that voice, the more nervous you felt. You insisted, asking Salandit who he was talking with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noibat. Best friend\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt like you were about to faint again. No, that couldn't be possible! It couldn't be that, after everything you had gone through, you had returned right to the first Pokemon you had met since you shrunk, and not only that, it was the one Pokemon you would have liked not to see again. Even Honchkrow had shown some friendliness towards you, the Noibat was only bad news for you. \"Can we leave? Please?\" you hope the answer will be yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me show you to Noibat?\" at least Salandit was asking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't ever do that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you need the human's permission? Come on, I want to see!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't hurt them.\" That wasn't a question, that was a demand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not. Why'd I do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Salandit, please, don't show me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour protector didn't even reply. With a sudden lurch, the stomach contracted, pushing you closer to the sphincter that led to the esophagus. You yelped, not having expected such a strong movement. This was as good as a reply, though: Salandit trusted Noibat and was willing to show you to them. Maybe it wasn't going to be so bad, who said it had to be the same Noibat that had eaten you before? There had to be million of Noibats all over the world. This had to be a different one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, a Noibat had eaten you, and you had almost died. It was an experience you weren't willing to forgive. Maybe you shouldn't take your chances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClinging to the slippery walls with all your strength, you manage to crawl in the opposite direction. Noises like retching filled the chamber, proving Salandit was serious about getting you out of his stomach. With strength that surprised even yourself, you managed to cling onto the stomach walls despite Salandit's best efforts. He was straining so much to squeeze his stomach, trying so hard to get you out, he had to take a moment to rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to use that moment to your advantage. If you could do something to make sure you wouldn't be shown to the Noibat...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's taking you so long?\" the other voice said. Feeling the disguised malice in its voice, you looked around, hoping for anything that could be of help. Not too far from you there's the way into the intestines. Salandit's efforts seem to have loosened it, it's halfway open. In a flash of inspiration that surprised even yourself, you dash towards it, pretty much diving into the open sphincter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou land right after it, in a tunnel that's far more cramped than the stomach. You make sure not to advance much, though. Your idea was to stay far from the stomach's reach. As long as you were in Salandit's intestines, he wouldn't be able to throw you up. Just in case you stayed near the sphincter you had dived through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plan was that you were going to stay there until Salandit gave up, or at least until you could explain you didn't feel comfortable at all getting shown to the Noibat. Anything that could give you some time would be good! Or at least you hoped you were safe...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt depended on how stubborn Salandit was about showing you to Noibat.</span></div></div>",

To you the time it took to reach the front door was like an eternity, and to Floatzel it was even more. It kept looking around, expecting a flock of Murkrows to come and attack, or for there to be an ambush. Why did this small human have to be so slow?! Seeing how antsy Floatzel was starting to be, you ran faster, doing a leap of faith when you reach the end of the topmost stair, closing your eyes and extending your arms forward. You expected to crash into Floatzel's fur, you were ready to hold onto it as hard as you could while your newfound helper ran away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"What are you waiti-?!\"</span> you hear Floatzel start yelling and suddenly shut up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrange sensations you didn't expect happen when you land. Instead of coarse and short fur enveloping you, you crash against something slimy and wet. When you open your eyes you only see red, not because you're upset, but because the surface you landed on it is of an intense red and pink color. Looking up through the dim illumination around you, you see ridges above you, and white spires surrounding you. It doesn't take you long to realize what exactly happened: you landed in Floatzel's mouth. This was something you didn't need right now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloatzel snapped shut its maw out of surprise and, still fearing an attack from any of the residents of the abandoned manor, started running towards the river. It went there to search for treasure and got out with a tiny human in its mouth. This wasn't what it had expected, but it couldn't complain that much. The only thing it could complain about was the taste of that human. It was horrible! <span class=\"corange\">\"You taste awful! Where have you been?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to talk about that!\" you shout, feeling guilty, holding onto the tongue. Floatzel's talking jostled you around, the sound of its voice was deafening. In moments like these you seriously reconsidered your choices. Why did your life have to be like this now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for you, Floatzel wasn't going to spit you out just like that, even if having you in its mouth was a rather unpleasant experience. Like it or not, it had to carry the human away.<span class=\"corange\"> \"I'm going into the river!\"</span> it said, confident in its swimming skills. Inside, you were in no condition to ask him not to. It wasn't like you had any better suggestions. Having some trouble holding onto the tongue because of how slippery it was. To try to get a better grasp, you crawl upwards, a bit towards the throat. It was a risky move, but in your mind the plan was clear: stay away from the teeth, stay away from the throat. If you managed to stay in the center then you'd be okay!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a splash, Floatzel dives into the river, you can hear the water rushing around you. You can't see well, but you're sure some water leaked through the lips and teeth. <span class=\"corange\">\"You know how to swim, right?\"</span> it asked you, surfacing for a second. More water splashed into the mouth when he talked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda, I just don't know if I can swim in a river because I'm small\" you explain, a bit uneasy at the water trickling around you. Behind you, you can hear it trickling down Floatzel's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloatzel swam, taking another chance to resurface when it judged it was safe to. <span class=\"corange\">\"Then you can't stay around here. I'll leave you on a dry place</span>\" it says. Being used to not worrying about the level of water, a wave gets into its mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the mustelid it was nothing. To you it was a tsunami of water. The water hits you with force, you feel your fingers slipping from the tongue. Panic grips you while you realize the danger you're suddenly into. Frantic, you try to cling back onto the tongue.</span></div></div>",

You really don\u2019t want to think about what happens if you let go of the bumpy, slimy muscle. This is hard.

No water either \u2014 besides the spittle that called this dank, fishy-smelling cave a home.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That was, until, the pearly white gates opened.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Light and water stormed in.

Water surrounds you in a suffocating shroud, held there by Floatzel in a concentrated, teeth-clenching effort to not gag and spit out the weasel-creature\u2019s tiny passenger.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your situation is red; you\u2019re trapped betwixt a rock and a hard place: being crushed against the Pokemon\u2019s hard palate \u2014 or tumbling into the dark abyss of their gullet.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Floatzel then tries a different approach: swallow the water, not the little one.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Everything tilts up. Water flows downward, trying to drag you with it. Despite both your and Floatzel\u2019s best efforts, it succeeds. Slipping from the mustelid\u2019s slick tongue, you are pulled into the athirsting throat. It snatches and swallows you as it would to any other food. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0On the outside, Floatzel feels the little mote on its tongue slip away. Momentarily, its eyes go wide in surprise. Then its face quickly shifts into one of vexed half-moon eyes and a exasperated frown. Soberly, Floatzel thinks:<br>\r\n<span class=\"cborange\"> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That's <i>how I lose them?</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Walls of hungry flesh drag you deeper into dark depths of Floatzel. Wet muscle shoves your sodden form deeper. Water surrounds you. Air is nowhere to be found. You can only hope that there is something breathable deeper within.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Just as your lungs begin to ache, you hear the bubbling flush of water released as esophagus opens and ejects you into the eager stomach. A sweltering heat and a pungent fishy aroma hits as if you slammed face-first into fish-market stall in the middle of sultry July.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then you fall \u2014 into the foul gruel that lay fermenting in Floatzel\u2019s gut. You cannot see in the darkness. However, your intimate contact with the otter\u2019s belly-brew imparts vile sensations your eyes could never infer.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rising to the top like a cork dropped water, you struggle to stay afloat through Floatzel\u2019s bouncing swimming-motions. Your efforts are successful because, regrettably, this isn\u2019t your first rodeo.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Floatzel! You shout over the slopping of an ever-shifting stomach, can you hear me?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Under the river surface, Floatzel halts its movement, closes its eyes, and listens closely. Its ears perk as a curious sound tickles its ears\u2026<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0...It\u2019s Floatzel\u2019s stomach growling.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i><span class=\"cborange\">Palkia\u2019s pearls,</span></i> Floatzel thinks, <i><span class=\"cborange\">that little buddy got themselves in a fine mess.</span></i> <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Floatzel is not particularly hard-hearted, but does it believe it\u2019s even possible to save you?<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You had to wonder what you did to deserve everything that was happening to you. Had you insulted a cosmic entity? Did you bring upon yourself something\u2019s wrath? Was the universe simply into messing with you? There had to be some sort of explanation as to why you were once again inside a Pokemon, and by no fault of your own, may you add. While you moved with a lot of difficulty through the contents of Floatzel\u2019s stomach, you kept thinking about that, but even thinking was difficult when the mixture around you was so difficult to move through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had just reached the wall when it curves towards you, it smacks you right on the face. Instinctively, you grab onto it, letting yourself be pulled against it. \u201c<span class=\"corange\">Are you there?</span>\u201d you hear Floatzel\u2019s voice ask. You shout as loudly as you can:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m okay, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be okay for long if you don\u2019t get me out soon!\u201d you shout, lying a little. Although you were presently covered by Floatzel\u2019s gastric acids and countless bits of fish, you felt more like you needed a bath, not like you were burning and melting. You sure weren\u2019t going to complain about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cHang in there! I will get you out</span>\u201d it promises. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cJust wait until I get home. It\u2019ll be easier for me to help you once I\u2019m there!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not too sure about that\u201d. What exactly could Floatzel do over there that it couldn\u2019t do right where it was now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloatzel prods its belly again, as if it was annoyed you doubted it. \u201c<span class=\"corange\">Trust me on this one, I know what I\u2019m doing!</span>\u201d and as if there was no ground for discussion, it started swimming as fast as possible. You held against the wall of the stomach for dear life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat followed were some particularly anxiety-filled minutes. Not only the walls of the stomach were much more slippery than the tongue you had been grabbing not that long ago, you also kept hearing the sloshing of the stomach contents a few inches beneath you, and the fishy smell was starting to get you dizzy. How was it possible the fish smell filled the air so much?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Floatzel\u2019s credit, it really didn\u2019t take long for it to stop. The otter crawled out of the water and into a burrow, shaking the water off and rooting through a chest of trinkets. It liked to collect stuff, the more uncommon the better. There had to be something it could use to get that tiny thing out of his belly! And in one piece, hopefully. While it was searching, it came across a round, small sphere, of yellow color. A Light Ball! Testing it, he enveloped it with his paws and peeked through them. The ball was shining rather brightly, so much he could see every detail of the fur covering his paws. \u201c<span class=\"corange\">Are you still okay?</span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am. This stopped moving so much\u201d you said, relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"corange\">I have an idea. While I work, here, I have this for you</span>\u201d it said before putting the Light Ball into its mouth and, with some hesitation, swallowed it. The ball went down its throat rather quickly, so in no time you saw light enter Floatzel\u2019s stomach. You couldn\u2019t see the source, but it entered and crashed into the fish soup, sinking to the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"corange\">It\u2019s something I found once. I thought you\u2019d like to have some light in there instead of just darkness</span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a rather considerate thought, but it didn\u2019t exactly make you feel better. The stomach was now filled with light, allowing you to see every inch of the place. You never thought you\u2019d see so much detail of a Pokemon\u2019s stomach, yet now you could see everything. The contracting walls, the slime rolling off everything, the rather large and expansive stomach that reminded you just how small you were. Almost touching your ankles was the contents of the stomach, a beige liquid that looked like quicksand and undoubtedly had that consistency too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome things were better unseen, you figured. \u201cThanks\u201d you said quietly, not very grateful about it. Luckily for you, Floatzel didn\u2019t notice, focused on its idea. \u201cAlthough now that thing is stuck inside you as well\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cborange\">I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get it back one way or another. What\u2019s important is getting you out</span>\u201d. At least it had its heart in the right place. Several minutes more passed before you heard the sounds of gulping above you. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d you asked. There was no response except more gulping. The answer to your question was obvious when, from the entrance sphincter on the other side of the stomach, a string appeared. \u201c<span class=\"corange\">Grab it!</span>\u201d you heard Floatzel\u2019s voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat string?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"corange\">I\u2019m gonna pull and get you out. Get ready!</span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a good idea! Better than being trapped inside Floatzel for a long time, at least. Intending to swim to the string, you let go of the wall and fell into the syrupy mixture in Floatzel\u2019s gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if that was what its system had been waiting all along, the whole stomach shook. Floatzel bent over, a pang of discomfort coursing through it. Inside, you saw everything contract violently, and then beneath you there was a rather gross gurgling sound, like someone had removed the plug of a bathtub and was emptying the contents now. \u201cNo, not again!\u201d you said, trying to swim faster, against the current that was threatening to take you. If you could reach the string before it was too late...!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light in the stomach dimmed, caught in the current that was leaking into Floatzel\u2019s intestines, and floated inside. Great, you thought bitterly. Now if you failed to reach the string, not only you would be into another creature\u2019s intestines, you also would have enough light to see every inch of the rest of Floatzel\u2019s inner tubes. Making one last desperate push, you extended your arms, the string touching the tip of your fingers.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your grip so tight your knuckles turn white and your nails dig into fibers of the string. Your momentum causes you to swing, stirring the broth of the weasel\u2019s belly like goop in a cauldron. Yet, you hold on \u2014 as if your life depended on it.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0...Technically it didn\u2019t, really. You survived this before.

Immediately it begins the process of reeling you up and out and back into the daylight. It feels a tickle in its throat as the string sidles on upward.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Inside, you\u2019re being pulled in two different directions. Like siblings fighting over a toy, Floatzel tries to pull you up as the whirlpool in its body drags you down. Floatzel triumphs over its own body as you\u2019re lifted from the watery clutches of its gut. Soaring through sultry skies, you\u2019re tugged towards the exit, former entrance. You slam into the esophageal sphincter. The collision isn\u2019t gentle but as you\u2019re not down there you don\u2019t care.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After a brief moment of resistance, you breach through. Darkness returns. Throat muscles grab you like clenched fist and haul you skyward. Gravity shifts. You\u2019re sideways. Floatzel is on the ground, hunched over \u2014 gagging. Its esophagus presses against your ears with each heave. The squelching of moist muscle, Floatzels\u2019 awful retching, the faint burbling of its belly below \u2014 all perfectly interlocked in a horrid organic rhythm.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0At last, you spy the glow of light peeking behind the hump of its tongue.  Daylight rushes to greet you and you\u2019re momentarily blinded. You\u2019re out of the throat \u2014 upside-down now. You spill over its tongue and fall past its cage of glistening teeth. Now in freefall, a trail of drool tailing you, you\u2019re caught in a soft paw before you can hit the ground.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cborange\"><i>Eyuch</i>,</span>\u201d the Pok\u00e9mon clears a phlegm-full throat. \u201c<span class=\"corange\">You\u2019re still kickin\u2019, right buddy?</span>\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You lift your arm out of the weasel\u2019s sticky slobber and manage to give a thumbs up.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It gives a weary chuckle. \u201c<span class=\"corange\">Ghost-type\u2019s haven\u2019t got you yet\u2026</span>\u201d It turns around and stretches out a paw toward a menagerie of items nearby.

You were smaller than usual, not bigger. Something must have shown your discontent, because Floatzel hurries to offer other possibilities.<span class=\"corange\"> \"If that's not convincing, I know other places! You know how Xatu is said to see the past and the future? I know where we can find a Xatu. There are also ruins in a swamp not too far from here, and ruins are known for their strange artifacts. I myself have found quite some treasures in ruins before\" </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou appreciate her effort, you really do, but those two also sounded like they were a long shot. That about Xatu was closer to myth than truth, as far as you knew, and mystical ruins were more fiction than reality.

I said I'd help you, the only thing I ask is that you don't turn your nose to my suggestions\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you\" you say. She's right, you have to make a choice or else you will have zero chance of returning to normal. You won't get anywhere unless you take the plunge! After a moment, you consider the options. That glade...it's a fact Pokemon are larger than they should be. Maybe there's something in there that will make you larger. \"Can you take me to the glade?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"Of course I can! It's two hours away, and I don't think many Pokemon who don't live in there know about it. We won't be bothered by anyone\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a bonus. Less chances of someone you know seeing you. True, you knew a grand total of two Pokemon, but it was something you wanted to avoid, anyway. The course of action was set, you were ready to depart. Floatzel, though, insisted leaving the next day would be better. It'd give them more time to prepare. <span class=\"cdorange\">\"Adventuring isn't something you can do recklessly\"</span> she said. You had to admit she was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, you asked her to tell you more about the glade. Floatzel curls on the ground, reminiscing about when she had seen that glade for the first time. She was a novice in her hobby, and had stumbled upon the glade. She hadn't stayed for long, deeming it too dangerous, but right now? It was important to go back! \"It's surreal. Pokemon that wouldn't even reach my hip would tower over me. One of them saw me, but it was like they were normal Pokemon, just bigger than they should be\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how dangerous is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"For your size? I'd say you'd better stick with me or else you'll have a hard time\"</span> she adds, with a cocky smirk. <span class=\"corange\">\"I'm pretty sure I saw a few Pokemon who were so big they could eat me. Can you believe that?\"</span> You couldn't. The mere thought a Pokemon could be that big was mindboggling.<span class=\"corange\"> \"Anyway, the air feels so clean, and even though I could see the sky over my head it felt like I was in an entirely different world. It was so weird\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think is going on in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"I dunno. Maybe it's another world, for all we know. Everything is normal size except the Pokemon, so it's not that different from the rest of the forest\"</span> That was a relief. At least it was a confirmation you wouldn't be getting even smaller by being there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeparting from the burrow felt bittersweet. It was only for a night, but it felt like such a nice place. Floatzel had talked and shown you her treasures, you'd have loved to stay for a little longer, but she was eager to return to the glade. <span class=\"corange\">\"I can't believe I'm going back!\"</span> After some discussion, it was decided you'd hold onto her fur. After what happened in her snout, you weren't willing to risk it again, and she agreed wholeheartedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip to the glade was uneventful, thankfully. You sank into Floatzel's fur while she ran through the forest. The ride was bumpy, it was one of the few times you were glad to be so small because it meant the fur kept you on your newfound friend. Floatzel recommended not to talk during the trip, so most of the ride was you battling the dizziness of being on what felt like a living rollercoaster from how much she moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the start of the second hour of traveling, Floatzel reached a fallen tree. The insides had been hollowed out, it was a rather narrow passageway. Although she as larger than the passageway, her shape allowed her to sneak inside, even though it was a tight fit., so tight the bark pressed you against Floatzel's skin with no room to move. The pressure went away when Floatzel emerged at the end of the tree, into the strange glade she had been talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did feel like a weird place. The air was clean but there was this constant feeling of dream-like calm, like nothing would ever happen. The sky overhead had a very intense blue, with no clouds at all. The trees looked very real and healthy, more than you remembered the forest on the other side of the dying tree to be. Even the dying tree you had came through was covered with moss and dew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe glade was rather beautiful, and from the looks of it, further than the glade the forest went on. You wondered just how far this anomalous place went to. \"So what's the plan?\" you asked. Floatzel stood on her hind legs, sniffing the air around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"We'll look for a Pokemon and ask for help\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Just like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"Someone must know something\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if they're hostile?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"Then we run away, of course. No point in fighting\"</span> she reassured you. <span class=\"corange\">\"Not everyone is out to get you\"</span> You knew she was right, but it was hard not to feel paranoid when you were tiny and the Pokemon you were going to stumble upon now would be larger than they should be. You wondered if it was limited only to small species, or if those that were already large would be gigantic now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sure wasn't a soothing thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"Now, where to start...\" </span>Floatzel considered the options, discussing them with you. <span class=\"corange\">\"Let's find a Pokemon, but what'd you prefer? Should we approach any Pokemon that's bigger than usual, or should we try to find a normal-sized Pokemon around here?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis glade was bound to be teeming with anomalous Pokemon, so finding those would be easy. A normal-sized one was a nice thought, you had to admit.</span></div></div>",

Only moments after your search begins, it ends! It's pretty hard to not notice the unmistakable rotund form of a Dedenne peeking over the horizon\u2014a lazy sun. Its black ears peep over the tall grasses like an inquisitive Watchog. Its belly rises and falls as the Pok\u00e9mon snorts and snores in its afternoon nap. All the while, normal sized Dedenne sleep on and by the 'mon.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The creature is massive! Double \u2014 no! Triple? Can\u2019t be!

Snorts, snuffles, and snores of many a \u2018mon become the new sounds of the glade \u2014 overtaking the birds and the whispering wind. A cartoonish bubble crops from the nose of one of the smaller Dedenne, sleeping on the larger one\u2019s tail.

They're a Cutiefly.</span>\" She finishes. The small Dedenne raises an eyebrow, but curbs it's inquisitiveness just this once.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The little creature clambers up the plump mountain. At the summit the small Pok\u00e9mon springs upward, using their cream belly like a springboard, proclaiming, \u201c<span class=\"cyellow\">wake up, big guy!</span>\u201d They land softly back onto the furred trampoline and bounce away as the big Dedenne stirs, and yawns, and stretches their limbs\u2014nudging the surrounding Pok\u00e9mon away.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cyellow\"><b>Mmm\u2026 hello?</b></span>\u201d The big Dedenne yawns once more and smacks their lips drowsily. Their voice sounds like a Snorlax's. Er, what you'd imagine a Snorlax's to sound like anyway. Definitely a dude, though. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"corange\">Hey big fella!</span>\u201d Floatzel greets, \u201c<span class=\"corange\">up and at \u2018em!</span>\u201d The giant \u2018mon groggily rubs his eyes and attempts to sit up. All the other Dedenne scramble to get out of the way and vanish into the tall grasses.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cyellow\"><b>Ah!</b></span>\u201d The monumental Pok\u00e9mon grins ear-to-ear, \u201c<span class=\"cyellow\"><b>a visitor!

The last of the outside world you see is Floatzel, coated in slobber and bearing an empty-eyed look of shock.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Locked behind a gate of lip and fang, situated atop a slimy and sticky tongue, you don\u2019t even have time to scramble to your feet before light rushes in once more and the muscle beneath bounces and moves. Hot air, incubated within the Dedenne\u2019s deepest depths, rushes from below as you\u2019re flung about. Dedenne is speaking.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<b><span class=\"cyellow\">Eyuck,</span></b>\u201d Dedenne says, \u201c<b><span class=\"cyellow\">I think I got some of your hair on my tongue.

If you had a moment to prepare yourself, you're resign to the imminent swallowing that'd lead to the belly of another Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't have a moment of respite, though. Dedenne's tongue moved you around in his mouth at blinding speed, not even giving you the time to notice what was going on. You saw blurry colors. White, pink, red, and black mixed together in a dizzying trip that made you feel like you had been through in a washing machine. All the saliva you were being tossed with only increased the similarities to that metaphor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, the spit didn't drag you towards a waiting throat. Instead the mouth opened and you were thrown in the air at fast speeds. You barely had time to notice you had left the hot cavern you were in, replaced by air that felt cold. The impact against the grass stunned you, you just laid there and made a quick inventory of your body. Nothing broken, thankfully, but that was too close. Everything aches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clkhaki\"><b>There we go, that's better. Where were we?</b></span>\" you vaguely hear Dedenne's booming voice. You hadn't recovered yet when someone lifted you. The cream-colored fur enveloping you told you the identity of the Pokemon who had you now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"Are you okay? Can you hear me?\"</span> Floatzel cradles you in one paw, anxiously checking you all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Floatzel...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"You're okay! I'm so glad!\"</span> She had gotten so worried when she noticed you had been swept by Dedenne's tongue, but in her opinion what happened to you was better than being swallowed. Much better!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Dedenne could do was stare quizzically at Floatzel until she finally calmed down enough to explain the situation. Dedenne's wide smile got smaller when Floatzel described how she had brought a small human, and that they had gotten all the way to this glade to try to find a way to return you to normal. <span class=\"clkhaki\"><b>\"So wherever this human comes from it's not like here? Some bigger -- or smaller -- than others?\"<br>\r\n</b></span><br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"I'm pretty sure they're not\" </span>Floatzel said, not knowing at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDedenne asked a couple more questions. By then you had recovered enough to sit up and talk. Part of you was grateful at Dedenne for not swallowing you, you had to admit, so you were patient and explained you had no idea what had happened. \"So can you help me? Please, anything that could be of help could be good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy's ears twitched. <span class=\"clkhaki\"><b>\"Nope. I don't have the slightest idea\"</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed. Figures. \"How are you so big? We saw the other Dedennes, they were much smaller\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clkhaki\"><b>\"I dunno. I just grew like this since a few years ago!\"</b></span> he said cheerfully. You frowned: you sure didn't have years to wait! <span class=\"clkhaki\"><b>\"I do remember something weird happening back then. Maybe that'll be of help?\"</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"If it's weird it's a clue! Weirdness is what we need\"</span> Floatzel pressed on. <span class=\"corange\">\"What kind of weird was it?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDedenne pointed upwards. <span class=\"clkhaki\"><b>\"One day a flying human vehicle had passed above. It was all on fire, and a box that fell from it exploded in the air. Whatever was inside the box broke and fell all over the forest, maybe even more than just the forest. Since then several hundreds or like a thousand Pokemon grew more than usual\" </b></span>he nodded, pleased with his good memory. <span class=\"clkhaki\"><b>\"Is that useful?\"</b></span> You weren't really sure if it was, but there indeed was a chance there was some causation there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"Yes, very useful! But if it was years ago then we can't do anything about it\"</span> Floatzel said. At least they knew a little more now! Dedenne, noticing neither you nor your mustelid friend were very enthusiastic, laughed rather loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clkhaki\"><b>\"I know what to do. Look at this\" </b></span>from his whiskers, sparks of electricity spread all over the place. For a moment you felt tingly but it didn't seem to affect you any further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" you asked, curious. Dedenne pounded his chest, proud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clkhaki\"><b>\"I gave a signal to my fellow Dedenne! They will bring here some of what fell down so long ago. There were so many small pieces to this day Pokemon keep finding them around\" </b></span>Those were good news! Sure, the odds you'd be able to get something useful from the pulverized remains of whatever happened back then were astronomically low, but at least he was being helpful. You thanked him profusely. <span class=\"clkhaki\"><b>\"No need to thank me! Just have some patience. I hate to admit it, but we Dedenne aren't known for focusing for long on a task\" </b></span>he winked like he had said a very good joke. <span class=\"clkhaki\"><b>\"I suppose you two will stay for dinner?\"</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody could say Dedenne wasn't welcoming. That was a great dinner. Floatzel and Dedenne ate so much you were sure Dedenne got rounder than usual and Floatzel fell into a food coma five minutes after eating. You had a rather generous share of food too, but you had been so nervous from the way they were shoveling food into their maws you made sure to stay kind of far from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clkhaki\"><b>\"They're taking longer than I thought they would\"</b></span> Dedenne commented, his tail swishing across the grass with impatience.<span class=\"clkhaki\"><b> \"I'm sorry, maybe I should have gone myself\"<br>\r\n</b></span><br>\r\n\"No problem. It's not like I have any place to be right now\" You sure weren't going to stray far from Dedenne or Floatzel, that was for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clkhaki\"><b>\"Then let's have a good night of sleep!\" </b></span>Dedenne proposed, curling in a ball.<span class=\"clkhaki\"><b> \"Come on, little human, sleep a little\"</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sleepy\" you said. It had barely been sunset half an hour ago, you were used to going to sleep much later. Dedenne smiled at you, yawned widely and settled in for the night. You laid on Floatzel, staring up at the sky until you heard Dedenne's snoring. Great, he snored. That wasn't going to help you sleep later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour passed while you waited around. Underneath you, Floatzel slept placidly, satisfied. Dedenne had uncurled, stretching and turning over and over until he found a comfortable position. It was like the entire forest had gone to sleep, the only sounds you could hear was a breeze passing through the leaves, and the faraway sounds of bug Pokemon. It was a peaceful night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was still no sign of the Dedennes. Given how it was night, you judged it was unlikely they'd arrive so late. They likely would be here the next day. A possible clue, so close yet so far! Or perhaps not so far? Dedenne was right there --- a very large Dedenne who had been affected by something. You got off Floatzel and approached Dedenne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom up-close, Dedenne was a behemoth. Usually a Dedenne would be much smaller, this one was even bigger than Floatzel! To think it had grown along the years...but perhaps you'd be able to find something? Such a drastic, unnatural change surely had to leave traces of some sort. You ran your hand over Dedenne's fur, letting it sink until you touched skin. Dedenne didn't react at all. You didn't have to wait until the other Dedennes returned, you decided. There were two options available to you right now:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe you could explore Dedenne's body. There could be traces or clues on him that could tell you what you were dealing with. He was asleep right now, so you pretty much had free reign to do whatever you wanted. You frowned, a tad uncertain. Right now all you were thinking about was examining the exterior of his body, but if you found nothing then what would you do? You didn't feel like examining his insides...but maybe you'd have to if you found nothing. Or if you found anything that could indicate you'd have to enter him to find out more. That'd make it necessary too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other option you had right now was interrupt Dedenne's sleep and interrogate him.

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When you heard Dedenne thought you were some of Floatzel's fur you were relieved. That had to mean you'd be spat out, as that's what anyone would do with hair or fur in their mouths. You struggled to stay afloat and conscious, trying to be ready for impact, but then you felt everything moving in the opposite direction you expected. \"Wait!\" you yell when all the spit and you moved towards the throat, already opening to receive you. Right before you were swallowed, all you could think was that you hoped Dedenne's stomach would be hospitable enough not to make you float around in digesting food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling of weightlessness catches you. The throat squeezes the ocean of spit and you, mercifully keeping you on top, while it all descends with frightening speed down Dedenne's throat and esophagus. It's all happening way too quickly, not even giving you a moment to catch your breath, while you plunge down into the depths of the giant rodent. The sphincter to the stomach opens with an audible sound and you fall through, bouncing on the side of the entrance and falling towards a side, free from the saliva that made the trip along with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou expected to splash on gastric juices and food, or on spongy tissue if Dedenne's stomach was miraculously empty. You certainly didn't expect to fall on a surface so hard you were stunned. Trying not to black out from the impact, you crawled forward, dizzy, until you felt safe enough to stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strangest mix of sensations was invading all your senses. The smell was odd: a combination of nuts, herbs, something that really resembled cinnamon, and vomit. It was like you were smelling very acidic peanuts. It wasn't <i>unpleasant</i>, but you didn't want to keep inhaling it for too long. The stomach was faintly illuminated, like a slight electrical current was underneath the stomach lining. The gastric soup was sparkling underneath the platform you were on, you could see bits and lumps underneath the surface, undoubtedly food being processed. Finally, you seemed to be on a metallic shard of something. You examined it, finding grooves and reflecting material. It took you a moment to realize what it was:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remembered having seen this texture in a book, it was the inside of a Pokeball. This wasn't the only shard in the stomach. In the faint illumination you could see dozens of smaller shards embedded onto the walls of the stomach, metal and plastic inserted into the tissue. You recognized the color of the plastic: this was from one of those novelty giant-making Pokeballs from a region you don't remember right now. Could that be the explanation for Dedenne's size? There must be shards all over Dedenne's digestive system. Hoping to get shards as proof of what was happening, you decided to take a couple more, in case you got separated from the shard you were riding. Trying to row the shard to the wall, you start paddling as much as you can with your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"Why's this happening?!\"</span> Floatzel shrieked, frustrated, while she tried to tackle Dedenne. She had to get the human out of the mouse, The large Dedenne didn't expect that, he had been saying how it was so unusual to see Pokemon from the river, when Floatzel slammed onto his abdomen. It wasn't as effective as Floatzel could have hoped, he barely staggered. Instead he put a hand on Floatzel's back, surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cyellow\">\"Something wrong? Did I say something I shouldn't have?\"</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"You have to spit them out!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cyellow\">\"Who?\"</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"Wait, I don't even have thread right now, and even if I had, it wouldn't be enough...there has to be a way to solve this,\"</span> Floatzel said to herself, ignoring Dedenne. All he could do was keep watching in confusion. He had been about to ask Floatzel to explain when he felt a sudden tingling sensation coming from inside him. The tingling sensation increased very quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloatzel's attempt to help you hadn't gone unnoticed to you. Her attack on Dedenne's abdomen had hit lower than the stomach, but it had been enough to rock the sack you were in. Waves formed, moving the shard around. A couple others fell into the mixture, a hundred shards still into the walls. You held onto the grooves of the shard you were on, until it crashed against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" you hoped it didn't hurt Dedenne. The stomach reacted immediately to the impact, you could just watch while the effects made themselves known pretty quickly.</span></div></div>",

It wasn't likely it was the literal truth, but if that species did have some foresight, then this Xatu Floatzel mentioned should be of help. You nod when Floatzel says that. \"I'd like to talk with that Xatu. How far away is that mountain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloatzel grins, takes you delicately, and walks outside of her den, holding you high so you can see. \"Do you see that mountain over there?\" she pointed at a mountain that was just a couple hours of distance away. \"That's the one\" The mountain was rocky, with trees all over the base, but the higher you looked, the more barren it seemed. The peak was barely visible, you were sure you could see something that seemed to be snow. That was a rather tall mountain!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you gone up there before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? No, I haven't. But I'm confident in my skills. We'll be fine!\" she reassured you, the way she exclaimed was dripping with confidence. Still, that was a really tall mountain, and if it got colder the higher you went...you couldn't avoid being worried. Not only for you, but for Floatzel. She didn't seem particularly ready for colder climates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloatzel and you left the den at dawn, ready for the new adventure of going up the mountain, you holding onto her neck, right beside her flotation device. Walking through the trees, Floatzel seemed to be in a rather good mood, until you both got to the parts where the trees stopped and the rocks and moss increased. From there on the trip would be much more difficult. Floatzel looked up at the peak, and psyched herself up: \"Alright, are you ready? This is going to be steep\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not like I'm the one walking on this place. I'm more worried for you than for myself,\" you admitted. Floatzel seemed rather flattered for your concern, she patted your head and back of your neck with a paw. You weren't sure you liked when she did that, it made you feel like a pet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, are you worried? It'll be fine, this isn't the first time I come to a mountain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really. When I was younger I used to play around here with a friend. We used to climb around because he wanted to be strong. I think he left to go to faraway lands, but I'm sure some of that strength we got back then is still in me. I'm prepared\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew herself better than you knew her, if she said she was ready then you weren't going to doubt her. You got comfortable between her flotation device and her fur. \"Alright, let's do it. Be careful\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful is one of my qualities, friend, it's part of being an explorer,\" she boasted, jumping high and grabbing onto a jutting stone. The arduous climb towards the peak of the mountain had started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou trusted Floatzel's survivalist skills, and she clearly knew what she was doing. You could feel it in her movements, in the way she stepped on every trecharous part of the path with confidence, even though she crossed a lot of narrow ledges and frightening-looking chasms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite that, you felt something was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sky overhead had gone cloudy, and when that happened, the temperature was reduced considerably. Floatzel's face had flashed concern, she stopped for a moment, surveying the sky. \"It...doesn't look like the clouds are going away,\" she said. You felt the muscles beside you tremble very, very slightly. She was cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we go back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I refuse. This isn't like I had planned, but we have come too far to retreat. The peak is just a few hours away,\" she said, determined. Fire of bravery burned in her eyes, you hoped that fire would keep her warm in the increasingly colder weather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more time passed the more obvious it was this was very taxing for Floatzel. Her movements were still very energic, her steps firm and nimble, but the trembling you felt through her neck had increased in intensity. The stronger her tremors got, the more guilty you felt. She was doing this for you, she was almost to her limit because of your situation. Floatzel was truly a friend you could rely on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just hoped it wouldn't lead to she being harmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloatzel looked up, frost falling around them. \"Look, there's some frost. We're close\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should camp or something--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. If we stop moving we'll be in more danger. We don't have a way to keep warm,\" she declared. She wasn't wrong. \"We have to reach the cave at the peak, that's our best bet\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" you said. You pressed yourself onto Floatzel's fur, like it was going to transfer some of your warmth to her. Her neck and the flotation device had protected you from the cold, you were nice and toasty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a thank you you should befriend a Floatzel when you return to normal. Have one as a companion,\" she said lightly. That was something you were actually considering. Still, your return to normality was still far away, and it wouldn't happen unless Floatzel reached the peak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just hoped she'd succeed and reach the caves.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The best laid plans run into snags, something goes wrong, something doesn't go as expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloatzel's shivering was increasing to worrying amounts, so much you were actively being moved around by the contractions of her muscles. The fur all around you was starting to have bits of frost, and the flotation device felt cold as ice. For the first time, even in your cozy spot, you were starting to feel the cold. You could only imagine how Floatzel felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"...I have to keep going. You won't last long...out there in the cold,\" </span>she mumbled, walking forward. Her steps were growing tired. You raised your voice:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't sound well at all! Maybe we should go down the mountain for now!\" even though you said that, she ignored you completely. You silently cursed the clouded skies -- ruining Floatzel's efforts like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cursing turned into fear when Floatzel collapsed. It was sudden, one moment she was going on all fours to grip the barren rocks better, the next she was falling onto her belly. \"Floatzel?\" you called. You got no response. \"Floatzel, say something!\" she was alive, you could hear her breathing when you put your ear against her neck, but falling unconscious at a time like that was very dangerous. If she got any colder...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of your friend dying made your heart jump to your throat. You got on top of her flotation device on her back, jumping up and down to try to get her to rouse. \"Come on, you have to stand up! You're...you're close, don't give up!\" It was useless, though. She didn't even twitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuilt invaded you. You felt this was your fault, she had wanted to help you and now she was going to freeze to death on a mountain. You should have asked her for other options. You should have suggested she should get something warm to carry. There must have been something you could have done! Even though the cold was a real danger for you too, you didn't fear for your life, you were more worried for Floatzel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't much time for pity. A big shadow enveloped the area, barely visible on the dirt and moss. At first you thought it was the clouds above moving and covering everything even more, but the sound of something landing beside Floatzel dispelled that notion. You looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a bird. A frighteningly large bird, covered with what seemed to be a steel armor of some sort, frost caked on them. Black feathers peeked from between some of them, you saw large and bright red eyes on the head. The wings were covered with steel, and so were the rather sharp-looking talons. There were very few places without steel, just the holes for the eyes, the beak, most of the legs, and the underside of the tail feathers and its base. You had never seen a Pokemon like that one before. It reminded you of Honchkrow, as it was clearly a corvid of some sort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat frightened you the most was that, even if you were normal size, you were sure it'd be at the very least two heads taller than you. Where did such a large bird come from?! \"...please, help\" you pleaded. \"We need help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bird opened its beak. A boisterous voice emerged, clearly a male voice.<span class=\"clred\"> \"Don't worry, that's what I'm here for! Believe it or not, I have been watching you for a while already. I feared your orange friend here would collapse!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...wait, you could see me from up there?\" he didn't seem surprised about your presence. If it ever was, then it already had time to convince himself he wasn't seeing things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"Of course, my eyes are second to none. I don't know why you're so small, but that's not what's important right now. I, Corviknight, shall take you under my wing for protection!\"</span> he patted his chest with a wing, lowered his head and whispered. <span class=\"clred\">\"Metaphorically. What I'm actually doing is taking you both to get medical attention. That's my job, I'm a scout\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorviknight. Interesting name. \"Medical attention...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"I believe you humans call such places 'hospitals'. It's a place where Pokemon get attention for all sorts of problems, from the most pedestrian illneses, to the more injuries, to those of a more...\"</span> he cawed in what seemed to be an attempt to clear his throat. When he spoke, he seemed a llittle bit flustered.<span class=\"clred\"> \"...of a more private nature. Reproductive problems and all that. Not my field!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...right...\" so in general it was a place where Pokemon got help for medical problems, and now this large bird was going to take Floatzel there. Good! Just what you needed, for once! Corviknight positioned himself over Floatzel, like a mother hen to a chick, giving her some of his warmth. Then, inclining his head, he gazed at you with curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"I must say, your size is unusual. Would it be inaccurate to say you're afflicted by a medical problem too?</span>\" Maybe being shrunk was a medical issue, now that you thought about it. You nodded.<span class=\"clred\"> \"Then you shall be a patient too. Your case seems unusual, though. I mentioned I'm a scout, I scout for both patients and workers\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay?\" you weren't sure where he was going with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"You're smaller than even the smallest Pokemon I have ever seen. I won't beat around the bush: your help would be immensely useful! Sometimes there are cases that need some sort of smaller help. We used to have a few Joltiks who did the job, but they fit in less places inside Pokemon than you'd think\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh. Now you were starting to see where this was going. \"You want me to work at the Pokemon healing place you work at...as a helper?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"To be frank, I don't think we have seen a case like you before. You may not recover your normal size. But wouldn't it be a nice life? Doing your part to help other Pokemon? In exchange, you get warmth, a home, and our company. It's not a bad trade\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was too much to consider at once. Here you were climbing a mountain with Floatzel, to try to get you back to normal size, and then she falls unconscious, a giant crow tells you you may be tiny forever, and then offers you a job as a medical assistant whose job would be crawling inside Pokemon to help. No, you needed time to think about it. No way you could give an answer right away! \"I'll consider it,\" you say. \"Right now all I want is Floatzel to be okay\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow Corviknight, Floatzel twitched. His warmth was helping. Corviknight examined her face carefully, seemingly satisfied with what he was seeing, and turned his attention at you again.<span class=\"clred\"> \"She will be fine! I will carry her now that she's not in a dangerous state anymore!\"</span> he claimed, and once again lowered his voice and head towards you. <span class=\"clred\">\"But...there's an issue\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"You.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing called an issue felt a bit insulting. \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"I cannot carry you like I carry Floatzel. I can grab her easily and carefully, but you're too small to be gripped by my talons\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could ride on Floatzel--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorviknight squaked with indignation: <span class=\"clred\">\"Absolutely not! I cannot condone the risk of you falling down! No, I have to ensure you'll be carried safely, and this is an urgent situation. I wouldn't usually suggest this, but there's no more option:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI must carry you in me!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a chill down your back you're not sure has anything to do with the weather. \"Like inside your armor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorviknight pecked the plates over his belly. <span class=\"clred\">\"These are fused to my plumage, I'm afraid. There's no space, and if there were, you'd be crushed by my muscles. That won't do\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAre you really suggesting\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\u201cThat's right\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\u201cCorrect\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere exactly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\u201cYou could say you have two options.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you really say that?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\u201cAnd my belly\u2019s got acid in it.\u201d</span> he finished with a look of concern. All you did was look at him with disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is what deja vu feels like...\" you mutter. You remembered having a very similar conversation with a different and smaller crow, just a couple days ago. Now you were in a similar, but more urgent situation. Crud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"Is there a problem?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Corviknight, you're asking me to either get swallowed or to get into your ass\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"The correct term is cloaca, human. A cloaca receives both solid and liquid waste--\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not the point! I'm just...\" you sigh. \"It's not like I have a choice to not go. Damn it. My life has spiralled out of control. I just want to feel like I have some control in my life\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorviknight looked at you with sympathy. Slowly, he got off Floatzel, walking to a flatter part of the terrain. <span class=\"clred\">\"I understand. It isn't much, but if it helps, I'll let you go inside me at your own pace,\"</span> he said, folding his legs and loweing his entire body to the ground. Corviknight positioned his head against the rocks, ready to open his beak if you approached it, and made sure the open part of his armor at the base of his tail was low enough for you to go under it and crawl into his vent. You appreciated his willingness to do this at your own rhythm -- he was showing much more consideration than Honchkrow did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the moment you knew you could trust Corviknight with your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you had to make a choice so he could depart and take Floatzel to get help and rest. </span></div></div>",

You\u2019re ready.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You clamber up the lip of Corviknight\u2019s beak and plant a foot on his soft tongue. It wriggles slightly in response, but the armored avian wills it still. You have been granted passage.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Enveloped in his maw, the light outside dims as his beak seals. The white mountain\u2019s brilliance narrows to a slit before it narrows into nothing. You are in a hot and humid inner world. The sounds of the whistling winds outside are silenced. Now the powerful sonorousness of Corviknight\u2019s breath replaces it. Deeper within, you can hear his great heartbeat rump-a-pump away. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You hear a sticky sliding sound as Corviknight\u2019s tongue lifts up. Simultaneously, you sense your center of gravity shift as he begins to tilt his head up. Soon, your stable footing vanishes. You begin to slide down his gluey tongue as you approach the black hole of his throat. Corviknight\u2019s head is now completely vertical\u2014and you are shunted into the clutches of his throat.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Corviknight is a caring fellow\u2014who forged himself an iron will and is a master of self-discipline. But even he, swallowing as gently as he can, cannot quell the hungry clutches of his gullet. His esophageal muscles cram you downward with the strength and dispassion of an uncaring lord. The wet meat mashes with primal, mindless instinct\u2014and despite the hot flesh pressing against your skin, you feel that whatever smidgen of will Corviknight\u2019s tissue possesses, it\u2019s colder than his steel armor. Before, you\u2019ve only been swallowed by a bat and a weasel-otter. Now it\u2019s extremely apparent you\u2019re in the gorge of an alpha predator. Despite Corviknight\u2019s clear friendliness and passion for life, you\u2019re made keenly aware of your place in the food chain.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You\u2019re propelled forward, passing through a tight ring and expelled into a pungent-smelling sack. You splash into the mushed-up remains of\u2026something as you plunge underneath the semi-solid surface of the bird\u2019s internal pool. You flip and twirl in the mush before finding your orientation. With squeezed-closed eyes and a wrinkled-shut nose, you swim to the surface, allowing the goo to slide away like water off a duck\u2019s back. You take your first breath in a forever and find it stained with an acrid odor. The previous scent of birdseed is omnipresent too, but it\u2019s now soured and wry.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Corviknight\u2019s voice shakes the contents of the mud-like pool around you.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cred\">\u201cMy most sincerest apologies, valiant human. I had filled my belly to prepare for the day of work ahead. But I fear my gluttony has conferred you a maltreatment most foul.\u201d </span>You feel the great mucky lagoon slosh back-and-forth as Corviknight struts along\u2014likely toward your unconscious friend. \u201cI will carry your friend to the safety of Sanctuary.\u201d He does another of his half caw, half cough throat clears.<span class=\"cred\"> \u201cAh\u2014and I\u2019ll try to keep the flight steady and smooth. It must be\u2026 very gross in there.\u201d</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He is most certainly not wrong.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s not\u2026 the worst I\u2019ve been through.\u201d You admit. As repugnant of a place this is, nothing will beat the squalor of Honchkrow\u2019s cloaca.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After a brief moment of silence, Corviknight clears his throat once more. You and the goopy stuff lurch upward as whatever is blocking the crow\u2019s throat gets ripped away.<span class=\"cred\"> \u201cApologies\u2014force of habit.\u201d</span> And without another word, you feel Corviknight shift his weight around as he grips Floatzel before launching off into the sky with a flap of his wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0True to his word, Corviknight\u2019s flight to what he called \u201cSanctuary\u201d is smooth and stable. The Pokemon glides along with the winds, flapping his wings only when needed\u2014and even then, minimizing the jostle as much as possible. You got splashed around some, sure. But it could\u2019ve been a lot worse. For most of the flight you just soak in the mire of his belly. At the start of your journey, your vision is completely obscured by darkness\u2014leaving only your nose and your ears to paint a picture of your surroundings. But as your journey continued, a peculiar thing happened. You began to see, ever-so-slightly. The darkness was still oppressive, but you could barely make out the rumpled walls of the crow\u2019s belly, the murky soup of his earlier lunch, and the slow churning movements of his stomach at work. The smells of his internal broth still are an offense to your nose, but you grow used to it. And somehow, the scent of digesting birdseed only grows stronger. In a strange way, it reminds you of the collection of birdhouses your grandmother used to have. The kind that drew all the bird Pokemon from all over\u2014of many different colors and sizes. The old memory brings you comfort as you sit there, reminiscing and letting the hours melt away...</span></span></div></div>",

Corviknight humors you with some small talk, distracting you from the other unpleasantries of his stomach. You\u2019re in the middle of a conversation over your preferences of medieval swords and shields (which you try to desperately feign interest and knowledge of the subject) when your chat halts and Corviknight addresses someone unseen.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cred\">\u201cGreetings, Joltik.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Swimming through the contents of Corviknight's stomach is difficult. It feels like swimming through quicksand, and in the faint light of Joltik's incandescence, you see the color is close enough. Joltik tries to move towards you, but he doesn't seem to be a very good swimmer, you do most of the job, until you finally grasp the bug's side. Joltik, although bigger than you, is not that big. Your head reaches his eyes' height. It's comforting to be with someone who is almost as small as you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Get up there, this is gonna be a ride,\"</span> says Joltik, sinking a little in the mire to make this easier for you. You grab the fur and hoist yourself up, soon getting to Joltik's back. <span class=\"ctan\">\"Hang tight\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" there's spider silk looped around Joltik's midsection, so much there's plenty for you to grab, You get your fingers through it, grabbing some of the silk. Much to your surprise, some strands snap under your fingers. That's odd... you thought these were supposed to be tougher than this. A sudden bad feeling invades you. \"Joltik, can you turn on the lights a bit more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"I guess?\"</span> Joltik's fur gets a little tingly, and soon there's more light, enough for you to see around clearly. Corviknight's stomach is large and with a lot of birdseed in it, halfway digested, thanks to all the time you have been there already. You ignore the contracting pouch and focus on the silk. What you see makes a knot in your throat -- the strings seem corroded. You look up, see nothing, and instead notice the safety string is lying against the wall of the stomach. Acidic liquids are dripping on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The silk is breaking down. We have to get out now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you saw fills Joltik with urgency as well. Hurrying as much as he can without jostling you -- a distressingly small speed -- Joltik starts backing up, crawling up the wall by holding the string. Joltik manages to get halfway in direction of the esophagus sphincter when you hear a soft snap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext you know, you're splashing in Corviknight's belly juices, with Joltik's light weight above you. It's enough to hold you down for several seconds before you swim away, and when you surface, you hear Joltik is shouting at Corviknight.<span class=\"ctan\"> \"--it broke, I see it all dissolving!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"I still have silk in my beak and throat. Can you reach it?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's none left in here!\" he could make more, but without a place to tie it into... <span class=\"ctan\">\"You're the senior here, what do we do?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the flap of wings outside. <span class=\"cred\">\"This is unfortunate, but looks like I have no choice. I shall undergo surgery\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"WHAT?!\"</span> Joltik shouts surprisingly loudly for a little guy his size. <span class=\"ctan\">\"No, no you won't!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"It'll be the easiest way for you and the human to get out. The Leavanny will need an hour or two to prepare, but--\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Don't, please don't! We'll think of something\"</span> Joltik pleads. You voice your agreement. Corviknight didn't deserve to undergo such a procedure for your sake. The matter settled, you crawl on Joltik again. He's completely soaked in spit and digested birdseed, but it's still comforting to be on him. <span class=\"ctan\">\"Okay, we need to think of something\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about other Joltiks?\" you suggest. Everything around you grumbles and shakes, the symphony of Corviknight's body at work is just so loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"I'm afraid we have a shortage, human! The one with you is the only Joltik around. That's why I was offering you a job\"</span> Corviknight explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"E-Enough! Corviknight, please rest. I'll handle this, I promise.\"</span> you feel Corviknight settle down to wait for you and Joltik to get out. If only the raven could just throw you up...! A couple minutes pass, both of you are thinking as much as you can. Joltik is floating around, letting the stomach's movements push him all over the place. <span class=\"ctan\">\"What a first outing...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just joined them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"I arrived a few months ago. There was a lot to learn and memorize before I could start,\"</span> Joltik says. <span class=\"ctan\">\"My dad and my grandmother and many other generations helped here until they evolved, so it was my turn to do the family tradition. They wouldn't have let this happen to them...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh no. Your bug friend wasn't feeling confident about his job choice. You hope patting Joltik's head isn't too bold, because you do so. \"Being inside Pokemon isn't too bad,\" you tell a white lie. \"I have been inside others before this one\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Really? But you're still alive! I mean...\"</span> he looks around. <span class=\"ctan\">\"You know Corviknight's acids are real strong? But you're still intact! You humans are made of tough stuff. I had to get covered in all sorts of things to stop acids. Anyhoo, how did you get out?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One time it was like with the spider silk, just that it didn't break. The other time...\" you look down towards the surface of the birdseed goop. You very faintly see the outline of another sphincter beneath it all. \"...I had to wait for nature to take its course\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Oh. Ew.\"</span> Joltik shudders underneath you. He didn't seem eager at all about such option. Big mood. <span class=\"ctan\">\"Let's leave that for plan B. Or maybe even plan C. Any other ideas?\"</span> you didn't say anything. Joltik turns his head to look at you. In his eyes, you see so much concern your heart melts a little.<span class=\"ctan\"> \"Corviknight has helped me since the start. Honestly I'd rather crawl travel through his guts than let him be under surgery because of me. Please...we have to think of something...\"</span> to be honest, you also didn't like the thought of Corviknight doing that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Just so you know, I ate at dawn today. If you take too long I'm afraid my body may push things along before surgery preparations can be finished. Can I contact Leavanny already?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" both Joltik and you shout at once. Corviknight didn't try to convince you again, but his point was clear: take too long and his body would take the decision for you. Suddenly, you get an idea. \"Corviknight, you should get on a high place! And then you should tilt your body so the esophagus entrance is closer to us. That way we can crawl up and get the silk in your esophagus!\" you propose. Joltik nods with enthusiasm. It could work!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weightlessness of Corviknight taking flight submerges you and Joltik in the acids for a moment. Outside, Corviknight settles high on the roof of the facility, and slowly tilts his body forward, gripping the edge of the facility with his talons. Slowly, the tide carries you forward. You're hopeful!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil everything just rushes ahead and slams onto the upper end of the stomach. It all is immediately submerged under a pond of digested birdseed. <span class=\"ctan\">\"It's the shape of his stomach,\"</span> explained Joltik. <span class=\"ctan\">\"The way out is going to get covered as soon as he tilts enough for us to get there\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then don't tilt so much. Corviknight, tilt back!\" It takes a few minutes, but between the three of you you finally get the right inclination for the esophageal sphincter to be available. The problem is that it's up an almost ninety-degree climb, too high to reach. \"I really thought this would work...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"It still can. Kinda,\"</span> says Joltik. Clumsily, he reaches the wall and tests it -- the bouncy and soft wall keep oozing slimes. Joltik can barely get his footing. <span class=\"ctan\">\"...I thought so...\"</span> he says. For a moment you thought he'd give up, but then he jumped onto the stomach wall. You hold onto him while he, very slowly, climbs the wall towards the sphincter. You can feel the strain of his bug muscles underneath you, you fear that in any moment he'll lose footing and tumble down into the stomach contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't happen, though. With a last effort, Joltik slams a foreleg through the sphincter, forcing it open and eliciting a caw of discomfort from Corviknight. You did it! Joltik's foreleg trembles. <span class=\"ctan\">\"What are you waiting for? Go\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoltik doesn't seem able to smile, but you feel it would if it could. <span class=\"ctan\">\"I won't get a grip enough to get myself out of here, but I thought I should get you out\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get me out...?\" Then you understand. Joltik had tested the wall and found it was impossible for him to climb it well. Despite that, he had made an herculean effort to make a climb he wouldn't benefit from, all so you'd have a chance to go out. These Pokemon were truly invested in others' safety. It made you feel awfulyou couldn't reciprocate with ease. \"But what about you...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"I'll be fine. I won't get digested, and I'll think of something else\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"I still can get--\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Will you can it about your surgery? I'll try anything but that!\"</span> Joltik shouts. You feel him slip, until he's hanging by the foreleg in the sphincter. <span class=\"ctan\">\"If I don't think of something I'll just go down the intestines. It's no big deal.\"</span> he closes his eyes. <span class=\"ctan\">\"I'll...just think of it as a lesson in bird digestive systems\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou doubt he'll last much longer hanging from the entrance to the stomach. You look behind you, through the opening. There's a corroded spider silk some distance up the esophagus, but you think you can reach it. Then you look down at the bug who had come to get you and was pretty much sacrificing himself for your sake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently the main trait in this Sanctuary place was sacrificing yourself for others. Pretty fitting for a medical center. Corviknight was willing to go through a procedure for you and Joltik's sake. Now Joltik was trying his hardest to get you out cleanly even if he couldn't. Such goodhearted Pokemon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a decision.</span></div></div>",

His many eyes are scrunched in concentration. His leg that\u2019s latched on to Corviknight\u2019s esophageal opening quivers, his muscles slowly failing to keep their grip. But you look down at the bug, his fur matted with the bird\u2019s digestive juices\u2014the once vibrant yellow soiled\u2014and give him a solid, steadfast look.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not leaving you.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Half the bug\u2019s eyes open in strained shock,<span class=\"ctan\"> \u201cno!

Under murky water, you can hear the indistinct, shrill cry of disbelief and surprise as Joltik watches you sink under the surface. Moments later, he lets out a defeated yelp as he loses his grip and tumbles down into the mushy, mashy semiliquid\u2014joining you beneath the surface. Even beneath the squalid tide, you can see his four eyes morph half-lidded into an expression of <i>why??</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You reply with a wink. As much as he wants to hide it, you can see the deep appreciation in his eyes.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You two, bug and human, break the surface. Joltik sputters something out his mouth as you try and smother your disgust with a smile.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you go!?\u201d </span>Joltik grills you.<span class=\"ctan\"> \u201cYou could\u2019ve been outta here!

You pass the time chatting with Joltik and pacifying the bundle of nerves that is Corviknight. At the moment, you\u2019re trying to relax\u2014resting your back against the squishy wall of his gut.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cred\">\u201cPerhaps\u2014\u201d</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cNo, Corviknight.

For your sake.\u201d</span> He caws and chuckles again. From where you are, you can hear the great drum of his heart slow down considerably. It seems the good bird finally got a hold over himself. Joltik swings his look over on to you. His look of exasperation is so plain on his face, that you\u2019re surprised that it isn\u2019t written on it.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0An oh-so-familiar gurgling, draining noise burbles up to your ears. You know it well; any possibility of doubt over what it is rinses away as you notice the muck level lowering. You spy Joltik\u2019s expression of worry as he realizes what\u2019s happening.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He says in a small voice, <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cI don\u2019t want to go down there\u2026\u201d</span> It hits you. The bug is afraid. He kept up his mask of confidence for this long, but now it is starting to crack. You swim over to the bug, fighting against the riptide that desires to pull everything to the depths of the Steel-type.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cJoltik, we have to go.\u201d You say with an intrepidness even you didn\u2019t expect. \u201cIf we don\u2019t go now, that antacid stuff you soaked in is going to wear off.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cI\u2026\u201d </span>Joltik falters.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re going to be food if we don\u2019t go now!\u201d Joltik winces at the bluntness of your words, but when his eyes pop back open, the fire of a reluctant determination burns behind them. He dives.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You follow.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Instantly, you\u2019re snatched by the undercurrent. You pulled along with the digested gluck, praying Joltik is going along with you. You swirl and spin as you\u2019re jostled along with Honchkrow\u2019s food as you\u2019re sent past the duodenum. You dare to squint open your eyes, but the murky subsurface prevents you from seeing anything but clouded waters.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Suddenly, you\u2019re shunted into a narrower tube. You flop into a river of the belly\u2019s former contents as more mixtures spills from behind you. You float to the surface and inhale the humid, sultry air of Corviknight\u2019s internals.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You look around. Is Joltik with you?</span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It doesn't take long for you to see the light coming from Joltik. It's a little bit ahead, thankfully he's floating in the current. You hurry to swim towards your bug friend. Once you reach him, you grab his behind and climb to his back once again. \"Here you are,\" you say. \"I'm glad you're safe.\" He doesn't reply to you. You say something else: \"Good thing you float, too\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"...I'm sorry, I just need a moment\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoltik turns his head towards you. He does look a little disgusted. <span class=\"ctan\">\"This was supposed to be a simple extraction assignment, something that's going to be routine. Now I'm floating in the intestines and I'll be pooped out later.\"</span> Joltik sighs. <span class=\"ctan\">\"It's not how I imagine my first assignment would go\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grimace a little. He's right, it's not exactly a pleasant thought. \"Look at the bright side: you'll succeed at the extraction, it just...won't be from the end you expected\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Because you refused to leave when you had the chance!\"</span> he said, but then added: <span class=\"ctan\">\"But I guess it's fine. Misery loves company?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe current around you slows down gradually, until the formerly strong torrent you entered the intestines with was reduced to a more leisure pace. Mangled seeds and oats surround Joltik and you, fresh from the stomach. Everything shakes for a moment, until you hear Corviknight's voice coming from right in front of you. He must be talking to his belly plates.<span class=\"cred\"> \"If I'm not mistaken you both must have left my stomach already. Are you both okay? Is everything intact?\"</span> Once you confirmed you were fine and unharmed, Corviknight exhaled. His heartbeat sounded relaxed. <span class=\"cred\">\"Good. I'm sure you'll be pleased to know you won't be in any danger from now on\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"It just will be gross?\"</span> Joltik asked. You were sure that was a rhetorical question -- one Corviknight didn't answer. Avoiding the topic, you noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"Joltik, valiant human, my body is a carefully calibrated machine. I have established an efficient routine, so you have nothing to worry about. My body will take care of everything\"</span> Corviknight returned to his home in the facility, a rather large nest with a neatly measured feeding trough to a side.<span class=\"cred\">\"I see the sky is turning red, meaning by now my morning meal left my stomach. You'll be in my small intestines until around 2AM, when you'll arrive to my large intestine. From there it's six hours more before you reach the end of my digestive tract, before the...the daily voiding of bodily residues at noon\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoiding of bodily residues. What a wordy way of saying 'shitting'. Joltik and you exchanged a glance. <span class=\"ctan\">\"You're going to make an exception to your routine and letting us out earlier than that, right?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Why, of course! I wouldn't let you two stew in my rectum for four entire hours. I imagine going there is unpleasant already,\"</span> he said before starting his evening meal. You heard the sound of seeds and berries splash in the stomach right above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you got a timetable established. It didn't really matter to you since you didn't have a way to tell time, but you filed that away in your head anyway. Looks like you and Joltik had a long night ahead of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"You said you had gone through something like this once. What did you do to pass the time?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try to sleep and be scrunched by my predator's guts\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"That isn't happening to us.\"</span> He was right. The walls of Corviknight's small intestine weren't even touching you. You chalked it up to the size difference -- Noibat's 1'08\" size and Corviknight's 7'03\" were too different. \"Any ideas to pass the time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, counting villi was almost akin to counting sheep, if sheep emitted gurgles and squelching instead of bleating. Joltik and you were trying to do something else other than stare ahead into the endless-looking fuzzy tunnel of Corviknight's intestine, and the result was that you were both idly counting villi to see how high you could go before losing track of the number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"3064983...\"</span> Joltik mumbled underneath you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"1632. 1633\" you counted, feeling drowsy. The sounds of Corviknight's body at work were oddly calming, if you had to be honest. Maybe it was because you were inside someone you trusted, but it didn't feel like the stressful situation you had the last three times you were inside a Pokemon. You felt the large crow flying around, 'making a last round' before ending for the day. It may have been because you were getting steadily lower into the avian body, but you felt the impact of him landing resonate through the tunnel more than you did before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"I'm about to retire to sleep. Status report, Joltik\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoltik lifted a leg, a strand of thick goop sticking to it. \"It's almost time\" Between the three of you you had agreed a plan of action: as soon as the goop thickened enough, Joltik would try to get ahead as much as possible to avoid getting stuck in fully digested food. Corviknight had insisted you and your bug friend had to stay a healthy distance ahead of the meal that had received you, because -- in his words -- <span class=\"cred\">\"Things can get real vile if you stay in the middle of that\"</span>. You didn't doubt that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"I suppose I'll hear from you both in the morning. Don't worry, I'll take the day off to make sure your release doesn't happen away from the Sanctuary.\"</span> Joltik looked guilty when he heard that. You imagined Corviknight wasn't the kind to take days off at all, and now he had to because of this. <span class=\"cred\">\"Good luck. May my body treat you well\"</span> Soon the breathing slowed down, and the heartbeat acquired a steady rhythm. Corviknight had fallen asleep. Only the gurgling and constant contractions of the intestines around you continued like normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoltik tested the state of the food again.<span class=\"ctan\"> \"I'd say this is thick enough. Let's go.\"</span> you made sure you were gently grabbing Joltik's fur, and the two of you trekked over the slime towards the front. It was going to be a lot of effort, and all of it was going to be done by your bug friend, while you coasted along on his back. <span class=\"ctan\">\"You should catch some zzzzs\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"I'll have plenty of time to rest once we're out. Or once we have to play the waiting game for Corviknight to let us out,\"</span> he guessed. <span class=\"ctan\">\"Sleep, I'll take care of this\".</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was real tempting. You didn't want to, but...the lullaby of Corviknight's organs, the warmth around you, the soft, fuzzy bed you were lying on...it would be nice to sleep. But you couldn't, not when you had to keep Joltik company. Trying to keep yourself awake, you decided to continue counting villi. What number were you at...? Drat, you'd have to start from zero again. One, two, three, four...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou barely reached fifty before you fell asleep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Birdseed, sun, and the sound of wings. Through the foggy haze of your dream, you once again remembered your grandma's birdhouse collection. When you visited you liked to watch the avian Pokemon from the window. Most were small, but sometimes larger ones appeared. Today there were a lot of crows, for some reason. With what seemed to be medieval armor on. Curious about those bird Pokemon, you exited the house, walking towards the birdhouse they were gathering around. You heard noises coming from inside, you entered without much hesitation. You were instantly blasted by an oppressive heat and a stench that almost knocked you out. Just great, you must have wandered into the shed where your grandmother kept the fertilizer. Not wanting to be there, you turned around and exited the birdhouse, but the smell remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pleasant dream vanished away, replaced by the far less nostalgic smell of scat. You opened your eyes, falling to your knees and coughing for a while. It was pretty bad! There still was a faint smell of birdseed in the air, but now it was far heavier with other things, with a stench that threatened to overwhelm you. It takes you a few minutes to gather your wits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if the smell wasn't confirmation enough, the wide space all around you proved it: you had arrived into Corviknight's large intestine. You were on the upper part of a slope, and down you could see a large pool of congealing substances, right in front of a ring of tissue. It seemed you were right at the start of the colon. You looked around, wondering where Joltik was, and find him a few steps away. You stagger towards him, trying your hardest to get used to the stench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoltik was staring down the colon, as far as his light could reach. The ribbed tunnel ebbed and flowed, inviting you to walk further. You reached Joltik, and pat his side. <span class=\"ctan\">\"Are you okay? Is the smell too bad?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I don't have much of a sense of smell.\" You sure were jealous of that. It felt like you were never going to get used to the bad air. <span class=\"ctan\">\"It's just that I keep remembering some unpleasant things from my training. It makes me dread going forward\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" you paid more attention to the tunnel ahead. There were a few thin rivulets of white liquid on the walls, and in other places white powder. Greenish round pebbles littered the way. It...wasn't entirely clean, but it wasn't <i>too</i> bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoltik stepped away from the white liquid. <span class=\"ctan\">\"Most birds, um...they don't have a bladder. Their bodies move liquids upstream for some more absorbtion before it all flows down again for expulsion. In other words, this is...pretty much urine from Corviknight's cloaca\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat a joyful thought. \"Oh.\" If \"fun facts\" like those were going through Joltik's head you definitely understood why he was so hesitant to continue on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoltik gingerly walked forward. <span class=\"ctan\">\"I fear things may get nastier the further we go\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose there's a risk, but it'll all be over later. We'll be out of Corviknight in just a few hours\" you said with more aplomb than you actually felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let's get walking. We still have to leave that behind,\" Joltik glanced at the pool of digested birdseed that had arrived shortly after him, and quickened the pace. Joltik's words kept echoing in your head. Nastier, huh. Could Corviknight have broken his routine even further and tried to make your trek easier by emptying his bowels? Routine was a poweful thing. Although reliable, Corviknight seemed to have been busy with many other things. He may not have thought about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd find out the deeper you went.</span></div></div>",

His weak glow alights the yuck-stuff that once lurked in the shadows. Thin streams of white flow down the walls like a trailing raindrop on a windshield, oftentimes congealing into a miniature pool on the filthy floor. You spy Joltik very carefully sidestepping as much of the dregs as he can. Teetering and tottering, trying his best not to tumble into his coworker's waste, Joltik finds great relief in that he can mostly avoid dipping his tips in muck.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You follow in his footsteps.

You have mountain climbed once or twice. Same principle here, really. You just gotta put your hands in the right place. But in here, finding a bad handhold means slapping your hand in crow poop. That's a mistake you are not making.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0All the while Corviknight's sleeping heart steadily beats away. Mixed in with his heartbeat are content coos from the crow, snoozing away\u2014his worries of the world put on ice. His murmurings and chirps saturate the tunnel\u2014almost as much as stench. As you worm your way around a particularly large clumping of waste pellets, you can't help but wonder. Corviknight is in dreamland. He's happy. But he's also unaware: of you. His dreamscape would certainly be a nightmare if his mind is filled with thoughts about your fate. But in this brief moment, he's checked out of reality. Right now, he doesn't even know you're here. He might not even remember you exist.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A shiver runs down your spine. For a moment, you feel alone.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But then you see Joltik: squeamishly surveying a pile of Corviknight's refuse. You realize: you're not alone.

You haven't a clue of the time, but when you heard the crow drearily rouse awake and stretch his wings\u2014compressing the intestines a bit and shifting things around, sending an unfortunate Joltik tumbling into a small clump of white-brown-green scat\u2014you could wager a guess. Now that the big guy is awake, he doesn't waste a second before bending a beak underwing to address his lower guts.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cred\">\"Joltik, Human, I dearly hope everything is okay.\"</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Joltik looks at you with half-lidded eyes. <span class=\"ctan\">\"You tell 'em, Champ.\"</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your couple second delay in answering prompts Corviknight to quickly jab an addendum. <span class=\"cred\">\"Human? Joltik! Please, please respond! My digestive system is perfunctory, meticulous\u2014ruthless. It could've grinded you to goo, buried you in refuse! No! I dread to think! The clutches of sleep, dragging me into a pleasant dream as my friends were <i>snuffed </i>out within me! O' woe! Great souls, perished alone\u2014dark, afraid; within\u2014\"</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We're okay Corviknight.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Corviknight stands stock still. Even the undulations of his bowels seem to momentarily freeze.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cred\">\"Oh.\"</span> He says. <span class=\"cred\">\"That's relieving to hear.\"</span> You wonder if giant metal-clad birds can get visibly flush.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"ctan\">\"Um,\"</span> Joltik pipes up, <span class=\"ctan\">\"You weren't serious about the whole 'my guts could grind you into goo' thing, right?\"</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The ground beneath you moves in time with Corviknight's uncomfortable shifting. <span class=\"cred\">\"It may have been an exaggeration.\" </span>Joltik furrows his brow(s).<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"ctan\">\"Uh, you sounded awfully confident that your guts <i>really could do that!\"</i></span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cred\">\"It would bring me great relief if you could cease to remember my outburst.\"</span> Joltik keeps prying.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"ctan\">\"Is it because you're embarrassed or because that's something <i>you can really do!\"</i></span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cred\">\"...Both.\"</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"ctan\">\"Uh huh.\"</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cred\">\"Theoretically, at least.\"</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"ctan\">\"Gotcha.\"</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cred\">\"Admittingly, I am unsure. Does this fact bring you solace?\"</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"ctan\">\"Yeah. Now I know I only have a fifty-percent chance of your bum crushing me into goo.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You both continue your travels as you rummage through the deepest depths of the bird. You two quickly learn to adjust your pace with the sway of Corviknight's step. The big corvid seems to be walking somewhere. Where, you don't know. To be honest, you wish he stopped. But you don't have the heart to show him your mind.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You hear a voice from outside.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cpred\">\"Howdy, Corviknight! How do you do?\"</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cred\">\"Greetings, Mistress Audino.\"</span> Corviknight greets her. At the moment you're sitting beside a tuckered-out Joltik resting himself on the foul walls. Honestly, you're thinking about petting him. But you're both kinda icky and you're unsure if he'd find the gesture patronizing. Instead, you take your time to observe your surroundings. Things got a little worse, that's for sure. More white urea finds its ways in the rivets of his bowels, mixing with the ever-present waste. It isn't all-encompassing, but there's noticeably a bit more \"stuff\" than when you first entered.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Audino's chiming, bell-like voice rings. <span class=\"cpred\">\"Mind if I eat breakfast with you? You always eat alone...\"</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cred\">\"Of course.\"</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cpred\">\"And take your time, this time!\" </span>The Normal-type puffs. <span class=\"cpred\">\"You're always in a rush! You need to slow down. You're in-and-out faster than a Farfetch'd who stumbled in a soup shop!\"</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cred\">\"Well, Mistress Audino, you see I'm quite\u2014\"</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cpred\">\"Eat.\"</span> Audino demands in a twinkling voice. <span class=\"cpred\">\"Slowly.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Suddenly you hear the clamoring of a rather jubilant Joltik. <span class=\"ctan\">\"Yes! Yes! <i>Yes!\"</i></span> The sounds of the Pokemon's celebratory spark echo from around the intestinal curve in front of you. The passage runs up at a 45-degree angle before bending right and out of sight. Joltik scurries closer to you and pokes his head from over the edge.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"ctan\"><i>\"We're almost out!\"</i></span> He practically sings his words. Despite the bits of filth that accumulated and stained his coat\u2014not to mention the discoloration from the corvid's belly acids\u2014you've never seen Joltik happier. Granted, you've only known him for a bit.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Joltik looks to you, eyes shining <span class=\"ctan\">\"I see it! The way out!\"</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You never climbed faster in your life. And lo and behold, you saw it. The passage dips down once more. A horrid blend of everything you've seen thus far pools within the trough-like chamber. At the end of it all, you see the vent: your wrinkled gateway to freedom.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But for now, you're staying on the high ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Corviknight feels a subtle tickle in his backside. Worry sprouts in his red eyes. He knows you're at journey's end. He stands abruptly.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cred\">\"Mistress Audino, I beg your forgiveness but I must leave immediately.\"</span> Corviknight says stiffly.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Audino huffs. <span class=\"cpred\">\"Not on my watch, mister! You haven't eaten half your oats and you haven't even warmed your seat.\"</span> You groan hearing the Pokemon's words. The sour smell wafting from Corviknight's waste is making your head dizzy\u2026<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cred\">\"But\u2014\"</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cpred\">\"No.\"</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cred\">\"Miss\u2014\"</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cpred\">\"No!\"</span> Audino pouts something fierce. <span class=\"cpred\">\"Everyone here knows you're the hardest working bird in Sanctuary and I will not allow you to spend your one day off acting like you've got someplace to be.\"</span> Corviknight shrinks under Audino's gaze. She points to the wicker basket of oats Corviknight was eating out of. \"Take your time.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Corviknight gives her an imploring look. When Audino does not relent, he gives a defeated sigh and begins to finish his breakfast. Slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"ctan\">\"So, uh, yeah,\"</span> Joltik yammers, <span class=\"ctan\">\"this is happening now.\"</span> You match Corviknight's exasperation with your own. You faintly hear the crunch of the oat-and-seed meal in Corviknight's beak, the squishing of his gulping, and the splash the masticated remains make when it reaches his gurgling tank\u2014hungry for more.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"ctan\">\"Looks like it\u2026\"</span> you say. You swear that if it things take too long, you're jumping on Joltik's back and telling him to go and force your ways out.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But then Joltik says something you didn't expect. <span class=\"ctan\">\"I'm kinda glad this is happening. He doesn't take care of himself. Always worrying about others.\"</span> Joltik looks wistfully at the exit. <span class=\"ctan\">\"Kinda wish we were a half-hour earlier, though.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Corviknight gobbles the rest of his meal, beak low, before looking up expectantly at Audino.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cred\">\"Mistress Audino?\"</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cpred\">\"Yes?\"</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cred\">\"Am I free to be dismissed?\"</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Audino hums nonchalantly, looking upwards and tapping a finger to her cheek.<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpred\">\"Hmm\u2026\"</span></span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Corviknight considers himself a rather courageous bird, but right now he sure doesn't feel like it. Audino is kind, but forceful, very forceful. Not only that, she's also someone he greatly respects and wants to please, and even if she wasn't, his cordiality and desire to help makes him not want to rudely turn his back to her to go seek a spot he can finally deposit the passangers he has inside. It's a struggle, battling between the need to help you and Joltik, and the need to listen to someone he respects. His armor had never felt so heavy ever since the day he had evolved, and so hot, too. He couldn't sweat, but he knows he'd be sweating buckets right now if he could!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, his apprehension doesn't go unnoticed. His heartbeat has gone rapid, so much you can feel the vibrations through the wall you sit and lean against of, and the passageway you're in keeps contracting sporadically, in a way that feels unnatural. You feel bad for him, even though you want to be out as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpred\">\"...is there something wrong?\"</span> you hear Audino ask. <span class=\"cpred\">\"Your face looks like a Meowth got your tongue\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"I'm fine. I simply need to take care of something,\"</span> Corviknight says. He's struggling a little to keep his growing unease out of his voice. Audino notices, she frowns. For a moment she stares at Corviknight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpred\">\"...I see what's going on\"</span> That's unlikely, you thought. <span class=\"cpred\">\"You asked for a day off, but I'm rather certain it wasn't out of your own volition. Someone asked you to do so.\"</span> Not entirely inaccurate, but not true either. Joltik seems a little bit worried about this. <span class=\"cpred\">\"You're trying to leave and, once you're out there, you'll work as if it was any other day.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoltik sighs. <span class=\"ctan\">\"She knows us all too well.\"</span> Apparently if this were any other situation, Audino may have been right in the money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is she exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Mistress Audino is our leader, but she works along all of us. They say she's as old as time.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorviknight looks down, ashamed. <span class=\"cred\">\"That's not true.\"</span> he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudino pats his chest. <span class=\"cpred\">\"You're hardworking but at this pace you'll burn down under the stress of working. You have to rest and try not to overexert yourself, darling, this isn't good for your health. When I heard you were taking a day off I was very happy, but then I was worried you wouldn't take it quietly. I see my fear was accurate.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"...I'm not sure what to say, Mistress Audino,\"</span> Corviknight says quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpred\">\"You don't have to say anything. Here, I want you to take a walk with me. Just give me a minute to get a couple things and we'll go\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorviknight looks around. A few Pokemon were coming and going, but it was a calm day at the Sanctuary, nothing that'd require Audino to stay around. <span class=\"cred\">\"But what about Sanctuary?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpred\">\"Oh, we'll be fine. We both aren't the only competent 'mons around,\"</span> she said proudly, pleased, and left the dining room, saying she'd be back shortly. That was the chance, Corviknight thought. He could step outside, get you and Joltik out of his rear end, and be back inside before Audino returned. If he hurried enough he could even apologize profusely to you two for the wait. The large crow had barely stepped away in direction of the outside when a voice called him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"Excuse me! The knight bird!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNear you, Joltik slammed the tip of one of his legs to the floor with frustration. <span class=\"ctan\">\"Another interruption?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"No, wait, I want to listen.\"</span> you said, having recognized the voice. Floatzel. The crow also recognized her, so he walked up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Yes? Have you rested well?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"I have. Listen, I know you saved my life. I couldn't talk to you along the way, but I wanted to thank you\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"It's no problem! That's what I live for,\"</span> he boasted, looking carefully at Floatzel. She was in a far better state than the day before, she didn't even have a cold. In fact, she was rather full of energy, raring to go out there and do whatever she wanted. <span class=\"cred\">\"But be more careful in the future when hiking up the mountains. That was quite dangerous\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"I know,\"</span> Floatzel said. That was starting to be a sore point. The mention of that brought her to why she wanted to see Corviknight, though. The entire time she had been incredibly worried about the human she had been carrying, and although they told her you were in good hands, she couldn't stop worrying. Did that mean you had almost frozen too? Were you hurt? Floatzel gestured Corviknight to come closer and lower his head, and once he did that, she whispered to him: <span class=\"corange\">\"I was with...with a very small friend. How are they?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"They're perfectly well! Despite how I found you, they were healthy and unharmed. In fact, right now they're in the company of one of our bugs. It's routine.</span>\" he struggled a little to tell half-truths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloatzel exhaled, relieved. <span class=\"corange\">\"Thank you, thank you so much. I hope they're getting a VIP treatment!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoltik scoffed, keeping back some laughter of disbelief, while a mound of crow poop brushed you while passing before tumbling down into the growing slop at the rectum and cloaca. This was all as far as it could get from VIP treatment. Corviknight didn't even have the heart to nod at that. The otter didn't notice, she just thanked him again and left towards her room, she still had to rest before she could be let go. Which was good for you, you thought, she wouldn't find out your current location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tunnel around you contracted while Corviknight hurried to the entrance, intending to go outside. You held the urge to slam your head against the incredibly gross wall when Audino's melodious voice could be heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpred\">\"I'm ready!\"</span> she had returned, carrying the basket again, with a blanket and other things. <span class=\"cpred\">\"Let's go. It's such a nice day, perfect for a day with no work. Aw, don't make that face, this will do you good. Come on, let's go!\"</span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You think it's good you can't tell the passage of time. It'd drive you insane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil not too long ago Corviknight had walked in a manner that wouldn't jostle those in the innermost parts of his body, out of consideration towards them. Now, thanks to the uphill walk Audino and Corviknight were having, you were wishing you could ask the bird to fly. The tube swung from side to side, like an amusement park ride, with the movement of the crow's legs. Joltik, being the bug he was, managed to cling onto the wall with some effort, avoiding most of the movement, but you were out of luck, sliding from side to side of the edge between the colon and the rectum, like a skater in a half-tube.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Corviknight was feeling every move you were forced to make. It was like a constant tickling sensation right underneath his feathers, just three inches above his vent. He mentally apologized over and over, and tried not to move too much during the walk. You could see his vent twitching and contracting, it was pretty obvious he was itching to release you and everything else, but simply couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpred\">\"I see you have been walking a bit stiff for a while already. Your legs are part of your body too, you shouldn't rely only on your wings,\"</span> she chimed. Corviknight used to be so eager to walk, apparently he wasn't anymore, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, you tumbled down the incline and fell into his rectum, crashing against the latest pile of crap that made the fall. The mass stopped your descent, but it still was pretty unpleasant to get so acquainted with the bird's waste. Telling yourself this wasn't Corviknight's fault, you got away from the poop, climbing the slope again, to where Joltik was waiting. <span class=\"ctan\">\"That looked nasty\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to talk about it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a couple hours to arrive to where Audino was taking him, but when they finally stopped, Corviknight felt calmness when he saw where they were. In front of them there was a large expanse of soft grass, dotted with flowers and berry trees, as far as the eye could see. Several rocks made small plateaus, a stream of water crossed the place. The air was clean, invigorating. The idyllic landscape almost made him forget about his worries -- he recognized where he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wistful look in his eyes didn't go unnoticed to Audino, who had spread the blanket to sit on it. <span class=\"cpred\">\"I thought you'd like to come here.\"</span> Slowly, since he still had the presence of mind to remember Joltik and you would want reprieve, he approached, folded his legs, and settled beside Audino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air was far less invigorating inside the avian large intestine. Even though you had been in such area of Corviknight for hours, you still weren't getting used to the awful smells, especially when more and more of the cause of it was getting piled right where you could see it. The urea dripping slowly from a hole you could see from the ceiling hadn't stopped, either, and the volume of the revolting mixture had been increasing very slowly, the shore being mere millimeters away from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite all that, you were calm now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving nothing to do but wait, and having stayed awake the entire night -- half of it carrying you on his back -- Joltik decided he needed a nap. He had approached you and turned into a fuzzy ball near you, and it didn't take long before he settled right to your side, lying his head and half of his body against you, a very slight electrical current making you tingle. He was sleeping placidly, like he was back home. You liked to think it was thanks to you, it was obvious Joltik really liked your presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had never been particularly appreciative of Bug Pokemon, but you were growing rather fond of Joltik.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laid your head against the wall, staying still as much as possible, not only because Joltik was using you as a pillow, but also because of the conversation outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpred\">\"Do you remember this place?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"It's been ages, Mistress Audino.\"</span> he remembered that place very clearly. It was like a secret grove, hidden away in the mountains, untouched by humans and Pokemon. A long time ago, Audino had taken him there, the day after he had joined Sanctuary. To tell the truth, Corviknight had completely forgotten this place existed. Coming back was like a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudino smiled. <span class=\"cpred\">\"Back then you were such a young bird, even shorter than me, and if I may say it, quite rude. I brought you here so you could see my favorite place, and you had in your eyes that same awestruck look you have right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLook at yourself now, you're so tall my neck hurts when I look up to you, and you have turned into quite the gallant Pokemon\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA drop of white liquid fell on your head. You still didn't move at all. You felt like you were intruding in a meaningful moment, and you feared moving too much would break the spell and make Corviknight go away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpred\">\"It hasn't changed a bit since the last time you were here, has it?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Not at all...\"</span> he sounded so melancholic. You swear you could hear his voice strain. Surely he was teary-eyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpred\">\"Corviknight, I just wanted to tell you how proud I'm of you. I'm not the only one, we <i>all</i> are very proud of you. You're so hardworking and caring, and a wonderful friend. Frankly, if you had some medical knowledge, you'd be perfect to be my successor someday. Alas.\"</span> Audino put a hand on the connection between Corviknight's leg and his body. That was as high as she could reach from where she was. <span class=\"cpred\">\"But don't go learn medicine just because I said that. You're perfect as you are\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Really...?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpred\">\"We all appreciate you so much, and everyone who joins Sanctuary adores you. I don't think you know how much they look up to you\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that was why she was so insistent. She was very concerned Corviknight was overworking himself, and wanted to take a moment to tell him how much he meant to her and everybody else -- and to stop being a workaholic because that wasn't good for his health. He felt a knot in his throat, he didn't know what to say other than thank you. It was nice to know he was appreciated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudino looked up at the sky from between the trees. <span class=\"cpred\">\"My, compared to yesterday it's turning hot. I say it's time for lunch. Would you like a bite, Corviknight?\"</span> Eating was the last thing in his mind right now. He shook his head. <span class=\"cpred\">\"Okay, but you should start eating three small meals a day instead of two large ones. That'll be healthier for you\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree meals...eating lunch...suddenly Corviknight whipped his head skywards, trying to find the sun. There it was. Rather high in the sky. What it all meant hit him immediately: noon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, the entire tube you were in contracted almost painfully. The walls mashed you forward, throwing Joltik and you to the floor. You saw the rectum twitch and compress. The sludge you could see was more solid than liquid, and now it was all making its presence known to Corviknight. It was a sensation he was familiar with, and he knew immediately what it was. Excusing himself, Corviknight bowed his head. <span class=\"cred\">\"...I'm sorry, I have to take care of something\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpred\">\"Of course, go ahead. I know you wouldn't leave me stranded in the middle of the mountains,\"</span> Audino winked, having ensured that way he wouldn't go work on his free day. A bit surprised at her clever craftiness, Corviknight hurried away. He had to look for a spot to deposit everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way, he apologized over and over: <span class=\"cred\">\"My most sincere apologies, Joltik and human, I'm so sorry. It wasn't my intention to leave you inside me for so long -- and at a time like this! I'm so mortified you must be...\"</span> he couldn't bring himself to say with words the state of your surroundings. <span class=\"cred\">\"Hold tight, I'll make something to cushion your departure,\"</span> he said, starting to work on a nest of sorts once he found a secluded enough spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, everything was quivering in preparation for release. Not wanting to get too close to the rest of the waste, you stepped back and looked down to the other side. There still was some crap coming your way, but most of the meal you had fallen into a day ago was already awaiting release in the rectum. That was one concern less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"...you know, she's right.\"</span> Joltik suddenly said. You hadn't noticed he had been awake for a while already. <span class=\"ctan\">\"We all like Corviknight. You...you're not holding this whole thing against him, are you?</span>\" he asked. <span class=\"ctan\">\"You know this was all out of his control?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I don't\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoltik nodded. <span class=\"ctan\">\"Good. By the way, welcome to our team\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked away. \"I...I'm still not one of you guys...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"But you will be, right?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was very tempting. You had a very large friend in Corviknight and a much smaller one in Joltik, a place to be at, and something to do, even if it wasn't a profession you really were looking forward to. If you couldn't return to normal, then this was a good as it could get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what if there was a way to return to your normal size? That question still existed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoltik looked at you expectantly, so you finally took a decision.</span></div></div>",

His little mandibles open in surprise as his matted fur suddenly stands on end: shooting up due to excited burst of static electricity. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cR-really? You\u2019re staying? In Sanctuary\u2014with us!?\u201d</span> He raises his thorax in the air and wriggles it in excitement.<span class=\"ctan\"> \u201cWoohoo! Yeah!\u201d</span> Joltik whoops in thunderous joy. You couldn\u2019t suppress the smile snaking up your face if you tried.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cThis is the best moment <i>of all time!\u201d</i></span> Joltik proclaims to the denizens of Corviknight\u2019s bowels. But just as he\u2019s coming down from his happy high, his oval eyes become round and his pupils grow large. You open your mouth to ask what\u2019s wrong when a contracting wave of Corviknight\u2019s bowels surges past. The undulation sweeps the ground from under you, sending you plapping to the grimy floor. Before you could even mutter a curse, you find out what made him go wide-eyed. A mass of bird poop, carried by the undulations of his intestines, plows into Joltik and sends him reeling into the foul cesspool. Before he can gather his bearings, Corviknight\u2019s rectum collapses violently as he begins to rid himself of the accumulated scat. The small opening above the pool unleashes a deluge of pale horribleness. You wince so hard you think you fear your face is going to stick like that.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Another ripple wracks the crow\u2019s colon. Barely keeping your balance, you peer down into the rectum. You frightfully scan for Joltik, but in your rush you can\u2019t seem to find him. You only see the pit of filth, semisolid and absolutely vulgar.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cJoltik!\u201d You shout as one more undulation flows past. Your heart leaps through your chest as you see the manure level rapidly drop as Corviknight\u2019s machine-like system voided the waste with frightening efficiency. Only a couple seconds have passed and almost all the waste is entirely expulled. Once more, you risk a glance behind you. Nothing\u2019s behind you: only the filth-streaken walls. You come to a heart-pounding realization: if you don\u2019t jump now, you\u2019re not coming out until noon tomorrow.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You never made a faster leap of faith. You rocket from your perch like a tensed-up spring. Your arms spin in circles as you legs dangle, hurtling through the heavy rotten air. As you fall, eyes watering, you vaguely hear the muted sounds of Corviknight\u2019s waste splattering upon the ground. And of course, you\u2019re fast approaching the tailend of the moat of scat. You wish you could say something cheeky about this being a \u201ccrappy\u201d experience\u2014or some such\u2014but you haven\u2019t a moment to think before one last contraction bears in, mashing you in midair. You\u2019re propelled forward by the muscles careless movements. As you near the mucky abhorrence, you shut your eyes and plug your nose. You\u2019re fearing the worst.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But fortune smiles upon you (for once.) The disgusting scat ahead of you is voided milliseconds before you collide into it. The sweltering, oppressive internal heat of the bird is swapped by the cool pastoral air as you pass through the opening of Corviknight's vent. You dare to open your eyes, gritting your teeth and powering through the sun\u2019s burning sunlight. You see that you\u2019re still sailing through the air. You catch sight of the pile of Corviknight\u2019s waste waiting below and desperately twist yourself to the left, hoping to nudge your trajectory out of the danger zone. Your fortune continues to be true and you bellyflop in a pile of grass and leaves with a puff.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your landing is cushioned by the knight-raven\u2019s jumbled-together nest, but the impact still knocks the wind out of you. You lay there, dazed, when a great shadow eclipses the sun and a greater voice speaks above.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cred\">\u201cAh! The human\u2019s okay! But Joltik\u2014where\u2019s Joltik!? Joltik!\u201d </span>Corviknight shouts the world\u2019s loudest strained whisper. It\u2019s only matched by the world\u2019s tiniest wail of disgust.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"ctan\">\u201c<b>BLEEEECCCCHH!</b>\u201d</span> You hear the plop of something erupting from Corviknight\u2019s remnants.<span class=\"ctan\"> \u201cGet me out! Get me out! <i>Get me out!!</i>\u201d</span> Joltik bawls. Corviknight panics, hopping in place, dancing in confusion.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cred\">\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do!

Joltik doesn\u2019t waste a precious second before scurrying over and latching onto the stick with all four legs. Carefully depositing the pint-sized Pokemon in the clean grasses, Corviknight relaxes and holds his head in shame.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cred\">\u201cI am repentant beyond calculable caliber.\u201d </span>Corviknight chokes. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cI can\u2019t express how horrible I feel having forced you into this mess\u2026\u201d</span> You look over to Joltik, who's looking quite shell-shocked at the moment, and decide that it\u2019s best if you do the talking.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t beat yourself up, Corviknight.\u201d You say. \u201cYou tried to help. You did everything you can. If it wasn\u2019t for you, Floatzel and I would\u2019ve been ice cubes.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Corviknight lifts his head slightly.<span class=\"cred\"> \u201cBut I had to ability to prevent all of this!

I\u2019m on an outing with Audino and I can\u2019t leave her!\u201d</span> He swivels his head quickly from Joltik to you. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cAnd her dainty little nose is going to sniff you out if the wind so happens to blow vaguely in her direction.\u201d</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Joltik wrinkles in worry. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cSo what are we gonna do?\u201d</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Corviknight ruffles. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cYou could say you have two options.\u201d</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You look at him in abject disgust.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Corviknight stare back horrified. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cNo, not those options! These are different options. Options that do not involve putting you in me.\u201d</span> Corviknight calms himself. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cThere\u2019s a stream near here. Go there, wash off, and follow behind me 100 paces back. Audino and I will be leaving soon, and you will tail our trail.\u201d</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cAlright,\u201d</span> Joltik says,<span class=\"ctan\"> \u201cand what\u2019s the second option?\u201d</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Corviknight rumbles in thought. <span class=\"cred\">\u201cYou two could always go on ahead.

You had to decide. \"Uh, I think we should get going. If we stay around Audino could find us and that's going to be hard to explain\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">Are you sure about this?</span>\" Corviknight wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surely we'll be fine if we mention we work at Sanctuary. Nobody would harm 'mons who work so everyone is healthy\" you were inclined to agreeing with Joltik, mostly because you wanted to believe that was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince he had to return to Audino, the large bird had no choice but to allow this. After again giving you instructions to follow the river, he flapped his wings and flew some distance away, to where Audino was still waiting. You were on your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you reached the river, Joltik and you decided to take a pause to wash yourselves up -- or more like you scrubbed all the filth off Joltik once you were done with yourself. Joltik was barely bigger than you but it still took you a while because you wanted to do a good job, erase any trace the both of you had passed through that bird's digestive system. The only hint such a thing happened was the discolored fur on Joltik. \"<span class=\"ctan\">That's much better!</span>\" he sighed with relief. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Are you ready for the trek back?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure am. Let's get going\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing downhill was easier than you thought it'd be. Your size wasn't nearly as big of an obstacle as you thought it'd be, Joltik and you managed to walk at a good pace. The very peaceful and unhabitated grove Corviknight and Audino had stayed at was soon left behind, replaced by a mountain that was definitely the home to countless Pokemon. You could hear the noises of unknown Pokemon wandering around, thankfully nothing engaged you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">When you can zap something's insides they tend to not prey on you</span>\" had said Joltik at some point. You were glad your friend had a way to defend himself, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, despite how well the trek was going, the distance was the biggest problem. That grove had been up a mountain, while Sanctuary was at the bottom, and you were pretty sure the path you were taking wasn't the shortest one. It was matter of time before the both of you started feeling the effects of the walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">I'm hungry</span>\" Joltik mumbled. You could faintly hear his tummy rumbling. \"<span class=\"ctan\">I haven't eaten anything for almost an entire day...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you knew Joltik would never do such a thing to you, for a moment you were glad you were far too big for the bug to eat. \"That's going to be a problem.\" You were trying very hard to ignore that you were hungry too, having eaten nothing for far more than a day. Last you ate was before Floatzel and you went to climb a mountain. You were surprised you still could walk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Do you have anything to eat?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clearly not! I'd have offered you food if I had any\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoltik stopped, looking at your head. \"<span class=\"ctan\">You have hair. Maybe there's some static in it. Mind if I...?</span>\" Static? Ah, right, you remember hearing something about this species consuming static. You weren't going to miss any static electricity on you, that was for sure. Once you told Joltik that, his mood seemed to brighten a little. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Alright, sit down and don't move. This will take just a moment!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" you obey, sitting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">This is going to be really weird for you, I guess, but thanks anyway</span>\" That wasn't really what you wanted to hear! But it was too late, you had accepted to provide Joltik with whatever static you had on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoltik approached you slowly, moving until he was right beside your head. It was really odd to be seeing your friend's head from the ground, an expanse of yellow fluff. The mandibles were at the front, very visible given your position, and right behind them, a rather unpleasant-looking hole. How many had seen a Joltik's mouth from so close? You weren't sure it was much of a honor. The bug positioned his mandibles right against your scalp. You didn't feel anything, but it really was weird to have the tips of the mandibles brushing against you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe process took just a few seconds. \"You full?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">No, not at all. There was almost nothing on you</span>\" Joltik said sadly, stepping away from you. \"<span class=\"ctan\">You have almost no fur, any Pokemon with fur on them would have so much static on them...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't exactly eager to approach a random giant Pokemon, even if it was for Joltik to feed. \"Can't you eat anything else? Like...grass? There's plenty here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Of course I can eat <i>food</i>! If we find berries we will be just fine. You look pale, they'd be good for you too</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat. A reminder you weren't looking too great right now. \"Let's see what we can find around here\" you say, looking towards the side. Looking for food would mean going away from the river you were following, but surely that would be no problem, right? You should be able to find it again and continue your trek. Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...you really hoped so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoltik and you wandered away from the river, going towards other parts of the mountain. You kept your eyes wide open, scanning the area to see what you could find. Anything that could feed Joltik would be nice. You didn't really think much about food for yourself, you were more worried for your bug friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a while, but soon you stumbled upon a solution</span></div></div>",

Above you the peak of the mountain loomed, like an ominous guardian, and the inside of the cave was illuminated by a large collection of crystals, both growing from the walls and seemingly brought from somewhere else. Floatzel slumped over against a wall, taking deep breaths. She deserved a break, after all the effort she made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"Visitors?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the depths of the cave came a Pokemon. You peered from over Floatzel's flotation device, immediately noticing that Pokemon was definitely not a Xatu. It wasn't even a bird. That was a bear, black and white, almost touching the roof of the cavern. The shoot in their mouth was the confirmation you needed, you remembered hearing about a Pokemon that had that. Pangoro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPangoro stopped, surprised. <span class=\"clgrey\">\"...you?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"You!\"</span> Floatzel shouted, elated. Without warning you, she bolted forward, running on all fours until she leaped at Pangoro, clinging onto his torso and mushing you against coarse white fur.<span class=\"corange\"> \"I thought you had gone far, far away!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"I have been here for a while. Xatu lets me stay while I train in the area.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"You should have told me! I'd have come to visit you!\"</span> You knew you were definitely missing something here. Floatzel, remembering you were there. Carefully, she took you on her paw, showing you to Pangoro. <span class=\"corange\">\"Human, this is my friend! I told you about him, we used to play when we were younger!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPangoro got his head closer to you to take a better look. He was so close you could see his eyes amidst the dark semicircles on his face. <span class=\"clgrey\">\"That looks like a human, and a very small one at that.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a long story,\" you say. Floatzel clearly trusted Pangoro, if she was showing you like that, so you decided to trust him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloatzel and you explained your situation, although you didn't go into much detail about your unfortunate trips inside Pokemon. All you did was mention it had happened and that you had come out of them alive -- you wanted him to know you wanted to return to normal, and that you and Floatzel thought Xatu could help. That was the important part, you remarked it over and over. Pangoro listened patiently, sitting on the floor of the cave. Once you were done, the bamboo shoot in his mouth moved around while he chewed on the end, before he reached for a rather colorful and tiny crystal lying nearby. <span class=\"clgrey\">\"Xatu had to fly somewhere and should return in a couple days. That said, I believe I know what happened.\"</span> He showed the crystal. <span class=\"clgrey\">\"Have you seen these before?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, never\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"Xatu says these crystals are full of strange energy. When the crystal breaks, the energy is liberated, and if it reaches any being nearby...\"</span> he pointed at you with a claw. <span class=\"clgrey\">\"...this happens.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, an explanation! \"Okay, what's the solution?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"Time. The effects are temporary. The bigger the crystal, the more it'll last.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been a few days already\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPangoro exhaled noisily. <span class=\"clgrey\">\"It must have been a rather large crystal, most likely underground. There's nothing you can do but wait for the effects to wear off\"</span> This brought you a lot of happiness. You didn't have to do anything, just wait for the energy to dissipate! But you had quite the curious feeling: that there were still many, many days of having a small size ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloatzel took the crystal, looking at it with curiosity. There was a glint in her eyes you weren't sure you liked. \"You said the effects are temporary?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A crystal that size should make the size last from eight hours to one day\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"Interesting...!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPangoro stood up, beckoning Floatzel and you towards the far end of the cave. There you could see a rather cozy fire, and a fluffy couch. <span class=\"clgrey\">\"Since you two climbed this mountain I think you should rest for a while. Human, if you'd like to, you could talk to Xatu when she returns.\"</span> May as well do so, since you were here, you decided. Floatzel put you on one end of the couch and curled on the other end, pleased as punch. With a toothy grin, she beamed at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"I told you everything would be fine! We got up here, and now you know you'll be okay!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should have never doubted you,\" you admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"And I got to see an old friend again!\"</span> she glanced at Pangoro, who had gone to make sure the campfire would last for a while longer. <span class=\"corange\">\"You know, he and I were about to be more than friends, but then he decided to leave. Now look at him...\"</span> she winked. <span class=\"corange\">\"He has turned into quite the handsome 'Mon, hasn't he?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Pangoro and shrugged, noncommital. You sure didn't know how to judge a bear's supposed attractiveness. Still, you were grateful for his help. Content, you laid on the couch, soothed by the warmth of the cave and the softness of the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know when exactly you felt asleep, but now you're waking up. You don't feel particularly rested, so you deduce you have been roused by something. Soon you know what it was: voices. Rubbing your eyes, you jump from the edge of the couch to the rock floor and slowly approach the source of the voices.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You can see Pangoro and Floatzel beside the bonfire, talking. Their voices are quiet, most likely out of consideration for you. From where you are you can see Pangoro is sitting on the ground, with Floatzel sitting on his lap. You barely manage to glimpse a shiny, colorful object in one of her paws -- the crystal Pangoro had showed you earlier. <span class=\"corange\">\"...eight hours should be enough.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"I'm not sure about this.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"Oh, come on! Try to see it as I do: this could be the adventure of a lifetime for me. How many Pokemon can say they have been inside another, without being prey?\"</span> You feel your blood go cold when you hear that. Floatzel isn't saying what you think she's saying, right? Pangoro glances towards the couch. You're not sure if he noticed you're not there anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"The human didn't seem to have liked it at all.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"I can't blame them. They didn't ask to be small, or be eaten by anyone. That's the difference, I want to go through this willingly. I'm a explorer, and now I have the means to go into uncharted territory.\"</span> Floatzel clutched the crystal. <span class=\"corange\">\"But honestly I wouldn't dare to do this with anyone except you. I'm doing this only because I'm with you. I trust you.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're rather sure that underneath the black and white fur on his face, Pangoro is blushing. <span class=\"clgrey\">\"Really?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"Of course. What do you say? Will you let me?\"</span> you waited, hoping Pangoro would refuse. He did seem hesitant. <span class=\"corange\">\"Imagine it, Pangoro. I could enter your mouth, and then I'd jump down your throat into your stomach with a perfect 10 landing.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"Hm.\"</span> Pangoro gulped involuntarily. Floatzel continued:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"Or maybe I could go into you through the other end.\"</span> She tried to grab Pangoro's butt, but from where she was sitting, all she managed to do was put her paw on his hip. <span class=\"corange\">\"You have quite the great ass, did you know that?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"That's very daring of you...\"</span> Pangoro sounded intrigued, much to your disappointment. He was letting himself be convinced of this madness!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloatzel smirked. <span class=\"corange\">\"Or, if I'm small enough, maybe I could try some...<i>bolder</i> entrances...\"</span> Pangoro inhaled sharply. You didn't see it well but you're almost certain she just brushed his crotch with her tails, the implication quite clear. You wanted to go there, tell her to change her mind, but your own curiosity kept you rooted where you were standing. You wanted to see where this was going. <span class=\"corange\">\"I could even try your nose, or your ears.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"You have given this a lot of thought already.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"I guess I have,\"</span> she admitted. No wonder she had seemed so interested in the crystal. <span class=\"corange\">\"Pangoro, you're like...like a big, furry cave system, and I want to see what's inside it. You're the only one I'd feel comfortable doing this with. But of course, if you don't want to accept, I'll understand,\"</span> she smiled. <span class=\"corange\">\"At least you listened to this crazy idea I had.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPangoro was silent for a moment. You held your breath, hoping to hear a negative response. There was no way Pangoro would accept being the host for Floatzel's curiosity, right? <span class=\"clgrey\">\"Fine. I'm willing to do it.\"</span> You held back the impulse of shouting into your hands. You couldn't believe this! <span class=\"clgrey\">\"But what the human? They'll want to know where you are\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" For a moment you see guilt on Floatzel's face. She shakes her head, steeling her resolve. <span class=\"corange\">\"Just tell them I went down the mountain, and that I'll be back after a while. I don't think they'd approve of what I'm doing--\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously I don't!\" you didn't notice you had actually yelled that until the Pokemon turned their heads towards you. Spurred by the surprise in their faces, you stomp towards them, indignant and baffled. \"I can't believe you're actually thinking of doing this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"I knew you wouldn't get it...\"</span> she murmured. <span class=\"corange\">\"I just want to go where no Pokemon has gone before, that's all\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Floatzel, it's not fun to be inside another living being. Take it from me, it's not nice at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"I know that! Look, I'm prepared. I just want to give it a try. The crystal is temporary, I'll be fine\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if something happens to you? It can be dangerous inside a Pokemon!\" you argue. Pangoro's shoot moves from side to side of his mouth while he mulls what you just said. \"I almost got digested, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"My fur is rather dense and I'm sturdier than you think,\"</span> she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPangoro put a hand on Floatzel's head. <span class=\"clgrey\">\"They're right. This is dangerous.\"</span> <i>Yes!</i> you thought, hoping Pangoro had changed his mind. When he looks at you you know he wasn't done talking. \"I'm not letting you unless they come along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"What?\"</span> Floatzel sounded so disappointed. Ignoring her, Pangoro addressed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"You have experience inside Pokemon and you got out of them alive. You said that earlier. I want you to help her be safe.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour immediate thought is to reject that, but then you saw Floatzel and her expression of complete determination. You knew: she'd sneak inside Pangoro later if you refused to come. Either you went with her right now, or she'd go by herself later. Besides, you owed Pangoro a favor. You could repay it by keeping Floatzel safe -- and not only that, you also wanted her to be okay. She's your friend, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, you nod. \"Alright. I'll go with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloatzel's face showed both surprise and frustration. Looking at you with disapproval, she stands up, managing to reach Pangoro's ear, and whispers into it. Pangoro nods, hems and haws, and finally stands up as well.<span class=\"clgrey\"> \"Let's get this done.\"</span> he says. Agreeing, Floatzel steps away from him, holds the crystal with both of her paws, and snaps it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe effect is almost immediate. You have to avert your eyes at the sudden onslaught of light, but when you look again, you see Floatzel. She's just as small as you are. Floatzel looks around with interest, marveling at the sight around her. <span class=\"corange\">\"This is amazing! Pangoro, you hear me? I'm ready!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPangoro's ears twitch while he puts his clawed hand on the ground, palm up. Floatzel wastes no time getting on it. You follow her reluctantly, climbing the paw, until you manage to get to the surface. Floatzel is already waiting, sitting on the pad of his palm. Once you're with her, Pangoro raises his hand, until it's to his chest level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"Human, this is your last chance to change your mind,</span>\" Floatzel says, and leans toward you with a sly smirk. <span class=\"corange\">\"I already told Pangoro where I wanted to go.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"I have decided to explore the insides of his butt.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan. For a moment you wonder if your presence is precisely what made her take such a decision. You look at Pangoro. He has a carefully neutral expression. \"Are you serious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"Oh yes. Pangoro is going to get his hand close to his anus, and then we will climb into it by ourselves. Can you picture it? We will make our way into Pangoro's ass!\"</span> she grins toothily, and then you realize what she's doing:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's trying to make you decide to not go. She knows you're not eager to go inside Pangoro in the first place, so she decided to go into an area she imagines you'd like to avoid. You weren't going to give her the satisfaction: \"I'm coming along anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloatzel snarls, and raises her voice somewhat. <span class=\"corange\">\"I'll let you know Pangoro is infamous for being unhygienic!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"<i>Excuse me</i>? That cannot be true!\"</span> Pangoro sounded rather offended by that. Floatzel must have been rather desperate if she resorted to slander.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"And-And did you know bear stool is as goopy as syrup? If you step on it, you'll sink right to your neck. Gross, ain't it?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"Now that I know isn't true at all. The bamboo sometimes makes it all so dry I get constip--\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I'm coming along!\" you shout, cringing at the excess of information Pangoro just gave you. Gathering all of your courage, you face Floatzel: \"I'm not changing my mind no matter what you say. I'm going with you, and that's that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloatzel huffs, staring at you carefully for any signs you were wavering, but you refused to let any doubts show on your face. Not when it meant losing face. After a few seconds of daunting staring, she sighs, admitting defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"Alright. I never thought we'd do this together, but since you want to come...\" </span>she looked up, at Pangoro's face, and settled on the pad of his palm. <span class=\"corange\">\"I'm ready. Get us to the entrance point.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go.\" you agreed. Pangoro sighed, but it had to be done. With a swift move, he moves his hand.</span></div></div>",

You mumble near-silent grumbles as you pass by his mountainous white belly, flying past and behind. You flank behind, leaving behind the forest of white belly hairs before moving under the shadow of his black fur cape. The warmth of the fire is replaced with that of Pangoro\u2019s body as you hover around where the two tones of his fur meet. The pleasant smell of firewood mingles with another. You\u2019re close enough now that the panda\u2019s scent prickles your nose. It isn\u2019t a bad smell. It smelled like a freshly-groomed animal\u2014a natural musk with an earthen detail. You aren\u2019t particularly moved by the scent, but when you turn your head to Floatzel, you catch her swooning\u2014breathing deep with closed eyes and relaxed shoulders\u2014awash with nostalgia and amour. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You watch as Pangoro takes a knee, his massive weight sends a rippling shockwave through his fur. He follows it up with the other before resting his left hand on the cave floor, propping himself up in a three-point stance. He continues to crane his claw lower, hauling you to the \u201centry point.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Pangoro\u2019s black bottom is all you can see. You feel your belly do a little leap. You realize Floatzel wasn\u2019t completely insincere.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Floatzel picks up your growing apprehension. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cHaving second thoughts, are we?\u201d</span> She slaps on a casual look as she cooly looks away, <span class=\"corange\">\u201cyou\u2019ve still got a chance to back out!\u201d</span> She says quietly, almost mockingly. <span class=\"corange\">\"I won't judge. If I were you, I wouldn't want to go up Pangoro's stinky behind either.\"</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You wipe away your trepidation. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving.\u201d Floatzel responds with an exasperated sigh and a click of her tongue.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The sky is now black, enshrouded in Pangoro\u2019s cloak and painted with the furs of his butt. You both are sent closer\u2014the musk of his scent growing stronger\u2014until you could reach out and grab one of the countless hairs of his pelt. Hiding behind the ebon thicket, lurking abaft the panda\u2019s asscheeks is the sight you\u2019ve been dreading: the Pangoro\u2019s puckered exit, your entrance.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0His paw lifts you a little higher, inching closer to the dark band of muscle. A gasp of disgusted fear claws up your throat and nearly breaks free, but you grit your teeth and chew it back down. You will not let your disgust get the best of you! You can\u2019t wimp out now!<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Floatzel saunters up and past you, speaking with a slight waviness in her voice. You knew it isn\u2019t from fear. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cO-oh my\u2026\u201d </span>She whispers through her teeth. She steps forward onto the tip of Pangoro\u2019s paw, reaching out a paw of her own\u2014gently resting it on the ursine\u2019s tailhole. Pangoro breathes sharply, the pudgy muscle recoiling slightly.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"corange\">\u201cSettle down, Pangoro\u2026\u201d </span>she says with an unmistakable sultriness. Is she really getting her jivvies off to this!? Somehow, you find that more disturbing than upcoming trek into the panda\u2019s butt. You turn your head and gag. Floatzel doesn\u2019t notice.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With a dextrous slip of a paw, Floatzel slides her hand inside. Pangoro tenses, careful to not clamp down on Floatzel\u2019s paw. After a tense moment of stillness, Floatzel smooths her limb in up to the shoulder. She flicks her head back to you.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"corange\">\u201cIt\u2019s <i>real </i>nasty in there.\u201d</span> She says.<span class=\"corange\"> \u201cYou\u2019re gonna hate it. Trust me. 10,000%.\u201d</span> You might\u2019ve taken her words more seriously if she wasn\u2019t blushing brightly behind her cream cheek-fur. When she sees that you\u2019re not budging, she turns away and faces the bear\u2019s exit once more. She sticks her other paw in, prompting a small groan from Pangoro, and bravely shoves herself in. You follow with repugnant curiosity as Pangoro grumbles a deep belly-moan as his tailhole tightens, nibbling on Floatzel\u2019s body as it slowly draws her in\u2014her twin tails spinning in excitement. You bite your lip as you walk closer, watching as her friend is drawn deeper inside, slipping past the bundle of black flesh. Soon, she\u2019s nearly consumed. Her tails stop spinning as the asshole\u2019s flesh clamps down upon them before slurping them in like two orange noodles.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Now only you remain. Staring down at Pangoro butt-to-face, you roll your shoulders and pump yourself up. It\u2019s gone beyond making sure Floatzel stays safe in the wretchedness of Pangoro\u2019s innards. Now, it\u2019s personal. You are not going to let her psych you out. You would never hear the end of it!<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You\u2019re there: balancing on the tips of Pangoro\u2019s mitt and engaged in a staredown with his wrinkled eye. You don\u2019t look away as you stick your hand in. His flesh molds around your hand, slickening it with sweat. You let out an uncomfortable grouse as you reach further and further, your fingertips brushing the innards of dungeon never chartered. You follow in Floatzel\u2019s footsteps, pushing your other hand in, gripping the twitching flesh as its owner breathes deeply. Your arms are slick and wet and warmed with a steamy heat. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But you won't back down.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You press your head against the flesh as it peels apart, making way for the shape of your head. Pangoro\u2019s musk grows to an oppressive level, his masculine scent now commixed with scent of his scat. Slick flesh slides over you as you draw yourself in, aided by the spasms of Pangoro\u2019s shivering exit. You go in, cautiously and slowly, reluctant to go blindly into the abominable darkness. You feel the tissue around you quiver as Pangoro spits a sudden gasp as his asshole squashes in, a sharp surge of pleasure runs through the panda\u2019s body. The contraction squeezes you in an unrelenting bear hug, smearing the oily flesh against your skin, before devouring you too.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0All is dark. All is smelly. You press your hand against the squishy ground as you attempt to blindly stand. You wave your dominant hand ahead, groping in the darkness\u2014searching for your friend as the odors that have been stewing in Pangoro\u2019s colon commit a full assault on your senses.

If you had to hazard a guess, it was because your companion Floatzel\u2019s adventurous side was influencing you. Admitting that would be a bad idea, though, it\u2019d make you look like you didn\u2019t care about your current size, and if you did that you feared Floatzel would stop taking seriously your plight. That was why instead you said, mustering as much confidence as you could: \u201cI don\u2019t know much about temples but they\u2019re supposed to be filled with mysteries. There could be something about this mystery I\u2019m in right now\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all Floatzel needed to hear. She immediately dove into her pile of treasures, digging around for stuff that could be of use in the swamp. <span class=\"cborange\">\u201cGreat! We\u2019ll leave in the morning. I warn you, it\u2019s all full of slime and marsh water so you better not get separated from me!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrust me, I won\u2019t\u201d Not when it meant being in danger, that was for sure. You weren\u2019t a bad swimmer, but being in dense marsh water would be very dangerous for you at your current size. After some light discussion, the both of you fell asleep, you feeling satisfied for the first time in a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swamp was unexpectedly dense. Even Floatzel, who was used to swimming through any kind of water, was having trouble. Thankfully you were holding onto her flotation device, behind her head, so you didn\u2019t have any problem surviving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the depths of the swamp, where the trees covered everything in a darkness that surprised you, stood what seemed to be a half-submerged tower. Part of it was crumbling, but from what Floatzel could see there was a clear pathway. Even though it was going downwards, under the level of the water, the stone stairway was completely dry. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cI feel so excited! I had seen this place from outside, and now this will be the first time I\u2019ll sneak in!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this tower?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cI dunno! I heard it\u2019s a place where a legendary Pokemon used to be venerated by humans but these days it\u2019s just a place for Pokemon to live. I can\u2019t blame them\u201d </span>Floatzel commented, sneaking through a crack in the tower. The inside of the building was musty, humid. She took a deep breath, enjoying it \u2013 the smell of places to explore! <span class=\"corange\">\u201cLook at the torches, there\u2019s Pokemon here, definitely\u201d</span> Indeed, many of the torches had fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s hope they\u2019re friendly\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloatzel awkwardly tried to pet your head. Given the place you\u2019re at, the only thing she could do was press on you slightly, not much of a petting. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cWe won\u2019t talk with anyone! This will be like a stealth mission, so hold tight onto me and let\u2019s see what wonders are in this place!\u201d</span> it was hard not to be excited when she said it with so much excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mustelid descended the stairs quickly, going down on all fours for more speed. It was exhilarating, like you were on a train. Floatzel descended for what seemed like an hour, getting deep into the swamp, until she came to a bifurcation.<span class=\"corange\"> \u201cUh, left or right?\u201d</span> she asked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight\u201d<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good choice</span>\u201d she complimented, bouncing a little on her hind legs.<span class=\"corange\"> \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d </span>You were ready to hold onto her again when you felt someone grabbing you, someone who definitely wasn\u2019t Floatzel. Fingers plucked you off her flotation device so lightly she didn\u2019t notice, and you didn\u2019t even have the time to call for her before she ran away, unaware you were left behind in someone\u2019s hand. By the time you got the time to call for her, a dizziness overtook you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately the surroundings changed. You undoubtedly still were in the tower in the swamp, the stone walls, slime and moss proved it. \u201cLet me go!\u201d you shouted, turning around to face your captor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an Abra. So that was why it could teleport so fast. Abra excelled at that, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cThis is new. I like this. Why are you here?\u201d</span> without giving you a minute to answer, they put a finger to your forehead. In your mind a series of images flashed by in a second, all the memories of these last couple days condensed in a shorter span of time. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cAh, so you weren\u2019t this size all along. Interesting. It\u2019s almost sad, if you ask me\u201d</span> Abra said with sly expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah...? Great, then can you help me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbra petted you on the head.  She \u2013 you were pretty sure it was she -- she didn\u2019t seem to mean any harm? You sure hoped so. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cMaybe I can, maybe I can\u2019t...\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not really in mood for riddles. You took me away from my friend and I really don\u2019t appreciate that\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cI\u2019ll tell you something: if you play a game or two with me I\u2019ll see what I can do to help you. Or maybe instead of games you could call them challenges. It\u2019s more like challenges to see what you\u2019re made of\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChallenges by a Pokemon you were getting warier of by the second? That didn\u2019t sound appealing at all, especially because you were separated from Floatzel. As much as you hated to admit it, you were at the Abra\u2019s mercy. Annoyed, you sigh. \u201cWhat kind of challenges are they?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cLet\u2019s say seeing your recent experiences gave me ideas\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat could only mean you were going to get eaten again. At least by now you were more confident about your capacity to survive anything, so you weren\u2019t afraid. You just hoped it wouldn\u2019t be too bad. \u201cIf you\u2019ll eat me then do it quick\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbra gasped. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cMe? No, I won\u2019t do that! I don\u2019t want humans crawling around in my insides\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t expect that response. \u201cNo? Not that I\u2019m complaining, but if it isn\u2019t that, what kind of challenges are they?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cI have a couple friends, they\u2019re the ones who will have a human crawling around inside them,</span>\u201d she said, teleporting to another area of the tower. When you were able to look at your surroundings from between Abra\u2019s fingers you saw everything was much darker, many other torches were needed to keep the environment lighted up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and your current captor likely were deep into the swamp, possibly way underground by now. Part of the tower had crumbled so much the water was seeping through, forming a small lake of a deep green color. The rest of the room was furnished with many things; you\u2019d even think it was comfortable. Did Pokemon live here?<br>\r\nYou got your answer after taking a better look. In the lake there was a cyan form. It took you a moment to realize it was a Feraligatr, a rather large one. It was lazing around in the water, floating, perhaps asleep? On the other side of the room, a Vaporeon was running around, a tad anxiously, bringing objects all over the room, reorganizing everything.<span class=\"cdorange\"> \u201cThese are my friends. Don\u2019t bother saying hello,\u201d</span> Abra explained with telepathy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright, you had decided: you didn\u2019t like Abra at all. No explanation about what the challenges entailed had been given yet, though.<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll give you two options: one is short-term, the other is long-term. I\u2019m not promising you\u2019ll have to do only one of them, but make a choice anyway. Then I\u2019ll explain. How much time do you want to spend in the challenge?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn\u2019t something you expected either. Going for anything that wouldn\u2019t last long would be great and definitely was your first idea, but then you thought: what if anything short wasn\u2019t enough to satisfy Abra and she decided to mess with you more? Accepting something longer could be better, then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was also rather likely your decision would impact which Pokemon you\u2019d find yourself into. You weren\u2019t sure which one would be what choice, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of thought, you took your decision.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Abra didn\u2019t seem to mind your choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cGood one,\u201d</span> her telepathy said in your head.<span class=\"cdorange\"> \u201cNow be as quiet as you can. Don\u2019t forget if necessary I can shut you up for good,\u201d </span>she threatened. As if you needed the reminder, as long as you were in her hand you just couldn\u2019t do anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, what am I supposed to do? You said it\u2019d be a challenge! What\u2019s the challenge?\u201d<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\"><br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s simple: you have to escape Vaporeon\u2019s body without being noticed\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat didn\u2019t sound entirely bad. You had literally escaped Noibat\u2019s body unnoticed, doing the same in that Vaporeon wasn\u2019t going to be difficult, you figured. Although...part of you wondered why Abra had chosen Vaporeon for this particular challenge. Was something about that Pokemon that would make the goal difficult for you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019m prepared,\u201d you said. \u201cI\u2019ll escape in no time\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cAre you sure? You\u2019re so confident I wonder if you already have a plan,\u201d </span>one of Abra\u2019s fingers folded, striking you on the back of your head. It seemed she had tried to pat you on the head again, and once again it had been such a graceless move it was more painful than endearing.<span class=\"cdorange\"> \u201cI see, I see now. Right, I remember seeing a glimpse of your trip inside a certain bat Pokemon\u2019s innards. So that\u2019s why you\u2019re so confident...\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d you weren\u2019t sure how comfortable you were with Abra being aware that was why you felt so cocky. You didn\u2019t get a response. Instead the laugh that was the response was the only reply, and it was one that got the Vaporeon\u2019s attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon\u2019s ear fins stood up straight when they noticed their friend\u2019s presence.<span class=\"clblue\"> \u201cOh! Oh, you\u2019re here again! Did you forget something?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cYou could say that,\u201d </span>Abra said, floating over, with a hand behind her back \u2013 the hand that was holding you. All you could do was listen, waiting for the moment you\u2019d be fed to Vaporeon. You did wonder how it\u2019d be, you don\u2019t remember seeing any food where you could be hidden, and given how the point of the challenge was escape Vaporeon\u2019s body without being noticed, it was likely they\u2019d stay unaware of your presence. It wasn\u2019t like Abra could tell them to open their jaws and toss you inside to be swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon trotted over, their tail swishing behind them. <span class=\"cteal\">\u201cTell me what it is. I\u2019ll help you and then you can leave\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cAre you saying I\u2019m not welcome here?\u201d</span> Abra sounded falsely saddened. Vaporeon, noticing how that may have been rude, shook their head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it! Feraligatr is sleeping. You know how Feraligatr is like if you wake him up. We really have to let him sleep,\u201d</span> you had to agree with Vaporeon. You didn\u2019t want to be near an angry alligator, especially not one as large as that one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbra nodded, deciding to get done with placing you inside who would be the embodiment of your challenge. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cThen I\u2019ll come back later. I\u2019m sorry for bothering you, so...bye\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBye, Abra.\u201d<span class=\"clblue\"> That was all you heard before a sensation of freefalling overtook you. While you tried to keep yourself from freaking out, you focused on rationalizing what </span>was happening: Abra must have used her teleporting ability on you, and only on you. You didn\u2019t feel Abra holding you anymore. Then what had happened?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA humidity that surprised you enveloped you, you fell down on a spongy surface. Agh! You crashed down, holding onto the ground. It was all wet, there was a strange smell in the air. With your eyes closed, you didn\u2019t recognize it at all. It didn\u2019t smell acidic, so you definitely weren\u2019t in a stomach, and \u2013 much to your relief \u2013 it also didn\u2019t smell earthy, which indicated you likely weren\u2019t in the intestines. But then where were you? Where could Abra have placed you into? Holding onto the ground, you took a bearing of your surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when you realized how exactly Abra had planned to make this difficult for you. She hadn\u2019t placed you in any place of Vaporeon\u2019s digestive system. \u201cHow am I supposed to get out of here?!\u201d you yelled, having noticed where you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbra, that tricky Pokemon, had teleported you right into... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's surreal. <i>You're wading in a Vaporeon's bladder!</i> You've been inside <i>three </i>Pokemon! What have you done to attract Arceus' ire? Is it because you haven't called your mother in ages?

Unbeknown to him, someone inside him was very thankful for the respite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had held onto the wall behind you, trying very hard not to be thrown around once again like a sock in a dryer. Why did the bladder have to be near very mobile limbs? Your silent complaint is interrupted when everything lurches around you, forcing you to stop gripping the wall, throwing you onto the other side of the sac. You slip down, the urine raining all over the place. You actually have to take another moment to breathe, somehow being inside the bladder was more exhausting than being inside a digestive system. A strange thought crossed your mind: you'd have preferred to be in the stomach than in here, or even the intestines. At least in there you weren't getting tossed around!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce everything went still, you waited, trying to not to alert Vaporeon of your presence. After many minutes of absolutely no movement, you let go of the wall, wading onto the center of the bladder. The level of the water was reaching your chin now, soon you'd be forced to start paddling around. There was something humiliating in that thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of humiliating, you really hoped Abra wouldn't ever bring up what you were going through right now. You weren't sure your feelings would endure the self-satisfaction that fox surely would be feeling if she found out you were having quite a bad time. Then again, she was a Psychic type. Why did she have to be someone with power over the mind?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, if there was a time to slip out unnoticed, this was it. Fed up with swimming around in liquid wastes, you consider the situation. Unfortunately for you, the general area you were in was terribly sensitive. There was one thing you were sure about, and it was that you couldn't wait for Vaporeon to empty this place and let you go. You were sure they would feel you...passing through, and that'd be your loss. Also you couldn't know how long Vaporeon would wait or if they would avoid urinating even if the bladder got full, and the thought of drowning in there if you couldnt' stay afloat was terrifying. No, you had to escape now that things had quieted down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how? Obviously there was a way out, but there was absolutely no way to know in what direction the exit hole was at. You'd have to examine the walls very carefully, or maybe even the ground. You sure hoped it wasn't on the ceiling or you'd be out of luck. Resigned, you start searching, trying to pretend the liquid around you wasn't what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took you much longer than you'd have prefered, but you found a way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere it was, just below the surface, a muscular opening, currently closed. Despite your diminutive size, it seemed like it'd be quite the tight fit, nothing there had been made to have anything solid crawling through. There was a very real risk Vaporeon would feel something, and by then you hoped you'd be too far away for them to see it had been you. \"No time like the present,\" you muttered, taking a rather acrid deep breath, and trying to force your way through head-first into the opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were rather lucky your body kept the bladder plugged while you snaked inside. The tunnel ahead of you was dry, if unpleasantly spongy. For a moment you stayed there, considering if you touching the walls would alert Vaporeon of your presence, and decided it didn't matter anyway. Your entire body would be dragged in there anyway. Trying to get a grip, you pulled, soon getting your body through the opening, letting it close right behind you. It didn't seem like much had leaked through with you, fact you were very thankful about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrawling through such a tight tube was very difficult, especially when you were trying to be stealthy, and soon it got repetitive and monotonous. It felt like you were making no progress at all, advancing inch by inch. A snail would have outpaced you, you were sure. Where was the way out? Why hadn't you reached it yet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were two possibilities, you reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne was that the Vaporeon you were inside of right now was male. That meant there could still be plenty of path ahead. The thought of dragging yourself through a Pokemon's dick made you dizzy with disgust, but it was the way out. It had to be done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other possibility was that you had not entered the right hole. If you recalled correctly basic anatomy, there had to be another two openings in the bladder, leading up to the kidneys. Despite your size you were sure entering a kidney was impossible, so if you had entered the wrong way, then there would be a dead end forcing you to go back. But then where was it? Why was this so long? You couldn't be getting <i>lost</i>, could you? That had to be impossible! Or at least you hoped so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery minute that passed with you advancing a little bit more was stressful. You really couldn't wait to finally get out of Vaporeon, but to do that, you had to be on the right path. You really hoped so.</span></div></div>",

With every second that passes, your heart grows heavier as self-doubt fills it like ball-bearings in a can. <br>\r\n<i>By all that is good, there's an end to this right?</i> You really, really hope you're not going the wrong way. Delving deeper into Vaporeon would be <i>no bueno.</i> Especially that way. Because that would mean you would need to make this trip <i>again! </i>And also you'd end up in his kidneys\u2014or atleast in the tubing leading to them. And that would just be a great big bundle of awkwardness. <br>\r\nOnward you go. You wriggle through the tight passage, arms beneath your chest\u2014your body embraced by the cramped, slick walls. When a musky smell wrinkles your nose, you let out a sigh of relief. You are where you need to be (but not necessarily where you want to be.) The overpowering, earthy stench blankets your mind in fog. You're surprised you didn't sprout a Gandalf-beard from inhaling this much unfiltered testosterone. It did feel like you got punched in the face by a gym locker room, however. You didn't care, though. With each wriggle, the end can only be closer. You carefully continue your campaign with renewed energy.<br>\r\nAs you venture on you sense your crawlspace to be getting tighter. Your shoulders, nudged by the narrowing enclosure, push against the sides of your jaw. The slippery, squishy sides of the tunnel smear against you, rubbing your form with a lubricant you dare not think about. The walls, fleshy and pink, completely obscure what lies ahead\u2014making this tunnel truly feel endless. It's then you're hit with a realization: how can you see? It's dark, yes, but you can still see something or another. You pause for a moment, taking a breather from your crawling and rest your chin on your balled up fists. You're not resting your face on the insides of a fish-cat's dick\u2026<br>\r\nAfter a moment of recapitulation, you chalk up your fancy night vision to be of Abra's doing. You wonder if she granted it to you in some twisted notion of fair-play, or to simply ensure you didn't miss a single detail of your \"experience.\" You're torn on whether you hope this power is permanent. Given your cruddy luck, you have a feeling you're gonna end up somewhere you wish you didn't have to see\u2026<br>\r\nReality kicks you in the teeth\u2014pulling you from your thoughts as you realize something is very wrong. The passage is so tight, you can't move! You swear it wasn't this tight before. Did the passage's width taper off? Can you not fit? What a cruel joke that would be!<br>\r\nYou feel the unmistakable sense of movement. ...Oh no. Did Vaporeon wake back up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon slowly blinked his bleary eyes. He really didn't want to be awake right now.<br>\r\nBut <i>of course</i> that wonderful dream he was having about the talking Roggenrola got so rudely interrupted. How did the Roggenrola speak without a mouth? Who knows! Who cares! Vaporeon doesn't. All he knows is that it had a funny voice and he was really enjoying its company.<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Ugh,\"</span> the Water-type groaned. He felt a familiar tightness around his groin. Morning wood.<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"You would think this would happen <i>in the morning</i> and not <i>fifty minutes</i> after I fell asleep. Bloody Helioptile, I just want to sleep in peace.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could clearly hear Vaporeon's bemoanings from the outside. You didn't dare move a muscle. The tunnel walls twitch in response to his awakening, squeezing and slathering you with its clammy walls. Somehow, thank heavens, he didn't notice you. Something tells you that he's not the most observant Eeveelution. He didn't even raise an eyebrow when Abra was plainly hiding something behind her back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon sighs. <span class=\"cblue\">\"Unless I'm bitching a lullaby, I don't think complaining is doing me any good.\"</span> Vaporeon slinks slightly into the water, half his face floats above the tide. Barely audible, Vaporeon mutters, <span class=\"cblue\">\"and to make matters worse, I'm starting to feel\u2026 frisky.\" </span>Vaporeon exhales through his nose, blowing bubbles in the water. <span class=\"cblue\">\"Praise Arceus,\"</span> he sarcastically says. <span class=\"cblue\">\"Hallelujah.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do not, not one bit, like he is, quote-on-quote, \"feeling frisky.\" To think your journey out of here could possibly get any stranger\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Please, oh please,</i> you pray in your head. <i>Go back to sleep\u2026</i></span></span></div></div>",

In your opinion, fate knew all that, and decided to balance your happy goals with cold, unpleasant and real events. It was like the universe had decided you needed some humbling down after having made such grand plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just couldn't think of any other explanation. You'd be fine with it if it wasn't because fate went out of its way to kick you while you're down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart had plummeted when you heard the Vaporeon calling to Feraligatr. <span class=\"cblue\">\"Hey, Feraligatr...\"</span> he had said, with a tone you didn't like at all. Just in case, you tried to wiggle forward, still finding you were very stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon lazily floated over to the large alligator. He had seen Feraligatr's eyes flutter open, he knew the big guy wasn't sleeping anymore! Yet he was still pretending he was. <span class=\"cblue\">\"I know you can hear me\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment Feraligatr didn't want to acknowledge he had been caught, but it was pointless, Vaporeon was staring at him sharply. A rumble shook the pond while the big Pokemon raised his head above the water.<span class=\"cteal\"> \"What...have I told you about waking me up?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Sorry, sorry. But need I remind you you have been sleeping for almost an entire day?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"I deserve that sleep. You know that.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Sure, you do. It just would have been great if it had been any other day that wasn't today,\"</span> Vaporeon swatted Feraligatr, barely felt by the larger one.<span class=\"cblue\"> \"Look at yourself, then look at me. You're almost nine feet tall and I barely can reach your hips. You know how much easier this all would have been if you had been the one to move the furniture?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"You're the one with the eye for that kinda thing\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"It's called teamwork, ever heard of that? You...\" </span>Vaporeon clumsily climbed on top of Feraligatr's back, even though he'd have liked to go sleep, there was something about Feraligatr that just made him feel giddy.<span class=\"cblue\"> \"...you move things, I tell you how. But no, this time I did all the work while you slept for an entire day\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon could feel Feraligatr's skin vibrate with his voice, he was actually chuckling. Vaporeon could be a handful to deal with, but he meant well. Usually when he got all touchy and started climbing on him, the message was rather clear: he was feeling frisky. Slowly, Feraligatr crawled out of the pond, carrying Vaporeon on his back, until he was on dry terrain. <span class=\"cteal\">\"Fine, I get the point. I owe you\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"You're much more fun when you're well-rested\" </span>Vaporeon was happy he was the one starting things this time. Usually it was the other way. The anticipation was making him quiver, he was glad he hadn't decided to try to go back to sleep.<span class=\"cblue\"> \"How are we going to do it this time?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had stayed still, listening to every bit of the conversation outside. With every word, your dread increased. It was plainly obvious what was going to happen, and judging by the way the walls around you were contracting and expanding, Vaporeon was really eager to get started. You had tried all along to dislodge yourself, sending sensations that undoubtedly must have spurred Vaporeon to pursue such urges further. Nothing you could have done would stopped this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat thought didn't make you feel any better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow far were you from the end? Would you be able to escape before things started getting heated all around you? You didn't know, but that sure wouldn't stop you from trying your hardest, anything to not be caught in the crossfire of those two's...activities. Screw being seen by Vaporeon, you also didn't care if Abra got upset with you, you just wanted to get out. Now. Struggling, you crawled forward, taking advantage of the times the tunnel ahead of you widened. You saw it happen, the flesh parting and opening just a little further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was little consolation that Vaporeon's eagerness was expanding the tunnel a little. You were being shaken around, clearly Vaporeon was moving around a lot. He and Feraligatr were getting ready, no doubt. Soon it was clear to you: you wouldn't be getting out in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, you let yourself fall on the spongy floor. It was a bitter laugh of defeat, your fighting spirit had left you. \"Of course this is happening! I have finally reached rock bottom!\" So much had happened in the last few days, and there were no signs of improvement anytime soon. Your laughter stopped, replaced with silence. While outside Vaporeon asked a question, slowly you raised your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings couldn't get any worse. That meant the only way now was up. Humans weren't prone to giving up just like that. You made a promise quietly: you'd keep fighting. No matter what else fate tried to throw your way, you'd take it with bravery and face it head on. So what if your near future indicated you were likely to be in the middle of a sex session between two Pokemon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'll be fine, you told yourself. You knew you'd be fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe size difference usually meant Feraligatr was on the receiving end. As such, normally he was the one who decided how things would proceed. At Vaporeon's question, Feraligatr only had to do one thing to convey his response.</span></div></div>",

Vaporeon, who was splayed out across the gator's spine\u2014his belly flat across his scales and his legs wide\u2014slips off like water on a duck's back. Vaporeon slides onto the floor, staring at Feraligatr with restive eyes. Feraligatr takes his time to turn around towards Vaporeon. He puts his head on the water-slicken stone and returns the Eevelution's gaze with a more restrained look. The lizard even gives a half eye-roll.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cteal\">\"You're way too eager.\"</span> Feraligatr says flatly.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cblue\">\"And you're moving way too slow!\"</span> Vaporeon says. <span class=\"cblue\">\"Are you doing that on purpose?

I didn't wake up for nothing.\" </span>Feraligatr's got a hell of a stoic face, but Vaporeon couldn't help but notice a pink something betwixt Feraligatr's own legs that betray his true excitement. Feraligatr nearly blushes when he notices where Vaporeon is looking. He hurries things along.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cteal\">\"Shut up and pop it in.\"</span> Feraligatr says, opening his crocodile jaws wide, showing off his cavernous mouth and deep throat. Vaporeon didn't hesitate\u2014and most surely didn't care that Feraligatr told him to shut it despite not saying a word. He trots on over to the great beast's head. Feraligatr ceases to show off and closes his mouth somewhat, leaving the front door cracked just enough for the soon-to-be invited guest.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Vaporeon clumsily stands on his hind legs before placing his left paw on the top of Feraligatr's snout. Now balanced, he brings himself closer\u2014placing his other paw on the gator's head and leveling his crotch with his friends open mouth. Vaporeon gets in position, back arched and legs tucked beneath him, and gently pushes his crotch forward. His dick docks on Feraligatr's tongue and slips into the humid hangar of his mouth.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cblue\">\"Don't make it toothy, please!\" </span>Vaporeon whispers to Feraligatr.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cteal\">\"Don't be a one-pump chump.\" </span>Feraligatr mumbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your defiant determination is the one thing keeping your soul from shattering into a million pieces. You thought being in the middle of two horny Pokemon's sexy-time was going to be your silver bullet \u2014 but no! It's their gag-inducing dirty talk! You almost wish you drowned in Floatzel's belly.<br>\r\nYour surroundings are beginning to get a little\u2026 wet. As the tight, spongy walls continue to bear down on you\u2014growing more taut and tough\u2014sticky clear-ish fluid lubricates the walls around you. You identify the substance and voice your frustrations with a loud groan. It's precum. So gross. You think you've already got it in your hair\u2026<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Looking ahead, you see the tip of Vaporeon's penis briefly open as a constricting pulse travels up the excited organ. You glimpse Feraligatr's open maw rapidly approaching as your harshly mutter a colorful swear to yourself. If you have to go on an inside-tour of another one of these\u2026 technicolor you-gobblers\u2026.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You hear a wet plap as Feraligatr's great jaws close. You feel your surroundings tremble as Vaporeon quivers and hums in approval. You sense yourself rock back and forth as Vaporeon slowly and rhythmically sways his hips. Soppy suction sounds reach your ears loud-and-clear as Feraligatr sucks on Vaporeon's dick noisily. You feel something through the flesh slide beneath you. It makes a disgusting and long slliick as whatever it is glides along the organ's underbelly and wraps around its surface. It didn't take you long to figure out it was the Feraligatr's thick tongue, teasing Vaporeon\u2014causing your sticky prison to constrict like a vice.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Vaporeon's breathing gets heavier as Feraligatr exhales through his nose like a dragon. You could plainly hear this. You hoped in your little heart that Vaporeon would finish early, but it seems the fish took Feraligatr's words to heart. It feels like you've been stuck here for a forever-and-a-half. And you're getting to know Feraligatr a lot more closely than you want. The big guy makes little, cute, pleasured squeaks that die halfway up his throat. They're not loud enough for Vaporeon to hear. The big guy would die of embarrassment if he knew anyone knew he squeaked like a Pacharisu\u2014not that you'd know. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Currently, the heat is hotter and more sweltering than the jungles of Alola. The air is thick with musk and you're being crushed and soaked in the batter that broiled in Vaporeon's balls. The noisy slurping from outside mingles with the pleasured groans and moans of two very intimate Pokemon. Your ears are pressed so tightly against the Vaporeon's flesh, that you can hear his frenzied heartbeat\u2014hammering away like a drum in a heavy metal album. His thrusts have become more forceful as he grinds against the gator's giant tongue.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"C'mon\u2026,\" you manage to eek the words out from your squeezed lungs. \"Just cum already\u2026\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Vaporeon's beleaguered breathing reaches a fever pitch as you're wracked with a bone-breaking throb. You're shook by lengthy, drawn-out thrusts as things become tighter than you could ever imagine. All is black as the walls come crashing in, the sticky fluid you're bathing in nearly submerges you as you're forced to share the same too-tight space. A cry from above\u2014Vaporeon's\u2014as the flesh around you trembles. Just as you're seeing stars, he lets up. A torrent of cum erupts from behind you and sweeps you away. Rocketing through Vaporeon's long length like a bullet from a gun, you're spewed from the tip and land messily onto the soft surface of gator tongue. The great member above you gives a few last thrusts as it empties its payload. Once he's finished, the reptile's tongue lifts up and licks the Vaporeon's cock, smearing you against it in a messy goodbye kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Wasting not a moment longer, Feraligatr takes out Vaporeon's dick from his mouth and tilts his head up\u2014displaying his thick throat in front of the fish-cat. He swallows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Powerful neck meat drag you down to the lizard's belly as you kick and holler. A great tightening and the following blissful shudder impart to you that Feraligatr just came. You slap your hands against the esophageal muscles, hoping to stop your descent. But as always, it's in vain.<br>\r\nYou're dumped into the lizard's belly accompanied by gator spittle and Vaporeon's load. The Feraligatr's belly isn't full, thank goodness. However, a waist-high slop of foodstuff slorshes about like borscht in an unsteady pot. A pungent, meaty smell haunts the area. Strangely enough, you detect the faint aroma of sugary sweets broiling along with the rest of his stomach soup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0What does Feraligatr, panting and high in the afterglow, do next?</span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was just too enjoyable of a moment for both Pokemon, even if it wasn't for you. Vaporeon staggers away, satisfied, his legs trembling, until he reaches the edge of the pond. With a last sigh of exhaustion, he falls forward, crashing into the water and being carried by the water in a rather good dead man's float. It'd be worrying if he wasn't a Water-type. Bubbles burst onto the surface, Vaporeon was snoring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard for Feraligatr not to feel pride at the results. He idly wondered if Vaporeon would sleep nearly as long as he had done. Sleeping for an entire day was a sacred time for the alligator, and now that his quota for sleep had been fulfilled, he was feeling rather energized! Standing on his hind legs, he steps away from the pond, walking towards the entrance of the room they resided in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside him, in his stomach, you felt every single movement. The steps made waves in the soup you were in, waves that carried you around like some sort of waterpark pool. You touch one of the walls, and then the thick liquid carries you towards the other end of the stomach, taking several seconds to get there. The mixture surrounding you is only waist-high, but the unstable floor beneath you makes it hard to have a footing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now what?\" you briefly wondered. That was all you managed to hear before you heard something from above you. It sounded like...munching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeraligatr's destination had been the sizable stash of food he and Vaporeon had accumulated. The swamp the tower was in was near a commercial route, trucks and boats passed nearby with various products for the cities. It wasn't uncommon for the Pokemon in the area to get some of the merchandise with ease, and it wasn't like the humans cared. Feraligatr, thanks to his size and strength, had carried almost everything in the storage. Boxes of raw meats, soups, and even candy were stacked one over another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all would last them like four days, thanks to a certain glutton. Feraligatr wasted no time, tackling one of the boxes with enthusiasm, clamping his jaws over one of the crates full of meat. With a powerful twist of his neck, he ripped off the wooden cover, and greedily took out the contents. He was already salivating at the prospect of eating it all. Without hesitation, Feraligatr ripped off the plastic covering the meat, and tossed the food into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for you to see the confirmation of what you had heard. Thanks to the ability to see in the dark, you didn't miss any detail. Above you, from a hole you knew you had came from, splattered down a pink and white mush. Gristle and meat poured rather quickly, forming a hill on the opposite end of the stomach<i>. He's eating?! </i>That meant soon the place you were in would be filled with acids. You really hoped you still were as resistant to acids as you had seemed to be before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stomach wasted no time dealing with the meat, Feraligatr would soon start shoving more and more, so of course it had to process it as soon as possible. While you heard the sounds of masticating and more meat entering Feraligatr's voracious maw, the stomach contracted, shoving the mountain of chewed meat and spreading it all over the stoamch. Soon it reached you, forcing you to get onto it to avoid getting buried under meat and into the resting liquids that had received you. You grab the meat, feeling the wetness in it, and thanking whatever little luck you had Feraligatr wasn't eating live prey. Knowing your luck you'd have been eaten by prey if that had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was some of the longest ten minutes in your life, and it was all while Feraligatr just kept eating, not stopping at all. The level of the food in the stomach kept rising, distending the sac and giving you more space to crawl around. You were looking for stable ground to weather the meat storm, but the stomach kept throwing everything everywhere, you were at its mercy. More and more ground meat kept entering, completely soaked in acids and liquids you didn't want to think about. How much could Feraligatr eat?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the munching above stopped. You sighed with relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeraligatr licked his chops. <span class=\"cteal\">\"That was the stuff. Now where's the good sugar...\"</span> he talked to himself. You heard that. Wasn't he full already? The stomach was already pretty full, if he kept eating you'd be able to touch the ceiling with your hand!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe good sugar, as Feraligatr had called it, was in a corner of their stash. Tearing apart the crate, he found assorted candy inside. Taffy, mints, jawbreakers. He wouldn't ever tell Vaporeon, but he really, really liked candy, even though most of it never stayed in his mouth for long enough for him to taste properly. Taking a package of mints, he poured it into his jaw, half of it falling into the throat already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA barrage of mints fell into the stomach, helping just a little with the meaty stench that filled the place. The candy bounced around, sinking into the meat and pelting you with pieces. You stepped back, trying your hardest to not be touched by them. Above you, you heard a curious noise, and looked up just in time to see a while, round jawbreaker enter the stomach and fall towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you woke up, you knew you could add 'knocked out by a jawbreaker' to the list of misfortune you had experienced in a while. You touched your face, it ached. You were sure you had a bruise from the jawbreaker hitting you. Touching your cheek to count your teeth and make sure you hadn't lost any, you looked around to assess the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt must have been a while since you had fallen unconscious. Everything still looked rather cramped, a consequence of Feraligatr's eating. Still, there was something different...the smell was different. You examined the area. The walls didn't have the wrinkled texture you remembered the stomach had, instead it had more of a bumpy, hairy texture. Villi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...ah.\" You must have been unconscious for hours, if you were in the intestines already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meat and candy all around you clearly had been quite a while stewing inside Feraligatr's stomach and intestines. It all and you were covered in all sorts of liquids, and beneath you it felt like a lazy river was carrying you. Ahead you saw what looked like an endless field of food being processed, and looking behind you you saw the same thing. In both directions the food just kept going further than the bends of the small intestine. It was like you were on a conveyor belt, efficiently carrying the digestive process, and you were a stowaway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to move forward, but you can't. Looking down you find you're embedded chest-deep into the slop holding you. Tugging and trying to get out showed how difficult the effort was. \"...alright then.\" you muttered. So there you were, stranded in the middle of Feraligatr's food, getting carried deeper while the body performed the digestion, and thanks to your eyesight, you would be witness of how it worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least you'd be able to tell Feraligatr how his guts worked, you'd be able to give all sorts of details--wait. Feraligatr.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wouldn't be able to change your situation, but you wondered if you could talk to him. Now that you thought about it...you had won. You overcame Abra's challenge. You escaped from Vaporeon's body and he was none the wiser. She never said anything about Feraligatr not finding out! For a moment the thought of explaining how you were eaten brought you dread, it'd be just too awkward to say where you were right before Feraligatr swallowed you, but then you realized you had a decent excuse surrounding you. All that food...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh well. You look up. You can feel Feraligatr is awake, you can feel him moving. But should you get his attention?</span></div></div>",

A tremor shakes all around as Feraligatr stomps about, sending ripples through the gluck and the muck you're mired in. Sounds of busy digestion fill the air with an incessant grumbling. The slow-moving river you soak in slops along, barely flowing. You sigh. His body gurgles back. It's at that moment you decide: you're not going to sit here, marinating in an unholy mixture of meats and sweets, in silence. If you're gonna go all the way through again, you're going to at least try to spark some conversation\u2014even if it's with your devouree. What's the worst that could happen? Eat you again? After your exit\u2014fat chance.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey!\" You shout. You're almost expecting your words to echo back in Feraligatr's cave-like digestive tract. Alas, your only response is the burbles and swashes of the intestines' food-river.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You wriggle and twist your arm out of the slop. It exits with a pop and comes out looking like you took a dip in a pool filled with Grimer. Ah, you say as it hits you. You're swamped in a swamp in a Pokemon in the swamp. Sweet irony. Swamp doesn't feel like a real word anymore.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You take your smudge covered arm and rub the villi-laden walls. It's like wringing your hands through the strings of a mop!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Outside, Feraligatr feels a peculiar tickle in his belly. Moments ago he was patrolling the halls of the old ruin. Not that he needed to, anyway. But a couple minutes stomping about the crumbling corridors does wonder in scaring away pesky Rattata. They will ravage Feraligatr's stockpile if left unchecked. Granted, he could eat them. But Rattata don't taste that good. And contrary to what Feraligatr expected, a Rattata gorged on sugar does not taste sweeter.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But back in the present, Feraligatr's attention snaps to his belly. That oh-so-strange tickling feeling feels\u2026 strange. Feraligatr knows no other way to describe it. It's like\u2026 a tiny, tiny bug is twittering about inside him. Also, Feraligatr is pretty sure he doesn't eat bugs. At least intentionally\u2026<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"clblue\">\"Urgh,\"</span> Feraligatr grumbles as he took a claw and pressed in on his lower belly. His ivory claws scritched across his scales as he scratched the funny feeling into submission. <span class=\"clblue\">\"Quit it.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Walls crumpling, gluck squelching, goop rising\u2014everything is thrown into disarray as the small intestines squeeze in as Feraligatr's claw pushes forth. Like a crumpled water bottle, the slop level upsurges as villi-coated walls close together. After your head momentarily dunks beneath the surface in a gloppy baptism, you just about had it. Fueled by frustration, you unleash a shout so loud it could rouse a slumbering Snorlax.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b>\"Stop that you dolt!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Feraligatr froze. Did a tiny angry voice just erupt from his tummy?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Oh Juniper, the squirming is getting worse! The surprise of it all causes Feraligatr to reactively suck in his belly. The struggles that continue after he relaxes indicate that, whatever that is, it did not like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Stop dunking me like a breakfast tea biscuit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Feraligatr feels his head go hot with confusion and embarrassment. Dear Arceus, the thing in his belly really is talking! And it's angry. And fond of unusual insults.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0All Feraligatr can muster out is an unsure, <span class=\"clblue\">\"OK\u2026\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Things quiet down as the meat-sweet stew sloughs off the walls and settles back into the river below. Covered in the residue, you're looking like a thing from the swamp yourself.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thank you!\" You shout. Surprisingly sincere. The gut passage tilts and wobbles as you assume Feraligatr inspects his talking belly.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"clblue\">\"You a bug?\"</span> He asks. <span class=\"clblue\">\"Like\u2026 a tiny, tiny Joltik or something?\"</span> You hear the great boom of his heart quicken its pace as things shift again, slop sloshing to-and-fro. \"Don't shock me! Please, I'm sorry! Electricity really hurts!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After finding some stability, you shout back, \"I'm not a bug! I'm a human.

Great save.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Things get quiet for a bit. Feraligatr looks meekly to the left and right before resuming his patrol like nothing ever happened\u2014no tells besides the vaguely unsettled look upon his mug. The stream of foodstuff (and you) are steadily carried deeper into his depths. The groans and burbles of gator innards hard at work acquaint your ears with the unique soundscape of a giant lizard's internals. A great rumble buzzes around you as Feraligatr breaks the silence.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"clblue\">\"You new here?\"</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Nah, I've got a condo in your intestines\u2014three bends back.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"clblue\">\"I meant here\u2014like\u2014in the swamp.\"</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, I'm just passing through.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"clblue\">\"...Of course you are.\"</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No! Not like that! Well, like that too, I guess. But, like, on the outside.\" You groan. \"But Abra comes along and plops me in\u2014yeah. Your friend is a real jerk.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"clblue\">\"...This another game of hers?\"</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yup. And a rotten one, that's for sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\u25d3 \u25d3 \u25d3</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You're given a front row seat, witnessing nature take its course. The foodstuff around you is beyond recognition. Anything of use was sapped away by the greedy villi and what's left\u2014the dreck\u2014is quite unsightful. The color has molded to a vague ugly brown-ish color. Not quite yet the abominable stuff you are dreading crossing paths with. But given you are trapped in the middle of a meal, you're afraid it's inevitable.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You spot a puckered valve of muscle ahead: the duodenum. The end of the small intestine and entrance to the large. Ho boy, here you go again\u2026<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The gluck-stream drags you closer to the ring of flesh. The valve opens at random, swallowing the liquid muck then closing tight\u2014patiently waiting to do so again. Soon you find yourself pressed up against it. Your cheekbone presses against the warm flesh as you detect a foul smell wafting from deeper within. Moments later, it's your turn as the duodenum opens once more and you pass through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0What awaits you on the other side?</span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It's only when you're at your lowest that you appreciate how nice things were before. That's an undeniable truth many experience throughout all their lives, and now it was your turn. You had been inside Pokemon a few times before, and although you never had a good time, now you can say it could have been worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think that now because, now that you look upwards to the path ahead of you, you see much lining the walls. It's not much, just a few patches staining the walls, but it's a foreboding omen: you're likely to stumble upon Feraligatr's meal before you. \"...Feraligatr, tell me you don't usually eat as much as you ate a few hours ago\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Why do you ask?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wondering\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pleased growl erupted from way above you, from Feraligatr's throat. <span class=\"cteal\">\"Of course I do. I love food. You don't think the same?\" </span>You did like food, but certainly not to the amounts Feraligatr ate, if his latest showing was any hint. It was confirmation, though: you weren't going to enjoy your stay here. The smell was bad enough, making the air so heavy you were forced to cough, and you weren't looking forward to getting any closer to what's causing it. It was bad enough to have it behind you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crawl forward, trying hard to get away from the slop holding you, and only manage to get a couple steps done before you fall to the floor, too weighted down by the muck. It's thick, sticky, like a soup. You sigh, sinking and taking a deep breath that made your lungs burn. Right, you shouldn't breathe the air too deeply. At least you managed to get yourself to the front, that should be of some help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passes. Just like you expected, the situation was as dirty as you feared. The meal holding you onto place was solidifying, turning into what you couldn't deny anymore: you were held down by stool. For a moment you thought you were lucky you were closer to the front, but that didn't mean much when you were stumbling onto growing bits of crap along the way. Stains on the walls turned into particles no bigger than your fist, particles that fell down from the walls and ceiling. You had front row seats to seeing how it all crashed mere inches in front of you. Did that mean the further you went the bigger those pieces would get? How long before you sighted something blocking the way?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least you had Feraligatr's company, as silly as that was to say when you were in his bowels. He was pretty good conversation, showing interest in you and your life. Thanks to him you know where you were. \"You're taking this all better than expected\" you said, the gurgles all around you filling the silence while you wait for a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"I'm a predator. Pokemon have been inside me, you know. The smallest ones follow the same route than you.\"</span> So that was why he was taking it relatively well. You were the first human, he had commented. <span class=\"cteal\">\"I thought you'd be protesting more. Are things okay in there?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's actually pretty awful. I'm stuck and your colon needs some cleansing!\" you protested, annoyed by the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Oh. Um, sorry about that. Guess I should eat less?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should. But I'm not upset with <i>you</i>\" that was the only reason why you were taking it as calmly as you were right now. \"Abra's the one to blame\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Right. About that, I have been thinking and I wonder if she knew what she was doing\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure she knew very well. She wanted to give me a hard time with one of her games\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"That's what I mean.\"</span> A large tremor shook the colon, dislodging you somewhat. If there was one good thing happening right now was that the drier the feces holding you got, the more you could move. Feraligatr had just sat down, taking a break.<span class=\"cteal\"> \"I met her when she teleported me into this tower. Told me to get out\"</span> <i>Does she have no more tricks, seriously?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're still here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"No, I got out! But I came back because I met...a friend\"</span> Feraligatr said. Vaporeon, you supposed.<span class=\"cteal\"> \"And that friend is turning into something more. I wouldn't have met him if it wasn't for Abra being a jerk\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you're not saying what I think you're saying, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Psychic types, pal, they're weird. They know a lot but they never say it like you'd want it, straightforward. You'll be grateful to Abra before you know it\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frowned, shaking your head with disbelief, looking around yourself with disdain. Here you were, riding a crap train, in the depths of an alligator, surrounded by air so bad it felt like it was going to stick with you forever. Hell would freeze over before you thanked Abra for anything! A few minutes later, though, Feraligatr piped up: <span class=\"cteal\">\"So you gonna be small forever?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure hope not!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Listen, at the bottom of the tower there's a way for you to talk with Legendary Pokemon. I can't help you with getting those inches back, but getting a legendary's favor can't hurt. It's under a lot of water, though, you'd drown before you reach there\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou listened carefully. \"You think it'll work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"You should give it a try\"</span> He wasn't wrong about that. <span class=\"cteal\">\"I can't take you because I'm busy, but my friend could. He's fussy but he'll help if I ask him to\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckled nervously. You really doubted you could even look at Vaporeon without thinking where in him you were. \"No, I have a water-type friend who can help me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"Fine. Then I'll make sure you two can pass. You got my word\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of that had changed your mind. While you watched the walls contract and propel everything forward, you kept repeating to yourself you'd<i> never</i> thank Abra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a few hours since you had arrived to the colon and you were glad you could say you were close to the end. You were using the refuse you were stumbling upon to deduce how far away the rectum was, and now the stray pieces were starting to fill half of the passageway. Having dislodged yourself from the meal carrying you, you had gotten yourself to the dryest spot you could find -- no way you'd walk by yourself ahead and risk being crushed by the mound you had arrived on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhead of you, you saw the walls contracting almost hypnotically, and an ominous-looking drop was looming ahead. You got off the refuse, approaching the edge, careful not to tumble down. All you could see was quite the fall, and then at the bottom the road evened and went out of sight. Maybe it was better that way. The rectum and its contents could only be over there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, everything around you shook. Jumping back to avoid falling, you crawled back to your crap carriage. \"What's going on?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was going on was that Feraligatr had finally found Floatzel. You had told him about her, that she was the friend who'd help you, and he had promised if he saw her he'd tell her you were okay. <span class=\"cteal\">\"Wait! The human!\" </span>Feraligatr shouted. Floatzel had been about to dart around the corner and away when she stopped in her tracks, slipping and going back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"Did you say human? This tall?\" </span>she showed how small you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"That one\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloatzel pretty much clung onto Feraligatr, trying and failing to envelope him with a hug. <span class=\"corange\">\"Thank you thank you thank you! You don't know how worried I have been! When I noticed they weren't with me...\"</span> the otter looked all over Feraligatr. <span class=\"corange\">\"So where's the human?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were listening to the conversation. From your position, all you could do was cringe. <span class=\"cteal\">\"They're inside me. My bad\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"Your bad?! They better be okay!\"</span> the wall right beside you buckled, shaking everything. <span class=\"corange\">\"Can you hear me? Are you okay?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine!\" you shouted as loudly as you could, trying to be heard over the gurgling of Feraligatr's system. \"I'm...on my way out\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"On your way out? Wait, does that mean you're...um...\"</span> she couldn't bring herself to outright say you were on Feraligatr's poop, pretty much. Your affirmative response confirmed her fears. She glared at Feraligatr. <span class=\"corange\">\"You better be careful!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"I know, I'll get them out carefully\"</span> As carefully as he could, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw some of the things ahead of you fall down the abyss. Great. You hoped it'd have been carried away when it was your turn to fall. Outside, Floatzel grumbled: <span class=\"corange\">\"I can't believe this...I should stick my paw in there and get them out myself, I can't believe this...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"It's not like I <i>want</i> to have humans up my ass, you know!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, can you stop? This is bad enough already, I don't want to listen to your bickering!\" you were teetering on the edge of the turn. Below you, anything that had fallen was already slowly being carried away, towards the rectum. \"I think it'll be like twenty minutes before I'm out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you just couldn't wait for that to happen.</span></div></div>",

In good news: you finally know what it means when you stare into the abyss, and the abyss stares back. This abyss was giving you one monumental stink-eye. It\u2019s also trying to push your nostrils into your skull by the sheer force of its stench. Also, most of it is covered in literal dung. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You turn away\u2014you face very likely green. You can\u2019t know for certain. You can\u2019t see your own face. But you know what you can see? Absolutely everything else! There\u2019s not much else to see, really. The intestines are fleshy, red, writhing, horrible tunnels: a sewage pipe filled with a mudslide of stinking refuse. But there\u2019s a simplicity to that horror that makes it 10x worse. You\u2019re up shit-creek without a paddle.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You look back. Lurking behind and below you is the regrettably familiar crap-coaster you\u2019ve been cruising on. It rises and falls with the undulation of Feraligatr\u2019s colon. It slopes upward, mounds of crap stacked atop each other until they very nearly reach the ceiling of the cavernous tunnel. The hard truth hits you. You\u2019re coming out dirty either way\u2014but if you don\u2019t take the plunge, you\u2019re going to be buried.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You face forward. You\u2019re gonna do it. You\u2019re making the dive.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before you can stop yourself, you kick off the mushed earthen floor and plummet. You\u2019re in freefall. The humid, hot air whips past, providing you ironic relief to the suffocating environment of Feraligatr\u2019s colon. The ground fast approaches. You aim for the portion of the road not covered in dung. But, as luck would have it, you\u2019re not that lucky. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Splat!</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You\u2019re sunken up to your armpits. Your legs are entombed below, gripped in a nasty, mushy vice. You blow, breathe, and cough the breath back out. The smell is somehow worse here.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Looking ahead, it\u2019s no wonder why. You\u2019re not the only tenant here. Portions of Feraligatr\u2019s last meal, and perhaps others as well, got here long before you. The mound of evil mud is mountainous, dwarfing you to such a degree that you feel microscopic. To make matters worse, the way ahead is hemmed away by the wall of crap. Worst of all, you\u2019re stuck. Again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"corange\">\u201cThey\u2019re taking a terribly long time\u2026\u201d</span> Floatzel worries, pacing back-and-forth in front of Feraligatr. The giant lizard is simply sitting in silence, waiting for a cue. He risks a glance at Floatzel\u2014which the weasel immediately notices and returns a glower of her own. Feraligatr quickly breaks away does his best to avoid eye contact. When he dares to take another peep in Floatzel\u2019s direction, he finds their snouts practically touching.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"corange\">\u201cSomething awful better not have happened to them in there!\u201d</span> Floatzel reels back and crosses her arms and tails. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cOr I\u2019ll\u2014I\u2019ll\u2026\u201d</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Feraligatr\u2019s belly gurgles.

You hope Floatzel didn\u2019t hear that. \u201cJust\u2026 fine!\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Floatzel didn\u2019t buy it. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cYou\u2019ve been in there forever!

While they\u2019re taking their swamp tour, you\u2019re taking a tour of your own. But of course, your\u2019s is much worse. But not by much. Given that it seems Feraligatr\u2019s bowels\u2019 thermostat turned up a few degrees, he\u2019s probably sweating bullets while dealing with Floatzel\u2019s ire. That is, if he can even sweat. You don\u2019t know if he can or not. But it\u2019s mulling over thoughts like these that help you survive the slow, hellish trip through the twilight of your journey in the land where the sun never shines. Two mounds of crap surround you in a phalanx formation, a pocket of air mercifully spares you the fate of having to be in a log as opposed to being surrounded by it. The natural peristalsis of the intestines moves you forward at a snail\u2019s pace. You don\u2019t have much else to do besides to listen to the bodily noises of the gator, the sticky movement of the feces being pushed towards its final destination, and Feraligatr\u2019s awkward attempts at small talk. Not any of it is all that engaging and you slowly find yourself daydreaming, gazing off into nothing.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The monotony is abruptly broken when you realize you\u2019re falling. Before you can process what\u2019s happening, the clump of stool you\u2019re stuck in plaps onto a similarly disgusting space. You\u2019re in a vertical tube, you remain un-entombed, but sadly still stuck. The good news: you\u2019re just about free!<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0...Wait. There\u2019s still the crap behind you.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<b>Feraligatr!</b>\u201d You yell with a ferocity and urgency you never knew you possessed. \u201c<b>Shit now!</b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your words are loud and clear. Floatzel blanches. Feraligatr stares at the ghost-white weasel, coughs nervously, and rushes behind a nearby bush. Floatzel remains petrified.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Feraligatr squats, takes a deep breath, lifts his tail, and sighs. <span class=\"cteal\">\u201cWell, buddy. Here goes nothing\u2026\u201d</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The flesh walls of the fetid chamber you\u2019re in clamp in, pushing in-and-out-and-forward in an oscillation that could only mean one thing: Feraligatr is pooping. You feel yourself steadily lowering as the horrid viscid sound of expelling scat sours the air. You hear the bass-enriched grunts of Feraligatr as he tries to free you as fast as he can. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>C\u2019mon, c\u2019mon, c\u2019mon!</i> Looking up, you can already see that other horrible log poking from over the lip of Feraligatr\u2019s bowels. With each rhythmic contraction, you\u2019re pulled deeper. Soon you feel a pressure on the tips of your toes that spreads further up your body as you descend\u2014clenching in time with Feraligatr\u2019s groans. Soon that pressure is around your shoulders. You\u2019re almost free! But the heap of scat teeters on the edge of the rectum\u2014ready to fall at any moment.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Just as it breaks off, plummeting towards you with frightening speed, Feraligatr gives one last push and expels you. As you\u2019re falling in the (comparatively fresh) air of the swamp outside, you\u2019ve never been happier to see a Pokemon\u2019s butt. You\u2019re less than enthused when you fall amongst the rest of the Pokemon\u2019s former meals.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cStop! Stop! STOP!\u201d You clamor. \u201cI\u2019m free, I\u2019m free!\u201d Feraligatr halts immediately. Thank Arceus.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Pokemon grins a many-fanged grin of relief. <span class=\"cteal\">\u201cYou\u2019re okay! Th-they\u2019re okay! Floatzel, check it out! They\u2019re okay!\u201d</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Floatzel stiffly approaches, some of her color restored. Her paw quickly reaches for her nose. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cThis is going to take a lot of Water Guns\u2026\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\u25d3   \u25d3   \u25d3</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The next day, you\u2019re clean, well-rested, and singing the praises of the outside world! Feraligatr offered to let you crash at his place, but knowing that was near Abra\u2019s stomping ground, you politely declined. Floatzel, being the expert survivalist she is, was able to find a cozy place to sleep.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And now that you\u2019re freshened up and reunited with your ol\u2019 pal Floatzel, you\u2019re ready to knock on the door of that legendary Pokemon Feraligatr mentioned earlier. The big guy directed you both to the waterway that lead under the tower: a clear pool amongst the crumbling ruin\u2014whose surface shone like a polished mirror. You and Floatzel are raring to go!<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"corange\">\u201cJust one thing,\u201d</span> Floatzel said, looking at you standing on her shoulder, <span class=\"corange\">\u201cI never ever wanted to carry you in my mouth ever again.\u201d</span> Floatzel gives a sad look, <span class=\"corange\">\u201cbut it\u2019s looking like we don't got a choice this time. Unless that Abra you were talking about gave you gills.\u201d</span> She sets you down on the stone floor and flops down in front of you. You give an affirmative nod before she creaks open her jaws and allows you to walk right in.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After you pass by her ivory fangs and wriggle onto her slippery tongue, the weasel wastes no time before shooting off into the crystal-clear pond.<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were rather nervous to be inside Floatzel's mouth again, most likely more nervous than she was. You're the one who is small enough to be into her belly, after all. Thankfully, she's being much more careful than before, barely moving her tongue, while you grab what you can and hold onto it. All around you there's an impenetrable wall of teeth and fangs, pointy and scary-looking. It's not the most inspiring landscape, if you had to be honest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, things were better. The water was clean, pristine, without not even a sign of murkiness despite being in the depths of a swamp. Floatzel could clearly see the stone walls to the side, slowly turning into what rocks and dirt. The pond was going far deeper than she thought it would, had she entered an underground cavern? Sometimes she passed by fish Pokemon. They barely looked at her. She couldn't tell if they lived there or if they were guardians of what laid below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty minutes later, she found the bottom of the pond. The bottom curved like a bowl, leading towards an opening right to a side, where she could see a passageway decorated with ancient symbols. Behind you you heard a gurgle of delight. This was awesome! She had found some rather amazing things! If only she could stay to take a good look...but no, she had a task to do. Hoping to return someday, she entered the passageway and followed it to the end, surfacing in an underwater chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a huge chamber. Statues decorated the place, most of them shattered and broken. There were clear signs of something <i>huge</i> living there -- that was huge bedding, right over there, and the ceiling was so high she could never dream to reach it at all. The Pokemon that resided there was nowhere to be seen. How did they leave? The tunnel she went through was too small for whatever lived in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she saw the large pink orb set to a side, she realized who resided there. Her jaw hung open from how surprised she was. You interpreted it as she trying to let you out, so you crawled to the edge of her mouth, where she felt you and picked you up. \"Okay, we're here. Where's the Legendary Pokemon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"I thought Palkia's pearls was just a fun thing to say, not that...peals existed out of their body!\"</span> she commented. It took you a moment to realize what she meant:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in the abode of Palkia, the Spatial Pokemon. That Water and Dragon type was a Pokemon you never thought you'd come close to meet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloatzel approached the pearl, mesmerized, and put the paw holding you close enough for you to touch it. <span class=\"corange\">\"I think this is how we can contact them, since they're not here. Go ahead, touch it\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was worth a try. You laid a hand on the surface of the smooth pink pearl. Static-y noises emerged from the pearl, like it was having trouble to connect with Palkia, until finally a voice came through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"chotpink\">\"...yes? It's unusual for anyone to try to contact me. What do you need?\"</span></b> Palkia said. You couldn't tell their gender at all from the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry for bothering you,\" you apologized, hoping to invoke pity. \"I really, really need your help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou explain the situation, making emphasis on everything you had gone through. You wanted to make clear that staying small could only lead to further misfortune, and that you relied on Palkia to be okay again. Floatzel was just bowing her head, like she expected Palkia's face to appear on the pearl at any moment and she feared it'd be disrespectful to look at them. Your story took ten minutes to tell, and Palkia didn't interrupt at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...you're the only one who can help me. Please, help!\" you finished. Should you get on your knees, you pondered for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPalkia's voice replied. You couldn't deduce what they thought of you and your adventures so far. <b><span class=\"chotpink\">\"I see. Indeed, that'd be under my purview. You did well in coming to see me\"</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt so much elation when you heard that. Finally...! The return to a normal life--!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\"><b>\"I will get in contact with you in three hundred years. Please have some patience\"</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three hundred years?!\" Floatzel and you shouted. You got closer to the pearl. \"I won't live for not even half of that time!\" As soon as you said those words, a strange tingle coursed through your body. \"W-Wait, what was...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\"><b>\"Now you will\"</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloatzel raised her head up, politeness be damned. \"You can't extend someone's lifespan like that! They need help right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed to have been a bad idea. From the pearl Palkia's voice raised its intensity, turning so loud you felt it in your bones. <span class=\"chotpink\"><b>\"I believe I made myself clear! Since when is the human so important they deserve to be placed ahead of the millions of Pokemon that desire my favor? Don't they deserve my help as well?!\"</b></span> Oh. So that was what was going on. That was why they didn't want to help you right way, even though they very clearly could. Palkia wanted to take their duties in order, and since millions of Pokemon asked for help before you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou conked your head against the pearl. \"Please, there has to be a way for me--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\"><b>\"...I have a proposal for you.\"</b></span> they said almost immediately. Oh, that manipulative dragon...they must have felt for desperate you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raised your head. Behind you, Floatzel's ears perked up. \"Yes? What's the proposal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\"><b>\"Human, there's a <i>favor</i> I'd like to ask of you. Let's say your current size would be quite advantageous for you, for the completion of such <i>favor</i>. Perhaps even <i>favors</i> in plural, now that I think about it.\"</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou held onto the pearl like it was a lifesaver in a stormy sea, although you didn't like the inflection of the word 'favor'. It sounded like a foreboding omen. \"What do I have to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\"><b>\"I'm not claiming if you complete my request or requests you will be taken to the top of the waiting list, but I may speed things along for you to not have to wait three hundred years. I imagine moving you up the list a few years a time for every favor you make would be welcome\"</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, definitely! But what do I have to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\"><b>\"Will you accept or not, human?\"</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were pressing an answer out of you. You peered deep into the pearl. Like images of a movie, moments of your time shrunken flashed in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had been eaten by a Noibat, almost died in their stomach, had to travel through the intestines to leave, met Honchkrow, was shoved into his bottom because of his perverted desires, trekked through a ruined manor, met Floatzel, got swallowed by her while you got as far as possible from the manor, was taken up her throat, went to a swamp, was stolen by Abra, got teleported into Vaporeon's bladder, crawled through his dick, was a third wheel in two Pokemon's lust-filled urges, and saw in more detail than you'd have liked how Feraligatr digested his food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd all that had happened in three or four days. If you had to wait three hundred years, you were sure by then you'd have been inside every Pokemon species in existence's bodies. Twice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same fire of determination that had been sparked within you the day before swelled up. There was absolutely no way you'd let such a fate happen to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"I don't like this,\"</span> said Floatzel, bringing you down to earth for a moment. She had stepped back, eyeing the pearl warily. The excitement she had felt before was gone. <span class=\"corange\">\"Why aren't they explaining what they want? Why do they want you to accept before you even know what you'll be doing?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...\" you had no rebuttal. You also had a feeling once you said yes there'd be no way back. Floatzel sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"I never thought I'd say this, but Palkia seems to be a jerk.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\"><b>\"I believe you have no say in any of this, Floatzel. Stay silent.\"</b></span> Palkia said. Definitely a jerk. <span class=\"chotpink\"><b>\"Human, my patience has a limit. I want a response. Right now.\"</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crossed your arms. Floatzel was right, something was going on. As you saw it, Palkia's request -- or requests, apparently they were mulling asking you for multiple favors -- was going to be something you wouldn't like at all, or would get you in trouble. Or both. You wouldn't be surprised if it was both. That she had mentioned your size also bothered you a lot. Just what was Palkia thinking right now...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you respond.</span></div></div>",

Without a word, she blasts a jet of water toward the Dragon-type. It splashes against his scales, harmless bouncing off before drifting off into the void. At that, Palkia recognizes Floatzel, peering down at her from above.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b><span class=\"chotpink\">\u201cInsubordinate\u2026 and churlish.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Palkia's order leaves you without breath. You had gone through so much, and got the best lead you could ask for...and the price is being a pawn in the Legendary Pokemon's struggle for power! You exchange a look of disbelief with Floatzel. It's rather amazing to you how much easier you can read her expressions now that she's right in front of you: she can't believe what she just heard, either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, how are we going to do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\"><b>\"That is something you must think by yourself. I have given you the order, and it's your duty to complete it.\"</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn other words: Floatzel and you are on your own. For a second you wonder if that's their way of pushing Floatzel closer to her doom. You certainly didn't want her to be digested by that oversized dragon! Swallowing back protests, you ask: \"Alright...whose domain will we infiltrate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you're being shown in your mind an image of a Pokemon you recall hearing legends about before. It's a rather tall black and blue stag, with an impressive set of antlers. What was its name...Xerneas? With domain over life?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPalkia explains, the image intensifying. <span class=\"chotpink\"><b>\"That's Xerneas. For the last few years they have been rather insistent about keeping several of us Dragon-type Legends in check -- in their own words. They're borderline paranoid, and there's not much we can do about it.\"</b></span> You imagine it's hard when Xerneas has a decisive type advantage over them. The image transforms, a tree replacing Xerneas' form. <span class=\"chotpink\"><b>\"When Xerneas needs time to rest, they are forced to transform into a tree for a thousand years. That's your mission:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou must make it so Xerneas transforms into a tree.\"</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretty tall order for a pair of beings not even tall enough to reach over Xerneas' hooves. You don't even know how to get started. Floatzel looks as much at a loss as you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\"><b>\"You have a day to do so. If you fail, I'll give good use to your friend, as a morsel,\"</b></span> they warned you one last time. You don't even have time to reply to that before you find yourself in a different place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPalkia had the courtesy of directly transporting you to Xerneas' domain. A bright, blue sky shone way above you. There were countless trees, plants, and flowers all around you, a lush and colorful garden worth admiring. You're currently on a grassy hill, and at the bottom, you see your target: Xerneas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stag is right there, legs folded, head held high. They seem to be contemplating something, hopefully deep enough in contemplation not to notice you. Floatzel gets closer to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"...we have to think of something,\"</span> she urges you. You sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, I know. I don't want Palkia to eat you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cborange\">\"I mean, I admit I'm kinda interested on how things are like inside a Pokemon, but definitely not if it means dying...\"</span> she says. Giving her a comforting pat on the back, she and you start thinking as hard as possible how to tackle the impossible-looking task you have been given.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for you both, it seems Xerneas is in no hurry to move somewhere else, they have barely moved their head during the last hour. You sat on a pebble, staring at the stag as if that was going to reveal a weakness you could exploit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cborange\">\"You said Xerneas is Fairy-type, right? Weak to Poison and Steel?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloatzel is rather invested in the success of this mission -- obviously, since failing meant she'd be in grave danger. She looks around with expert eye. <span class=\"corange\">\"There are a lot of plants here. I'm certain we can find a poisonous plant we can use\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widen. \"That's not going to kill them, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"Of course not! I doubt any plant will be intense enough to kill even <i>you</i>.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If they grew everything in this place then I doubt they can be fooled into eating poisonous plants,\" you point out. Floatzel examines the leaves of a nearby bush, liking what they see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"We just have to get the poison into their body somehow, without them noticing. That should weaken them and force them to transform into a tree.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf a Legendary Pokemon could be defeated by putting poisonous plants inside them then they weren't really that impressive, you thought. You weren't sure the plan would work, but it was the best idea you both had -- for the mission, that is. You had a different idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We also could ask Xerneas for help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloatzel shot you a look of disbelief. <span class=\"corange\">\"Help about how to weaken them?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not! Help about saving you,\" you hurry to explain before Floatzel can think of a rebuttal: \"Xerneas has domain over life. What if they can use their powers to keep you alive and safe even if Palkia eats you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe otter seems intrigued, although not very convinced. <span class=\"corange\">\"I...I guess they could do that, but what will we do when Palkia eats me?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...we'll think of that later,\" you say. She was right, you'd both need some sort of plan of action for such a case. You weren't sure you could even stand around and do nothing while Palkia gobbled down your friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloatzel plucked one of the leaves. <span class=\"corange\">\"We don't even know if Xerneas would want to protect me, and I don't...like the idea of Palkia eating me.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, we can think something else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"We have been thinking for one hour and that's all we have! We have to start doing something or else the time will run out,\"</span> she said, tearing the leaf into pieces easier to carry. She stops for a moment and adds something, though: <span class=\"corange\">\"I think you noticed I'd like to proceed with the poisoning Xerneas plan, but...if you insist with your idea...I guess I'll play along.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment you had the rather unkind thought she was pushing a tough responsibility onto you. You stamp down that thought and think carefully your options:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could do what Palkia asked you to do. To achieve that, Floatzel and you would have to somehow get poisonous leaves into Xerneas' system without them suspecting anything. There wasn't even a guarantee some leaves would be enough to affect the stag that much, even with their weakness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr you could make contact with Xerneas and ask them to bestow their protection onto Floatzel, so when the time for Palkia to punish you and her by eating her, she'd survive. There was the problem of making it so Palkia doesn't notice your friend hadn't been digested, though. Getting them out of Palkia safely was a challenge, too. Not only that, you also doubted you do nothing while Palkia ate your friend, and there was a chance the dragon would lose their patience and eat you too. Also, there was no guarantee Xerneas would protect Floatzel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA third option crossed your mind: rebel. Plot against Palkia somehow, to weaken them. It'd mean surrendering any chance of a return to normalcy, but...you really didn't like Palkia. Not when they were making you take such hard choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way it seemed that both the subterfuge option and the mission failure option had rather high chances of you paying a visit to a Legend's insides. Two drastically different bodies, and neither could really be classified as the lesser evil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving considered your options, you tell Floatzel what needed to be done.</span></div></div>",

As you go past their tucked in hooves, you hope you've made the right choice.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And soon you and Floatzel stand directly below Xerneas's head, held high and proud. Floatzel doesn't wait before greeting the Fairy with her best shout.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"corange\">\"<b>HEEEY!</b>\"</span> She hollers. Xerneas doesn't even flinch in surprise. They simply slowly tilt their head down, looking right at your orange friend.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cblue\">\"Curious.\" </span>Xerneas muses. Her voice is distinctly feminine.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"corange\">\"<b>CAN YOU HEAR ME?</b>\"</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cblue\">\"It's unnecessary to shout.\" </span>The doe states calmly. She huffs a puff of air from her nostrils.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"corange\">\"Sorry about that\u2026\"</span> Floatzel rubs the back of her head. <span class=\"corange\">\"So, uh, how you doing?\"</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cblue\">\"I contemplate the meaning of the cosmos. Life is serendipitous in its serenity. Can you not espy nature's celestial wonder?\"</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Floatzel looks on blankly.<span class=\"corange\"> \"I haven't a clue of half the words you just said, lady\u2014 I mean ma'am.\"</span> You decide to try and salvage things.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Look,\" you begin, \"we don't mean to trouble you Xerneas. We need your help.\" Xerneas' face doesn't show any flicker of emotion. What is it with Legendaries and their cool looks??<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cblue\">\"You are quite brave.\" </span>Xerneas says with a hint of\u2026 admiration, possibly? <span class=\"cblue\">\"It must've been arduous to journey here. You've braved the grove's fearsome traps: the fearsome forest of Trevanant, the eternal watching eyes of the Decidueye, the bone-quaking guard of\u2014\"</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"corange\">\"It was really hard. Yeah.\"</span> Floatzel interrupts. <span class=\"corange\">\"Sorry for rushing things along, but we've got a ticking clock above our heads.\"</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cblue\">\"You clearly do not. I see nothing. And my eyesight is peerless.\"</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"corange\">\"...It's metaphorical. But anyway, Palkia wants us\u2014specifically me\u2014gone. And by us, I mean you and me, just so we're clear.\"</span> Floatzel's looking more and more nervous by the second. And greater her fear grows, the more she begins talking with her paws. Xerneas watches it all with an unflinching eye. <span class=\"corange\">\"...and so we need your help, great Xerneas!\" </span>Floatzel finishes dramatically.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Xerneas hums. <span class=\"cblue\">\"It ails my heart to see such frail creatures troubled so.\"</span> With her next words, you feel her water-blue iris pierce through your soul. <span class=\"cblue\">\"I will assist you.\"</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Floatzel is ecstatic. Her two tails spin wildly, thumping on the ground as they try to make a full rotation.<span class=\"corange\">  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Awesome! Thank you, thank you!\"</span> Floatzel bounces up with revitalized energy.<span class=\"corange\"> \"What do we gotta do, Mrs. Doe?\"</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Xerneas inspects the both of you before looking cooly back toward Floatzel. <span class=\"cblue\">\"Hm. To ensure your safe ingress, embrace your friend.\"</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"corange\">\"No clue what you're saying, but I know what I've gotta do!\"</span> Floatzel beams as she springs over to you, smashing you into her chest and hugging you tight. She closes her eyes as your face is stuffed in her fur. It smells kinda nice, you guess\u2026<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But your Spinarak-senses begin tingling when feel the pleasant warmth of the sun's touch snuff out. You look down. The ground is eclipsed in shadow. You look up. Xerneas is lining up her rear above your head.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You sputter an ugly gasp. \"What are you doing!?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Floatzel opens her eyes just in time to see the doe's rear come crashing down.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Immediately things become tight, wet, and hot. You and Floatzel are pressed up together as Xerneas groans, her grousings traveling through her cramped walls in a rumbling earthquake.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"corange\">\"<b>What in the world are you doing!?</b>\" </span>Floatzel shrieks before Xerneas grunts, the walls bearing down once again. You're smeared up against Floatzel and the deer's depths; the Legendary holds you in a vice grip, barely allowing you to squirm. A potent musk overpowers you. But it's different from what you've experienced before. It isn't the stench of the colon. It's strong, yes, but\u2026 it's\u2026 it's\u2026 feminine?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Xerneas voice rings as you and Floatzel cry out, the flesh around you constricting and mashing\u2014squeezing you deeper. <span class=\"cblue\">\"I am claiming you as my own. Palkia cannot take what is mine.\"</span> You're about to call out how that sounds like a load of Mudsdale-crap, but Xerneas anticipates this and presses her legs together and squeezes her lower belly. You're forcibly silenced as musked, moist flesh crams you against your friend, her fur already sodden with sexual fluids. Xerneas hums pleasurably as her internals crush in, causing Floatzel to whine in protest.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Floatzel manages to speak through clenched fangs, <span class=\"corange\">\"let us out!\"</span> She yelps as another bone-crushing pulse rocks the insides of Xerneas' vagina.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You feel the doe's voice in your bones. <span class=\"cblue\">\"In time, I will. I\u2014 <b>ah\u2014</b>\" </span>Her voice skids to a stop as she moans in pleasure as her pussy continues to swallow you.<span class=\"cblue\"> \"\u2014need to finish the ritual. Legends cannot directly harm another without reason. I can't make you Legendary but\u2014ah! Urgh\u2026 I can make you one in the eyes of our law.\"</span> A bead of pearlescent fluid glops down onto you before the walls bear down once more, smearing your back in sticky horribleness. You find the room to kick and squirm, prompting a very surprised, airy gasp from the deer above.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cblue\">\"Ahhh! Repose yourself! You're hastening your cudgeling!\"</span> You have no idea what that means, but you got the intent. You try to stop fighting back, sitting by\u2014letting the writhing walls continue to wail on you.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"corange\">\"Let us out!\"</span> Floatzel cries out once again.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cblue\">\"I've voiced this already! I cannot! The ritual is incomplete. To accept you as my allegorical children, I require a union!\"</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"corange\">\"A <i>what!?</i>\" </span>Floatzel squeaks with squeezed lungs.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cblue\">\"A union: a mate! I require the life-seed of a male.\"</span> Xerneas pauses. <span class=\"cblue\">\"Or perhaps a female. I've never tried it before\u2026\"</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"corange\">\"Ack! I got it in my mouth! Ew-w-ww\u2026!\"</span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cblue\">\"...And I have reason to believe that I must do so godspeed.\"</span> With those words, Xerneas plants her feet into the ground and slowly rises up, her rear wobbling the entire way. Her tail raised high, she unsteadily wobbles into the wood, unused to the squirming holdaways in the depths of her snatch.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You \"enjoy\" Xerneas' carouse through the forest clamped by a twitching tunnel that caves in at the slightest provocation, Floatzel accompanying you. With a clop of Xerneas hooves, you're swung back-and-forth with the sway of the deer's rear\u2014hidden completely from the outside world. Occasionally Xerneas would grimace and things would get unbearably tight, but the deer seems to be more in control now. Just as you and Floatzel are finding the room to peel yourselves off each other, you feel your sensitive surroundings jump with an unexpected lurch.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0What's going on?</span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It takes all of your willpower to stay still when you hear what Xerneas has to do. You have a faint feeling of nausea that you know is your mind trying its hardest to make you scream many, many objections. No, thanks, Xerneas! You had already been in someone's lovemaking once! And now you were on the receiving Pokemon, which you certainly weren't looking forward to. Still, what other option did you have? If you fight back, you either will fall down from where you are all the way to the ground and you can say goodbye to Xerneas' help, or Xerneas gets too distracted from how you and Floatzel moving around feels like. You glance at Floatzel, who seems to be having a hard time deciding it being devoured by Palkia was worse than this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...at least you're not in deadly danger,\" you say. Floatzel keeps her mouth shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXerneas knew she had to hurry. Her prospective children felt so, so strange yet so <i>good</i> in there...! But no! She can't let herself fall prey to the urges she was feeling! Not when she had to help them and--and if only the mere act of walking didn't make them press against the walls of her sexual canal, this was getting distracting. The doe stopped, looking around in the forest like a potential mate was going to appear from the trees at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps it was fortune deciding you needed help that there was a large enough male Pokemon coming through, passing by like the obstacles of the grove had been no big deal. Xerneas wouldn't have to search any further. If you had been outside, you'd have seen a tall, quadrupedal teal being coming forth. Crooked horns pointed at the sky, but not even with those the newcomer was nearly as tall as Xerneas. It didn't matter to her, though: he'd do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Cobalion</span>,\" she greeted. Other Legends arriving to her grove was nothing unusual. Cobalion bowed his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"I hope I didn't arrive at a bad time. I need counsel regarding--\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"My utmost apologies for asking you to pause, but I require your aid immediately.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was like the magic word for Cobalion. He raised his head high, didn't need to hear any further. <span class=\"cteal\">\"Of course! Just say it and I will endeavor myself to your help!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"I need you to mate with me,\"</span> she said bluntly, already turning around, tail raised high, doing all that so fast she missed Cobalion's flabbergasted expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">\"...Sorry, I must have misheard you, and <i>also</i> misinterpreted your-\"</span> body language, he was about to say, but Xerneas, in a hurry, once again interrupted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"There is no misunderstanding! I shall give you an explanation at a later time, but it's imperative you perform the favor I'm begging you to. Don't you have reliance on my decisions?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't say no. Xerneas wasn't the kind of Pokemon to joke around, and she certainly had no fame of asking random Pokemon to satisfy her sexual urges. If she was asking so urgently, there had to be a reason, and a very good one. Seriously wondering what kind of explanation he'd get later, he approached her rear. <span class=\"cteal\">\"Let's get this done.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was rather difficult to listen to what was going on outside when you had tissue slamming against your ears, you had only heard the mate's name. Floatzel had better luck, that was why she was staring in direction of the way out with a face full of dread. Following her stare, you looked in that direction as well. The opening of the vulva was open enough for you to see a teal underbelly. That was all you could see before it went dark -- or at least you had hoped so. Your accursed improved sight sense had gotten in the way again. You once again think how much you dislike Abra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd have preferred not to have been able to see the rod-like organ that was inserted into Xerneas' nethers, especially not when the very tip was a mere inch in front of you. What would you have done not to see so much pink tissue right in front of you, and on it an opening already open and showing the depths of that dick. The ritual was underway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"Nooo...\"</span> Floatzel whimpered, already knowing how things would go. The thrusting that ensued signaled Cobalion was doing his best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried really hard to think about something else, anything, just to try to delude yourself from what was going on, but that was rather difficult when the tip of a Pokemon's dick was pushing you around, slamming against the walls, and making everything quiver you actually feared it'd all grind you to dust. You clung onto Floatzel while she tried to get away from the penis, dragging you with her, observing the organ retreat and advance over and over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Cobalion was going to be your allegorical father? Was that how it worked? You and Floatzel were right now getting symbolically adopted by a pair of cervine Legendaries. What a turn your lives had taken. You tried to focus on such thoughts, but Cobalion unwittingly gave you no reprieve. More than once he thrusted far enough for you to be touched by his dick, you hated the feel of his dick pushing against you, wet from his own fluids and the increasingly clammier environment you were in. Drops of lubricant had turned into veritable rivulets, making it feel like you were once again in a swamp, clutching Floatzel like she was going to be your lifesaver boat in what would turn into a sea of questionable fluids. She didn't seem to be faring well at all, the juices being too viscous for her to swim, but she kept taking you with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pressure kept growing, kneading you endlessly, the male organ pushing you back and forth with it whenever it reached you, until suddenly, everything convulsed like it had decided to end you, mashing you against the wall opposite to you. All you could see was black and bits of bright pink, and then a deluge of fluid fell all over you. Out of the corner of your eye you peered transparent globules, dripping from the walls, and cream white liquid starting to pool all around you. You looked up when Floatzel pulled from you, trying to get you to climb up a wall. You could see Cobalion's penis, sputtering the seed Xerneas had been looking for. The few seconds that lasted seemed eternal to you, even more when Cobalion thrusted one last time, the tip of the penis going right at you and Floatzel, sticky from so many substances you didn't want to think about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"Don't let go!\"</span> Floatzel urged. You grabbed the wall with all your strength, feeling the push of a cervine dick on your back, you swear you could even feel its opening right behind you like it was out to get you. You dug your fingers on the walls of Xerneas' canal, uncaring if she felt it or not. You just wanted to ensure you wouldn't be moved from there!</span></div></div>",

It seemed they had caught onto what she was trying to do with her eager attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Palkia said, everything around you disappeared in the blink of an eye. Instead you were brought to what seemed to be a forest, the trees extending way above your head. Behind you, Floatzel seems somewhat dazed because of the startling trip, but recovers quickly and sniffs the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"...this doesn't smell familiar at all.

Surely a giant Pokemon shouldn't be too difficult to find!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grimace. \"If there's one thing I have found out is that there are many ways in and out of Pokemon. All we have to do is pinpoint the pearl's location and get it out somehow. It's a pearl we can roll it around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"If this is all we have to do then it'll be a walk in the park!\"</span> Floatzel actually was rather glad Palkia's demand wasn't too difficult. It meant there was a good chance she wasn't going to be devoured by a Legendary Pokemon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she expected, finding a giant Pokemon wasn't too difficult. She had taken the lead, guiding you through the foliage of the forest, and showing you where to hide whenever any normal-sized Pokemon passed by. She seemed to be following the smell of something, until she pushed a few leaves apart and saw something not too far away. With a yelp, she rushed towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"I found them!\"</span> You hadn't been able to catch a glimpse of what kind of Pokemon it was. <span class=\"corange\">\"It can't be anyone else\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's get going.\" You move to pass through the leaves, but Floatzel stops you, whispering to you:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\"Wait! Um, how are we going to do this? Should we...like, sneak into their body? Or should we make ourselves known and ask for their help?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had been about to just go ahead and talk to the Pokemon, the possibility of doing this while the target was unaware hadn't crossed your mind.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You didn't really believe Abra would leave you alone if you went for something short and sweet. You were sure she'd make you go through both of her games, so to try to avoid that, you decided to try to avoid giving her reasons for tormenting you for too long. Completing the one challenge that would take a while should do the trick, even though you were going to suffer a lot because of it. \"I want the longer one\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbra actually looked rather surprised. \"<span class=\"cdorange\">I didn't think you'd take the one. Okay then</span>,\" she looked in direction to the small pond - Feraligatr was still sleeping. \"That's the one you'll be inside of. Have a good look at him\" You obeyed. Feraligatr was a considerably large Pokemon, and you had no idea what his temperament was. That made you rather nervous. \"<span class=\"cdorange\">First you should know is that you can't let him know you're inside him. If he finds out, I'll take that as my victory\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat didn't seem too hard. You were so small you'd have to make a serious effort to be noticed. \"Fine, but what do I have to do?\" you asked, already dreading the answer. You were sure you'd have to find your way out of the Feraligatr's body, you were already mentally psyching up for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Abra said was pretty much the opposite of what you expected. <span class=\"cdorange\">\"You must live inside Feraligatr for a while\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\" You were preparing yourself for escaping from his body as soon as you could. Living inside wasn't really an idea you were hoping to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\"What you heard! It's going to be a game of endurance. Don't worry, it's not like I'll let you have to scavenge around for food. I'll send you small packages of food, and-\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou interrupted: \"That's not really what I was worried about! How long will I have to be in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\"One month should be fine\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt definitely wasn't, and you made sure to make your objections known right away. \"I'd go crazy before two weeks pass! There's no way I'm staying inside for an entire month\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\"Fine. How long do you think you can last? Two weeks?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were glad Abra was giving you a chance to set things to your preferences. While your preference was \"no time at all\", that likely wasn't an option, so instead you decided to reduce the amount as much as possible. \"Less than that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\"If it's less than a week I'll make you set your base camp somewhere you won't like at all\" </span>you were sure she'd fulfill that threat, no doubt. Another reason to make it as few days as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three days\" you wanted to see if she'd accept that. If she did, maybe you could reduce it even more? She didn't, though. Abra's hand tightened around you, she hadn't liked your suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\"You're pushing your luck, idiot. One week\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then...five days\" it was useless to ask for less, you didn't want her to accidentally or intentionally crush you with her hand. Abra thought it for a moment and finally nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\"Okay, five days. I'll be sending you the stuff you need, don't worry about that. I can even make it small like you, see?\"</span> to demonstrate, a small lantern appeared beside you. It seemed she really had intentions of keeping you stocked while you were inside Feraligatr. You disliked Abra, but you were grateful she wasn't going to let you have that bad of a time inside Feraligatr. Having to live for a few days inside him was bad enough, anyway. You took the lantern. \"<span class=\"cdorange\">Are you ready?</span>\" You frowned. If you said no you were sure you were going to be teleported inside Feraligatr already. You took a deep breath of the air. It was all stale and humid, but you knew it was heap better than any air you'd find inside Feraligatr. You nod. Abra petted your head clumsily with a finger. \"<span class=\"cdorange\">You'll be going in now, to your base camp location. Have fun and remember: don't let him find you're inside, and don't dare to leave his body until the time's up</span>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weightlessness invaded you immediately, just for a second, and when that sensation vanished you were assaulted by many new sensations. The temperature around you increased, your feet sank into tissue. You held your lantern, kind of afraid of turning it on, and examined the area with your other senses. The gurgling and groaning from many huge organs around you filled the air, and a fetid smell surrounded you. You cringed and coughed, momentarily overwhelmed by the smell. Great, Abra really meant it when she said your base camp would have to be placed where you wouldn't like it at all. You already weren't looking forward to sleeping somewhere inside Feraligatr's colon. Another reason to be kind of afraid of turning on the lantern, the longer you avoided looking at your new residence, the longer you could hold the illusion you'd be just fine, even if the rest of your senses were screaming you were stuck in the middle of an alligator's large intestine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still were feeling sorry for yourself when you heard a weird noise some distance away from you. You yelped, feeling your heart sinking to your feet, already dreading what it could be. You waited to the place contract, indicating Feraligatr was about to blast you with foul air, or worse -- remains of food were coming your way, for example -- but the noise didn't repeat. You held the lantern up and turned it on, seeing what had made the noise.</span></div></div>",

You're not a fan of that name, but it's not like it really matters. You walk over to the berries and begin eating them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess you don't mind. Wow, you are digging into those berries.

Once on, Cindy picks up the leaves and berries in her other hand and begins walking back to her den. After a while of walking, Cindy reaches a cliff overlooking a small valley surrounded by mountains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See that valley down there? The whole place belonged to my father's trainer waaay back in the day. Unfortunately, the poor guy died of old age, but he left his mansion to my father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy spread her wings, took off at a jog and jumped off the cliff. You closed your eyes until you felt wind hit your face. You opened them to see that Cindy was flying. You laughed nervously. 'Right, she can fly,' you think to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of my father, he's not around anymore. Not because he died or anything, mind you. He just couldn't handle the memories of the old place and gave it to me just last month when I finally evolved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy looked into her hand at you, and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, don't worry, Tiny. As far as I know, I'm the only predator in this whole valley! My dad made sure of that before he left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Cindy was jogging on the ground slowly coming to a stop. Looking over Cindy's clawed fingers showed a large, run down, marble mansion. The place looked like it would have been real nice looking back in the day, however, some charred spots here and there betrayed that look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go, solid ground. And that over there, is the old Mansion De Zard... Just kidding, I don't speak Kalosian. I have no idea what the mansion is actually called.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle at Cindy. Her carefree attitude is exactly what you needed right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy walks into the mansion, sets down the berries in a nearby kitchen, and walks down a long corridor until she reaches a whole in the floor, filled with clean bubbly water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Tiny. Sorry, if this is a bad topic to bring up, but you stink. Let's get that stink off of you and get a bite to eat afterward, that sound good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shout up at her that you couldn't agree more, but remembering she can't hear you, you nod instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Here, let me just set you down and I'll just use my finger to make a small puddle for you. Followed by some hotspring water... And there! A spring just for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile widely, jump into the hot spring water, and instantly regret it. The water was burning hot! You swim over to the side and look at your body. It's bright red from the heat. You frown and look at Cindy, who is already enjoying the hot spring with her back to you. You dip your toe into the spring water to see if the water is still as hot. It is a little more cooled down, so you get in a bit more. After about ten minutes of getting used to the hot water, you finally clean yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the kitchen you sit, now with some leaves for clothes, and wait for Cindy to be done with dinner. You are starving and are just dying to try some Deep Fried Cheri Berry that Cindy talked you into. After about another five minutes, Cindy finally showed up to put food on the table. There was one big tray and you were excited!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? Dig in Tiny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy picks up a berry and after licking it a lot, swallows it whole. You look at the berries and dive into them, not literally, but you do try. Cindy, laughs at your eagerness and plucks another berry from the plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope you don't mind sharing, Tiny! These are my favorite!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter stuffing that berry in her mouth she swallows and licks her lips, going for another...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You manage to get on top of a berry and start chomping down on it. You get a small chunk of the berry eaten before you feel full. You sit back and enjoy the berry juice soaking into you before suddenly the berry is lifted from the tray. You look around and notice that Cindy's claw is lifting it up. You feel slightly nervous at this, until she opens her maw to devour your berry. Now you feel terrified! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Charizard's mouth was covered in saliva, with saliva strings connecting everything inside to eachother. Looking closer would show rather clean teeth, with various berry, meat, and other mush towards the back of the mouth, between those teeth. A steady wisp of steam arose at the back of the throat, signifying hotter temperatures deeper inside. Finally, the tongue looked nice and red, meaning Cindy was very healthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you mentally noted all of what you saw, Cindy's tongue began licking the berry. When she was done, she stuffed the berry in her maw and began swishing it around. This one had tasty juices she was eager to taste. When she was done, Cindy leaned her head back, and swallowed it whole. She felt the berry go down her throat as she grabbed another berry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe berries made a barely noticeable bulge on her throat, and absolutely no bulge in her thinner-than-average stomach. Speaking of which, her other clawed hand was busy rubbing that stomach now. Cindy was about to stick another berry in her mouth, when she suddenly burped. She patted her stomach and, saying \"excuse me\", ate the berry and reached for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, however,  experienced something entirely different. You were staring into Cindy's maw, when suddenly,  everything went dark! You were about to scream in fear, but the tongue had other plans, throwing you all over the mouth. Just when you couldn't handle it anymore, gravity changed and you started sliding down the tongue and toward the throat. You tried to grab ahold of the giant taste buds, and actually succeeded, until the berry came and dragged you down with it. You fell into the throat, and with a slight, but incredibly loud GLRK, you began to slip down the throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you fell, the throat walls were too big to squeeze you, so you just fell into the heated darkness. When you landed, it was a soft, squishy landing. Looking around showed that there was light here, coming from below all the piles of meat and berries. Wait, meat? You haven't seen her eat meat today? Is this a crop? It makes sense... Charizard is half flying type. You sigh in relief. You are safe, for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy ate the last berry on the tray before standing up and putting it over by some other dirty dishes. She had a Blastoise who cleaned her dishes, though Cindy insisted he not. She didn't need her father's butler to look after her! When she showed him that she was capable of looking after Tiny, maybe he'd believe her. But that will have to wait until he came back from fishing. Until then, she had a tiny creature to care for and protect... now where did he go?</span></div></div>",

She checked by the table again, but found nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiny? Where did you go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, inside the Charizard's own gut, you and the countless food Cindy has eaten sense yesterday are thrown around inside her crop. You are so dizzy that when everything stops for a moment, you don't know which way is up or down. Just as you think you've righted yourself, the crop squeezes some meat and berries into the actual stomach. You look down to see hot fumes, mostly digested fish Pokemon bones, and bright glowing magma-like stomach acid. You gasp as the berry you're on begins to fall inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Cindy begins moving around again at that moment and your berry rolls inside the stomach as you get thrown into a crop wall. Then the light diminishes some, as the sphincter closes tightly. You look around, only you and some berries are left inside the crop. You need to find a way out, soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside, unaware of what's going on inside her, Cindy closes a broken down fridge and tries to calm herself. Tiny has to be around here, the only other option is that she ate the poor creature, and she knew that didn't happen. She would have felt it and tasted it in her mouth, wouldn't she? Cindy looked out a window, and noticed the sun was noticeably lower. She has been searching for an hour, and still nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gurgle from her stomach told her to just go to bed and look for Tiny tomorrow, but she couldn't. She had to find the little thing before it was too late. Another growl from her stomach made her realize just how tired she was. She looked down at her belly and rubbed it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe going to bed would be a smart idea? She'd be able to think better in the morning after all! But, what if she had eaten Tiny!? It would be digested while she slept, assuming it wasn't already. And that was IF it was in her body in the first place. If not, she would just be throwing up for no reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright little guy, if you're in my belly-\"</span></div></div>",

It doesn't work. Being a lizard, means she can't upchuck unless absolutely necessary. She tries again, and again, and again, but nothing is happening. Cindy stands up. She needs a plan B.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Cindy's crop, you watch as the whole place is shook around. When everything is calm again, two more berries slid into the stomach. There is only one left, not including you. When that passes on, so will you. You punch the side of the crop for the 12th time since you fell in here. You need out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy walks back into the mansion. Maybe Blanc, her father's Blastoise butler and friend could help her. Only problem was that he was off fishing for the weekend and wouldn't be back until tomorrow evening. Cindy walked into her bedroom inside the mansion. She was rubbing her gut sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With no way to get you out, you could get hurt... I have to do something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy laid down on her rock slab that functions as her bed. It was cold, but she didn't care. A gurgle from her stomach told her to empty her crop. She refused with all her might, she would never-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cough cough cough\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy's thoughts were interrupted as something forced it's way into her throat from her crop. It felt small, so small that Cindy had to focus to feel it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Tiny? Is that you in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Cindy's chest, behind a wall of scales, flesh, and muscles, you slowly climbed out of your \"Protector's\" throat. When she laid down, this had thrown you directly in front of Cindy's esophagus sphincter. You had taken advantage of the situation she was in, and climbed through her sphincter, which was loosened up from all the dry heaving. Now you just needed to hope she didn't swallow you back down...</span></div></div>",

She uses her long tongue to drag you further in her maw. The draconic teeth are worrying if you look at them but Cindy makes sure to keep you safely away from them as you enter. Once you are fully in her mouth, Cindy closes it and leaves you resting on her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith only a little light coming in through the teeth, you sit up and look around. You are surprised to see that you only take up about two taste buds on her tongue. The rest of her mouth is gigantic! The teeth are all bigger than or just as tall as you, making you feel really... tiny. Suddenly, Cindy's nickname for you makes sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go to stand, which is something you have plenty of room for, when Cindy's tongue shifts, causing you to fall face first on top of it. Before you can get back up, Cindy uses her tongue to squeeze you a little. You yelp in surprise as you're lifted of the ground while being wrapped up in tongue. You laugh and begin fighting back to have a little fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Cindy smiles. She is so glad you decided to do this. She feels all giddy with excitement! She would be spewing flames if not for you being in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter around ten minutes passed, you and Cindy got ready to sleep. Cindy tucked you under her tongue as if it were a blanket, and she rested on her belly, with her tail and head tucked closer to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for doing this Tiny. It really means a lot to me. I think you and I could be close friends. See ya in the morning!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laughed as her tongue bounced on you as she spoke. When she was done talking, you rubbed her tongue. You felt the same. And with that, you two fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cindy sat up as morning shed light on her mansion, which bled in through the cracks of the mansion walls. After yawning, and scratching her belly, Cindy felt something stir under her tongue. It was you, and although you hadn't woken up yet, you definitely smelled Cindy's morning breath. Cindy scooped you up onto her tongue and extended her tongue out of her mouth. There you slept, tiny as ever. Cindy dropped you in her hand softly and went to start he morning routine. A small drink from the waterfall in the room next to her kitchen, a bath in the hotspring, and finally some breakfast. All while you slept soundly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo soundly, in fact, that Cindy would switch between holding you comfortably and putting you on her snout. Mostly, you laid on her snout, as she could easily see you there without worrying if you got hurt since her saliva stuck you to her warm scales. As she was \"cooking\" breakfast, you began to stir a bit and sit up. When you did, you were met with a shock. You weren't in Cindy's maw, but rather on top of her basketball stadium sized snout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chuckle below told you that Cindy loved your surprised face. You turned to face her better and gasped. Her eyes were huge! You hadn't really noticed how big they were until now. Two big blue orbs stared right at you. They were friendly, but you were still scared for a moment. Until you saw how beautiful those eyes were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled and waved at her. She chuckled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there Tiny, how are you this fine morning? Good I hope?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod happily. You try shouting that your wondering why you're not in her mouth, but all she gives you is a confused look. She then pulls a roasted Rattata into view and begins eating it, talking between mouthfuls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you trying to do there Tiny? Are you trying to tell me something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, and after a game of charades, you get her to understand what you're trying to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Why are you not in my mouth? Well, I had to clean my mouth out. Don't worry, I can tell by that look you're giving that you're wondering how I do that. Well I get some cold spring water from a small waterfall in the water room next to the kitchen. Then I swish it around and use my claws to pick food out from between my teeth. My father taught me how to be clean and respectful, but also not to be a pushover. I had to beat Blanc, my father's butler, in a battle just to so he'd give me the mansion. Oh! Speaking of Blanc, he'll be home this afternoon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Cindy questioningly. Blanc? Who is that? Just as Cindy finishes her roasted Rattata, she looks at you. She must have read your mind as she starts explaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, I haven't told you about Blanc or my father... sorry about that. I'll explain later when Blanc gets home. Right now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy's clawed pinky went up to her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I think I need some help getting this meat out from between my teeth. Maybe I have a stick around here somewhere...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think for a second as she begins looking for a stick. Couldn't you just go inside her mouth and fix that? After waving your arms and getting Cindy's attention, you played another game of charades to tell her your idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, that's not a bad idea, Tiny! Yeah, let's do that! You're certainty more tasty than a filthy stick, that's for sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy peeled you off of her snout and licked your entire body before placing you on her tongue and retracting it inside her open maw. Inside, you saw a bit of fire appear from behind you. She had closed her maw and you saw her teeth, which were encased in flames!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about the fire, Tiny. I'm using Fire Fang, so you can see better in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. Turning around, you definitely saw the mouth was lit up much brighter then when the maw was closed. The teeth at the back of the maw weren't on fire, weather that was on purpose or not, you had no idea. As you walked closer toward Cindy's back teeth, you noticed that the saliva drenching you was keeping you nice and cool in the hot environment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you reached her back teeth and began pulling bone pieces and meat scraps out from between her teeth. It was hard work, but your hands were definitely better at cleaning than any stick she could find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Cindy was humming a tune and using Fire Punch to catch her hands on fire. When they were, she began \"cooking\" some berries for you to eat when you where done in her maw. She could feel you hard at work inside, pulling everything out from between her teeth. Her Fire Fang never extended that far back and was glad you were willing to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you were done with her left teeth, you walked across the tongue, which was eager for a taste, and got to work on her right teeth. However, you weren't paying attention, as pulling on a bone chunk lodged in between two teeth, proved to be a bad idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy's head shot up in pain as her teeth flared red with flames! She roared as loud as she could, letting out a blast of flame from her wide open maw! You, before getting set on fire, dove under her tongue as the flames shot by. It kept you from being hit completely by the fire, but some of it still hit you. Luckily, Cindy's saliva kept you from any harm, but you definitely felt the heat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Cindy lowed her maw back down, she gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TINY! ARE YOU OK!? Ohnonononono!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly began patting her tongue and rubbing it to show you were fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiny!? Oh, you are ok, phew! Sorry about that, here I'll get you out and we can try something else, instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lightly kick the tongue to show that you don't like that plan, you can be more careful and get the job done!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? You want to try to help anyway? Well, ok... Just try and be careful. As you saw, I don't handle mouth pain too well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you go back to work, much more carefully this time. Outside, Cindy rubs her bottom right jaw and sets back to cooking her berries, which luckily had landed on the table in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you slowly get to work cleaning between Cindy's last two farthest teeth, you take note of how close you are to her throat, one wrong move and it's yesterday's berry dinner all over again. You slowly reach out and pull on a very thin bone. Little did you know, this bone's tip was wedged into a crack on the tooth to your right. Just as you pull the bone free, you know you made a mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy's maw shoots open and points toward the ceiling again! You gasp and scramble toward the tongue again, but you were too slow as...</span></div></div>",

Charizards must have fire producing glands in their neck somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you're squeezed into Cindy's crop. You finally hear the flames she was breathing die down up above. You waited a second before doing anything, but when that second was over you mad sure to announce your presence within Cindy's body. The moment you did, you heard her stomach bubble below and felt her hand rest upon her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no... did I swallow you again by accident? Wait... MY FIRE BREATH! ARE YOU OK? ARE YOU BURNT!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly begin to rub her insides in an attempt to not get her worked up. It works and Cindy's crop walls descend on you comfortingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take that as 'you're fine'? Well if that's the case, then I'll bring you back up here in a bit. My throat is so dry and crisp from all that fire breathing. You can wait for just a little bit inside me, can't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rub in agreement and wait. After about thirty minutes or so, you doze off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you wake up, you are floating on a berry in a sea of saliva and water. There are other berries as well in here, but you're just surprised to see how full Cindy's crop was. It wasn't extending out in any way, just full. You nibble off the berry you're on and rub a nearby stomach wall. Upon doing so, a loud snoring echoed through the chamber. Cindy was fast asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wondered what time of day it had to be for her to be sleeping. Did she forget you were inside her? Did she just fall asleep for a nap? You had no idea, but you needed to find out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you were about to try and wake Cindy up, the crop began shifting. Cindy was asleep, which meant that her crop would empty into her stomach! You screamed as you fell, until suddenly...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A loud and heavy burp from Cindy's stomach sends you flying right back into her mouth. Once there, the snores are definitely louder. However, this only means that escape is easier. You hop out if Cindy's maw to see that the sun is setting and that Cindy is nowhere near the mansion. She's still within the mountainous ring, but far from home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around at the area nearby. Cindy seems to have fallen asleep rather abruptly as she's laying stomach down on cold dirt. One hand in front of her as if she had been protecting herself from an attack. Behind you a small stream leads into a barely noticeable cavern in the mountain. An underground pond perhaps? Assuming it doesn't go straight through the mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at the sky again to see that it's almost completely dark out. You run over to Cindy and try waking her up, but nothing works. A cold breeze blows by and your teeth begin to chatter. You crawl back into Cindy's maw for warmth for the night. Nothing you can do until morning, unfortunately. You curl up under Cindy's tongue, give a few friendly pats to it, and then fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up some time later. After rubbing your eyes you look around to see that you are still inside Cindy's maw. She seems to be awake as you feel her body shake slightly with each step she takes. You rub her tongue happily as if it were a happy Lillipup. When you're done, it tackles you eagerly running up and down your chest and face. When it's done tasting you, the tongue scoops you up on top of it and leads you outside of the now wide open Charizard maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter your eyes adjust to the light, you see that the tongue has deposited you onto Cindy's snout. You see the mansion off in the distance in front of you. It seems like Cindy was walking home when you woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around to see Cindy's giant light blue eyes looking at you innocently. You never noticed that her eyes sparkle so beautifully in the sunlight. Wait, why are thinking about that? That sounds like something someone would say if they found their \"true love\" as movies put it. And you're not in love with Cindy. You can't be! She's a Pokemon, you can't be in love with her! Not to mention that she is a giant dragon capable of eating you in one bite!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you're pulled from your thoughts as she begins talking. Luckily the saliva you've been sleeping in since last night is keeping you stuck to her snout instead of flying away with one opening of her maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there Tiny. I'm glad you're safe. When I woke up this morning, I was worried that I had digested you. Imagine my surprise when I found out that you were sleeping in my mouth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe licked her lips as a sign that you still taste great, licking you in the process. Then her face went serious as she continued talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about my sudden nap last night Tiny, it wasn't meant to happen. You see I was...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy explained that as you slept in her crop yesterday, she went off on a hunt. She would've stayed home and had some left over Rattata in her fridge, but she was bored and needed something to do. However, when she came across a strange Pokemon that she had never encountered before, things took a turn for the worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, all I wanted to do was help them out because they looked like they were having trouble with the water or something. When I showed up, I was blasted with some sort of hypnotic move. I tried to protect myself, but... I'm sorry for putting you in serious danger. I forget that not all Pokemon are nice Pokemon. Especially the Noibats and Noiverns up on Shade Mountain. You know, the place where I found you a few days ago. They suuuck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Cindy finishes that drawn out word. You hear a creaking behind you. You were so focused on the story Cindy was telling that you forgot about the mansion. It seems like you two have finally managed to get to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In fact, I don't think I ever explained to you why...I...Was not expecting this....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasp as you see that the mansion has been quite thoroughly cleaned on the inside. Sure there are still black spots from burn marks and holes in the building caused by wear and tear through the years, but the floor is the place with the most noticeable changes. Where once there was trash, leaves and other miscellaneous stuff, there is now clean marble and polished granite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh Crap? That can't be good...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n???: \"Young master Cindy? Is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy quickly grabs you and starts looking for a place to hide you. You look at her nervously. Why does she need to hide you? Who is it that she's hiding you from?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you have a chance to even think about more questions, Cindy quickly shoves you in her mouth and swallows you down rather roughly. As you're being squeezed down Cindy's throat, you hear Cindy begin talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy: \"Yeah, Blanc, it's me, sorry I wasn't home when you showed up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Cindy had just swallowed you. Your bulge was still in her throat when a Pokemon came around the corner out of the hallway. It was a very old looking Blastoise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlanc: \"It doesn't bother me at all my Lord. Though, if you don't mind me asking, what were you doing? Am I to prepare for a new addition in the family tree? Your father will be so happy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy: \"What? No! No, no of course not. Well maybe. But not in the way you're thinking. I gotta get to my room now. Got stuff I gotta do. It was great talking to you though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy runs off past her father's butler and in to the hall he came out of. After going down it and into her room, she swiftly closes the door behind her. She presses her back against it and slides down to sit on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy: \"It's a good thing I don't have hair or fur, because if I did, I would have pulled it out years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy then hears a gurgle from her stomach. She rests a hand on her slightly chubby belly and begins rubbing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me a minute Tiny, I'll get you out of there, somewhat cleaned up, and explain what's going on. Just, give me a minute to think.\"</span></div></div>",

That only took about five minutes, the rest was spent with her pacing back and forth in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy: \"Where to begin, where to begin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would shout up to her that it's fine and just calm down, but you already tried that and it worked just as fine as any other time you tried getting her to hear your voice. Which is to say, not very well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy: \"Oh! I got it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh in relief. Cindy turns back to you and sits down on her bed beside you. You were far enough away from where she sat to not worry about being squished, but it still made your heart skip a beat when she sat so close to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy: \"Alright, so look. When I was a little girl, my father would tell me stories...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy goes on to talk about how her father and his trainer used to live here. One day, however, the trainer got sick and died, leaving his home to the only family he had left, his Charizard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Charizard, Cindy's father, went on to establish a nest within the mansion and area within the circle of mountains. This area being where you and Cindy have spent the last few days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far, you kinda knew most of this stuff. But you weren't about to tell her that. Not that she could hear you anyway. What she said next though, was interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer father went on to leave the nest and flew for days up to the North, following the flying type Pokemon. When he got there, he met Cindy's mother, another Charizard. She had been wild her whole life, while Cindy's father was still new to being wild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two had chemistry together, as Cindy's father was tough and stern, yet soft when you got to know him. Cindy's mother was beautiful and competitive, but didn't really act nice to anybody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two would work together to help Pokemon and people in need. One time, they saved a Wartortle from a fishing boat. That Wartortle later evolved and became Cindy's father's butler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while later, the three Pokemon all took off South to end up right back here. Eventually, Cindy was born and became the heir to her father's estate. Which meant the mansion and the area within the mountains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy: \"Any questions so far?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had questions but when you went to say them you remembered she couldn't hear you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy: \"Hahaha, I'm messing with you. You can ask Blanc questions about that time. I wasn't born for most of it, and when I was, I was too young.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod in understanding and gesture for her to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy: \"So anyway...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy went on to grow up in the mansion. Her mother wanted her to be raised as she was, in the wild on her own, while Cindy's father wanted her to be raised in the mansion, where he could protect her. In the end, they settled on an idea they were both ok with. That being that they would train her to hunt, defend herself, and cook. Afterward, they would go back North and leave Blanc to watch over Cindy here at the mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Cindy evolved into Charmeleon, her mother demanded she get a mate so as to continue the bloodline. Cindy's father disagreed. He wanted her to wait until she evolved again to worry about that. However, Blanc heard this piece of information, and ran with it. He encouraged her to get a mate to please her parents. Since then, Cindy was always hounded for not having one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, last year, she evolved once more and was convinced that the Noiverns on Shade Mountain would accept her. But they didn't. They mocked her for not knowing that they didn't share the same egg group. In her sadness, she went down to a river and wept. However, she smelled something terrible. When she went to investigate, she found you snoring in that hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy: \"And well, you know the rest from there. But now you know why I hid you from Blanc. If he saw you... He would tell my father and both my parents would try to eat you just to get you out of the picture. Yeah, I'd be making that face to. I would be so disappointed if they digested you and I didn't, after all. Hahaha! Your face! Anyway, that's why I have to explain to him who you are first. That being, a friend, nothing... nothing else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy almost sounded sad with that last part. Did she worry that she would always be alone? You pat the base of her tail as a way of trying to cheer her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy: \"Thanks Tiny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reaches down and picks you back up. Once you're back up to her eye level, she licks you cutely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy: \"Well, Blanc won't be willing to listen until later tonight. Which means we got time to kill. Wanna do something fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod vigorously. You could use some fun right about now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy: \"That's what I wanted to hear! Let's see... Ok. I got two ideas. Since you've been in there so much, you can explore inside me for a couple hours. Or, we could go find out what happened with that Pokemon last night. Whatever you choose first, just know that I want to do the other one later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy: \"So which is it? Explore? Or Investigate?\"</span></div></div>",

Though she could handle the cold rock just fine, she began to feel uncomfortable and rolled in her sleep. Causing Cindy to lay on her back instead of her belly. While laying on her back, her mouth opened widely, allowing her tongue to hang out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Cindy's open mouth, the saliva inside caused you to come free of your position under the tongue. This caused you to slid directly into Cindy's throat. With the assistance of gravity, you began to slide all the way down her esophagus, and into her crop. After another thirty minutes went by, Cindy shifted again. This time, she laid on her belly again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden movement of Cindy's body caused you to slid straight into her gurgling stomach. The heat and steam from inside would have woken you up, if your body hadn't already adjusted to the heat of the crop above. You slid right into the bubbling acid as you slept. You didn't have time to even process the wet burning on your body before you were dragged under completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning, after a restless night, Cindy woke up and stretched before smacking her lips and scratching her belly. She then burped a very loud burp that left saliva and drool all over the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, excuse me Tiny. I'm sorry you had to get caught up in the middle of that. I don't know what I even ate to burp that big anyway! Here, let me get you out of my mouth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter licking around in her maw a while, Cindy realized that you weren't in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funny... Tiny! Where are you!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a gurgle from her gut rang out in response. She looked down at her belly for a moment before it clicked. She had digested you in her tossing and turning last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorst. Morning. Ever.</span></div></div>",

However, Cindy still has her maw open expectantly. You instead rub her maw with a scared smile on your face as she looks down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Oh no! I scared you with your trip into me earlier didn't I? I'm so sorry, Tiny! Here, you can sleep over here so you feel more secure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy then got up from her bed and walked over to a broken fish tank. Inside were all those leaves from the berries earlier! She must have moved them here for you as a bed... but then why did she want you over there in the first place? Did Cindy think you would agree to sleeping in her maw? If so, then she must have set this up as a plan B...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There ya go Tiny, a little nest of your own. If you need anything, there's an old Chingling statue that was in this thing. I set it right over here, to the left-your right-of the nest, ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod. You can tell by the look on her face and the tone of her voice, that Cindy is upset you chose leaves instead of her. Before you can say or do anything, not that she could hear you, Cindy gives you a lick along your belly to your face and smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight Tiny! See ya in morning!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that she turns back around, resets her bed on fire, and lays down on the heated rock. Cindy's head is facing away from you, and you hear a wiser of some sobbing, before it turns into snoring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay on the leaves, a thinner leaf acting as your blanket. The only light in the room currently being Cindy's tail flame, which barely lit up your area. You closed your eyes feeling bad about what you did. You just couldn't control your fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, you woke up still covered in the leaves you had fallen asleep in. You get up and stretch before looking at Cindy's bed and noticing her gone. Where was she? You walk over to the Chingling bell statue and ring it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore too long, you hear a shout from the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a minute! I'm putting breakfast on! If you want down, just jump! There's a pile of leaves that should cushion your fall!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down the side of where you are. Sure enough, a pile of leaves are set there. You look at the gap, and wonder if you could even make it without getting hurt? Before you can change your mind, your left hand slips and you fall toward the leaf pile. You close your eyes, but when you don't feel wind whipping your body you open them. You're so small and light that you're slowly floating down to the leaves. When you land, you shout triumphantly, pumping your fist into the air! You then get up and run over to the doorway. A hallway goes from left to right. A smell of cooked berries fills your nostrils. You decide to try and find the kitchen, but... which way is it?</span></div></div>",

Cindy refused to swallow anything until you were back in her mouth. However, at some point, she stopped paying attention to you, and so she couldn't feel you in her throat anymore. Because of this, she assumed you were in her mouth. She leaned up and went to grab you, when suddenly, she began choking on the saliva that had built up in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Cindy's throat, you could see small waterfalls of saliva cascading down the sides of her throat. As long as you avoided those, you were sure you could make it. Suddenly, just as your hand made contact with Cindy's tongue, she leaned up. This caused all the saliva in her mouth to wash down her throat and take you along with it! Determined to live, you grabbed ahold of the opening to her lungs, just to avoid falling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy cleared her throat with an \"Ahem,\" and breathed out a small flame from her mouth. She then licked around her maw, searching for you. She didn't  manage to find anything, and suddenly heard a pleased gurgle from her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! I didn't swallow him back down, did I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou meanwhile sat on a berry overlooking an acid lake. There was no way out from here, suddenly the stomach walls began to move from side to side. Cindy was rubbing her stomach and knew you were in there. You placed a hand on the stomach wall nearest to you and rubbed it back. Then a gurgle gave out as your berry sunk below the surface. You swam around for only a second before the acid dragged you under too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Cindy licked her lips and rubbed her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry Tiny. I thought you were safe in my mouth. I will always remember you when I rub my stomach.\"</span></div></div>",

Goodnight little guy, I hope you aren't actually in there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Cindy walks off down the hallway and into a destroyed bedroom. The bed has been crushed by a giant rock long ago. After shooting fire at the rock from her mouth, Cindy curls up onto the slab. She then empties her crop into her stomach and places a hand on her belly. In one last attempt to make sure you aaren'tin there, she jiggles her belly a little, but only feels berries and Magikarp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess that settles that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy smiles, closes her eyes and sleeps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou however, had just barely heard her words to you over the gurgles below. When things start shaking again, you expected to be release. Instead, you heard fire pass by overhead after that, habit more shaking. You were just about to shout and ask what was happening, when the crop squeezed you and the berries into the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou expected to be digested instantly, but instead you swam up, got on top a berry and noticed that your skin was peeling off from the amount of heat inside the stomach. Cindy's mouth had been hot, her throat hotter, and her crop even hotter than that. But Cindy's stomach felt like it was as hot as the sun. You could tell you were already dehydrated before, and this heat made it even worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the stomach wall pushed you and the berry into the acid, squeezing you. When you surfaced, you heard Cindy say something else before the heat finally hit you too hard, and you sunk below the acid...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy woke up and yawned loudly. She got up and went to the kitchen, after eating a berry or two for breakfast, Cindy began to look for you. She looked around for you for most of the day before she felt the call to nature. When she was done with her business she turned to cover the whole she had dug, when she noticed something. A tiny skeleton among the waste.</span></div></div>",

She giggled and rubbed her belly softly. If she focused really hard, she could feel you in her crop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you feel great in there! Sorry about eating you, I just couldn't help myself! Don't worry about being digested, I promise not to send you any further. Now, I got some tidying up to do if I'm going to have you stay here. So if you need me, just struggle and I'll see what's wrong. In the meantime, try to relax, get some sleep, or something. I'll let you out in a couple hours when it's time for bed, ok? Ok.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Cindy, you listened to her body around you. It was nice and soothing. Suddenly, You could hear Cindy talking. It was hard to hear from the noises inside her but you picked up most of what she said. You decided that since she knew you were inside her, you would take her advice and take a nap. You snuggle into the flesh next to you and begin to fall asleep. As Cindy's stomach gurgles below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy went around the mansion picking up things and cleaning off cobwebs. Every once in a while she would squeeze a few berries into her stomach and make sure you were ok. Then she would continue cleaning and tidying up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to her father's butler Blanc, the place was usually tidy. Blanc normally kept the mansion in a pseudo-nice-looking manner. However, Blanc had left to fish for the weekend and wouldn't be back until tomorrow evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused the mansion to go into disarray due to the fact that Cindy didn't usually clean up after herself. Which, now that she met you, she was working hard to fix. Cindy didn't want you to have to worry about objects on the floor if you wanted to walk around the mansion, after all. A couple hours passed and the sun finally went down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew! All of this hard work sure is a bunch of... hard work! Well I guess it's time for bed. Yawn! Eh, yeah, it definitely is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy walked into an old room where a big slab of rock had crushed a former human bed. Cindy breathed fire on it to warm it up, lied down on top of it, and was about to close her eyes...</span></div></div>",

On one hand, you were alive, but on the other, you were trapped inside her Stomach. Once something fell in her stomach, it didn't leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy continued to rub her stomach. Her friend was right under her scales, but she could never see him again. She let loose a tear that fell on her belly, before sizzling up almost instantly from the heat within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround this time, you wake up covered in a mixture of saliva, acid, and sweat, especially sweat. Looking around shows that Cindy passed you into her stomach while you slept. You are about to freak out, when you hear a distant sobbing come from up above the stomach sphincter, which is high above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiny? You're a-awake? I'm really *sniff* sorry I d-did this to you. Maybe one day y-you'll *sob* come to forgive me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA big hand print outline appears on the stomach wall next to you. You place your palm on top of it. You do forgive her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Tiny!? You... you forgive me... I don't deserve it! I really don't! B-But... thank you. I think you'll be digested when that bone is done dissolving. Which will be sometime today I'm sure. I-I'm... sorry I dragged you into this. I thought that I could take care of you in there but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rub her stomach wall. 'It's okay! I don't blame you, really!' You try to convey your thoughts, but you don't know how to. Suddenly, Cindy begins talking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! I can eat more fish Pokemon! Or even just anything with bones! That will bye you some time! Oh and I can drink water to make it less hot in there! Tiny, hold on! You're not going to dye on me yet!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasp. You didn't know you meant this much to Cindy. Suddenly everything starts sloshing everywhere as Cindy flies down the hall to the kitchen. You cling to your rapidly digesting fish bone. Then the acid sprays everywhere as Cindy lands. You get hit by a drop or two, but nothing too serious, it only burns what was left of your clothes away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh in relief, having survived the acid bath. You then notice a sound of running water. A waterfall? The sphincter above you then opens as nice, cold, river water flows through and into the stomach. As the water hit the acid, it hissed and produced smoke that began to rise to the top of the stomach. The glow of the magma-like acid quickly began to dim until the stomach was just bright enough to see the other side of it from where you were. The slow bubbling of the acid was now left to a very slow churn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cautiously dipped a toe into the acid. A slight tingle could be felt, as if your toe had been dunked into some soda. You smiled and jumped into the tingling liquid. You swam around until you heard Cindy laughing above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You feel like you're having a good time in my belly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe poked her belly with a claw, causing the whole organ to ripple a bit and the liquid to slosh. The sloshing caused a bit of the glow to diminish even more. But you didn't even notice as you swam in the sloshing liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That should give you an hour or two of safety until I eat. And don't try to go any lower! Not that I think you'll fit, you're still too big to go further down without having the meat melted off your bones I think. But just so you know, if you go any further, I can't keep my body from treating you like any other chunk of meat. And I can't bring you back up either. I tried once when I had first swallowed a living prey. They were shouting in pain so much, that when I tried to release them from guilt, it didn't work. No matter how small you are, my sphincter leading to my crop is one way. And that way is down. If you were still in my crop I could've brought you out with some effort, but you're not... I think you'll just have to live inside my stomach for a while. At least until I think of a way to get you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy stopped talking to burp. The smoke at the top of the stomach exiting through and into the crop as it wasn't solid like you were. You smiled at her burp. Cindy's voice made it clear that she was still trying to take care of you from all the way in her stomach. You rubbed her stomach wall a bit more, causing another burp out of her. Another poke from Cindy, however, sent you under the liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take that for making me gassy you pain in the gut! Now, get to the center, because I know you're probably thirsty. Her comes some more water!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see a small bit of water fall from above. You really don't want to, but you are thirsty so you open your mouth and drink a bit of it. It tastes like saliva, but you'll take what you can get. After you're done, you swim over to a wall, pat it, and get back on your bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Cindy feels your pats and sees this a way to tell her you done with the water. She closes her crop back up, and opens the years old refrigerator. Inside, sat a few small cryogonal, Pokemon known for looking like snow flakes, and asked them to hand her a few Rattata for breakfast. They comply happily and Cindy takes the Rattata with a thank you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the fridge, Cindy rubs her stomach and licks her lips. Inside that very stomach, you cling to your bony raft as the rubbing causes waves to appear. You cling tighter to your bone, but the waves die off quickly. Your glad your friend takes care of you while inside the most dangerous part of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look out below! Here comes breakfast! Hope you're ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy shoves a full Rattata into her mouth, swallowing it down easily. She then looks down to her belly. She's still worried about you being in her most dangerous part of her body. The very core of it. She leans down, licks her belly lovingly, and whispers a few words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be safe in there, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy then swallows two more Rattata to hold her over later. Then she goes outside, spreads her wings and flies off to hunt. All while, you swim around the Rattata inside her. Unknowingly, helping her stomach digest the food while the top of the acids have been neutralized.</span></div></div>",

After walking inside the mansion, she noticed a smell. A smell she remembered well. It was the smell of the Ocean! She looked around the mansion seeing her dishes fully clean, and her bed freshly polished. The cleaning from yesterday must not have been good enough as she saw Blanc on all fours blasting the wall and floor with water. A square sponge hanging out of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy: \"Blanc! You're home! I can't believe you got here so early! What are you doing here? I thought you were fishing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlanc: \"Calmness, Lord Cindy, I ran out of room in my baskets for anymore fish. So I decided to surprise you with an early visit. Now, if I may, Lord Cindy, what made you clean the hallways, hmm? Did your father stop by while I was gone? Or did you have another Charizard over? Should I be looking forward to tiny Lords?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy: \"A male Charizard? Here? Ha! You're hilarious! The only thing nearby is the Noiverns up Shade Mountain. And they never come down into my father's valley anyway. In fact-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlanc: \"So did you try to talk to the Noiverns? I'm sure the leader's son would accept your hand in mating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy: \"Yes I did. But they weren't interested in me and threw me out. Which- \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy brought a hand to her belly. She would drink water down for you as soon as she was done. However, before she could finish, Blanc interrupted her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlanc: \"Threw you out? Well, I'm sorry to hear that Lord Cindy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy: \"I'm not, trust me. I heard a Noibat torture it's prey like some kind of monster! Anyway, when I was up there, I found a small creature up there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlanc: \"A small creature? A Joltic perhaps? Or Ribombee?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy: \"No, not a Pokemon! Sorta like... a Machop or Gardevoire. But not a Pokemon, and really tiny. Like prey for tiny Pokemon even!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlanc: \"Oh? Well, what did it do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy: \"Well that's the thing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy: \"-And now it's just sort of in there, trapped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlanc: \"I see... And has Tiny moved since this morning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy: \"Yeah, but I think it's asleep. They can't handle extremely high temperatures, and my stomach is full of that. Do you know of a way to get him out of me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlanc: Hmm, I don't think I do. My deepest apologies. I believe he's just a part of your digestive system now. Like when Pidgey eat stones to help grind up Metapods. He is there to help your body process foods.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy: \"Huh? How would he do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlanc: \"By swimming around when you drink water. I remember you when you were but a humble Charmander, not liking water due to it giving you indigestion. But did you get that earlier? When you drank the stream water from the water room right there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy: \"No, I never felt that. I was too worried about Tiny to even really think about the water... ARE YOU SAYING HE HELPS MY STOMACH DIGEST STUFF WHEN I HAVE INDIGESTION?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlanc: \"Tis' only but a theory. One heavyhanded with salt, my lord\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy placed both hands on her belly and started to rub. You helped out her digestive system without knowing it! Or maybe you did? Either way, she was glad you were in there. Though she wished she could get you out from time to time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day, you swam around inside your flooded home. It seems that, according to what Cindy told you, you were now a vital piece in her digestive system. Another \"body part\" almost. One she never knew she needed. You were excited for this, it meant being in here had been a good thing the whole time! You were happy to swim around in her belly broth and stir up some burps for your protector turned predator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Cindy sat in her hot spring. She was enjoying the feeling you made her stomach feel when you swam around inside. She released a stream of fire from her mouth in joy. Then turned toward her gut and began licking it all over, which you felt inside. She rubbed her belly lovingly as she burped loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, she drank more water for the night, heated her bed up, gave one final lick to her belly for the night and crawled onto her slab to rest. It had been quite the day. She tucked her tail and head toward her chest and uttered one final sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you, Tiny\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yawned inside her belly. Resting inside a Rattata skull. You poked your hand out of an eye socket and rubbed her stomach wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I love you too.'</span></div></div>",

So you pick where you sleep tonight.\" she says. Then she carries you to her bed and sits down, setting you on her lap.

Light was blocked off and you were trapped. \"Oh man, not good, im as dead as a snack right now.\" You were breathing quit heavily, hearing the twos conversation thoughed muffled by the charizards flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Char, charizard char?\" You heard the liard ask suddenly, \"Ahhh, Venu, Venu.\" The grasped claw opened and you were now sitting in a hand, almost perfectly sized for you. You stared up at an intimadatingly huge Charizard, shaking in his hands and then gazing over to the Venusaur, feeling slightly embaressed from the experience you just had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to plead with the two. \"Oh, please, please don't eat me, i know you probably don't understand, but im no good as food!\" Th charizard looked at you with surprise as the other Pokemon chuckled, know noticing his length and quickly gazing away. You stared into the deep blue eyes of the firey bohemoth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down human, were not here to eat you.\" You mouth gaped open as the charizard had just spoke to you.\"We wouldn't think of harming you, now would we Venasaur?\" \"No, we wouldn't\" He frowned looking at the ground but then smirked \"But you suredid feel good in my ass!\" \"Venasaur!\" He glared at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But both of you almost ate me whole!

You realize you had a source of heat near to you, the fire type, of course. He had a flame on the tail, but you are afraid of approaching it. If Charizard moved, he could incinerate you with that fire. You keep thinking and another thought crosses your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou approach them and note that they aren't completely asleep. They're conscious enough to hear you. \"I'm cold, and as odd as this may sound, I think it would be better for me if I slept inside one of you.\" \"What do you mean?\" Charizard muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean that I could sleep inside the stomach of one of you.\" Charizard looks at you and tells you that it is fine, that it is possible. He then tells you to pick which of your hosts would be better for you. You choose...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The Charizard didn't like to seem humans harmed, he had a sense of respect for them... that's why he kept his distance. He wouldn't want to become a trainers pet, but rather a friend. The Charizard took you in hand and walked off to a more secluded spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry bout that, he's a little conceited at times.\" He sat down, you were placed between his legs, giving you a very nice view of his once again massive package. Your mind began to think of whether his balls or his stomach was a good choice. He looked back to Venusaur to see he was sleeping. \"Well, he's asleep, no need to worry about any unwanted visits to his back side.\" He smirked. \"By the way, i know this is awkward, but...did you like it at all in there.\" You blush deeply, not wanting to admit it. \"You don't have to answer that, its a stupid ques-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did...\" You couldn't help but feal the least bit of regret, as he might think of doing the same thing with you. You wince as he makes a sudden movement, only to notice he's resting on his arms in a reclined position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do huh?\" He smiles at you. \"Never met a human that was into that type of thing. I guess its a required taste.\" He looks down the cave to the entrance. \"So you have no idea how you got this small? Just one day your as small as mouse?\" His voice seems somewhat concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.Well no. I do remember something a little now before.\" You get up and begin to pace, the thought groggy in your mind. \"I was at home and i was alone, i heard a strange noise and went out to my backyard.\" The Charizard looked intrigued, definitely wanting to know what happened next. \" I was then running towards a bright looking figure, shorter than me, and that's when i blacked out, the last thing i kinda remember is seeing a dark purple glow.\" You stood there scratching your head, trying to put the pieces togethor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, whatever it was, i help you find out how to get back, even if my friend keeps thinking you're no-more than a buttplug. Heh, he can get so horny at times.\" The slight thought of that made the charizards rod slide a bit out of its sheath. He looked down in surprise and forced himself to keep it back in. \"Oh sorry bout that, you must get nervous around us and our privates. But rest assured, we won't harm you the least bit....Well, i'll make sure, i don't know about Mr. vacuum ass over there.\" You share a chuckle. \"So, why don't we get some sleep, i sure hope you don't mind foreign smells, cause my stomachs full of them.\" He lowers a paw down, but you hesitate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About that...i was hoping i could sleep somewhere a bit warmer.\" The charizard look confused for about a second before he grinned and looked at you lustfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, which hole will it be?\" His dick was beginning to spring out and he lifted his lower half to give you a semi good view of his very clean tailhole.

You wait until he is asleep, and then you, without hesitation, approach the anus. This makes you realize how tiny you are. There was enough space inside Venusaur for you to move around, but it was too cramped, which made you think that you wasn't that small, but after seeing Charizard's size, you realize that the other Pok\u00e9mon is smaller than the fire lizard. The hole in front of you is the proof, since it is much bigger than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou timidly touch it, and see it open enough for you to get in it. You introduce your feet in it, and move until your head is the only part of your body that is outside. You feel the warmness enveloping you, and feel strangely happy of your actual situation. You close your eyes and try to sleep, but you aren't capable. After a while, you open your eyes again. You don't know how long you have been in there, and you look around, trying to think a way to make you fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoughts start to cross your mind.Your initial shyness is gone, and you want to do something. You decide to enter deeper, just for fun. You know that Charizard wouldn't mind, and you wonder what his reaction would be if he could read your thoughts now. You start moving, and slowly sit and crawl through Charizard's anus, until you can't see behind you. You crawl until you feel your hands reaching an empty space, and you know that you're where you wanted to be. You force yourself inside Charizard's rectum and the anus closes behind you, this time it is so tight you know you wouldn't be able to go through it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is much bigger than Venusaur's and you hardly can believe that in one day you was in the last part of the intestines of two Pok\u00e9mon, even if the first one was unwilling. You examine your surroundings. There is light, maybe it is a natural consequence of the Pok\u00e9mon being a fire type. And it certainly was different than Venusaur's rectum. Unlike the grass type, Charizard's rectum smelled as you had expected, waste. And there is some of Charizard's past meals around, covering the floor and part of the walls. You look around for a clean spot, and localize one. You walk over the crap, and sit against the wall of the rectum, and close your eyes again, wanting to sleep. Time passes and you...</span></div></div>",

However, there were so many odd things about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst of all, it was anthropomorphic, how that was a thing is completely beyond you, and thus you decide not to ponder over it to avoid yourself a massive headache and live with the fact that, towering forty feet over you - if you were still normal sized anyway- stood a giant, naked Ninetales with human features. And boy were those massive features, as her breasts, which you judged to be D-cups, were proudly on display for the world to see. They weren't the only ones, as the Pok\u00e9mon's fur didn't cover her pussy, and you hoped deep inside that her point of view made her unable to see the slight bulge in your pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, said bulge and the beauty of the creature in front of view were tossed aside as you noticed she was staring at your with a mad frown on her face, her blue eyes glaring icicles at you. Feeling threatened, you started slowly backing away, but before you could get any distance, she crouched down and grabbed you with her right hand, leaving you at her mercy as you vainly tried to wriggle free from her grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me go!\" you shouted, though your plight only caused the hold around your body to tighten. She rose you to a few inches in front of her face, and you could feel her stare piercing you even more from this close. You usually loved Ninetales and how beautiful they were, but never did it cross your mind that they could be this menacing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You stepped into my territory, little human,\" you heard her speak, her voice gracious but fueled with anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm sorry! I didn't mean to intrude, I was lost!\" you tried to explain as you ignored the nagging question in your mind on how a Pok\u00e9mon could speak human language. Then again, you were dealing with a giant, anthropomorphic Pok\u00e9mon after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lost, you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. A friend of mine has an Abra, and he decided to pull a prank on me by making it use teleport on me,\" you started to explain. \"At first it was nothing major, just warping me around in a room, but I told them to stop, as I was getting dizzy and nauseated from the ordeal, but they didn't. I guess one of the spells went out of control, because the last thing I remember was waking up in this forest at this size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence reigned between you and the Ninetales as she scanned you with her gigantic blue eyes, processing the story you told her. What you said was true, but you hoped she believed you, because truth be told, you actually didn't know how you'd get out of this mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, she released her grip on you, relieved that you wouldn't be dealing with fractured bones too, and opened up her other hand before putting you down in its palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As far fetched as your story is, I can sense that you are not lying,\" the Ninetales said as she removed locks of her long, flowing hair from her face with her fingers. \"Thus, I will help you out of this forest, on two conditions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you felt relief and joy at her offer, that last part made you pause abruptly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of conditions?\" you asked, worried on where this may be going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, I will need to wipe your memory of our encounter. I am afraid I can't let the outside world know of me. That would attract trouble I'd rather live without.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea of having your memory tampered with wasn't really appealing to you. At your current size, however, you were not really in any position to argue or negotiate, and so you agreed on this first term.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the second condition?\" you asked, only for your heart to skip a beat, when a devious smile crept on the giantess' muzzle, which she followed by sensually licking her lips, her gaze never leaving yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've always wanted to have some fun with a little man,\" was all she said before she grabbed your shirt with the tips of her clawed fingers and pulled it off you, tearing it apart in the process and revealing your torso, which sadly didn't show off much, as you were not really a sports guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on, isn't this rape?\" you protested in a panic, though your words fell on deaf ears as she then went to grab your pants and pull them off of you, dragging your socks and shoes along with them. In doing so, one of her fingers made brief contact with your rod, and you involuntarily let out a soft moan, which made the Ninetales smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is not rape if you enjoy it, is it?\" she teased. She brought back her index finger to rub your dick with its tip through the fabric of your boxers, and despite your struggles and best efforts to deny it, you couldn't resist how good this actually felt. After a little while, your last defenses crumbled, and you allowed yourself to moan pleasurably at her ministrations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to move on to the next step, the Pok\u00e9mon hooked a claw into your boxers, careful not to scratch your skin, and pulled them down before tossing them away, now leaving you completely naked. You felt self conscious about your size as she eyed your little Stewie. On normal circumstances, it would be considered average, but that didn't really matter to a giantess. Fortunately for her, watching your little stick of meat pulsate in front of her only fueled her lust even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking her lips, she brought her index finger into her muzzle and sensually sucked on it to lubricate it. You looked on as the sight made your rod hard like you've never had before, then stifled even more moans when she brought her digit down to stroke the underside of your cock. Before she proceeded further, she sat down next to a tree and leaned her back against it, and you looked in awe as her melons jiggled as she positioned herself comfortably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe caught you staring at her bust, but only let out a giggle before flicking your rod to return your attention to her face up above, eliciting another moan out of you. Despite your earlier reluctance, her soft fingers felt incredibly good, and despite the rough first impression you had of this beautiful Ninetales, there was a kind of warmth inside of you as you let her carefully toy with your privates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere deep in the recesses of your mind, you wondered why she was doing this, and what she could possibly gain from this exchange. You had a theory, but decided to put those assumptions aside and instead enjoy your treatment while it lasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDone with her teasing, the Ninetales grabbed your member with the tips of her thumb and index fingers and began slowly rubbing it. The feeling was amazing, the fur on her digits making it the softest handjob - fingerjob? - you could ever dream to receive. She kept at it for a while, making your rod nice and hard in preparation for the next step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any warnings, she let go of your shaft and, with a quick wink, opened her maw and engulfed your entire dick in her muzzle, causing you to gasp in surprise at the abrupt pleasure from the act. She then teasingly flicked your tip with her massive tongue before she started sucking on it. She let out a few moans as she tasted you, which sent pleasurable vibrations through your entire body. You thought you could hold out for a while longer, but she was way too good and sexy, and you prematurely exploded in her mouth. She looked at you in surprise, not expecting such an early release, but didn't seem to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled you away from her face, and you watched, slightly exhausted, as she sloshed your little glob in her muzzle before she swallowed it with an audible gulp, using her index to trail down the bulge in her throat all the way to her belly, licking her lips as she gave it a few light taps. She then returned her blue eyes to you and leaned down to drop a soft kiss on your face, catching you completely off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, little one,\" she said, giving you an honest smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome?\" you tentatively replied, unsure how to respond. \"What was that about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well, I just wanted to thank you for allowing me to find out how a human male tastes like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't really give me a choice in the matter,\" you pointed out accusingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned her gaze away sheepishly. \"I am truly sorry. It's just *sigh* it has been so long and I couldn't help it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda odd to hear from someone who wasn't too keen on finding me on her territory at first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I admit, I was kind of impulsive earlier, and for that, I apologize.

She already felt bad about the way she first treated you, and you just rudely shoved it right back in her face. Hell, she even fucking gave you the blowjob of your life, and this was how you thanked her, and that realization made you feel even worse inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll just grow you back and lead you back to civilization,\" she morosely said, bringing you back from your internal struggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were pretty sure that you'd just confirmed your earlier suspicions. Being different from other Pok\u00e9mon, and probably being the only one like this, she  had shunned herself away from any kind of interaction, be it with humans or Pok\u00e9mon. She may have assaulted you with the shield she had built around herself, but just now showed you the fragile core hidden inside. This was now or never. Will you be the one she needs, or say nothing and go back to your life, and keep the promise you've made to her about her existence?</span></div></div>",

You treck through some of the muck too get somewhere in the middle, the inner walls squeezing you, like its stuffing you in some of the poop. The feeling, it was nice, being squished into a soft, warm substance as it moved foward untill you notice your close too the tailhole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario was squatting by a tree, hiding behind it as he felt the need too go. He unknowingly was pushiung  you out (or maybe he did know and knew you thought it would be a great experiance) A small fart edmitted, making a slight squek as it exited, and then his sighed, letting his bowels move at its pace. The start of the soft poop peeked out, and started too coil on the forest ground. The load itself was mearly one long log. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon though, you feel your in free fall, and land with a nice soft splat into the waiting pile, more coming on top ofo you. you cant help but be fully aroushd too this. Lucario Finishes with another squeky fart, which smelled...nice now. and stood up streching. After a second, turns too the pile, and picks you out, you being smelly, and slightly brown colored<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile slightly and look at lucario from his palm.

To your surprise, Mew simply giggles at your statement \"No need to worry! You already know you can't be digested!\"she (you assume its female due her feminine voice and look) says \"Yeah, but then you would lose me. Would you let a predator take away your only friend?\" you say. Mew seems to be thinking \"You have a point. Tell you what, if something happens, just shout my name, I'll be there in no time!\" she giggles. You nod slowly, finding her logic valid, and knowing that if you refuse to play, Mew could easily force you to. The pink cat pokemon giggles again picks you from her head. Putting you on the ground, she turns around \"Go hide you mouse!\" she says excitedly, starting to count. You know that you have time until one hundred before Mew starts chasing you, so you look around for an hiding place. There's nothing but bushes and plants. They are common hiding places, Mew will for sure search in them for starters. So you shake off the idea. You start to walk, looking around for eventual hiding spots. Mew reaches fifty, so you hurry up and start running a little. Nothing here. You groan. How are you supposed to find any hiding place here. Maybe you could try and hide in the tall grass? Nope, Mew would find you easily. You are about to give up when you see, in a far rocky wall, a little crevice. You could easily squeeze yourself in. So you run for it \"Ninety nine... One hundred! Ready or not, here I come!\" Mew stops counting. Turning around, she sees you running and giggles \"You're not going to escape me little one! Here comes the cat!\" she says playfully, as she flies fast behind you. Soon she catches up with you. And moves one of her short paws your way. You notice and jump out of the way \"Almost got you!\" she says. You keep running like crazy. Almost there... just a little more... as you are near the wall made of rock, you jump towards the crevice, surprising Mew. You start squeezing yourself in \"Oh no you don't\" Mew says flying towards you and extending a paw...</span></div></div>",

You realize you've just been released from her maw!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments after you slide off her tongue, you feel a tightness surround your torso, keeping you from falling far. Your arms are free, though, and you use them to try to wipe as much saliva off your face as possible, which isn'y easy since your arms have drool all over them too. Luckily, you're able to open your eyes  soon enough, and look around to see that Mew now has you tightly coiled in her tail, and is holding you in front of her face.

It's nice and warm here. <i>And most importantly I'll be safe</i>, you think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Oh, it won't be far, I promise you,</span>\" she reassured you, \"<span class=\"cpink\">Hmm, maybe you should use this as protection from the rain.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA big green leaf quavers on a nearby bush and with a quick 'pluck' flies towards you.

You're probably familiar with eeveelutions, as a trainer?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes.

Brown dirt turns to grey stone and the air gets warmer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">We have this secret cave, you see. It's nice and warm and it's were we live. Oh it's not some dirty dark cave, we fixed it up. You'll see in a moment...we'll just get rid of this...</span>\" and the leaf lifts up into the air and flies backwards, out of view. Into your view now comes the lamp-lit inside of a large but nicely decorated home. A cave indeed, you can tell from the stone walls, but home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Why were you wearing a leaf on your head?

This one a boy and quite lovely-dovey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Missed you too, Umby~--hey! Glaceon, give him back!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're suddenly taken into two very cold paws and a pair of dark teal eyes frown down upon you. \"<span class=\"cteal\">You're cold and wet.</span>\" The vapor of her breath makes you shiver as it rises in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, well yes-yes I am in fact!\" you say between chatting teeth, \"so about you put me somewhere...warm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">Yes.</span>\" The female Glaceon smiles; a smile that worries you for some reason. \"<span class=\"cteal\">I could do that.</span>\" She brings you closer to her. It gets colder. Then she opens her mouth and you see threads of saliva join from tongue to the roof of her mouth and gasp in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Glaceon don't!</span>\" the Espeon yells out in horror but she doesn't reach you in time. You're plunged onto a...surprisingly warm but wet tongue. It seems strange that the inside of the Glaceon's mouth is warm while her outside is cold, but this momentary oddity quickly leaves your mind when it becomes completely black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">OKAY! That's enough! Spit him out this instant.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">Nnnn.</span>\" The blue icy Pokemon turns around and closes her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Flareon?

Glaceon perks an ear and a drop of sweat rolls down her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn mid-air halfway across the room already, the Flareon gives a frightful war cry as fire shoots from his mouth and just as he is about to pounce on Glaceon...</div></div>",

You pounded with your fists on anything you could hit, but the flesh absorbed everything, or so it seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlaceon sat in her little corner of the Eevees' home. It was a dark and cool little room painted blue with a hanging painting of an icy landscape. She watched her belly, as tiny bumps appeared as disappeared.

The walls kept your arms to your sides but at least there was room to breath but just barely. When the Glaceon had so suddenly let all the air out of her stomach, what probably happened was you were smushed down so hard that your feet got caught in the sphincter that joins intestine and stomach and you managed to slip past it. At least you're being spared the pain of being dissolved alive, you consider. If there's any \"bright side\" that's gotta be about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeven eeveelutions were already at the dinner table eating various kinds of noodles and rice, when Leafy and Glacey walked in.

Laughter erupted around the table. Glaceon couldn't help but join in when she saw the shocked expression on Leafeon's face as the meek grass-type couldn't decide whether to try and chew the thing or spit it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Now that we're all in a better mood</span>,\" Espy looked at the ice-blue pokemon who quickly suppressed her laughs, \"<span class=\"cpink\">why don't we eat?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlaceon looked at Espeon then looked away, pretending not to hear her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Oh come now Glaceon.

A baby-pink, wrinkled bubble that smelled like a gas station bathroom and flooded with a foul liquid. Glaceon jumped. Your surroundings lurched upward, launching you and your swimming pool into the air. Gravity kicked in and you splashed down with a mighty impact. Submerged, you watched as the remaining airborne piss drizzle down in a literal golden shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0         \u201c<span class=\"cteal\">Get it out of there! Right! Now!</span>\u201d Glaceon\u2019s cheeks were on fire. Her shoulders hunched diminutively, ears low, paws over her crotch. Everyone\u2019s staring. Flareon\u2019s rolling on the floor, laughing. She wanted to run under the table.<br>\r\n  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0         \u201c<span class=\"cteal\">Stop laughing...please\u2026,</span>\u201d her feet tap-danced under the table. She could absolutely feel you in there. Every little movement. Unlike before, it wasn\u2019t ticklish. It was worse. Her bladder was far more tender than her guts, and Glaceon had a sensitive bladder. Every little ripple, splash, flop \u2014 she could feel. Every single titulation sent her bladder into a leaping spasm. Which, predictably, made both your and her days worse. Everything in the organ went airborne, and when it landed, Glaceon swore a hammer hit her loins.<br>\r\n  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0         \u201c<span class=\"cteal\">Espeon, I\u2019m sorry!

You know where the bathroom is.</span>\u201d<br>\r\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0       Glaceon wanted to say something smart, but swallowed it. She had to make it to the bathroom. She was not going to pee herself. Not in front Flareon. Especially not in front of Espeon. She speedily galloped away, trying to balance on three paws. Her front-right paw was buried in her quivering groin. A plug to stop the flood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0       However bad Glaceon perceived her situation to be, your\u2019s was worse. Your prison constantly bounced and contracted. Glaceon\u2019s clumsy strides rocked the pisstank back-and-forth and up-and-down all while her contractions squeezed and made your surroundings leap. You spent as much time in the air as you did underwater. With every buck of her hip, you were tossed into the air. Sometimes you\u2019d hit the roof of the fleshy, flooded, cave and you\u2019d hear a startled yelp. Then Glaceon\u2019s paw would bear down on your cage even harder. The room would indent, the walls would flutter, and the cycle would repeat.<br>\r\n    \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0       Being this close to Glaceon, it was inevitable that you would learn a little secret: when she\u2019s nervous, her bladder jumps into overdrive. The \u201cwater\u201d level has almost doubled since you landed here. Glaceon\u2019s private pond was nearing its capacity and, last you checked, you didn\u2019t have gills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0          Glaceon arrived at her destination. She scurried to the old wooden door. She reached for the brass doorknob to find her worst fear realized: the door was locked. Someone was already in there.<br>\r\n   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0        \u201c<span class=\"cteal\">Let me in!

Before she can even talk, Glaceon bolts inside the bathroom, shutting the door behind herself and quickly locking it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe desperately goes for the toilet bowl. <br>\r\n\"Here we go!\" she exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, inside the depths of this ice type, you are about to drown into the foul liquid. You almost go unconscious, when your body gets sucked in a whirlpool, which drags you down along the piss. You hit the bottom of the bladder and are forced into an opening, which leads to the outside world. To freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlaceon gives a deep sigh of relief. She didn't pee herself. She   feels all the fluid leaving her body, then she hears something plopping into the bowl. And she's pretty sure she knows what is it. Or, more specifically, who is it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaping off the toilet, the ice type peeks into the bowl. As expected, the tiny human she ate earlier, and the same human her sister teleported into her bladder, is floating there, soaked in her piss, spitting out said liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlaceon can't help but give a small giggle. You glare up at her.<br>\r\n\"Well little one, seems you had quite the adventure today.\" the blue pokemon says.<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Are you going to flush now? Or perhaps I've had enough for one day?\" you retort angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Glaceon can respond, someone knocks at the door.<br>\r\n\"Glaceon? Are you alright?\" the ice type recognizes Sylveon outside.<br>\r\n\"Yes. I am.\" she replies.<br>\r\n\"Oh great. Are you done? Because I, ehm, was in the middle of something...\" the fairy type says. Glaceon looks down at you again, smiling. You are now almost sure she'll flush you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet Sylveon. But it won't take long.\" Glaceon says, before leaning forward.<br>\r\n'Here we go, she's reaching for the toilet handle.' you think, exasperated. But nothing happens. Instead, the ice type returns into view, this time holding a toilet brush in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lowers it into the bowl, right near you. You stare at the object confusedly. She's helping you? A nod from the ice type confirms that she's indeed aiding you. You grasp the toilet brush as Glaceon pulls it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe carefully walks over the sink and drops you in it, before throwing the brush aside. You sit there in disbelief as she turns on the water. The fresh liquid comes down on you, cleaning off the piss you're covered in. Another liquid pours on you. You recognize it as liquid soap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlaceon lets you wash yourself for a few minutes, before turning off the water. She leans forward, taking the back of your shirt in her mouth and closing it, lifting it -and you along- up. She doesn't bother to hide you. Sylveon won't be a problem -she's far too shy to try anything anyway-  and the others already know about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe exits the bathroom, Sylveon briefly taking notice of the small human hanging from her mouth, before stepping into the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stay silent the whole time Glaceon walks.

She gently releases you on the ground.<br>\r\n\"Listen up human,\" she says you.<br>\r\n\"I know how to repay Espeon for her prank, but I'll need you.\" she explains.<br>\r\n\"What do I have to do with this? You ate me!\" you exclaim angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlaceon looks away to check if her siblings heard you. Fortunately, they don't seem to have noticed anything, as they keep speaking. Glaceon turns to you again.<br>\r\n\"Don't be like that, I helped you then, right? Or did you like being covered in piss?\" she whispers.<br>\r\n\"... Go on. What do I have to do?\" you ask, remembering which prank Glaceon was talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ice type grins.<br>\r\n\"All I need is a distraction. Just walk there pretending you are leaving. If the plan works, Espeon will stop you. At that point, you'll have to keep her in place. And then... you'll see what happens.\" she says, winking. You nod your head.<br>\r\n\"Good, now go!\" she whispers, pushing you away with a paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do as Glaceon instructed you and walk in front of the three Eeveelutions, making sure they take notice of you. You walk towards the exit of the cave where the Eevee family lives. You hear nothing coming from outside, the rain must have stopped. But it's pitch black, you can't see anything out there.<br>\r\n\"Hey little guy, where are you going?\" a familiar voice asks. You recognize it as Espeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mentally prepare yourself.<br>\r\n\"I'm leaving.\" you reply, turning to notice the psychic type approaching.<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't recommend wandering in a forest at night  to someone as small and vulnerable as you.\" she says.<br>\r\n\"Why would you want to leave anyway? Is that because Glaceon ate you?\" she asks, acting oblivious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your gaze behind Espeon for a second, noticing Glaceon sneaking behind Leafeon and Vaporeon, who are watching the scene  with interest, not taking note of their sister behind them.<br>\r\n\"No, I'm leaving because you tricked me! You wanted to eat me, and you send me into Glaceon's bladder!\" you shout. Espeon is taken aback by your outburst.<br>\r\n\"Oh... you heard that...\" she mutters.<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" you say, looking at Glaceon again. She's approaching Espeon.<br>\r\n\"Well, I- Hey!\" the psychic pokemon doesn't get to finish as a wave of frosty air is shot from Glaceon's mouth, right into her sister's big ears, freezing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, without wasting any time, Glaceon scoops you in her mouth once again, before dashing away, in direction of her room. A shadow ball misses her of a centimeter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlaceon runs into her room, shutting the door behind herself with her back paw. She lets you on the ground, before starting laughing.<br>\r\n\"The look on her face! Priceless!\" she laughs. You chuckle along her.<br>\r\n\"Good job human!\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight then, your stomach growls. You just seem to remember you haven't eaten all day, since you woke up in this forest. The icy giantess smirks.<br>\r\n\"Well, I think you earned your food. Wait here.\" she says, walking out of the room. You get to take a look around. Glaceon's room is small - to her anyway - and cold, as you expected though. It's not your idea of bedroom, but, then again, you're in a cave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlaceon returns shortly after, holding a berry in a corner of her mouth, while carrying a small piece of cloth of some sort in the other. She drops the berry in front of you and lets the cloth fall down to the ground.<br>\r\n\"I figured you should sleep here for tonight. We wouldn't want Espeon doing something nasty to you, right? But, at the same time, it's way too cold in here for you. And, unless you want to freeze to death, you can't risk sleeping with me. So you will have to arrange yourself with this. At least until we're sure my sister isn't going to harm you for tricking her.\" she explains as you eat your berry. You give a small nod and resume eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ice type waits for you to satisfy your hunger and, as you give out a sigh that means you're stuffed, she lies down on the cold floor of her room. She yawns.<br>\r\n\"Well, I think I'm going to sleep, human. Whatever you do, don't go outside until tomorrow... but, if you do, avoid Espeon. When I got the berry, Vaporeon was unfreezing her ears with scald. Maybe she went to her room, but I'd recommend you don't take risks. But if you want to explore for a bit, you're free to do it. Goodnight.\" she says, rolling on a side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlaceon quickly falls asleep, while you wonder what to do. You could use some sleep, but you're also pretty curious about the cave. The Eeveelutions fixed it, it almost looks like a human house. And maybe the psychic type is in her room, like Glaceon said.<br>\r\n\"What to do?\" you ask yourself.</span></div></div>",

The bladder has nearly reached its carrying capacity. The organ was twitching incessantly, bouncing about in a spirited effort to not leak. The contractions had doubled in both frequency and intensity. Sometimes the wrinkled walls would almost touch, but often you found yourself between them, crushed and enveloped in piss. Glaceon\u2019s rear danced side-to-side rhythmically and so did you. Warm waves of urine crashed into the walls, heaving you from one side to the other. Her bladder fluttered, twitched, wobbled, and trembled. Something was going to break. Her hips humped back-and-forth in a desperate bid to hold her fluids inside her. But it was no use. In fact, it made it worse. Bouncing off one spongy wall to the other, you were the tipping point. Her bladder had enough.

The flesh surrounding you pulsed and quivered and mashed and compressed as it did its damndest to cram you into a too small hole. Glaceon felt this. Both paws rushed to her privates. Her groin squeezed and released. <i>Squeezed </i>and released. Her paws pushed deep into her groin, trying to stop you, but only assisted in her body\u2019s efforts. Glaceon felt her a trembling deep in her privates. She let out a defeated cry. She was going to piss herself. In front of everyone. With a rump-first view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0           You were packed in her urethra, your exit. Far tighter than her intestines, you were pushed further by a joint effort between the tube\u2019s twitches and pressure of the piss behind you. You were like a too-large cork stuffed in a too-small bottle of champagne. You could see the end of the tunnel. Glaceon\u2019s sky-blue fur was cropped around the edges of your exit. You could see the other Eeveelutions gawking at Glaceon. They followed her, it seemed. Some were watching with curiosity, others with disgust. Flareon seemed excited. He probably finds this hot. Wierdo.<br>\r\n  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0         You moved closer to your exit in bursts. A powerful compression would inch you nearer and nearer to your destination. Then, the cork popped.<br>\r\n  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0         You were sent shooting from her privates, a powerful stream of urine following. You landed belly-down on cold cave floor. Just as you flip over, you were barraged by a warm flood of piss. Glaceon\u2019s furred tush loomed over you, tail raised high. Her hips were shaking and legs trembling in euphoric relief. Her pussy pulsed as her bladder continued to drain, fortunately no longer on you. The powerful stream slowed to a trickle then dried up. Glaceon sheepishly looked back. She was looking at you.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0          \u201c<span class=\"cteal\">Sorry\u2026</span>\u201d<br>\r\n          <br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

Soon she is nowhere to be seen; instead, you hear a door closing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrossed out, you get on your feet. All of the giant Eeveelutions are staring at you, looking at you with looks of disgust and curiosity. Espeon approaches you.<br>\r\n\"Ehm... Welcome back...\" she attempts to say something.<br>\r\n\"Thanks I guess...\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about the whole thing. I just wanted to teach Glaceon a lesson...\" Espeon apologizes.<br>\r\n\"It's okay. Just don't do that anymore.\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anyone can say anything else, a feminine voice speaks up.<br>\r\n\"Good morning everyone. Did I miss anything? What are you all staring at?\" it asks.<br>\r\nEspeon groans.<br>\r\n\"Seems the princess woke up...\" she whispers sarcastically as a Sylveon pops out of the small crowd of Eeveelutions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo baby blue eyes fix on you. More specifically, they fix on the puddle of piss you're covered in.<br>\r\nInstantly, the pink and white pokemon rushes to you, completely ignoring Espeon.<br>\r\n\"You poor thing, are you alright?\" she asks with a hint of worry in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod.<br>\r\n\"Disgusting... let's get you washed, shall we?\" she asks, gently wrapping a ribbon around your piss-covered body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Sylveon can carry you off, Espeon speaks up.<br>\r\n\"Excuse me Sylveon, I was about to do the same thing...\" she states. You could swear you can see her irritation growing as the two pokemon speak.<br>\r\n\"You were my dear sister. But if you don't mind, I'm going to get this little guy washed.\" Sylveon replies, walking off.<br>\r\n\"I mind...\" the psychic type mutters, before walking off as well, in the opposite direction Sylveon went. All the Eeveelutions walk away too, retuning to whatever they were doing before this all happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's terrible.\" Sylveon comments, drying you up with a towel. You told her how you met Espeon and how you ended up first in Glaceon's gut and then in her bladder after Espeon's little prank while she helped you bathe.<br>\r\n\"Really terrible.\" Sylveon says once again, clearly wanting an answer.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it was. You're really gentle anyway.\" hearing your compliment, Sylveon pushes you to her cheek, nuzzling you.<br>\r\n\"Thanks little guy. Aren't you just the cutest little thing I've ever seen?\" she says, making you blush.<br>\r\n\"Come on, you're nice and clean now. Let's get out of here.\"she says, wrapping her ribbon around your waist and walking out of the bathroom where she cleaned you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey little one.\" Sylveon calls out. You, who are currently riding on her head bow, raise your head.<br>\r\n\"What?\".<br>\r\n\"I was thinking, from what you told me, you didn't get to see all of our cave. So, if you'd like, I can give you a small tour. What do you say?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would really like to spend more time with Sylveon - she's been  awfully nice to you this far - but on the other hand, you also want to check on Glaceon. She isn't mean, she just wanted to act cool, you somehow heard that from the inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little guy?\" Sylveon calls out again.<br>\r\n\"So? Are you in or not?\".<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You sputter and squirm, but you are held in place at the waist, clenched tight by the Pokemon\u2019s anus. Up, your world goes. And then back, forwards again. Back. Forwards. Zorua\u2019s hips are bucking. Pleasurable moans, deep from within the fox\u2019s belly rumble through the fleshy cavern.

The slick, ribbed walls undulate and crush as the Zorua sucks in her belly with every buck of the hip. Your cruel and unusual entrapment sways as Zorua sprays her hind legs. Her hind lifts. You find yourself starting to slide down the slick intestinal floor. Zorua\u2019s cheek touches the ground, mouth wide open, as her left-front paw snakes up towards her sex before taking the plunge.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You are wholly swallowed. Through the warm rectum floor, you feel Zorua\u2019s paw jet feverishly in and out, masturbating incessantly and carnally. You feel the tunnels pulse, then a quick squeeze.

Then, when you are about to pass out, you notice that you're starting to slide backwards - or downwards? - slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then... light. You blink a few times, noticing that you're staring at Zorua's pulsing anus. You try to stand back up, but, exhausted as you are, your legs simply won't move. So you begin to crawl away from the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop once you're breathing fresh air instead of Zorua's bottom. You notice the vixen laying on her side, panting to regain her breath. And, looking elsewhere, you see the key to your freedom. The door. If you could just reach it, you could slide out and go find Sylveon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, silently, you start crawling again, determined to escape this nasty fox. You climb down the bed, getting onto the hard, cold floor. But you don't get so far...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And where do you think you're going, lil' guy? The fun has just begun.\" a voice talks behind you. You perfectly know who that voice belongs to. And it's enough to make you shiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start speeding up, desperately trying to reach the door. But soon, a pillar of black and red fur steps in front of you, a centimeter away from your head. You look up. Zorua is snickering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please... let me go, I won't tell anyone about your secret.\" you say, trying to talk your way out of this situation. The vixen's bright blue eyes start sparkling with excitement. Excitement of what comes next.<br>\r\n\"Really?\" she says.<br>\r\n\"It think another lesson won't hurt.\" that said, her paw comes  down on your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua keeps you in place as she sits on her hind legs. From here, you can clearly see her dripping slit, a massive cave stained with the vixen's juices, that reveal you what she has been doing while you were in her behind. The paw holding you down starts dragging you in direction of her sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get immediately what Zorua has in store for you. And you don't like it one bit. You struggle, trying to get free, but the giant paw is simply too strong, and so your attempts turn out to be futile. <br>\r\n\"Please...\" you beg in a whisper. But the fox ignores you as she continues to drag you slowly, spontaneously creating an unnerving tension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stops when you're mere inches from her sex.<br>\r\n\"Ready, lil' one? Cause the real fun is about to begin.\" she says, putting emphasis on the word 'real'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, without waiting for an answer, she shoves your puny body inside her slit, the vertical lips blocking out all light as you enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Zorua starts howling in pleasure, feeling you squirm in her depths. Her mouth waters, her tail wags, her eyes close from the amount of pleasure she's having.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, meanwhile, are yet again entrapped in a dark and hot tunnel, though this one is much more spacious than the other three you've been in just today...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan. <br>\r\n\u2018Will this day ever end?\u2019 you think while squirming, trying to get outta here. But your squirms are stopped by the fleshy walls of the 'love tunnel' colliding together, crushing you in the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Zorua has dropped on her side, panting and moaning ecstatically. At this point, her tongue is sticking out of her mouth, and her paw is slowly travelling to her sex. The vixen starts masturbating yet again, howling in pleasure as she does so, sending vibrations through her body.<br>\r\n\"S-So... g-good...  Mawhr...\" she moans, her mind lost in the excessive amount of pleasure she's getting from your struggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the dark fox comes. Again. You are almost drowned in a wave of love juice that washes you out of your fleshy prison. You find yourself yet again laying on the ground, covered in Zorua's liquids, and more of the stuff dripping on your small body from the slit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTired out, you cannot move anymore. <br>\r\n\"Mhh...\" Zorua moans while panting.<br>\r\n\"I don't think I want to let you go anymore, lil' rat. You are too... useful to me.\" your eyes widen at the statement. That can't mean anything good...<br>\r\n\"Please... let me go...\" you desperately try to convince her.<br>\r\n\"Sorry, lil' guy, but you ain't going anywhere. We'll have so much fun together~\" she replies, snickering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHardly, the vixen gets on all fours and turns around, eyeing you with a wide, toothy grin on her face, her eyes sparkling with mischievousness. You gulp down hard. That look can only mean that the fox isn't done with you yet... </span></div></div>",

Unable to move, you make no attempt to evade it as she places the pillar on your chest, with enough force to knock the air out of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou close your eyes. Whatever Zorua has planned for you, you don't want to see it. You wait for her to do anything, but nothing happens. Instead, you feel the weight of her paw lifted by your chest, letting your breath again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes open as you look back at Zorua, only to find she's no longer there. An Eevee took her place, but you perfectly know what's going on. And the reason of why she had to transform again soon becomes clear as you hear footsteps growing louder. Someone must be heading here. Flareon, maybe? Sylveon had told you that he used this room sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Zorua can make any attempt to hide you, the door opens as a worried looking Sylveon comes in. Her gaze fixes on you, who are still laying on the carpeted floor of the room, then on 'Eevee'. The fairy type smiles.<br>\r\n\"Oh, there you are. I was starting to worry, but I simply left you here. Thank goodness. Come on, we still have to... Ew! You're all sticky!\" one of her feelers had wrapped around your waist while she talked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, the ribbon like feeler brings you to up her face. More specifically, to her nose. She sniffs you a couple times, before turning her head away, disgusted. And who wouldn't be after you were pushed in Zorua's rear? Not to mention the other place...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylveon talks again.<br>\r\n\"And you smell like a dumpster! You need a bath! Again!\" she says, before eyeing 'Eevee'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you later, sweetie.\" she says, starting to head for the door, you safely held in her ribbon. You turn back to Zorua one last time. She doesn't move, knowing that she can't do anything against a full evolved pokemon with a clear type advantage, and in a cave full of other Eeveelutions. Yet, her eyes are fixed on you, screaming \u2018I'm not done with you yet\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, Zorua disappears from eyesight as the door is closed by one of Sylveon's ribbons. Sylveon carries you into the bathroom,  and drops you in a sink, turning on the water with one of her feelers; another one grabs a bar of soap as the fairy type Eeveelution starts rubbing your body vigorously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylveon washes you for good twenty minutes before declaring you're clean. She uses a towel to dry you up.<br>\r\n\"There! All nice and clean!\" she exclaims, releasing you from the towel.<br>\r\n\"Thanks... I guess...\" you reply. Her happy look changes to one of curiosity.<br>\r\n\"Say... when I left Eevee's room, I thought you were still with me... I could even feel you, but you weren't moving or talking, and when I tried to pick you, I noticed you weren't there.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly get what happened. Zorua must have replaced you with an illusion,  which explains why 'you' couldn't move nor talk, and, when Sylveon tried to grab you, it simply faded away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I fell from your head while you were nuzzling Z... Eevee. You didn't notice me when you left the room.\" you (partially) lie. Sylveon nods her head.<br>\r\n\"But, how did you got so...\" she pauses to let a disgusted look spread on her face.<br>\r\n \"... Dirty again?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You gulp. What can you say aside from 'Eevee is a Zorua, and she used me as a pleasure toy'? Sure, you could always tell Sylveon about 'Eevee's' true identity, but you have a feeling that you would regret it. Or, you could simply tell a lie and see how things will go... possibly, staying as far as possible from that room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do? </span></div></div>",

But, you figured, such thing would be less humiliating than getting ejected from her body with the remains of what she last ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! I'll be your slave, just let me out!\" you shout, your voice vibrating through the smelly, fleshy walls of the 'cavern\u2019. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, you heard the Zorua's response: a snicker. A dark, mischievous snicker which sent shivers down your spine and made you reconsider your choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rectal muscles clamp down on you as Zorua clenches her butt. Then, for a moment, the fleshy walls release you, only to clamp down again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe process is repeated for several other times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClench-unclench, clench-unclench, clench-unclench as you are dragged along the slimy walls. The pressure around you loosened as you approached the anus of the giantess. And then... light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou barely register the facts going on around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rapid fall, the Zorua's tail wagging above you, her anus closing again... and then, you land on your back on the floor, the cream carpet breaking your fall. Nonetheless, you felt sore, partly because of your rough landing, partly because of the time you spent in Zorua's rectum, her muscles clamping down on you for the whole process, causing you pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay motionless, your legs and arms having fallen asleep while you were confined in the rectum of the vixen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the ground started to tremble beneath you as your dark type captress turns around and spots you on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Hehe... Hi there, lil' rat... welcome back.</span>\" the Zorua snickered as she kneels over your comparatively tiny form, her ice-blue eyes staring at you intently.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Hope you had fun back there.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your mouth to reply, but close it immediately after, opting to just shut up. You had enough for one day, you didn't want the vixen to come with new tortures to 'punish' you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua kept snickering, while you tried to regain some sensibility in your limbs. Your legs start to wake up, followed by your arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, you stand up again and look at the dark vixen sitting in front of you, a grin spread across her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snickers again.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">So, if I'm not mistaken, we had a certain deal...</span>\" she chimes, eyes glued on you, a maniacal grin glued to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, you remain silent and keep staring at the giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">And you can start your work right away!</span>\" Zorua said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time since you came out of her behind, you finally speak,<br>\r\n\"Doing what?\" you ask, not really wanting to know... but, after all, if you really had to do this, you HAD to know what to do...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen snickered... and then, her face suddenly darted forward, eclipsing your sight as her nose pushed against your chest, her huge eyes bigger than you. You felt her warm breath on your body, her fur ticking your skin. And then, she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">I do have a suggestion, ya lil'one.</span>\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore your eyes, her mouth opened, her teeth shining sinisterly as she closed the cave again, her canines piercing your shirt, leaving you pale and startled. Zorua raised her head with a sudden movement, letting go of you in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find yourself launched several feet up in the air, before gravity started working against you and pulled you back down... only for you to notice Zorua opening her mouth again, waiting... waiting for you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scream as you helplessly flail in midair, trying to change the direction of your fall in order to not fall into that abyss of death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut your struggles are in vain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarkness. Heat. White razors everywhere and a slick red floor beneath your feet, a dark abyss in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes catch one last glint of light before the lips of Zorua fall back in place, sealing you in darkness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, the living floor starts moving, causing you to lose your footing as you fall down onto the squishy, soaked ground. Big drops of saliva fall from the palate, hitting you and soaking you to the bone in the thick liquid, while the tongue keeps licking you, soaking you in even more saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Mhh~</span>\" a moan echoes inside the cavern, menacing to break your eardrums as you are just above the Zorua's vocal chords.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LET ME-\" your cry is reduced to silence as you're flipped on your belly, your face falling in a small lake of saliva under the tongue, your open mouth getting filled with the disgusting liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise your head, spit out said liquid in disgust. Again, the tongue darts towards you. You start backing up, trying to avoid the slick red muscles... but, eventually, you halt as your back hits something hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pale as you realize that you're standing by one of the teeth of Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God...\" you mumble. One wrong movement, and you'd end up impaled..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tongue soon reaches your immobile form as it presses your against the hard tooth and keeps licking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole thing goes on for a while, until you're laying motionless on the tongue, beaten, tired, soaked...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, a glob of saliva forms around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you find it sliding downwards as Zorua finally spits you out, the glob of saliva reaching the floor and releasing you. You cough as you splutter saliva that is not yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Hehe... you taste pretty good lil' rat~</span>\" the dark vixen chimed as she eyed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what Glaceon thought too...\" you meekly whisper as you stand up, desperately trying to remove the saliva from your hair with your hands, causing the Zorua to snicker even louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">You'd better get used to this all, lil' one... oh, we'll have so much fun... me at least~</span>\" she told as she eyed you with a mischievous look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, whatever.\" you simply respond, uncaring. Nothing mattered anymore, you were just a slave in the paws of a dark type vixen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua snickered again.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Glad you learned your place ya slave,</span>\" she chimed, before adopting her grin again.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">And now, on with our next \u2018game\u2019...</span>\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"What?\" was all you could get out as the Zorua's fore-paws neared. Part of you knew it was unsurprising. This gigantic trickster fox seemed to have no real sense of what she would and wouldn't do to a shrunken human. Another part of you, though, was shocked at the idea of putting their tongue anywhere near the Pokemon's paws, and it was sickening to realize that, thanks to all manner of indecent torments and tortures you'd already gone through, that that truly had grown not to be every part of you. But not as sickening as the task you had just been so easily and mischievously assigned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Was I not clear enough for ya?</span>\" The paws scooted closer, violating the personal bubble you didn't really have anymore. \"<span class=\"cplum\">These puppies need some love, and I'm fairly certain you... wouldn't mind givin' im some.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething chilling pervaded those final few words. Like a threat she didn't even have to state outright, tucked away under the toothy grin that would seem fairly innocuous to anyone else.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, you eyed her paws with a dead look. You could see the bits of dirt and grime that intermingled with her fur and paw-pads, nearly gagging at the sight alone. All this would be disgusting even at your normal size, but this puny...  the task ahead of you was a humiliation you could never fully prepare for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you clenched you eyes shut, leaned forward, and gave the smallest hint of a lap you could offer. It didn't really help. The taste was still as utterly terrible as you expected it to be even with the smallest lick. But you hoped that the Zorua would assume that that's the most feeling she would get from a tongue of your size, and be none the wiser to the fact that you could do better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">C'mon lil' thing, you're not getting past me with that. Give'im some <i>real</i> licks</span>.\" She punctuated her order with a lick of her own at her lips, reminding you of your previous torture even as you tried to mentally affix yourself to a new way for the remnants of your dignity to be shed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou closed you eyes once more, having no intention of opening them again until your heard the word from Zorua that you could stop. If that word would ever come. You brought out your tongue once more, and pushed your head forward till you felt contact. You had to struggle not to have your eyes bug back open, swiping your tongue up the second you thought it would be satisfying to Zorua. And from the murrs you could hear alone, you had to assume that it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only that was enough. <i>If only</i> a moment of satisfaction was all the cruel fox wanted, and not that mixed with the thrill she so obviously got by putting you in the place she had created for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother few licks, and your tongue (and whole mouth for that matter) felt violated. Earthy substances of all sorts invaded your taste buds, strands of fur and bits of <i>who knows what</i> finding their way into your mouth. You grasped at your stomach. Did this Zorua ever even wash?! Did Sylveon even give the \"Eevee\" a bath when she plucked them straight from the rainy wild? It certainly didn't seem like it. Or... taste like it... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did you do to deserve this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat emotionally-charged thought bubbled up from its place in your mind, eliciting a huff and a speedy punch to the pad of Zorua's left fore-paw. At first, you were expecting to get scolded for \"disrespecting her paws\" or whatever she would come up with to only further assert her dominance over you, but as a loud hum resonated from throughout Zorua's form instead, you had an idea come to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat simple punch clearly did something for her. And a bit of exhaustion in the arms seemed trivial in comparison to having your sense of taste destroyed. Maybe a paw rub would do just as well as licking, if not better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould she even mind? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cracked open an eye and looked between the red and black, furry paws that sat before you upturned, and the pleased, yet increasingly impatient look on Zorua, considering your options... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And, instead of your tongue, you extended your arms, pushing your hands through the thick fur of her paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave it an experimental rub, eliciting a small moan from the dark-type vixen above. She remained silent, this was a good thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, you started rubbing with a bit more energy, while your gaze slowly traveled upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Zorua was smirking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">I don't remember telling ya to stop licking.</span>\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paled and immediately stopped rubbing.

You didn't know whether to feel proud because you were doing something good or feel even more humiliated because of the task you were doing good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly shook your thought off as you simply kept rubbing, speeding up or slowing down to please the giant vixen more... and, from her moans, you could tell that you were doing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua had her eyes closed as she lazily sat down on the carpeted floor, enjoying your paw-massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pulled back from the furry paw and bent to look at the giant paw-pad, which was as large as your upper body you judged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou placed your hands on it and started rubbing the smooth part of her paw as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Zorua moaned loudly. You took it as a good signal and kept going, other moans joining the first one out of Zorua's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">That's... that's it... don't stop ya...</span>\" she muttered as your hands slid up and down her soft paw-pad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was... weird to say the least. You could literally feel the muscles beneath the flesh shifting, as if the paw itself was trying to thank you for your efforts by caressing your hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll while the giantess in front of you kept moaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut soon, her right fore-paw started to feel cut out by the one-sided massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, she gently but firmly kicked you, with enough force to make you fall down on your butt, which hit the carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen snickered as she held out her right fore-paw, which was still in need of a good rub, you could tell by the mix of dirt, dust, soil and strands of fur clinging to her paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">The other,</span>\" she unnecessarily said as you got up and approached the giant paw. Zorua  started snickering - she took pleasure seeing this tiny human worshipping her paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Y'know... you licked, then rubbed my left paw... now you get to lick <i>and</i> rub my right paw!</span>\" she chimed, while your face assumed a milky white color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to do both things <i>simultaneously</i>!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn disgust, you looked up at the vixen, hoping to find any trace of hilarity in her eyes... of course there was, but this certainly wasn't a joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, still wondering what did you do to end up in such situation... situations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ended up in two mouths, one stomach, two rectums, in a bladder and at the paws of this vixen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd all in less than a day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed as, once more, you closed your eyes and stuck your tongue out while extending your arms forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth touched the fur, your mouth getting assaulted with disgusting substances once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt sick, your stomach wanted to throw up whatever you last ate... but you thought that Zorua wouldn't exactly appreciate it if you threw up all over her paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo keep your mind off things, you started thinking about Sylveon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said no one else knew about \u2018Eevee\u2019, so she brought her meals no? She was definitely coming back. You optimistically started to think that she was going to find you, she was going to pull you out of this hell...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe, Flareon... Sylveon mentioned that he came into the room sometimes, all you had to do was get his attention... but you didn't have any friendship with him, was he going to help you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hoped so...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLost in thought, you didn't notice that you have been licking and rubbing Zorua's paw for quite some time. The dark-type was enjoying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly licked her lips - now, you had to lick and rub her paw-pad... she loved the feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly rose her paw, placing it on your chest and making you back away while you opened your eyes, finding yourself face-to-pad with her paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua snickered, while you felt sick once again - the pad was coated in even more dirt and grime than the paw did...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">And now my pad, ya lil\u2019-</span>\" Zorua didn't finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly noticed her looking at the door of the room.

Stilled by fear, Zorua\u2019s was. Sylveon\u2019s heart was stiffened by shock, and bewilderment binded Glaceon\u2019s. Yours was uplifted with hope. It was floating in your chest, weightless with anticipation. Zorua\u2019s crushing paw threatened to push it into your throat. You saw Sylveon\u2019s wide eyes grow even larger. Her white pupils darted frantically as she examine the scene while her mind toiled to understand it. She saw you pinned by the Zorua\u2019s paw, nearly lost in the jungle of the carpeted floor. Meanwhile Glaceon was simply befuddled. Her brow was furrowed in confusion as her mouth hung open in a silent, cool gasp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then, you craned your head toward your captor. Her mouth was open in shock. A dribble of drool had begun its trickling journey from the left corner her mouth. Earlier, she had drooled in pleasure during your torture. Now that fear has gripped her limbs, she self-consciously felt the slim stream of slobber slip off her black lips and slide down her fur \u2014 unable to lift a paw to halt its progress. Sylveon\u2019s eyes traced its downward progress.<br>\r\nIt felt like time had halted. No one dared to speak, nor move. Time resumed when Zorua\u2019s drool finally slid off her face and splattered onto your own in a warm, repugnant splat of spittle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cppink\">What are you doing <b><i>here</i></b>?</span>\u201d Sylveon said, focusing on Zorua.

The sonic impact sent Zorua flying five feet back, releasing you from her grip. She landed on her side with a thud and rolled a couple feet more. Zorua stood, steadied herself, and gritted her teeth. It could\u2019ve been a lot worse. Sylveon could\u2019ve had Pixelate... <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Through gnashed fangs, Zorua spoke, \u201c<span class=\"cplum\">This ain\u2019t worth it.

I\u2019ll be seeing you later\u2026</span>\u201d With that, Zorua cloaked herself in an illusion and seemingly vanished.

It was understandable - she had absolutely no chance of winning if she \u2018got her paws dirty catchin\u2019 a catfight\u2019, not with two fully-evolved pokemon, one with a clear type advantage, and in a cave full of other Eeveelutions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen was getting away, you judged by the tremors growing weaker and weaker, until you could no longer feel the ground shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill shocked about how fast the whole thing was, you looked up at the two Eeveelutions, who, unaware that Zorua had left, were seeking for the dark-type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... She's gone.\" you revealed as you shakily stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time since she came inside, Sylveon seemed to notice you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">... That really was Eevee, huh?</span>\" she asked. You nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy-type gently walked towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Are you okay?</span>\" she asked.<br>\r\n\"No! No I'm not okay! It was all-\" you had to swallow a lump in your throat, remembering the cruel tortures Zorua had subjected you to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, you proceeded to explain everything the vixen had done to you, from her speech to your stay inside her butt and mouth, and how she had forced you to worship her paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you finished your tale, both Glaceon and Sylveon wore looks of pure disgust on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">Nope... <i>definitely not</i> okay...</span>\" Glaceon commented with a hint of a blush on her face, recalling that you've gone through the same things with her earlier... except for the paw-worship part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Ew...</span>\" Sylveon chimed, shivering in disgust. The pokemon she believed to be an innocent, adorable Eevee had turned out to be an all-but-innocent, perverted Zorua that abused the human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">I swear I'm not going to help the next Eevee I find out there...</span>\" she said, feeling vaguely guilty for the things you've gone through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">You shouldn't have anyway... not without the rest of us knowing Sylveon,</span>\" Glaceon scolded, before her gaze shifted on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Didn't you hear what she said?\" you said in fear, recalling her last words, \u2018I'll be seeing you later\u2019,<br>\r\n\"She's coming back for me! Oh, I'm dead... I just know it...\" you whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylveon sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Let's not be silly... you're safe until you're with m-</span>\" a look at Glaceon's face revealed that hers was an unwise choice of words.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">... Us.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot knowing how to respond, you looked down as you took a good look at yourself, discovering that you were in a pitiful state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour whole body was coated in a thick, smelly slime that surely came from Zorua's butt; you were soaked in dried saliva, your shirt was ripped apart, exposing your torso, while your hands - and tongue - were still covered by the fur and the dirt they picked up under Zorua's paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo wonder why the two giantesses were disgusted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up again, discovering one of the four, silky smooth ribbons of Sylveon was coming your way... but it didn't touch you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt fidgeted nervously in front of you, crafting a small breeze. It was like the ribbon had developed a mind of its own and was too disgusted by the idea of landing anywhere near you, but you knew that those were Sylveon's actual thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlaceon knew too. She sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">You need a bath.</span>\" she broke the silence, suddenly lowering her head towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA memory flashed in your mind,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"<span class=\"cteal\">Yes. I could do that.</span>\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you had a chance to cower, Glaceon's teeth closed around the back of your ruined shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shivered lightly, thinking of all the gross stuff that was on you that was ending up in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouth full of you, Glaceon mumbled something incomprehensible before turning around and heading out of the secret room that was once occupied by Zorua. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts current occupant was Sylveon, who looked around dejectedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, an idea made her smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly forgetting about the whole situation, Sylveon headed out too, walking to her room while humming to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour butt hit a cold, hard surface as Glaceon dropped you into the bathroom sink, before turning on the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA river of cold liquid came from above, splashing you and your already-soaked clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">So... must've been rough, huh?</span>\" Glaceon casually asked, dropping some liquid soap onto you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm...\" you responded, not wanting to risk telling that she hadn't been any better than Zorua... but at least, Glaceon didn't contaminate your mouth for who knew how long...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remained silent, and started washing yourself instead, pretending to be busily removing the sticky slime and saliva from your body... before finding that you weren't pretending at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike the dirt that came off easily, the smelly slime and the dried saliva were hard to remove, you discovered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remained under the stream of water for at least thirteen good minutes before finally managing to clean yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlaceon noticed, and turned the water off, before leaning in the sink and picking you in her mouth once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... How much time have I been with Zorua?\" you asked, recalling that you had spent most of the day cooped up inside her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">Well... let's just say it's night now.</span>\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded - it was morning when you entered the vixen's hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shivered, feeling the cold emanating from Glaceon's body hitting your still wet body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe icy giantess sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">... Let's go.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of the Eeveelutions paid particular attention to you during dinner, except maybe for the playful Vaporeon that kept bringing up that face that you have been inside Glaceon's bladder, or the curious Espeon who wondered where you where for the whole day after you went with Sylveon, <i>after</i> she teleported you inside Glaceon's bladder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlaceon and Sylveon remained quiet throughout the whole meal, opportunely keeping their minds off things to avoid Espeon finding out what really happened to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the two ate their meals, along with you - with gigantic food, it wasn't hard for your to feel stuffed - and they started to walk to their respective rooms, Sylveon carrying you along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">So, we're simply keeping it a secret...</span>\" the ice-type mused, causing Sylveon to nod and, by consequence, you to hold onto her head bow since you were riding on top of the pink and white pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">It's better like this... </span>\" she responded, before stopping in front of a door, which, you assumed, led to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Good night Glaceon...</span>\" the fairy-type said as the blue pokemon started walking away after having thanked Sylveon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Hey, where do I sleep?\" you suddenly mused, both pokemon suddenly looking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">... Do you want to freeze to death?</span>\" Glaceon asked rhetorically, without waiting for an answer as she started walking away, leaving you with a giggling Sylveon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Looks like it's just us now...</span>\" the fairy-type said, opening the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time, you saw her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was occupied mostly by a huge white bed, covered by pink and blue pillows, other pillows scattered around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lemme guess, you made this all?\" you asked, recalling that she made the curtains in the hallway that led to the secret room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Yup... and I made this as well~</span>\" she chimed as she approached the bed, picking something up with her ribbons... it was a white, doll-sized shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you knew it, the torn shirt had been gotten rid of as it was replaced by the new one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Thanks.\" you said, causing Sylveon to smile brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">You're welcome! And now...</span>\" she said, leaping onto the bed and letting you down from her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled as she sat next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Good night,</span>\" she said, assuming a comfortable position to sleep.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">And don't worry... nothing will happen.</span>\" she reassured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Good night, Sylveon,\" you said, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you laid down and closed your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was the exhaustive time you spent with Zorua, or the fact that being stuffed made you feel drowsy, but you fell asleep rather quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes shot open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't mean to wake up - something that you expressed with a yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt observed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrowsily, you looked around... and you soon understood why you felt watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, in darkness, a pair of blue eyes with white pupils, staring straight at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your own eyes started to adjust to the darkness, you noticed who the eyes belonged to...</span></div></div>",

You were no sleuth, but even you could see the subtle signs of worry etched upon her face. You saw the bit of cheek pressed slightly upwards toward her right eye, the faint nervous crinkle around her mouth, and the fact that her big blue eyes didn\u2019t dare to stay on you for more than a second \u2014 always slowly drifting away. Despite this, she had a small friendly smile on her face. It was a flimsy mask, doing nothing to hide her worry from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For a few moments, nothing was said. Both of you sat in silence having a wordless conversation with your eyes alone. Eventually, Sylveon mutely mouthed something \u2014 her words not having enough courage to leave her throat. Then Sylveon took a deep breath. She closed her eyes briefly, momentarily swallowing the room in darkness.

Even you didn\u2019t completely know the answer. Even with Zorua still prowling around out there somewhere, just being near Sylveon diluted the feeling of danger.

She was almost motherly, in a sort of way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But your fears did not abate. The reason was simple: you were in a land of giants. How could you ever not be at least a little afraid? You were powerless to stop ne'er-do-wells like Zorua. You had to entirely rely on others for your protection: Glaceon, Sylveon. They\u2019ve already been fooled once, who\u2019s to say they won\u2019t be tricked again? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You were hoisted out of your thoughts as Sylveon\u2019s chiming voice severed the thick silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cppink\">You\u2019ve been thinking for a long time\u2026</span>\u201d Sylveon\u2019s eyes peeled away from you to look dejectedly downward, her head followed.

She let out a small sigh. The sleek white bed covers billowed in response to the warm air, the ripples traveling like a white, wavy crest of water before fluttering out \u2014 its energy lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sylveon regained her composure and mustered the will to look towards you. \u201c<span class=\"cppink\">Little one, I had a bad dream. Everything was just like it was right now, except you weren\u2019t here. You were gone and I didn\u2019t know where you went.

Then I checked Glaceon\u2019s room, Flareon\u2019s, Espeon\u2019s, and all the other\u2019s too \u2014 not there either.

For a moment, you imagined the dreaded vixen, laying in the shadows, waiting for the proper moment to steal her slave back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that couldn't happen while you were with Sylveon or Glaceon, could it? You forced yourself to believe it, but you really couldn't shake off the feeling that you were going to clean another paw with your tongue if you didn't found Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylveon seemed to somehow read your thoughts as she finally stood up, a determined smile on her face,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Maybe you are right,</span>\" she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of her four ribbons traveled to you as it coiled around your waist and brought you up in the air, until you landed on top of the giant's head. You got what was about to happen, so you hastily moved to Sylveon's head bow and grabbed a hold of it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">We're going to find Zorua! She won't bother our sleeps again!</span>\" she said almost cheerfully, respecting her earlier statement about being positive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp went your world as Sylveon leaped from the bed to the ground, your fingers almost sank into the silky smooth bow in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy took a moment to stretch, before she started walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of her ribbons opened the door as she exited her room, stepping into the spacious hallway that led to her room and, judging by the direction she took, to Glaceon's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Okay, Leafeon's garden is right this way...</span>\" Sylveon mumbled, mostly to herself, as she started walking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Shouldn't we wake Glaceon up? She could help...</span>\" you pointed out. Sylveon took another step, before she slowed down a bit, considering your suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, the ground beneath you oscillated right-to-left and left-to-right as she simply shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">I can handle Zorua if she doesn't use those annoying illusions...</span>\" she stated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... You know she's <i>totally</i> going to use those annoying illusions, right?\" again, Sylveon slowed down but this time, her head moved up and down as she nodded to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy allowed herself to sigh as she rounded a corner and continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">... We're both afraid of what she might do to you. But she won't take you as long as you're with me.</span>\" she said, offering a determined smile, though you couldn't see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the hallway came to an end as the white and pink giantess, whose fur seemed to shine through the darkness, stepped in a big, circular space that reminded you of a clearing. There were a few doors, but the stone wall was mostly occupied by a large glass door; through the glass, you noted a huge indoor garden. And huge not only from your point of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I'm still wondering how you made this all.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylveon smirked. One of her ribbons pointed to a door on the side,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">That's Leafeon's room.</span>\" she pointed to another door,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">That's Vaporeon's, she helps Leafeon watering the plants and-</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sylveon, we aren't here for the tour!\" you interrupted, causing her smirk to contort into a serious expression again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Right. Sorry.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilently, she walked up to the glass door. One of her ribbons gently pushed it open. The fairy-type stepped on the tickling grass of Leafeon's garden, which made you feel like you were back in the forest where Espeon picked you up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only difference were the colorful flowers and the rose bushes that jumped out every once in awhile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe quiet fairy-type started moving around, careful to not crush dead leaves beneath her paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">We need to be careful,</span>\" she whispered,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">If Zorua sees or hears us, she could flee. There's a backdoor here, she can run straight out of the den from there...</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... What if she's already out?\" you wondered out loud,<br>\r\n\"Like your dream?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylveon stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Hmm... it might be, but it's worth searching the garden first,</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylveon began walking around, watching her steps, while you held your breath, afraid that Zorua could be able to hear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylveon carefully examined the bushes, checked in the patches of high grass and behind a few trees, but Zorua seemed to be nowhere in the garden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make things worse, the process was incredibly slow, and it was completely dark. You could swear you saw the silhouette of a small fox sneaking around a few times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pokemon you whose head you were riding on eventually stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">... I don't think she's here. She might be outside...</span>\" she theorized once again as she started moving, knowing what awaited her in the dark forest: bigger trees, taller grass and the chance of encountering nocturnal predators that could easily take her on to get the tiny human she was protecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remained silent as the fairy-type trotted towards a small door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before she approached it, though, you heard a sound... the sound of plants shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour first thought was that the wind was shaking them... before you realized that you were inside, there was no wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sylveon...\" you called, startled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy had already stopped. Apparently, she heard the sound too. It made sense, her ears very big, two pillars of white fur that towered above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, very slowly, Sylveon turned her head, while forcing you to turn yours - along with your whole body - towards the direction where the sound came from...</div></div>",

Yours seemed to have stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, in darkness, hidden by a bush, was a pair of ice-blue eyes, staring straight at Sylveon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, of course, at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, noticing that she was discovered, Zorua walked out of her hiding spot, looking at Sylveon defiantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Hmph. What're ya doin' out of bed?</span>\" she said with contempt as she eyed the small door Sylveon had intended to reach, ready to run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">I dunno... there's an impostor lurking in our den?</span>\" Sylveon replied sarcastically as she and Zorua started walking in circles, like two wolves ready to tear each other to pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the same reason: you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylveon wanted to protect you; Zorua wanted her butt plug/paw cleaner/slave back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike reading Zorua's mind, Sylveon wrapped two of her ribbons around you protectively; you were doing your best to hide behind her head bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt like something was going to happen very, very soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour suppositions turned out to be true as Zorua, having reached a favorable position after her short walk, suddenly shot a Shadow Ball at Sylveon, who blocked it with two of her bows, before looking at the dark-type vixen... who had disappeared, cloaked in an illusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylveon thought fast while she felt you shivering in fear on her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy-type took action: a pink mist formed around her, before spreading across the garden as Sylveon performed Misty Terrain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew, that would make it harder for her to spot Zorua, but it would also make it harder for Zorua to find the door and/or her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Don't worry, I've got this!</span>\" Sylveon chimed, the grip of her ribbons tightening around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pixie carefully walked while looking around the pink mist, trying to spot Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, her search didn't take too long; after only a few minutes, Sylveon spotted the silhouette of a vixen in the mist. You swallowed a lump in your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly, she approached it, and her two free ribbons darted forward; but, as soon as they made contact with the figure, it vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylveon groaned - it was an illusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom your perch on Sylveon's head, you turned your own head, scanning the area in search of the dark-type threatening your safety - was it your imagination or air seemed to be moving towards you over there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Syl-\" you tried to call for the pixie in alert, when your world became hot and smelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">OW!</span>\" you heard Sylveon crying in pain as something bit her ribbons, snatching you from her head along with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had quite the idea of what was going on, and you were utterly terrified by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a second, Zorua opened her mouth as Sylveon retreated her ribbons, letting go of you in the process; you found yourself hovering in mid-air for a split second, before you were once again enclosed in Zorua's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">No!</span>\" Sylveon cried as she ran towards you. To her, it appeared like you were sitting in mid-air, but she knew what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, Zorua was quick and cloaked you in the same illusion, making you disappear from eyesight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHastily, the vixen turned around and started running: she had her slave back, now nothing could keep her from fleeing from the garden's back door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only it wasn't for this annoying mist - how long did Misty Terrain last?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sylveon! Over here!\" you shouted while you were being thrown back and forth the insides of Zorua as she ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to help Sylveon find you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, Zorua's large tongue rose as the vixen smacked you with, a slick whip that stroke your upper body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Keep quiet ya rat or I swear I'm swallowing ya...</span>\" Zorua hissed as she kept running, cursing you: Sylveon seemed to have heard the human she was carrying (more like kidnapping), because she was now running in her direction, she could tell by the sound of paw-steps growing louder behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua sped up, but couldn't really orientate herself in the thick, pink mist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt the leaves of the bushes tickling her - where was she going?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen soon found out in a very painful way as she ran into a tree, her muzzle crashing into the trunk; inside her mouth, you were suddenly flung forward, hitting Zorua's sharp teeth and falling back like a log.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Hold still!</span>\" Sylveon shouted as she ran towards the tree... her heart seemed to leap in her chest as she noticed that Zorua was fully visible - the impact had nullified her illusion, her focus broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua noticed too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHastily, she jumped to her paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimultaneously, Sylveon formed a ball of white light in her mouth, before she shot the Moonblast at the dazed fox in an attempt to incapacitate her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unevolved dark-type noticed it and jumped to the side, barely avoiding the attack, which caused an explosion upon hitting a tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylveon was approaching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua trembled slightly - was this the end?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the fairy-type, then she looked around, hoping to find a single way out... and, finally, the mist faded, the dark garden returning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, behind Sylveon, the back door. Had she been running in circles? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua discovered that she didn't care. She had to get out, and fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sylveon approached, Zorua did the unthinkable: she leaned forward, her dirty paws rising and placing themselves on Sylveon's silky muzzle; then, Zorua jumped past the pixie, landing straight behind her as she started running once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylveon recovered quickly and began chasing the vixen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Oh no, you don't!</span>\"</span></div></div>",

Zorua dissipated in the flash of dark, emerging out of the void and into the hallway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Oh goodness, she's out!</span>\" Sylveon shouted, you feeling her shrill voice shake your small structure.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">Espeon, are you...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">Fine. I'm fine.</span>\" she assured, paw to head. She forced herself to shake off the disorienting spell, the darkness that had hit her dissipating at her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Take the human, Espy. I'm not letting her get away.</span>\" Sylveon tried to insist, holding you poised in front of her gleaming eyes. A blink was the only answer she offered, a psychic grip forming around you. It tickled a bit, but you mostly felt wary about being in the possession of a Pokemon that had just been engulfed by a surge of darkness. The Espeon seemed to read this in you, whether it was from your expression alone or the inner-thoughts she easily could've pried, and hovered you close to Glaceon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">Here. You take him.</span>\" she said flatly, a dark-blue paw becoming your only leverage. Espeon gave you a strange look before teleporting after Sylveon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">Aw c'mon, I want to... Egh...</span>\" Glaceon gave up, mostly because she no longer had anyone her words would reach but a shrunken human. Better than no one, though. \"<span class=\"cteal\">So... some day, huh?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">It's another fake.</span>\" Sylveon said, staring exasperated at another mockingly cute Poke Doll that had replaced the once convincing form of a runaway Zorua. \"<span class=\"cpink\">How many of these things did she make...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">She's desperate.</span>\" Espeon returned in a bode of half-baked confidence. Her head ached with a dark disruptance, cluttering her clarvoyance with unhelpful white noise. \"<span class=\"clilac\">...I just can't get a read on her location.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">She's certainly.... tricky.</span>\" Sylveon said through a sigh, shaking her head with a growing bit of self-pity. \"<span class=\"cpink\">And I fell right through her tricks. Making me think she was a poor, defenseless Eevee. Oh, what was I thinking?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">There was no way for you to of known... If it was me, though...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Yeah, yeah, yeah...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">Should've just told me about her when you thought she was... scuse me... 'a poor, defenseless Eevee'. I would've saw through her the instant I walked in.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylveon rolled her eyes, turning away from Espeon. Lost in thought, she failed to immediately realize that one of her ribbons had pointed itself straight down an adjacent hall until what it was being attracted by emerged from it's dark end. The form of Zoura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Well how about this one Miss Know-It-All? Real or fake?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon batted at the orb on her head, trying to mentally clear out the pesky interference. \"<span class=\"clilac\">Well, maybe if I didn't have the worst kind of headache in history I could tell you.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">I'm going to guess...</span>\" Sylveon started to charge up an attack, eyes locked on the Zoura's own glowing slits. \"<span class=\"cpink\">...fa-</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sharp sniffle, followed by a dramatically loud bellow sounded out from the Zorua, tears beginning to stream down their muzzle. \"<span class=\"cplum\">O- Oh, please... I'm so sorry, I... I never meant no harm. I was just playin' around. Please, don-</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA harsh psychic hold seized the Zorua, stopping their dramatic show of emotion dead in its tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">Fake tears.</span>\" muttered Espeon. \"<span class=\"clilac\">Don't even need half a mind for that one.</span>\" With a slight mental push, Zorua was flung against a wall, taking down part of the elaborate banners adorning it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Geez Espy... A little much maybe?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">Oh, you're just protective of your 'artistry'.</span>\" she snarked back, though a part of her was a little guilty of the damage she had done. Not to say she wouldn't roll with it. In mere moments, she had bundled the Zorua up in a mess of the fancy clothe, making sure to keep her original hold on the conniving dark type to leave no room for them to escape. \"<span class=\"clilac\">There. No chance she's getting away now.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*CRASH*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlaceon jumped great big, the reflex shaking your entire world and making your own jump feel like nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">What on Arceus' blue Earth?!</span>\" she cried, sights set on where the sound had come from. Breaking from that still surprise, Glaceon sent you to the very familiar place against her chest-fluff, dashing out of the room in seconds. \"<span class=\"cteal\">What's going on?!</span>\" she called out, voice bouncing all over, as well as resonating so much within you than it made your ears ring. Following her own ears, Glaceon skidded through the halls until she reached the other Eeveelutions by a pile of unmounted poles and fabric, wrapped into an effective bundle. Glaceon guided you to the ground, closing the distance between her and the hopefully fruitful mess the others had made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">We got her.</span>\" Espeon chimed, perhaps a little too pleased with herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Now, now... She isn't some Joltik we were trying to drive out. We need to... have a talk.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">With her?! What's there even to say.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, personally, had a few hundred things to say to the over-sized vixen, none of them being particularly kind. You didn't really want to, though. You were perfectly content with never thinking about the Zorua, or what she did to you ever again, let alone talking to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, your focus drifted away from the argument the trio had only just begun to have. Through your countless thoughts, something caught your eye back in reality. At the entrance to the now frozen former-room of 'Eevee's', was a stray Pokedoll, a swirling portal starting to grow under it until the entire plush of a Clefairy was engulfed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was nothing in comparison to what you saw next. From the mess of banners, came the Zorua, seemingly unphased. Immediately, you felt a yell rise up in your throat. But before you could get it out, Zorua gave you a look of sheer death, pointing an unsheathed claw from a running yet silent mouth before running it along her chest-fluff to emulate the cutting of a neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe message was clear, and it chilled you to the bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Zorua dissapeared into a dimly-lit hall, and you tried to control your copious shaking, Sylveon finally set things back onto a track she had no idea was derailed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Let's just see what she has to say for herself. Maybe a little more than insults I hope.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon and Glaceon nodded in tandem. Espeon untangled the banners like they were a bow, and the Pokemon they were finally able to secure was the present. Instead of a subdued Zorua, what everyone found was something a lot more akin to a present: a single Poke Doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe halls erupted into a cacophony of voices. Except your voice which had completely and utterly escaped you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">How... was that not her?</span>\" Sylveon asked the air in shock, trying to wrap her head around it like it was the most foreign concept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">I have no idea. I.... If this headache would just stop I could find her in a heartbeat!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">Headache? Do you want me to make you an ice-pack?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">No... its was that attack. I never should've let her lay a claw on me.</span>\" Espeon groaned, before lifting her head back up to look at you. Something changed in her expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">What do we do now? She could be anywhere... Tricking anyone into believing her cruel illusions.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon let out a deep sigh, grabbing everyone's attention. Her eyes glimmered with something strange, leaving you lost in her bottomless stare. Like she was looking straight into your soul. \"<span class=\"clilac\">Human. Did you see where Zorua went?</span>\" she stated simply, almost dully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two other sets of eyes locked onto you, fully invested in your answer by Espeon's confident air alone. You felt like a deer in the headlights, cheeks burning red. It wasn't just their piercing eyes, and their awaiting ears, but <i>hers</i>.The one's you knew were somewhere close, watching and listening for what your answer would be along with that wicked smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a deep swallow, you...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then, Sylveon adopted a firm expression as she began moving towards the hall, her ribbons swinging quietly behind her as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight after Sylveon, Espeon started moving towards the dimly lit hall; after a moment of hesitation, Glaceon, whose paw you were resting on, followed, balancing on three legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white and pink Eeveelution was the first to disappear into the hall, but she soon came back into sight as all three pokemon (and you) stepped into a circular space surrounded by stone walls - no wonder, you were in a cave; several doors adorned the walls, but one in particular drew the attention of Espeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">Hey...</span>\" she whispered, paw pointing to one of the doors on the side. You hastily took notice that the door the psychic-type was pointing at was slightly ajar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever was on the other side of that door, Zorua was there too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">Hey! That's my room!</span>\" Glaceon spoke while sounding not too happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you even noticed, Glaceon, along with Sylveon and Espeon, began moving again, this time towards the open door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of them spoke during the short journey from the hall to the door; then, one of Sylveon's ribbons went to the door handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a firm shove, the door opened, revealing what undeniably was Glaceon's bedroom: the warmth seemed to disappear all of a sudden, replaced by a freezing cold air; there was a small bed in a corner, while the floor was covered in thick ice, which shined despite the room being quite dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, in the middle of the room, a Zorua sat, with an expression of terror painted on the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">You and us...</span>\" Sylveon started as she carefully walked onto the ice covering the floor.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">We need to- another!</span>\" one of Sylveon's ribbons had extended to the terrified Zorua, but it faded to reveal a poke-doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">If only it wasn't for this headache, I'd-</span>\" what Espeon would have done, you never knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">Oh!</span>\" Glaceon screamed, causing the other two Eeveelutions to look at her, noticing the ice-type laying onto the ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">I'm okay...</span>\" Glaceon reassured as she stood back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon and Sylveon, however, kept staring at her, one with an expression of confusion and the other with her jaw almost touching the ice covering the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">What? I said I'm okay! I just tripped!</span>\" Glaceon repeated, before remembering about something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">Human, are you-</span>\" Glaceon quickly understood why her two counterparts were looking at her weirdly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere was the human?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment Glaceon fell, you tumbled down your perch on her paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a brief second, you felt the cold ice making contact with you, before you were suddenly introduced to a dark, smelly yet familiar place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, you noticed that you were surrounded by sharp teeth you recognized; and you paled as you realized you were in Zorua's mouth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn eternity of trying to convince yourself that this was a nightmare passed, while things shook wildly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, after a while of Zorua doing unknown activities, her mouth suddenly stopped shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, as roughly as you entered, you were suddenly spat out of the cavernous mouth; you hit a stone wall, the saliva surrounding you breaking your fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou meekly looked up, noticing that, indeed, a certain dark-type vixen covered your whole view, panting while glaring at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Ya made the biggest mistake of your life.</span>\" she spoke with cold fury in her voice, the effect ruined by the fact she was panting from her run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Give me-</span>\" a dirty, giant paw moved to your neck, cutting off your breathing while pushing your head into the wall; at least, you couldn't breathe in the smell of her paw.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">... <i>One</i> reason why I shouldn't kill ya right now.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red paw left your neck, but stopped at an extremely short distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou inhaled deeply several times, not caring about inhaling the smell of Zorua's paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" you coughed a bit, interrupting yourself,<br>\r\n\"P-Please... I'll do anything...\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark giantess began snickering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Ya already do that, have you forgotten ya lil' rat? You're a slave - no, you're <i>my</i> slave!</span>\" she exclaimed, causing you to feel utterly humiliated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you didn't have much time to think about your feelings, Zorua was going on:<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">And d'you know what happens when slaves betray their master?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the paw inched closer to you neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head was yet again pushed against the wall, Zorua's head moving closer too, so close that you could feel her smelly breath on your body, which had turned a milky-white color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, Zorua's paw was suddenly removed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">If only ya weren't so damn useful to me, I'd-</span>\" you could only guess what she was about to say, because she didn't say it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, another voice spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Hold still!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned your head to see a heavenly sight: Sylveon, Espeon and Glaceon running in direction of the dark-type vixen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua, forgetting about you, cloaked herself behind the usual illusion and seemingly faded, though you felt the floor beneath your shaking as she ran from the three Eeveelutions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the three giantesses, Espeon ran past you without even noticing you; or perhaps she did, but totally ignored you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylveon and Glaceon stopped as they noticed you pale and covered in saliva, dirt clinging to your neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Are you okay?</span>\" the fairy-type giantess spoke worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, still too shaken to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth giantesses sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">Okay, listen: you stay here - we'll get her.</span>\" Glaceon hastily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout adding anything else, she bolted away; Sylveon gave you one last glance, before she sprinted off too, leaving you alone to think about what just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, fear made you spring back on your feet: what if Zorua came back here first? You needed to hide!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" you wondered if it was a wise choice to risk trying to find another of the Eeveelutions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be, though, a safer option to have one of them watch over you while Sylveon, Espeon and Glaceon hunted Zorua down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut... would they have been willing to help?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You didn't stew on the dilemma for long, a knot forming in your stomach at the thought of getting snatched up by Zorua like you were a toy with not an ounce of agency. If it weren't for the nippiness of the air, you would've actually been able to distinguish your chills. Wiping off your dirtied neck, you began a careful walk back outside Glaceon's room. You hugged the edge of the doorway, looking out and scanning both ends of the hall like you were preparing to cross the street. Except, instead of oncoming cars, the thing you were watching out for was a giant, sadistic vixen that probably wouldn't allow herself to be plainly seen anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breathed in deeply, bolting out of the room so fast you almost tripped on the icy ground. As the squeaking sound of your shoes sliding against ice echoed out in all directions, your need to book it only increased, bringing you to somehow run even faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know where to go exactly, though you obviously favored high-tailing it the <i>opposite</i> way to where Zorua had gotten chased off to. You just needed to find someone. Anyone, as long as they didn't have a red and black flame of fur on their noggin, and a horrible, crooked smile. <i>Anyone.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour run stopped just as quickly as it had started at a close-by noise, soft on your ears. A gentle humming. Like you were ease-dropping on someone's shower. You followed the song to a strange sight, one that contrasted with the rest of the cave with its untamed display of nature. A twisting spiral of tree roots, creating a crevice that looked just barely big enough to squeeze an Eeveelution through, but perfectly manageable for someone of your size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure what awaited you, but you weren't going waste your precious time preparing yourself for it. You were starting to get used to things happening without having done any steeling of yourself before hand, and that trend didn't seem like it would be stopping anytime soon.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit of a trek through a jungle gym of roots and vines, you emerged in a more homey place, kitted out with decorative flora, grown-over furniture, and wooden adornments along the wall, seeming to be created out of the wood that encapsulated the place itself. The whole den looked like it was inside of a tree, carrying the rustic scent of sawdust and magnolia. Coupled with this, was the song that continued to hum out, now sounding closer than ever. But before you could identify where it was coming from, it stopped, replaced by a soft gasp. You felt a strong sense that you were being watched. Watched from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped, turning your head upwards to discover that the room had a bit more to it than you had thought, reaching up tall with pales and pots holding finely-kept flowers within intricately designed holders, everything bathed in an orb of sunlight. Something else up above shone bright, too, though it froze you up instead of warming you. The two eyes of a similarly motionless Leafeon, seeming to be stuck in the state of catching up with the sight of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Y- You... You're that shrunken human,</span>\" she simply said, breaking her silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were cut off by the grass-type leaping from her perch onto a small bed in the corner, kicking up a sweet smell into the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Are you... alone?</span>\" she asked with a tilt of the head, stepping down to your level and lowering her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallowed a lump in your throat. \"Right now... Yes, I am. B- But there's a reason I came in here, I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, you were interrupted, this time by a feeling of suction around your body. Leafeon was sniffing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">You smell... really bad.</span>\" she stated bluntly, nose wrinkling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. There's kind of a long story to that... If you're willing to hear it out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeafeon blushed a bit, retreating into herself. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">I already know some of it...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do?\" you returned with a hushed sense to my tone, legitimately surprised.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe backed away even farther, her cheeks only continuing to bloom roses. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">A- About what happened... With you and Glaceon.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was your turn to blush, connecting the dots almost instantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N- No, no! It wasn't that... Well it was partly that, but.... uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, losing your voice under her unreadable glare. After a moment though, in your flustered silence, you saw, and felt, that glare soften. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">You seem stressed</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, call this one a psychic type because we've got ourselves a mind-reader.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am. I've kind of had my life flash before my eyes like... six times in the last hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Leafeon's eyes lost their hard to interpret cloudiness, bleeding into something at least curious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Six times?</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... might be exaggerating a bit.... Or maybe I'm being generous, I.... can't really tell anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeafeon started to return to her previous proximity, ears poised like leaves as sharp as knifes. At the very least, you had her attention. And maybe that was all you could ask from the shy grass-type after wandering into her tree-den without any notice and clashing its pleasant smell with your own heinous one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a deep breath, you decided to tell her everything that had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And... then I heard your singing, and.... yeah... I came in here.\" you finished, judging the reaction of what had mostly stayed a silent audience, if not for a few gasps and gags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer expression remained hard to read, not too metallic to be cold, but not too deep to look truly and utterly concerned. She seemed bashful, if anything, a light pinkness remaining on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">You heard my singing?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot the first question you expected her to ask, that's for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah...\" You stuttered a bit, trying your best to not miss a beat after such a tonal whiplash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe prodded at the leaf atop her head, turning a reddened cheek. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Did you... like it?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost couldn't help but chuckle, opting to let out a puff of air instead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y- Yeah, it was... nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeafeon simply smiled, and as pleasant as you wanted the thought of just indulging in a casual, if a tad awkward conversation to be, your state of fear and continued recovery from your near brush with death kept it an exasperating one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, look... I need your help, okay? Zorua is unpredictable, and I don't think she's going to leave unless she gets me back in her paws... And with how I gave away where she was hiding... she's probably going to be even rougher to me if she ever does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeafeon visibly winced at this, clearly just as troubled by the thought as you were.

Such crevice led to an impressive garden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua grinned, while the voices of the three Eeevelutions grew louder behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey weren't going to find her in such maze, she thought as she squeezed herself through the crevice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard someone humming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeafeon, judging by the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, Zorua ventured deep into the literal jungle, until she came to a halt as she noted a cream/green pokemon, kneeling over a few plants, tail wagging.

Espy is right, we've got to search for Zorua first... If she has the human, we'll get him as well...</span>\" Sylveon paused to look around, glancing from the entrance to Leafeon's room to the straight hall that led to Vaporeon's room, to her own room and, further, to the living room the Eeveelutions shared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">I know what you're thinking, and it's a good idea.</span>\" Espeon said, looking to a confused Glaceon.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">Let's split up - I'll check Leafeon's room. I have more possibilities to find that Zorua in there.</span>\" the psychic-type smugly said as she squeezed herself through the crevice without even waiting for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylveon and Glaceon looked at each other, sighing deeply, before proceeding further into the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up, hearing a familiar tune being sung.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes opened into two tiny openings as you glanced across the garden, noticing the giant Leafeon humming to herself once again, her back turned to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled a bit as you watched her, feeling quite soothed for the first time since you set foot in this cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Havin' fun?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach hair on your body sprang up as you heard <i>her</i> voice beside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a mere whisper, but it was enough for you to recognize Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou instinctively looked to your side, finding nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, Zorua was there, you could <i>feel</i> her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't reply, you didn't move, your eyelids sealed themselves as you desperately tried to give the vixen the impression that you were still asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">I know you ain't sleepin', lil' one,</span>\" Zorua whispered and, judging by the hot, smelly air that assaulted you from an imprecise point beside you, she had leaned in closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">D'ya know what happens now?</span>\" she whispered, before quickly adding,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Don't answer.

And if you try to shout, you'll discover how bad I can really be.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallowed, but remained still as a hot and smelly wave assaulted you; Zorua had opened her mouth, which was ready to take you in...</span></div></div>",

He's just startled... stupid fluff ball, my head is killing me...</span>\" Espeon groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shot an annoyed glare, despite the fact she was right. Aside from the near heart attack you just experienced, you were relatively unharmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly, the timid Leafeon extended a brown paw, halting it in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, you climbed on top of the soft back of her paw as she brought it up to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I... I thought she was going to eat you...</span>\" she mused. You wanted to tell her that Zorua's idea was more or less, but no sound came out of your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeafeon continued,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I'm... glad that you are fine human,</span>\" she said, her muzzle cracking up a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes lingered on the grass-type Eeveelution for a moment, before you sheepishly returned the smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" you said, while Espeon rolled her eyes, before emitting another groan of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before she could further complain about her headache, Glaceon and Sylveon returned to the garden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with a knot wrapping itself around your stomach, you noted the lack of a certain giant fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Nothing. She fled again.</span>\" Sylveon confirmed your thoughts with an annoyed huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlaceon remained silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy-type looked at you on Leafeon's paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer expression softened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Are you alright?</span>\" Sylveon asked as two ribbons hovered towards you, wrapping themselves around your waist before slowly removing you from Leafeon's paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pixie held you in front of her face, and you noted that the serenity and cheerfulness she showed when she gave you the tour of the cave were gone, replaced by a stressed look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Yeah. I'm fine...\" you replied as the pink and white giantess nestled you in her chest bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God...\" you muttered, not even the silky smooth fur being able to comfort you.<br>\r\n\"She wants me... she's going to kill me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought alone made you go white as Sylveon's own fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua spoke her threat, next time you ended up in her paws, she was going to eat you, like Glaceon did, only you probably weren't going to be so lucky as you were in the ice-type's own digestive system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeafeon perked up, approaching Sylveon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Don't worry, we'll keep you safe!</span>\" she exclaimed with a faint shade of pink spreading across her cheeks.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I-I mean... you need protection, or that horrible Zorua will take you again and will... will eat you...</span>\" you had forgotten that Leafeon was present when the dark-type spoke your sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how? With those damn illusions of hers... I'm dead, I just know it.\" you sourly replied while trying to shake off the dreadful image of you melting away in a pool of gastric acid inside Zorua's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind went back to when you had been trapped inside of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was already horrible back there, being in her stomach couldn't be any better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">Don't be stupid human, we'll get her.</span>\" Espeon declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Yeah, we won't let her take you. We gotta stay positive, little one!</span>\" Sylveon chimed, though you could tell by her tone that she was trying to self-convince of what she was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlaceon seemed to finally perk up again, ears shot upwards as she rose her head to look at the other three Eeveelutions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">Speaking of,</span>\" she mused,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">Shouldn't we go after that Zorua again?</span>\"</span></div></div>",

We were giving the human a tour of the cave!</span>\" Sylveon hastily lied, recalling that the tour ended hours ago with your disappearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon immediately took great interest in you, and rushed in front of Sylveon to observe you up close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Hey, aren't you that little guy Glacey ate before Espy sent you in her bladder and she peed herself while you were still inside?</span>\" she asked without even breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, your cheeks flared up; Glaceon's did too as she shot another glare at Espeon, who smirked smugly, struggling to not laugh in her ice-type counterpart's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm... yes?\" you replied while Sylveon sighed and Vaporeon began laughing merrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">That was hilarious!

Dinner's ready!</span>\" she exclaimed cheerily and, without adding another word, she turned around and began trotting away, leaving you and the four Eeveelutions behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm...\" you began, still blushing massively from her unspoken comment and her recalling of what happened with Glaceon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... She's certainly...\" said ice-type grumbled something under her breath, causing Espeon and Leafeon (though very quietly) to snicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... <i>Energetic</i>,\" you finished, causing Sylveon to sigh,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">You can say that...</span>\" she muttered, before a soft smile appeared on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about to reassure you that she and the others weren't going to let Zorua take you again, but she then shook her head: your mind was off that subject right now, bringing her up wasn't a wise move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Let's go get something, okay? Then you can get some sleep.</span>\" she whispered softly as she began walking to the exit of the garden, followed by the other Eeveelutions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">You look like you could use some.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had no idea how right she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile sitting at a table in front of Sylveon, with all the Eeveelutions present - especially Vaporeon, who kept staring at you with that playful grin of hers glued to her face - you learned how quickly today passed while you were being subjected to Zorua's cruel tortures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was morning when you first entered the vixen's rear, afternoon when you came out hours later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlaceon, Sylveon, Espeon and Leafeon had silently decided to not tell anyone about the the intruder that was currently lurking around in their den, you could tell by the fact that none of the gigantic Eeveelutions had looks of stupor or anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of them didn't seem to mind the presence of a shrunken human at their table. In fact, they seemed like they hardly noticed you: Jolteon, Umbreon and Flareon chatted with each other while eating, Espeon and Glaceon listened to Vaporeon with almost bored expressions on their faces; only Sylveon and Leafeon seemed to be fully focused on you as you ate the bits of food that the first had given you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the dinner, and of the evening, passed quietly, while some of the agitation deriving from Zorua's threat began to wane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, you were riding on top of Sylveon's head, nestled in her head bow as she walked through the hall that led to her bedroom, followed by the the three Eeveelutions that knew about Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">You know, I was thinking,</span>\" Sylveon said, abruptly halting while causing the three other pokemon to halt as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom your angulation, you could see a bit of Sylveon's face, her baby blue eyes were fixed straight on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">... The human should sleep with one of us. Y'know, that Zorua seems to want him...</span>\" she recalled, causing you to pale as you remembered the vixen's threat once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I absolutely agree with you.\" you replied, more than happy to have a giant, fully evolved guardian for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts were however distracted as Espeon walked past the fairy-type,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">Good night.</span>\" she said, disappearing behind a corner while causing you and Sylveon to sigh simultaneously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon didn't really seem fond of you, you thought as you were reminded that you were here because she wanted to eat you herself when she first brought you here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe probably lost interest in the thought because the idea of eating someone who had been through someone else's digestive system was repulsive to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlaceon offered an almost dejected shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">He can't stay with me, he'd freeze to death. So... count me out. See y'all in the morning.</span>\" she explained as she too began walking away, back into her room with ice-covered floor and frosty air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat only left you with two choices: either Sylveon or Leafeon, who currently wore a blush on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I'm fine with it...</span>\" she muttered quietly, only you able to hear her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylveon smiled,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">I'd be more than willing to help you out, little one,</span>\" she said, her cheerfulness coming back after being away for most of the day; her gaze went straight back to you,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">And you?

I won't let that Zorua get you again!</span>\" she exclaimed cheerfully, before she too started marching again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...\" you muttered in response as you held onto the Eeveelution's head bow, feeling slightly reassured; but at the same time, you couldn't shake off a bad feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt like you were constantly watched, and not by the Eeveelutions that decided to protect you; no, you felt <b><i>her</i></b> eyes following every little movement you made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua could be invisible and right behind Sylveon right now for what you knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought made you shiver, but Sylveon kept going, unaware of your current thoughts, quietly humming to herself much like Leafeon did earlier today, drawing you in her garden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while where nothing was said, Sylveon halted her walk in front of a closed door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Hey, wanna end that tour I was giving you?</span>\" she asked cheerily, trying to keep your mind off things.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Little one, welcome to-</span>\" the door was opened by one of Sylveon's ribbons, revealing its insides to you,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">My room!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like entering a dream or a tale book, you thought with amazement as you wondered if you were really inside of a cave. All these Eeveelutions were surprisingly civilized for pokemon, there was no denying that, but this was incredible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, everything looked soft and fluffy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was almost entirely occupied by a large white bed, which was in time occupied by several pink, blue and as well white pillows; the floor was pink-carpeted and the air inside carried a sickeningly sweet scent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike... cotton candy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany of the fancy-looking pillows were scattered across the floor. Sylveon didn't seem to be one that liked disorder, so you assumed those pillows had their place on the floor for a purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe place was a bit dark, but there were candles all over the place, though you didn't need light to see; this room seemed to sparkle in darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy-type giantess grasped you with two of her ribbons, which coiled around your waist, and lifted you from her head, bringing you in front of her big blue eyes. The humongous oculars sparkled excitedly as their owner stared at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">So? Do you like it?</span>\" Sylveon asked, her voice carrying a childish excitement as well as a hint of proudness.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">I made everything in here! Even the bed!... Not the candles though, those are still Leafeon's.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite everything being quite girly, you couldn't say you didn't like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah,\" you stuttered, amazed that Sylveon managed to make this all by herself.<br>\r\n\"The place looks really nice Sylveon. It looks very comfortable in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant fairy-type smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Glad you think that, little one,</span>\" she said,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Because this is were we will be spending the night!</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white and pink Eeveelution made her way to the oversized bed and jumped on top of it, the silky texture shaking under her weight. Sylveon gently put you down, and you discovered that the bed was incredibly soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it looked anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour giant guardian got comfortable, before she laid down next to you, paws folded under her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Well then, sleep tight human, and don't worry. Everything's gonna be fine.</span>\" she reassured you, her face inching closer to you as she nuzzled your whole form, before retreating to her original position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't reply to that, still feeling somewhat bad despite the amazement reigning in your emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all your struggles weren't enough to fight back the fear you felt, you simply couldn't get rid of it, not when you knew about a certain sadistic vixen that was currently lurking around out there, waiting for you or your guardians to lower your guard to get her paws back on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... Heck, for what you knew, Zorua could be hiding in this same room right now! Grinning behind her invisible cover, waiting until Sylveon drifted off to sleep so she could snatch you and carry you away undisturbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mere thought was enough to send chills down your spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, like she had detected your negative feelings, Sylveon opened her eyes to look at you, noticing your startled expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Can't sleep?</span>\" she asked in a sweet, almost motherly tone,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">I feel you. I know you're afraid little one, I am too,</span>\" her ribbon reached out for you while she said this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silky smooth ribbon wrapped around you yet again and gently pulled you closer to Sylveon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">But you don't need to worry, I promise I'm not letting anything bad happen to you, okay?</span>\" she reassured cheerily, before she nuzzled you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smile on her face widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">If you'd like, I'll help you sleep, too.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could wonder about the meaning of her words, Sylveon raised her head a bit; the ribbon holding you hovered directly to it and it placed you right under the fairy-type's chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Sylveon's gigantic head came back down, nestling you in between her face and her paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo anyone, this would have seemed like an uncomfortable position to sleep, but you found that you were comfy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylveon's smooth fur was all around you, her soft embrace warming up your whole being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flushed red, but couldn't deny that you felt slightly better. Sylveon's presence alone seemed to be like a comforting aura around you, an impenetrable barrier inaccessible for bad thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Sleep tight~</span>\" the fairy repeated, her eyes closing once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, you emulated her and laid your head against her fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, sleep came to claim you, and you happily followed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopefully, everything was going to be okay.</span></div></div>",

She was waiting from you to wake up the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Hello again, lil' rat, did ya miss me?</span>\" the dreadful voice of Zorua spoke in a whisper as she leaned in even closer to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">I believe we had some... unfinished business. Waddya say if we take care of 'em now?</span>\" the vixen whispered again, grinning devilishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only response you wanted you give was a scream that would have surely enough awakened Sylveon, alerting her of the third presence in her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, your vocal chords seemed paralyzed by fear, and you couldn't do anything but watch with sheer terror as the giant dark-type moved one of her red fore-paws towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anything happened though, Zorua shot an uncertain gaze at Sylveon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she woke up, Zorua herself would catch hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of thought, the vixen shot you a second grin before her form vanished, cloaked behind the usual illusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were finally able to swallow the lump in your throat as you gulped in fear, watching as Sylveon's head suddenly rose from your tiny body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pixie smacked her lips in her sleep, but didn't wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a newfound courage spreading through your body, you attempted to move, wanting to hide underneath Sylveon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, before you could even attempt to do so, you felt a wave of hot air assaulting you once more, before you felt something sharp scratching your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoughly, you were picked up from under Sylveon's head, which was delicately placed back in place by the invisible Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at your pixie guardian with a sense of dread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was your last chance to yell to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou inhaled deeply to scream, but no sound came out of your mouth. Why couldn't you scream!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua seemed to read your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Don't even think about screaming, shrimp, or I'll bite your head off.</span>\" she whispered through her clenched teeth, which were currently holding you by the front of your shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began trembling as Zorua began walking towards the door, you hanging from her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Take one last look, lil' rat, before I make ya regret squeakin',</span>\" that cold whisper filled your ears again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-Please...\" you stuttered while you moved dangerously close to the door of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou figured that Zorua was headed outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Nice try, lil' one, but you ain't gonna fool me this time. I've given ya too many chances already. But don't worry,</span>\" you could practically feel Zorua's grin widening behind you,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">We're gonna have a little fun first. Ya'll learn your place... and then I'll show you it to you - my tummy!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, you heard the stomach of the vixen grumbling softly at the mention, causing her to snicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-Please, do-don't...\" you begged,<br>\r\n\"I'd be more useful alive than dead, no?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">You'd make a darn good snack too, and that's what's gonna happen.</span>\" Zorua repeated as she finally reached the door of the room, which was slightly ajar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened it without making a noise, before she slipped outside and closed the door again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, the dark-type reappeared, staring at you with a cold smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to do this... I'm sorry!\" you tried, trying to talk your way out of this mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, what will you achieve by killing me? Sylveon and the others know about you anyway, you'll only made them more angry if you kill me.\" you spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe statement caused the vixen to slow down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human had a point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe really wanted to teach him his last lesson, but if she did, those annoying long-eared dogs that inhabited this cave would double the efforts to find her and would probably send her right after the human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua felt conflicted, but she didn't take long to make a decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at you once more as she resumed walking properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe usual whisper began coming out from her gritted teeth as she communicated your sentence,</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Zorua had a way of making your heart sink to the point where its rampant beat felt like it was rattling your whole form, and putting air into your every breath not second too late, you had to give her that. You knew that she knew it, too. If you had already resigned to your deemed fate as the unruly vixen's plaything, and lost the will and the care to be utterly demoralized by half the things that come out of her cavernous, foul-smelling mouth, you doubt she'd be having nearly as much fun with you as she oh so clearly was even behind her steely cover. It's like she feasted on your fear, and perhaps even more so... your humiliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now, she was tearing you away from your cozy, cotton-candy scented refuge, fiercely firm in her promise of literally devouring you once and for all. And it was the most terrifying, humiliating thing in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you really don't care at all about getting a target put on your back, then? Being hunted down for the rest of your life sounds fine to you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">For the rest of my- Pft, ya kidding me?</span>\" Zoura sneered, pulling you ever closer to her maw seemingly by the strength of her derisive snorts alone. \"<span class=\"cplum\">You'll be old news to those rats in a week. Maybe the one with the ribbons will harbor your death as some lingering guilt since... well, it is sorta her fault I got in here in the first place, but otherwise... I'll have already long gotten you out of my system, and they all will keep living out their sad lives, struggling to remember what you even looked like.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery time her invisible teeth poked a fresh set of holes into your already ruined shirt, your inborn fear of her maw as a mere carnal hazard started to mix more and more with something a lot more sickening. The words that were whisking through those teeth and out of that dark pit of a mouth, as sharp any full set of teeth threatened to be, stung a whole lot on their own, and you could only hope that was the lengths of which her mouth would sting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scariest part is that you couldn't really know. The gargantuan dark-type that had you ensnared was nigh impossible to predict on everything but the fact that she would never cease to make your life a living hell, even if meant doing so until there was nothing left of that life. She could decide to graze you with a few of her chompers if she felt so inclined. It wasn't exactly a worse pain than digesting in her gut, you could only imagine. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"T- They won't... They won't forget about m-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Can your crisis for a second,</span>\" she snapped, getting you to do just that by her tone alone. Her voice was still hushed however, saving her from getting caught and your ears from getting blown out. Perhaps it was worth getting your hearing shot as long as Zorua was caught, you realized, though you still couldn't say the same for getting your head bitten off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Mm, smells like another rat,</span>\" she mumbled to herself, sending a jolt of hope through your hanging body. Maybe you could be saved yet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could even slightly get your hopes up beyond anything more than that, though, you felt yourself get pulled back into a wet. dangerous cavern you've grown to be horrifically familiar with. But this time, the consequences for being tucked away into such an awful place were all the more dire, and not because of the familiar fear of getting eaten alive, but because the already dwindling chances of being discovered before Zorua made it out of the cave were severely hurt. Her body remained invisible up until the point where you were actually <i>within</i> a part of her, you realized the moment you slipped past her gums - a situation only a shrunken human like yourself could afford the disgusting, smelly, stomach-churning \"luxury\" of experiencing. You were caught under Zorua's own devilish blanket of invisibility, completely against your will. And dang it, you wanted to be seen! To be found! To be <i>rescued!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot a second after your saliva-drenched body flared up in anger, you were tackled by the Zorua's tongue, becoming somehow even more slathered in disgusting, foul-smelling oodles of the stuff. With your eyes glazed, and mouth hacking to distinguish your own saliva from the nasty pokemon's ever-plentiful supply, you had no real choice but to cling to the fact that your ears still worked. And there was something to listen in on past the sickly sound of spittle and a slimy tongue, albeit an incredibly muffled something. It was still distinguishable, though. Familiar, even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">You really didn't see anything? Anything at all?!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">I- No... I don't even think I woke up before.... h- he was gone.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon and Sylveon! They were close! Close enough to hear even beneath the hefty tongue of Zorua! Your heart started racing from a pulse of adrenaline rather than the fear and humiliation your honestly surprised hasn't stopped the organ all together at this point, and you felt that pulse help you put all your might into trying to push up at Zorua's tongue. And for a mere second, all of that minuscule might actually felt like it was working, until it all came crashing back down before you could blink... literally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch an easy shunning of your efforts sent a harsh message, too. Not just that of how weak and feeble you were, but somehow, coupled with what you could only detect as a hissing laugh in the back of her throat, you got a more nuanced impression than that. Past fighting off the mobile, pink, crushing snake that was her giant tongue, what chance in the world did you have of escaping her mouth? Not only was it guarded by an always at the ready set of life-threatening spikes, but the seal her lips created alone was nothing short of unbreakable with your body soaked in such thick fluids. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEscape was impossible, and unless Espeon's headache had finally cleared up, chances of Zorua's sneaky, nearly imperceptible self getting found out were slim to none. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">She had to of left a trace... somewhere. Is your head clearing up? C- Can you feel anything around?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">I...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused for a painful while, an agonizing wait for both Sylveon and the close-by shrunken human she didn't even know was such. At least, maybe she didn't know. Something about how long she was taking filled you with a sense of hope as you deeply held your breath, seconds feeling like the most excruciating of minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...<span class=\"clilac\">do!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart leaped, the vixen you were trapped within picking up the pace considerably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">W- Where? How close?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted so desperately to shout exactly how <i>close</i>, knowing that with every second that slips by, that closeness becomes less and less close. And unless you did something about it, the feeling Espeon was catching would fade as the pair of Eeeveelutions' words slowly did from what you could hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">\"<span class=\"clilac\">I can't tell... It's hard to concentrate right now.</span>\"</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike hell you were going to let that happen, you thought with another surge of confidence. Perhaps Zorua had shifted her priorities from messing with the human in her mouth to running as fast yet discreetly as possible, perhaps you were just that invigorated, but you managed to topple Zorua's tongue, only boosting your confidence all the more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">\"<span class=\"clilac\">Wait, it's stronger! It's a feeling, I think. O- Optimism, almost...</span>\"</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">\"<span class=\"cppink\">Optimism?</span>\"</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">\"<span class=\"clilac\">Confidence, perhaps... It's somewhere by the entrance!</span>\"</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasped a bit in time with blast of air from Zorua, not even caring about the rancid smell it brought to you. Espeon was sensing your emotions! She could find Zorua, and free you from your turmoil before it truly starts! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the speedy dark-type was making scary amounts of headway through the maze-like cave, and unless the Eeveelutions were quick on the draw, the vixen could still manage out into the wild before they even caught wind of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought scared you, but it was confidence Espeon was sensing, so you suppressed the fear as fast as it had bubbled up, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">\"<span class=\"clilac\">This way, quick!</span>\"</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to anyway. Some part of you pressed that you would be insane to trust in a spacey psychic-type Eeveelution's fickle ability to feel your very emotions, and couldn't help but consider something drastic in your fear. Something that betrayed your swell of hopeful confidence, as well as Zorua's terrible-meaning wishes. To scream at the top of your lungs for help, even if it meant having your head bitten by the teeth just before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you know it didn't. There was no way Zorua would make such quick work of you after all of the build-up. ...Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you heard a distant yet all too close gale of wind from the outside world, and the close yet all too distant yelling of two scrambling Eeveelutions, you realized that it was now or never to submit to a side of yourself. Trust or complete desperation.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sylveon was far beyond horrified to care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, you traveled down a tight, fleshy passage that smelt obnoxiously; the stench of the Zorua's past meals stung your nose, and the sticky saliva invaded each and every inch of your body, but you couldn't care less about these facts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind was instead completely focused on another, more important fact - <i>you were just eaten!</i> Again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerrified, you tried to look downwards, noticing that your descent towards the vixen's stomach was being rather slow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you could just...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn idea sprang up in your mind, you could still save yourself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHastily, you spread out your limbs, pushing them against the walls of Zorua's esophagus in order to halt your fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, it seemed to work, and you found yourself snugly wedged between the fleshy walls; but your incoming wave of relief was pushed back down in the pit of your stomach as Zorua gulped once more, sending saliva raining on you as well as making the esophagus slippery enough to cause your arms and legs to slip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith terror showing itself again, you noted that your descent has resumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeneath you, a sealed opening gaped open, revealing a lake of colorless steaming liquid waiting for the incoming meal - you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could do nothing but tremble in fear as you slid down, past the gaping hole, splashing into the \u2018pool\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe opening sealed tight after your entrance, blocking one of your ways out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou emerged from the lake of gastric acid and spat out some of the liquid, sitting in the middle of the empty stomach in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua's once threat became a reality, and very probably the last reality you'll ever live: she had swallowed you, dooming you to a nearly certain fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour brain worked crazily to try and find a way you could use to escape this fleshy, steaming hell, but every way you could think of seemed simply impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed defeated, swimming back to one of the walls of the stomach, waiting for your fate while also surrendering to the atrocious reality: you didn't know what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill hovering in mid-air but no longer tied by Sylveon's ribbons, Zorua watched with deep satisfaction as Espeon waved a paw in front of her immobilized fairy-type counterpart's face, trying to remain calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Your friend there doesn't look too alright, ain't I right?</span>\" the vixen snickered, earning a simple response from Espeon,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">Shut up.</span>\" the psychic-type told, before returning to Sylveon,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">Syl-</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pixie seemed to spring back to life all of a sudden,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">That's it!</span>\" she exclaimed, scaring the hell out of Espeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the psychic-type Eeveelution could recover from the surprise, Sylveon moved in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Teleport, Espeon!</span>\" she ordered,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Teleport the human out, like you did with Glaceon!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylveon's words sank into the other Eeveelution, who blinked, before shaking her head in an almost resigned fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">I can't.</span>\" she bluntly told, pointing to the trapped Zorua with a paw,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">She's not like Glaceon. She's a dark-type, teleport wouldn't work. It's already a miracle I'm being able to hold her.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylveon's ears dropped; Zorua laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">That's right, ya rats!</span>\" she taunted,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">So might as well let me go, no? Your lil' friend down there will come out eventually... just in another form!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe comment only made Espeon glare and Sylveon snarl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">Let you go?</span>\" the psychic-type parroted back in annoyance,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">Fine. But on <i>my</i> terms!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the invisible grip holding Zorua began spinning her around in circles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen barked in protest as she began gaining speed, more and more speed as Espeon got ready to launch her across the forest. And finally-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\"><b>STOP!</b></span>\" Sylveon shouted a second before Espeon could throw Zorua away like an old rag doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">We need her. We could still get the human out.</span>\" the fairy-type explained to her confused counterpart, who slowed the dark-type fox down, leaving a very dizzy Zorua hovering several feet away from the duo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">There's no way we could, Sylveon. Unless we beat him out of her, but I refuse to lay my paws anywhere near her.</span>\" Espeon smugly told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Ugh... right back at ya...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylveon sighed, her kind mind fixed on what you were experiencing right now... if you weren't already reduced to nothing but a bloodied corpse traveling across the Zorua's digestive system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shuddered at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Let's... let's wait anyway,</span>\" she suggested, her cheeks growing a shade of red,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">... He could make it... y'know, like with Glaceon?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon winced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">Disgusting.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgainst what Sylveon had imagined, you weren't dead yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour held your breath as your body bathed under the surface of the digestive juices, which were starting to give off a tingling sensation, but you didn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA newfound idea to escape this hell had come in your mind a while ago, and you were now trying with all your might to pry the hole leading to Zorua's intestines open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gross way out, but the only one available, you mentally told yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was no easy task: the sphincter was shut, and it was giving no signs of wanting to open anytime soon; it was like nature itself was trying to stop your efforts to get out of the Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tingling sensation became stronger each second more you spent in the stomach, causing you to pound on the opening in desperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point though, you ran out of breath and had to surface, taking in a disgusting mouthful of the foul smelling air that lingered in the stomach before diving again, resuming your work on the sealed opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point, the acids began burning your skin, suggesting that the digestion has started; but, at the same time, the hole seemed to give away a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mentally cheered, but it wasn't done just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuick, you didn't have much time left...</span></div></div>",

In the stomach of a random Zorua, only because you made the mistake of agreeing to doing that stupid tour!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fought back tears, your hands desperately trying to open up the hole, just enough for you to slip through so you could save yourself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if fate itself was listening to your prayers, it decided to finally show mercy: just as the acids became unbearably hot, the hole suddenly shot open, as if having developed a mind of its own and wanting to help you in your escape from its sadistic, murderous owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you knew it, you were sucked through the opening; you were plunged into a damp, slick and slimy place. The fleshy walls pulsed slowly around you, like they were trying to chew Zorua's latest meal again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hole sealed tightly behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAir, albeit foul-smelling and utterly disgusting, began filling your poor lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisgusted, exhausted and with the acids leftovers still burning your skin, you began wiping the tingling liquid off your skin, tiny, colorless droplets splashing onto the already wet walls of Zorua's small intestine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly when your body began feeling slightly better, you let yourself fall on your rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would have gladly continued on your quest to get out of the vixen who had eaten you as soon as possible, but you simply couldn't move anymore, your wave of adrenaline  having died down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeaten, half-dead and tired from your struggles and the lack of sleep, you laid there unmoving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou needed rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Is he still alive?</span>\" Sylveon asked anxiously, worried for her little friend's fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had woken up earlier, only to find that the human she intended to keep safe was gone; in a matter of minutes, she had gotten Espeon who, albeit annoyed because she was woken up, was more than willing to chase Zorua down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid vixen snickered deviously, her laughter striking both annoyance and fear into the poor fairy-type Eeveelution, and only annoyance into the smug psychic-type that wished nothing more than to throw the little vixen across the forest with a psychic flip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Wouldn't count on it too much if was ya, believe me.</span>\" Zorua chimed in, only to get a simple reply from Espeon,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">Shut it, you creep.</span>\" she coldly stated, before focusing her psychic powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of her being a dark-type, sensing Zorua was complicated; but the tiny presence inside of her wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon wore a surprised look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">R-Relief...?</span>\" she stammered in confusion, <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">Fear... hope... the human is-</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">He's alive!</span>\" Sylveon exclaimed happily, relied seeping in her body - her human friend made it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for your current host, she fluttered in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't believe it.  And how could she? The human was supposed to be nothing but a bloody mess right now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylveon's related expression fell back into a frown as she stared Zorua down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Now, let's wait,</span>\" she addressed Espeon without making eye contact, her eyes fixing a stern glare into Zorua, <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">And when he comes out, we'll see what to do with her.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon wore a rather menacing grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">I have quite a few ideas what to do with that little creep...</span>\" she hinted cynically, causing the vixen to gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't go to be her best outcome... unless she came up with something real smart real quick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't keep the human to escape,  and she couldn't keep these two rats from getting him back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could, however, still come up with something to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she wasn't going to give up on the morsel in her intestines. She would eventually come back, get the little human back and make sure he was good and deceased the next time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEndless hours of being trapped in a slick, smelly and absolutely disgusting passage passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Zorua's small intestine, you eventually slipped into her large intestine; the moment you did, the muscles became tighter and clamped down on you like hungry maws. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuite surely, you passed out from exhaustion at some point, waking up after what had to be several hours later, you could tell by your current environment tighter than even, rectal fluids entirely covering your body; but what caused your body to swell with joy was the tight, puckered opening that laid not too far from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrenaline spread through your body like a shockwave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot want to spend more than a few seconds more in here, you hastily began crawling through the last of Zorua's (luckily) empty digestive system, which took quite the effort due it being extremely tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly after several minutes, you managed to reach the opening, which easily towered above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGingerly,  you reached out for the imposing anus and touched it, trying to open it to get out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, outside, your current host  grunted as she felt an odd feeling - nature's call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">D-Damn ya...</span>\" Zorua mumbled, sweat beginning to roll down her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon, who, alongside Sylveon had stayed awake all night, turned her head in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">There it is.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylveon didn't reply, but waited, expecting to see your body popping out of the vixen at any moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd eventually, it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large hole in front of you opened, allowing the faint light of dawn to peek inside for a brief moment, before your body was gripped by the large anus which, pulsing slowly, began pushing you out of the dark-type fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face went first, followed by your whole head, then chest, torso, waist and, eventually, lower body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGravity worked against you, dragging you down in a great fall towards a patch of slightly damp grass, which cushioned your landing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned, sore from the impact and in general, while the vixen you were ejected from panted above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after your landing, you felt something oddly soft coiling around you, like a soft blanket, which began rising you up in the air... since when did blankets fly on their own?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes opened, your view filling with a comforting sight - Sylveon, whose ribbons were holding you in front of her, although at a a foot from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard to see why, given the state you were in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">There you are.</span>\" she spoke softly, almost motherly. It was like you were a baby pokemon that had just hatched from the egg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Are you alright, little one?</span>\" the giant fairy-type asked, causing Espeon to huff in disgust beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">You mean, aside having just been-</span>\" the psychic-type trailed off, disgusted, though slightly relieved to see you alive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shot the psychic Eeveelution a glare, before sighing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah... kind of...\" you replied to Sylveon's question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylveon's smile faded, and her eyes shifted on the red-faced Zorua, who fluttered there, held by Psychic, shooting the two Eeveelutions and you a glare, a silent declaration of contempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">As for you...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, Espeon firmly stepped forward,  staring the vixen straight in the eye,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">Allow me.</span>\"</span></div></div>",

And... good night.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too.\" you replied, feeling uneasy: Sylveon's disappointment was palpable. Leafeon, who was quiet throughout the whole conversation, muttered a quiet 'Good night' before turning to walk in the opposite direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft behind, Sylveon waited for the grass-type to disappear behind a corner before sighing, having lost the little human she grew so fond of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe may have had his reasons, she thought while she too turned to walk to her bedroom, but she still was disappointed about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilently, Leafeon walked across the cave, towards her garden; her tiny passenger was being just as quiet as her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked past a few other Eeveelutions  and eventually arrived to the opening in the roots that led to her garden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">You might want to, um, lower your head.</span>\" she advised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou followed what she said as she squeezed herself through the small opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scent of grass hit your nostrils as Leafeon started to venture deeper into what was a jungle to you; the Eeveelution avoided what remained of a pot that was previously broken by Espeon to stop Zorua, deciding she was going to clean the mess later on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now, she had someone she wanted to talk to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and Leafeon remained silent for the rest of the trip to the end of the garden, where the pokemon's bed rested in a corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing vaguely, the grass-type Eeveelution jumped on top of it, nearly throwing you off of her head, which she then lowered slowly, letting you climb down onto her muzzle and on then on the bed, right in front of her humongous face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, that sinking feeling of powerlessness showed up, causing you to take a step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you noticed that Leafeon was blushing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">So... why me?</span>\" she bluntly asked, her creamy cheeks growing a deep red shade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou too blushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess... because you'd be able to keep me safe. You've done it once...\" you admitted, before smiling awkwardly, <br>\r\n\"Now that I think about it, I've never said thanks...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeafeon smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">It was nothing, really,</span>\" she replied, though you could tell she enjoyed being thanked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">So now... we should go to sleep. You've had a long day, haven't you?</span>\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can say that.\" you replied, before feeling a huge weight in your heart: Zorua was still out there in the den and, until she was finally caught, this long day you've had was gonna become a routine you feared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to mention that the vixen was now after your head...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiscomfort assaulted you and led you to look down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeafeon noticed this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">You're afraid...</span>\" she stated the obvious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bit your lip and nodded, before glancing up again, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can I not be? She wants to kill me and I can't do anything about it, Leafeon. It's... frightening.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green giantess remained silent for a couple moments, pondering the right choice of words to reply to your confession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Maybe not you,</span>\" she said in the end, leaning in closer, <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">But you have us. We'll eventually get her before she gets you, you don't need to worry... <i>too much</i>.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words so kindly spoken made you feel slightly better. You managed to crack a smile and look up at the towering Leafeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green giantess flushed red and returned the smile, before she began moving on the bed. She settled down and moved one of her brown paws towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Come on, let's go to sleep now.</span>\" she repeated; her paw slid behind your back, her soft pad pressed against your back and pulled you closer to her muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot without having blushed again, Leafeon pushed you up against her cheek and laid still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Try to catch some sleep. Good night.</span>\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... good night, Leafeon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quieted down, letting yourself enjoy the warmth and smoothness that surrounded you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes closed and, shortly after, your mind drifted off to sleep from the exhaustive day you've had.</span></div></div>",

It contrasted nicely with the horrible nightmare you had awoken from, you having been entrapped behind a certain fennec's canines, very nearly suffocating under oodles of spit and an unrelenting wave of palpable heat however native it was to your subconscious... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe that's why you woke up - you <i>did</i> suffocate, your subconscious not even bothering to humor the idea of depicting you slipping down into the monstrous pokemon's gullet, either out of pessimism that you'd even make it that far, or because you had tucked the idea of getting swallowed up by Zorua so deep-down that your nightmares couldn't even be bothered to tap into it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps that was for the best, anyway. Had the nightmare taken you farther down into the dark-type, you couldn't imagine you would've woken up as relatively composed as you did, and you didn't want to have to trouble a sleeping giant so late at night...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you bothered to unfurl your body, though, and looking around on the expansive bed you laid on, you realized there was no 'sleeping giant' to trouble in the first place. You were alone on the stretch of fabric, the lingering imprint of where the Leafeon had slept off most of the night being the only trace of her. Had you not known any better, you would've assumed she left you alone in her room all together, but you <i>did</i> know better. You already felt her gaze from up above, meeting it quickly with a slight rise of embarrassment. Though, by the look in her eyes, and the rosiness to her cheeks, it was evident you weren't the only one feeling such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">S- Sorry, did I wake you?</span>\" she whispered like there was still a sleeping human to be mindful of, paws pattering on her perch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you're fine. Just... didn't like where a nightmare was headed, I guess.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething changed in the Leafeon's eyes, a drop of caramel spreading in the hazel of her irises, before she closed them all together. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">...Was it about... erm... Y'know...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou puffed. \"You would <i>think</i> my brain would be a little more subtle, but yeah... It was about her. <i>Way</i> too much about her.\" you said, pulling down on a part of your face with a palm like it would smooth out your stress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I- It wasn't that she was just the villain in some bigger story?</span>\" Her head dipped lower, paws coming off the end of her oaken perch. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Nobody else was there... It was <i>all</i> her?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...She ate me, Leafeon. All the dream was is me getting gobbled up by her and drowning in her saliva. Because apparently even in sleep I can't have a break from thinking what she's going to do when she gets her paws on me.\" you let out, throwing up your arms with enough vigor to already make you want to curl back up and doze off again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeafeon grimaced before jumping down, sending a familiar scent out into the air as well as bouncing you up like the bed was a aromatic trampoline. Sure sounded like a place where you could never have a sour thought, but your mind begged to differ ten times over, addled by the brief nightmare that, even so, acted like a gift that kept on giving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, a gift like what a Delibird would give, except in this scenario there were a hundred Delibirds and they were all throwing presents at you relentlessly without a chance of any of them healing y-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">You okay, little one? You look... spooked.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh yeah... Psychic-type</i>, you thought with bleeding sarcasm, though you were earnestly glad to be broken from your own inner-hysterics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just.... I don't know if I can keep going like this, Leafeon. As long as Zorua's still out there... as long my life is constantly on the line... I don't know if I can bring myself to feel safe. Even here, in your... tree-den... garden thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled a bit, leaves loosening up from the blades they were beginning to become.. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">I like that... <i>Even</i> in here.</span>\" she let out just barely, a fresh couple of roses blooming by her small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is nice in here, I'll admit. It... smells both like a forest and bouquet of flowers.\" you complemented with buds of your own forming on your face, wishing you could just leave it at that and bask in the sunniness of the Eeveelution's reserved yet affable reaction. \"B- But Zorua's already proved she can get in here, and there's no way she's going to let me slip through her paws again. It's not like this place is any safer than it was last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Who says?</span>\" came a familiar voice, so sudden and considerably louder than Leafeon's own hushed tone that it caused you to jump like you had been bounced again. You felt your heartrate return to its previous speed as you looked to the where to voice had come from. Heck, maybe it even settled back to normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough a doorway was another hollowed out tree filled with a intricate pattern of flowers, and at its center were a trio of familiar Eeveelutions, except with a few additional features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">W- Wha... Hey, don't pick my flowers!</span>\" Leafeon cried, leaves rustling in a surprising showcase of frustration. You supposed if there was anything that was going to get the timid gardener to raise her voice, it would be three of her company picking some of her flowers and putting bunches of them in their fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">C'mon, what'd you expect? You're the one you who made us take an all-nighter in your treehouse just so we could.... What is it we're doing here again?</span>\" Glaceon turned to the Espeon and Sylveon, a periwinkle drooping out from behind her ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">We're here to protect the little guy, of course! Plus, Leafeon, us wearing flowers will help distinguish us if Zorua tries to pull another disguise. Little one, I'm only the real Sylveon if I have hibiscus in my bow, petunias at the ends of my ribbons, and a hollyhock in my tail, mhkay?</span>\" she sang, flaunting her features and their freshly-added flowers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oka-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">Oh so noo~oow it's about distinguishing you from Zorua. I thought you wanted to 'embrace what makes you unique from other Sylveon'.</span>\" Espeon snarkily butted in, though she too sported a few purple flowers of her own, excepting two stray instances of black and blue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Says the one who-</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rolled your eyes, managing to tune out their conversation and return you focus to a pretty frazzled looking Leafeon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">S- Sorry, they can get kind of rowdy sometimes.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... used to it. I'm just surprised they even agreed to this. Well, I'm surprised Glaceon and Espeon agreed, Sylveon I get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">....It was my idea, actually.\"</span> she murmured, that familiar pink tint returning to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" You were legitimately taken aback, especially considering how bashful the grass-type typically was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Yeah, I... I guess I couldn't stand you getting caught by that monster again. Especially if I was under my watch... I.... tired my best to just sleep my worries off, but when I did manage to doze off... I had a really bad nightmare.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded quickly, ears poised and eyes held near-shut. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Sorry I didn't tell you. I figured it would only make you more scared if I told what happened in it.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'm sure I could've handled it... I mean, they're just dreams right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeafeon paused at that, letting her tail sway as if she was mulling something over. \"<span class=\"clgreen\">Yeah.... that's the thing.</span>\" She lowered herself to your level, giving you a good enough look at her hazel eyes to see the striking concern at their centers, perhaps the solidified form of the sap spreading within them before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I don't think it was just an ordinary dream, little one. Nor was yours. The dream I had... all I saw was that Zorua. You weren't even there...  It's like the dream wasn't even coming from me. Especially not because.... the Zorua, she had this horrible grin on her face.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't see how she <i>wouldn't</i> be smiling like that in a nightmare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I- It wasn't just the smile, though. It was her <i>eyes</i>. It's like she knew I was seeing her, and the fact of that alone was pleasing... Like she had gotten just what she wanted simply by being there...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, it clicked. No wonder the nightmare felt so haunting, so suffocatingly Zorua-centric. She'd found a way into both you and the Eeveelutions' dreams! She was using your own subconscious to remind you of her and your fate at every sleeping moment!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did she... God, isn't haunting me during the daytime <i>enough for her?!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat borderline cry is what finally caught the attention of the arguing Eeveelutions in the other room, replacing their back-and-forth with utter silence. Slowly but surely, they made their way closer to Leafeon's bed, settling down just at its side. They each wore a distinct expression on their face. Sylveon's was one of bewilderment mixed with worry, mouth slightly agape. Glaceon's was a dull as ever, but there was some worry wading around in the pools of her half-lidded eyes. And Espeon's seemed... almost knowing, eyes glistening with some strange form of regret. So many eyes on you and not a single word spoken. That was until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally made it!\" called a voice from the entrance, getting everyone to look at the new Eeveelution that was just barely managing to squeeze through the passageway of tangled roots. It was... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If the purple giantess could read your mind for just a moment...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">What's wrong?</span>\" Sylveon asked concerned, <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">You look like you've seen a ghost...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't reply, but looked at Espeon intently, without speaking a single word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of them seemed to understand your line of thinking, but Vaporeon could easily be a smart disguise for the devilish Zorua you've narrowly escaped earlier today. She had no flowers on her, but you couldn't tell if she was Zorua or not, because Vaporeon came by after Sylveon explained her plan. You probably just kept Glaceon from telling Zorua, saving yourself if your supposition was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the Eeveelutions gathered around you, wearing concerned expressions... annoyed in Espeon's case, since you were staring at her like you would stare at a certain vixen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">What?</span>\" she asked, finally taking notice that something was wrong with you; seeing that you weren't speaking made her feel annoyed,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">Aw come on! Out with it!</span>\" she exclaimed, nearly deafening you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't obey and Espeon sighed in frustration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeafeon seemed to understand though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, she leaned forward, her muzzle stopping right in front of you,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Have you seen... <i>her?</i></span>\" she whispered, so that only you could hear what she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeafeon blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">What's wrong, then?</span>\" she asked, concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped, giving up your plan to get Espeon to read your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leafeon...\" you whispered,<br>\r\n\"Vaporeon...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">What's up with the human?</span>\" the Eeveelution you were trying to warn the others about spoke to her counterparts in an annoyed fashion, interrupting you while causing Leafeon to look back at the water-type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">He's acting weird! That's weirder than that noise I heard on my way here! When I went to check, there was nothing!</span>\" she exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, the attention of everyone was on the blue pokemon; the others adopted astonished expressions.

You didn't see it that way since Espeon got you in this cave, though you've been in contact with definitely friendly Eeveelutions such as Sylveon and Leafeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe proposal itself didn't sound bad, but it was very odd when spoken from a pokemon to a shrunken human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right...\" you conceded. Vaporeon's smile shrank into a sweeter expression.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Great. You'll see, we're gonna be the best friends e-</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Vaporeon?</span>\" a familiar chiming voice interrupted,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">What are you doing?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">Eugh, I bet she's trying to make the human surf on the ground.</span>\" another voice sarcastically spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon's ears perked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Now here's an idea!</span>\" she spoke while eyeing a quartet of familiar Eeveelutions approaching both her and you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylveon, Espeon, Glaceon and Leafeon all stopped near the latter's bed where you and your blue guardian have been. You noticed that all of them wore different expressions: Sylveon looked worried, Leafeon dejected, Glaceon deadpan and Espeon carried an annoyed expression on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any luck?\" you spoke, Vaporeon shooting you a curious look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylveon simply shook her head in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">We've searched around, but there was nothing. I think you were hearing thighs, Vaporeon.</span>\" Glace on addressed her water-type counterpart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">I'm sure I heard something...</span>\" Vaporeon replied, cocking her head to the side,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">What's with you all, anyway? You look like you've seen a ghost-type.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response to that, the gaze of the four Eeveelutions landed on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got the message after a little bit: they all wanted to know whether it was safe or not to assume Vaporeon was really Vaporeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave a quick nod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylveon sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">It's nothing, Vaporeon, we're fine. Just... here...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Hey, stop that at once!</span>\" Leafeon complained as she watched Sylveon extending two of her ribbons to pull two colorful flowers, placing them behind Vaporeon's ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Hey, that does look cute! Thanks!</span>\" she cheered<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy-type yawned in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">I need to sleep.</span>\" she declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">Same here.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">I wouldn't mind that...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling cut out, you decided to find yourself a corner on Leafeon's bed and try to catch some sleep yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the moment you found a spot for yourself and laid down, the whole bed shook beneath you and a shadow was cast over you: Sylveon had jumped on and was staring at you with a smile as well as a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">I'm afraid that won't do, small one,</span>\" she said, leaning closer to whisper in your ear,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">If we're gonna protect you, we'll have to do that the best we can, no?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Yeah?\" you replied, seeing no holes in such logic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylveon's blush became brighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Well, it'll be harder for that pesky Zorua to get you if I just do this...</span>\" she said, one of her ribbons coiling around you and bringing you to its owner's chest bow, where she nestled you before laying down,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Good night.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but blush a bit, feeling like Sylveon's been looking forward this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... good night...\" you muttered while another landing made the bed quake again: Leafeon joined the other two Eeveelutions and you on top while Espeon and Glaceon simply remained at the bottom of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive, fully evolved pokemon against a lone, still unevolved one would be a pretty unfair match, you mused, but at least you'd be safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom your 'cage' you shot Leafeon a look, noting that she was staring at you with a gaze that told 'Everything is gonna be fine' and a small smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled back, silently thanking her for the encouragement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you close your eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after, sleep claimed you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike before, when your sleep was tormented by a certain vixen, you managed to sleep soundly throughout the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Sylveon was the one waking you up by gently shaking your body with her ribbon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou moaned softly, then yawned and, in the end, opened your eyes to stare right into the azure ones of the white and pink giantess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Oh, hey...\" you greeted, somewhat relieved you were still with her and that those blue eyes didn't belong to Zorua, <br>\r\n\"What time is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">It's morning.</span>\" she replied. You noted she was displaying an unusually serious expression and you could clearly see through her forced smile. You also noted that everyone else around you was still asleep as there were a cream and green giantess and a blue one still snoozing on the bed next to where you and Sylveon were standing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Listen,</span>\" she said to you as she lowered herself a bit so that she wouldn't wake the others,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">I woke you up because I wanted to talk. We need to discuss options about... well, you of course.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frowned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still thinking about her?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Don't tell me you aren't...</span>\" Sylveon replied with a sudden frown. You were suddenly reminded of your nightmare and agreed with her, <br>\r\n\"Good point. But what should we do? That Zorua is really tricky and won't stop until she gets me and...\" you interrupted go yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">She won't.</span>\" Sylveon said, nudging you with her muzzle,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">And, as for what we should do... I was kinda hoping you'd have a suggestion...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\" you replied, <br>\r\n\"I don't know this cave like you and I never had to deal with giant pokemon before so... I'm just as clueless as you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylveon sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Great.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, both of you went silent, and the silence, interrupted only by the snoring of the other four Eeveelutions, was fully broken when the fairy-type one spoke again after two minutes,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Wait, I think I've got an idea...</span>\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know how to get her?\" you asked, your interest perked; sadly, Sylveon shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... About what, then?\" you asked again, disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Hey, not everything is gotta be about her now, does it?</span>\" she remarked, before wearing a smile,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">And I'm thinking...</span>\"</span></div></div>",

Heck, you didn't even have a clear idea of their gender yet, though you seemed to remember them being male. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUmbreon didn't seem to mind you since he hadn't spoken a word about you while you were eating with the Eeveelutions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't like you were a friend, nor you were a foe. You were simply indifferent to the black furred titan, perhaps a nuisance so little you could just be ignored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeafeon was the first to speak up,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">U... Umbreon?</span>\" she stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red-eyed Eeveelution shook the dirt off of their fur, before finally speaking,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Ow... dude, you should make that opening bigger...</span>\" he moaned, looking behind himself, <br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Wonder how you can even squeeze through that...</span>\" he muttered afterwards, ears twitching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was silence for a few moments, everyone just looking at the dark-type Eeveelution, too busy contemplating what he could possibly be doing here at such hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was honestly no surprise that Umbreon was still awake, though his being here did raise a few questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy he was here seemed a good one to begin with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Umbreon finally noticed that everyone, you included, was simply staring at him, he turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Well? What's with everyone? Why are you just looking at me?</span>\" he asked, a bit annoyed by the stares everyone were giving him; that's when he spotted you on Leafeon's bed and said,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Oh, there's the human. Hey dude.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were surprised to be addressed so casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...\" you shakily replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">Umbreon.</span>\" Espeon finally spoke up, sounding politely firm,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">What are you doing here?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">I could ask you the same,</span>\" Umbreon replied, though there was no hostility in his voice, only, if you had to make a guess, a disinterested curiosity,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">I just came back from my walk outside and I heard y'all talking, so I decided to come and check.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">Ain't you a lady killer?</span>\" Glaceon commented teasingly, causing the dark-type to roll his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Oh, ha ha.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the conversation among the Eeveelutions began warming up, you just kept staring at Umbreon in silence, having no place in their conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe seemed friendly enough, at least from the way he greeted you and from the way he talked with the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a detail that caught your eye: the complete lack of flowers in the giant's black fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinct immediately let you jump to conclusions and told you that his may have been a trap of a certain illusion-crafting vixen whose objective was to catch you, but then logic prevailed. Certainly, Umbreon could not know about the strategy Sylveon and the others made up, so he was justified...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr was he not? This could still be only a convincing fa\u00e7ade, though you didn't want to point your finger until you were sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around, noticing that Leafeon was being very quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Leafeon,\" you called, getting her to fix her hazel eyes on you,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">Hm?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou motioned for her to lean closer, which she did, lowering her massive head towards where you were standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">What is it, small one?</span>\" she asked in a concerned you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallowed your fears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen. It's only a concern I have, but...\" you shot Umbreon a stare,<br>\r\n\"What if Umbreon... is not actually Umbreon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeafeon turned her head to stare at you, perplexed, until she pieced it together and got the picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">You're not saying...</span>\" she muttered, looking at Umbreon for a moment before her gaze returned to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWordlessly, Leafeon got back up and walked over Espeon, whispering in ear for a couple seconds; the psychic-type looked at her her grass-type counterpart, before frowning and looking at Umbreon, who was talking to Sylveon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">So... what's with the flow-</span>\" he was saying, but got interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">Hey Umbreon!</span>\" Espeon called,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">What were you doing this morning, huh?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUmbreon blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">This morning?

Why?</span>\" he asked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon didn't relent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">Oh, I dunno... been chasing a small human lately?</span>\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUmbreon looked beyond confused now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">You mean, him?</span>\" he asked, pointing a paw at you,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Why would I chase him? Especially not after he came out of Glacey's-</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">Shut up!</span>\" Glaceon roared, her cheeks flaring up, while Sylveon made a disgusted face and Espeon began laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs an argument began, Leafeon and Espeon walked back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">There you have it.</span>\" the latter commented with a smug smirk,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">That's undoubtedly Umbreon.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, if you're sure...\" you replied, guessing these giantesses could recognize Umbreon more than you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, he was no Zorua...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn idea sprang up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But hey, now that he could help us,\" you said to the two titanesses,<br>\r\n\"He's an all-nighter, isn't he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clgreen\">He is.</span>\" Leafeon agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, why not have him search for Zorua? She wouldn't expect him to search for her, right? You just gotta tell him...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeafeon and Espeon looked at each other, silently pondering your suggestion, before looking at Umbreon, who had resumed speaking the others normally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe your plan was worth a shot...</span></div></div>",

I didn't see her...\" you hesitated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon looked at you, skeptical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a brief second, time seemed to stand still as the eyes of the psychic-type glowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you felt a lingering pain in your head: Espeon was trying to force herself inside your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grunted - she was having a hard time. Normally, a human wouldn't be able to resist mind-reading, but Zorua's attack weakened her powers; to make things worse, the human was afraid - no wonder why, shrunken and between three giantesses - and his fear kept her out of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed as she decided to give up, her own head was killing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon looked at Sylveon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clilac\">Let's go. Zorua must be somewhere around here...</span>\" she said, Sylveon nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth pokemon turned around and sprinted at the same time. Glaceon was about to do the same, when she realized that you were still being held against her chest by her paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bit her lip - she had to give you to someone else if she had to go after Zorua too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking nor talking, the ice-type started walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft alone in her hiding spot, Zorua snickered, listening carefully to check if any of her three chasers were close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirked, and slowly came out, cloaking herself in an illusion as she, once again, became invisible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the vixen started walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... where are we going exactly?\" you asked Glaceon, who was walking in a hallway.

I'm going after Zorua too.</span>\" she revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at her, momentarily forgetting the death promise you were made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what about me?\" you asked, wondering how Glaceon was going to chase the dark-type vixen with you kept against her chest. Plus, you were starting to feel really cold, and Glaceon's paw, as soft as it was, was pressing against your exposed chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ice-type didn't answer: she was looking in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">Oh, Flareon,</span>\" she asked, suddenly nervous. Your own gaze traveled forward too, and you took notice of the fire-type Glaceon mentioned, coming your way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the red pokemon with creamy fur could talk, Glaceon released you and placed you on the floor as gently as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">Do me a favor - watch him.</span>\" the blue pokemon hastily said, without waiting for an answer as she turned around and sprinted away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at the point where she was not even a second ago, blinking, not quite sure of what you just saw happening before your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, you turned around and raised your head to look at the looming, confused-looking Flareon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... ehm...\" you paused as you noted something weird: Flareon was grinning at you devilishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Hello there.</span>\" he spoke with a frighteningly familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paled and backed up as the red pokemon shrunk, his - her - fur changing color as it went from bright red and creamy to black and dark red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA yell rose from the depths of your heart, but it was pushed back down your throat by a red paw pinning you down before it could even reach your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">And so ya didn't rat me out... good, good lil\u2019 rat.

For a moment, Zorua's smirk faded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Because your purple friend was <b><i>this</i></b> close-</span>\" she opened an extremely tiny space between her toes, giving you a clear visual of the dirt that once again clinged to her paw,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">...To finding me. I had to play it safe... but now, that's not important.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paw was removed from your body, but it was replaced by something worse: Zorua's mouth, which darted towards you, opening wide in the split second before it reached you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, you were plunged into the dark insides of her fang-filled oral cavity, which she closed around your fragile form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to scream - not that it would have made any difference except for making Zorua angry - but you were silenced as you received a disgusting mouthful of saliva which fell from the fleshy ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spat it out as your surroundings started to shake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua, now back in the body of Flareon, was walking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, she only had to find a place to hide in this incredibly spacious cavern. She didn't want to go back into the forest and, until someone found her again, she could hide in here freely... having more perverted \u2018fun\u2019 with her human slave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden realization: since she fled from there... and it was technically a secret... no one was going to check the room where Sylveon hid her for two days before your arrival, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking, the \u2018fire-type\u2019 started walking towards the secret room, you uselessly struggling in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, the vixen encountered none of the Eeveelutions that resided in the cave and, eventually, Zorua reached the very familiar secret room...</span></div></div>",

Zorua, currently cloaked with illusions \u2014 in the guise of Flareon \u2014 thought her plan was infallible. To her, the red-orange puffball\u2019s brains were as fluffy as his fur. Zorua reckoned the other Eeveelutions thought the same. Any excuse would be a plausible excuse. She always had one.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And even if she was caught in here \u2014 who cares? It was easy to play dumb. Especially if others expected you to be dumb. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Zorua\u2019s swagger paused mid-stride. She had entered her former room and spotted the guest she least expected to see.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cborange\">Wow\u2026</span>\u201d Flareon said. A Fluffy Tail he was doing who-knows-what with dropped from his mouth. <span class=\"cborange\">\u201cIt\u2019s like looking in one of Glaceon\u2019s ice mirrors!</span>\u201d He paused to quizzically tilt his head. \u201c<span class=\"cborange\">Only it\u2019s<i> not me\u2026</i> it\u2019s me but not-me\u2026</span>\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Zorua looked to him, stupefied.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cborange\">Hello Not-Me!</span>\u201d Flareon cheerfully greeted. \u201c<span class=\"cborange\">So, are you like another Flareon who just happens to look like me? Or are you\u2014<i>gasp</i>\u2014my long-lost twin brother!</span>\u201d  Flareon transitioned to a clearly-audible stage whisper, \u201c<span class=\"cborange\">Haha! I knew I had one! <i>Suck it Jolteon!</i></span>\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For the first time in her life, Zorua couldn\u2019t think of something to say. All she did was pin you against the ridged roof of her mouth. You squirm, beating your hands against the muscle. Her slimy tongue squashed your resistance with a callous squeeze and a pretty clear implied threat: <i>squeak and you\u2019re sleeping with the fishes I ate earlier.</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cborange\">Y\u2019know, I always wanted to answer this question: what is the sound of one paw clapping? If we both use our right paw, it should be the same paw because we\u2019re the same person, right? So, if we both\u2014w<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">a</font><font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">a</font><font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">iiitt\u2026</font> why aren\u2019t you talking?

A deft movement of her tongue kicked you into the pocket of her cheek. You bounced off the fleshy wall and fell into a murky puddle of slobber. A cage of fangs separated you from the rest of her maw.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cplum\">\u2018Naw.</span>\u201d Zorua said, moving her mouth little as possible.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cborange\">Oh!</span>\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cplum\">I\u2019m...uh\u2026you.</span>\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cborange\">I knew it!</span>\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cplum\">...from the future.</span>\u201d At this, Flareon gasped.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cborange\">If you\u2019re from the future, you know everything that\u2019s going to happen! What am I going to eat for breakfast tomorrow?</span>\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cplum\">The same thing ya ate yesterday.</span>\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Flareon\u2019s eyes went wide. \u201c<span class=\"cborange\">Just like I did the day before\u2026</span>\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Zorua grew impatient. \u201c<span class=\"cplum\">Look \u2014 I\u2019m not here to play Q&amp;A. I\u2019ve got, uh, serious business. Saving the world \u2018n stuff.</span>\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Flareon\u2019s tail wagged like a cotton ball in a windstorm. \u201c<span class=\"cborange\">Me? Saving the world? I\u2019m so cool in the future!</span>\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cplum\">Ya, and I gotta ask ya to leave. To stop timey-wimey stuff from happenin\u2019.</span>\u201d Zorua cleared the doorway and put on her coolest face. She was really starting to get into the role, as weird as it may be. \u201c<span class=\"cplum\">And you gotta pretend nothin\u2019 happened here, you see? Paradoxicals\u2060\u2014or something, y\u2019know? If others find out, the future changes and I go <i>poof!</i> And I\u2019m you, so yeah.</span>\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Flareon jittered with excitement. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cborange\">You got it, me! If anyone asks where I\u2019ve been, I\u2019ll just say I was here,</span>\u201d Flareon points a paw to the ground, \u201c<span class=\"cborange\">and saw nobody but myself!</span>\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cborange\">...Good boy.</span>\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And with that, Flareon picked up that Fluffy Tail and sauntered away. Zorua didn\u2019t say a word until the pitter-patter of his footsteps faded into nothing. After an infinity of waiting in your dark tuna-scented pocket, a surge of warm air blasted past you as Zorua spoke at last.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cplum\">...that boy ain't right.</span>\u201d She said before spitting you onto the cream-colored carpet. Landing with splatter, your arms were weighed heavily with slobber.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cplum\">You\u2019re not gonna run, are ya?</span>\u201d She said smirking and wriggling her toe pads in front of you. You shielded yourself as bits of dust from between her toes rub off and flutter down, sprinkling you in the strangest shower. A cruel chuckle bubbled up Zorua\u2019s throat.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cplum\">That\u2019s what I thought.</span>\u201d she said. She retracted her forepaw and laid down in front of you, front legs tucked under her neck-fluff. Her head was far too close for your comfort. You could feel the warmth and moisture of her breath wash over your like a rolling cloud.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cplum\">Look, pipsqueak: I\u2019m gonna get outta here and you\u2019re comin\u2019 with me. The rest of the folk here are a bit wiser than Sizzles there. My silver tongue don\u2019t work with a mouthful. So, the whole carryin\u2019-you-in-the-mouth-thing, that\u2019s a no-go.</span>\u201d A devilish smile cut across her face, \u201c<span class=\"cplum\">but y\u2019know first-hand there\u2019s more places to keep a rat, hmm?</span>\u201d Her black-and-red tail whipped behind her. She sniffed.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cplum\">Y\u2019know the first rule for travelin\u2019 with pets? Make sure they\u2019re nice and tuckered before you do any of that travelin\u2019. I\u2019m a stickler for the rules, so I\u2019m gonna make sure I do a nice number on ya.</span>\u201d You saw her lick her fangs from behind her gums.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWait!\u201d you plead, \u201cyou don\u2019t have to do that!\u201d Zorua doesn\u2019t even flinch. She simply licked the back of her paw and grooms the little hair-tufts on the side of her cheeks.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cplum\">I know I don\u2019t <i>have </i>to,</span>\u201d she said nonchalantly as paused her grooming and looked you in the eye, donning a paper-thin mask of uninterestedness. \u201c<span class=\"cplum\">...But I really do want to.</span>\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A gleam in her eye filled your veins with ice. \u201cIs there anything else you can do?\u201d You managed to say.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cplum\">Hmm, no. But you can do something.</span>\u201d She went back to licking the back of her paw.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Desperate, you ask, \u201cwhat is it? What do I do?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Zorua donned a warm smile, more fake than a counterfeit portrait. Once more, she put a stop to her grooming and gave you a little wink. She sat up on her haunches with a small grunt.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cplum\">I\u2019m feelin\u2019 a little tired myself. Evadin\u2019 eight Eeveelutions ought to make anyone tuckered. You understand, right?</span>\u201d It\u2019s then when you notice you do not like how far her legs are spread apart\u2026.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cplum\">Anyway, you need tirin\u2019 out and I need some energizin\u2019. So,</span>\u201d she said as her paw dipped down to her nether regions, \u201c<span class=\"cplum\">you\u2019re gonna do the hard work for me.</span>\u201d Zorua\u2019s smile melted into something diabolical, \u201c<span class=\"cplum\">Now get over here and put some fire in my blood.</span>\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You wanted no part in this. You took a single step back before Zorua clicked her tongue in disapproval.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cplum\">Y\u2019know if you\u2019re not feeling this we could always do somethin\u2019 else.</span>\u201d She sighed mockingly. \u201c<span class=\"cplum\">But I have a feelin\u2019 you ain\u2019t gonna like what else I\u2019ve got in store\u2026.</span>\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You <i>really </i>didn\u2019t want to give in to the vixen\u2019s perversions, but was it worth risking her cooking up an even worse torment?</span></span></div></div>",

With a look, she commanded you to come closer. You obeyed. Her gaze lingered on you as you approached\u2014piercing, oppressive. It rivaled that of a Mean Look. Though Zorua can\u2019t learn Mean Look\u2014it didn\u2019t matter to you. Its effect was the same: you had no chance of escape. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As you stood between her red-and-black legs and faced her gray belly, you look up: at her. Really, you just wanted to look anywhere but <i>there</i>.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Zorua was hiding it well but her mouth was watering up from anticipation. She swallowed. It was louder, more obvious than she intended. She decided to use this moment.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cplum\">Heard that, rat? You better do a fine job. Mess up, and instead of here,</span>\u201d she gestured to her nethers, \u201c<span class=\"cplum\">you\u2019re gonna drown in here.</span>\u201d She patted her stomach with a soft plumpf. For a moment you thought to say something clever, but you repressed it with a swallow of your own.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Zorua smirked, \u201c<span class=\"cplum\">Nothin\u2019 smart to say? Good. Toys don\u2019t talk. Rats only squeal. Get to work.</span>\u201d Her final words hit with a gravity like from another world and sucked your soul into a black hole. Like a lifeless puppet, you broke eye-contact and walked forward and placed a hand on the furs of her crotch. Biting your tongue, you brush her fur to find what lay behind the undergrowth. All the while, the strangest thought cropped into your head: you can\u2019t believe how soft her fur is\u2026 Only Sylveon\u2019s was softer\u2026.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You stared her vulva in the face. For a moment\u2014strange as it was\u2014you were unsure of what to do. Were you really just going to <i>crawl in?</i> Behind you, Zorua\u2019s left paw began drumming impatiently. You made your choice before Zorua could make it for you.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You stuck your hand in. Disgust creeped up your arm like a contagion. Zorua pleasantly hummed above. The drumming stopped.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You take a deep breath, ignoring the mind-clouding scent. Your other arm grabbed the side of her sex stretched it open. You could easily fit.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Zorua\u2019s tail thumped behind her. In impatience? Excitement? You didn\u2019t dwell on it. You just shoved yourself in.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Halfway in, halfway out. Walls of slick flesh, drenched in foul fluid, assaulted you. They tried to snatch you away from the outside world like that of a starving beast swallowing long-awaited scraps. Zorua moaned as her tummy flattened, trying to curb her desire. She wanted you to do the work, afterall.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You\u2019re still only partially within. You wriggled yourself in deeper\u2014all the way. Every movement you made the tunnel twitched, convulsed, or pulsed.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Zorua breathed deep as her heart and tail had a drumming competition. This feeling she felt. This <i>conquering </i>feeling. She ruled you. You had no choice but to obey. At this moment, she was your queen. With a twitch she could make you bark. With a word she could make you submit. And her breathing, the sound of rushing blood\u2014those were the only sounds you heard. She was your world.<br>\r\nYou were claimed. A tunnel of love never felt so devoid of care. Crushing, compressing \u2014 unpleasant. The air: sultry, steamy \u2014 oppressive. The innards of her cunt constricted around you as the vixen moaned.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cplum\">Mrawr,</span>\u201d she purred. Her sigh came from all directions like the voice of a goddess. \u201c<span class=\"cplum\">Oooh, thi-this is <b>good</b>. I g-gotta get up. Gonna make this better, real good...</span>\u201d You didn\u2019t have the energy nor the mindspace the process what she said. You\u2019re just trying to survive. You felt a sense of vertigo as Zorua must\u2019ve stood up all fours. You pound your fists against the wall and only make things tighter as Zorua bucked her hips.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After a hellish infinity, you heard faint shuffling from outside. Zorua was moving something? Pushing things? Grabbing something? Your questions were answered as you sensed Zorua arch her back and tilted her behind toward the floor. Your confinement whipped as Zorua\u2019s bottom hurtled toward the floor. A brief glimpse of light, Zorua\u2019s vagina opened. An ivory stick lunged toward you. You narrowly avoid being skewered as the cavern around you squeezed with an infamothable tightness, leaving you pinned between the interloping object and the wet walls.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c<span class=\"cplum\">Oohhhhh,</span>\u201d Zorua couldn\u2019t contain herself. Beneath her was a Pok\u00e9 Toy fashioned in the likeness of a Mincinno\u2019s tail. She took ragged breaths as she rocked her bottom up and down, up and down. Her belly pressed in and out, crumpling and relaxing as her privates grew ever tighter. She felt you squirm, struggling against your new hell. And it drove her up the wall.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Everything was dark, wet, and tight. Up and down you and Zorua went. The toy, slick, glided out and in\u2014far deeper in Zorua than you\u2019d ever wish to know. A crushing pulse rocked Zorua\u2014threatening to make both you and Zorua pop. Then it happened again. And again. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Orgasm encroaching, Zorua tried to block to dam the flood best she could\u2014but she knew it would burst. In her final act, she slammed her bottom to the ground. And then she let the flood free.<br>\r\nA tsunami of fluid crashed into you like an unstoppable wake. A heart-melting tingle washed over Zorua. Her tongue free from the confines of her mouth, her privates throbbed as she came.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Afterwards, she sat there. Her bushy tail brushed the carpeted floor as she basked in the afterglow.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThat rat is <i>good.</i>\u201d She had to get out of here. If she avoided the Eeveelutions and managed to keep you\u2026 the fun would never end! But how can she escape? What was her next course of action?</span></span></div></div>",

Ten... nine...</span>\" she maliciously began a countdown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you interrupted her by the count of 'six', in which point you spoke, defiant,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want fire in your blood?\" you asked rhetorically, taking a step back,<br>\r\n\"Yeah, not happening.\" Zorua frowned for a moment at the mention, before smirking again, amused by your act of defiance, which she would enjoy crushing; she opened her mouth to speak, but you spoke before she could,<br>\r\n\"However, I have other methods to get you wet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">What's that supposed to m-hey!</span>\" Zorua exclaimed with another frown as she saw you turning and sprinting away while she was still standing on her hind legs,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Where d'ya think you're goin', ya rat?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA boom erupted from behind you, confirming that the vixen fell back on all fours; you ignored her and kept going at your top speed, headed for the door, not stopping even when you heard booming steps behind you - Zorua was giving chase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she was having a hard time keeping track you, whose body nearly disappeared within the strands of the creamy carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sped up. No matter what was going to happen, you were NOT going to become a pet for this vixen. After all, what did distinguish you from one was your brain, which would free you of Zorua's torment if everything went as planned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrowning, with her teeth gritted, the dark-type watched your small body reach the door, round the corner and disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Get back here ya vermin!</span>\" she growled as she ran straight for the door, though feeling tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrafting illusions took a lot of energy from her, and the fact she had to keep moving to avoid Eeveelutions didn't help at all; unlike her, you were feeling adrenaline flowing through your veins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour life probably depended on your success, and that thought made you keep going even though you were feeling your breath rapidly running short and your legs growing tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua still didn't give up though, and kept chasing you through the hall of the cave that Sylveon showed you before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore or less, you knew how to get out of here, but that wasn't your main concern; right now, your main concern was having Zorua run straight into her chasers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you were lucky enough, you could find Sylveon, Espeon and Glaceon before Zorua caught you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">I'm gonna catch ya, bug! If ya stop now, I'm gonna go easy on ya!</span>\" she warned, keeping up though not gaining any ground despite the size difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dream on!\" you snapped back in a bout of courage as you kept running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you were running into the candlelit you were shown before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, at the end of the of the hall, a bright red furry creature, busy blowing a flame out of his mouth and onto a candle... yeah, Flareon's help wouldn't be of any help protecting you, though he could help in another way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sprinted right past him while Zorua, who noticed the fire-type as well, had to think of something...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing steps echoing into the hall, Flareon turned his head to the side and noted... another Flareon coming his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"corange\">Oh, hey me! Still saving the future?</span>\" he dumbly asked, still believing what the disguised Zorua told him earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Yeah, yeah, gotta go! And keep your yap shut!</span>\" Zorua replied as she sprinted past the oblivious fire-type, who blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile still running, Zorua grunted, feeling tired because of yet another illusion she had to craft to save her tail. She had completely forgotten the other Eeveelutions were still out, all doing their thing save for three that were on her tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash, your plan dawned on Zorua and she gritted her fangs. It was those same Eeveelutions you were counting on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to be careful, or she would... stick to her original plan, with the difference she would be thrown out empty-handed instead of leaving on her legs with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting, she shot you a look, watching as you ran farther.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cplum\">Damn ya, ya sneaky rat...</span>\" she uttered as she kept going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't go on for much longer; little she did know that neither could you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you couldn't get her to lose you, you were gonna eventually get caught. If only you could find a nice little hole for yourself where Zorua couldn't possibly fit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweat ran down your face as you felt yourself starting to slow down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>What to do?</i>'</span></div></div>",

Have you decided?\" she asks, her voice sickeningly sweet. Is she doing it just to convince you to go with her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head.<br>\r\n\"Hey, could you... take me... to Glaceon's room? Please?\" you ask, trying to not sound embarrassed. Which obviously doesn't work. Sylveon seems to don't notice your sheepish voice though.<br>\r\n\"Why?\" she asks instead, with a not subtle hint of delusion in her eyes.<br>\r\n\"We-well.... you see, I have something to say her...\" you lie, your cheeks getting of a faint shade of pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylveon stares at you curiously for a few seconds, before smiling.<br>\r\n\"Well, if that's so, I don't see why not.\" she replies with a sugary voice, before starting to walk; she soon brings you in front of a door. One of her ribbon like feelers wraps around your body and brings you to the ground.<br>\r\n\"Guess I'll give you that tour later.\" Sylveon says, patting your head with a ribbon. Then, she walks off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait for Sylveon to be completely out of your eyesight, before turning to the skyscraper sized door.<br>\r\n\"Uhhhhh...\" you mutter under your breath, trying to find a way to get inside. Knocking is out of question, Glaceon would never hear it, and even though her big ears, you're too small to produce an audible sound by knocking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get an idea. You look at the crack under the door. It looks pretty tight, but you should be able to squeeze yourself under it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes you a few minutes, as the crack is tighter than you had anticipated, but you finally manage to get inside Glaceon's room. You feel like you just entered a fridge. The mostly warm air from the cavern disappeared , replaced by a chilling atmosphere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on a light blue bed, a blue creature is with her back to you. You clear your throat. Two big ears rise as Glaceon turns around, showing a light blue flower that glows soothingly... you realize that it's completely made out of ice! You look around the room, which is apparently almost completely filled with similar sculptures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice, aren't they?\" Glaceon asks calmly, almost embarrassed, while getting closer to you. Soon you find yourself staring right at two immense fluffy paws, a chilly aura emanated from them.<br>\r\n\"Uh, yes... pretty...\" you state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moments are followed by an awkward silence, before finally Glaceon breaks it.<br>\r\n\"L-Look I'm sorry about earlier. I...\" she shuts up.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I forgive you...\" you reply. Glaceon gives out a small smile, lowering her face. One of her forepaws pushes on your back, shoving your right into her fluffy cheek as she nuzzles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" she whispers. Even when you're being smothered between her paw and her cheek, you manage to smile a little. She then pulls off and opens her mouth. Her sharp fangs shine like the many ice sculptures placed around within the room.<br>\r\n\"Glaceon, what...\" her mouth closes around the back of your shirt, lifting you off the ground. The ice type leaps on her bed and lets you fall in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend some time chatting with Glaceon, about your life before you shrunk, and about her life with her siblings. And, from what you get  from what she told you, she always has been an eternal rival of Espeon.<br>\r\n\"But you probably already figured out with the prank of earlier.\" she says you. You just nod, the horrible sensation of being crushed in between titanic walls of flesh, while being drenched in piss is still fresh in your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" she says after a bit.<br>\r\n\"...I've told you about my life, and I'm pretty sure you have no more to add about yours, so why don't we...</span></div></div>",

Why do you think it's as cool as it is in here?\" The Ice-type nods at her room in general, \"Outside of this room, I have to make an effort to keep the area around me cold enough to be comfortable.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You think this over a bit, trying to find a middle ground, but come up empty. Either Glaceon carries you with her mouth for you ride on her cold back. Forunately for you, Glaceon makes the decision.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Look, I already told you I'm starving. I'll carry you my way this time. If something goes wrong, we'll do something else next time. Alright?\" Not waiting for your reply, Glaceon snagged you and began padding off.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You swung a bit as Glaceon pushed her door open, though it was the absolutely bone-breaking height that bother you over the movement. Not wanting to consider what would happen if you fell, you resort to looking around instead.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The walls were rather simple, but the candle-holding sconces that decorated every few feet were far from it. They were rather elegant. In addition, a number of various cloth object hung from the wall, each beautifully made. According to what Glaceon had told you, Sylveon made those.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You didn't have much more time to observe as Glaceon place you onto the table the group had been eating from (though this is the first time you're properly seeing it.)<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Stay here.

You half expected Sylveon to show up and offer to give you her tour again. However, you were left undisturbed until your Ice-type... friend? Yeah, she seemed friendly enough. Glaceon returned, carrying a number of berries.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Glaceon pushed a rather large (to you) Oran berry over to where you were waiting, \"Here you are. Enjoy,\" without waiting, Glaceon immediately started on her collection of berries.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 After watching the pale blue Pokemon eat for a moment, you go to take bite out of your own berry. Only to find that it feels as though you were trying to bite through a ball of concrete. Furthermore, it was very cold. After pulling back, you notice Glaceon watching you with a grin. She bursted out laughing a moment later.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Oh, your face! Ah ha ha! Your face!\" She pushes a second berry over to you, \"Ha ha, don't worry.

It also had a father nice, well-rounded taste to it.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Oddly enough, something fortunate is your small size, meaning that one berry is far, far more than you need. By the time you'd eaten your fill of the massive berry, Glaceon was done and watching you eat. Seeing that you had finished, she snagged your partially eaten and finished it herself.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Mmm. Nice picks, right? Leafeon really does do a nice job with these. Now, if she could figure out how to not be so timid.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You offer a shrug, \"Not sure about the timid part, but the berry was good. Except the frozen one.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Oh, come on. I was just having a little fun. Speaking of, what do you say to having a little fun in my room?\" She offers a small wink.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You take a moment to decide. Glaceon clearly liked you. Who knows, maybe she might be more willing to help you out of this situation if you accept. The problem is that you have an idea what she wanted. Were you willing to go that far? Alternatively, you could see if Glaceon would take you to Sylveon. After all, the Fairy-type did want to give you a tour.

She did eat you without a second thought.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Unfortunately, you didn't have as much time as you'd hoped. Plenty enough to worry about your predicament, but far from enough to decide what to do about it. Glaceon pushed her door open before hopping onto her bed and rather gently setting you down. You're not sure why, but you had half-expected her to drop you.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Certain that Glaceon was going to tell you what she wanted, you decided to speak first, if only to make sure Glaceon knew you wanted a say in things, \"So, what do you want to do that's... fun?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Ice-type gave a short laugh, \"What's with the hesitation? I wanted to see how you were at ice sculpting.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ice sculpting? You didn't expect that, \"Just ice sculpting? Nothing else?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Did you expect me to play naughty with you?\" She asked, her voice teasing and playful, \"I'll admit. If I hadn't been trying to eat and not expecting it, I'd probably have enjoyed the feeling of you inside me earlier... Before Espeon's prank, anyways. But let's be honest here. We barely know each other. I'd prefer if we kept things neutral for now, alright?\" Glaceon's expression and tone seemed serious, then she cracked a grin, \"Unless you insist, of course. I mean, I do want to be a good host. We may barely know each other, but we can fix that!\" She gives a rather dismissive laugh, leaving you unsure if that was actually an option.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You nodded, a little relieved. So she wouldn't make you do anything like that just yet. Good. However, before you could say something else, your furry friend was speaking again, \"Of course, if ice sculpting isn't your speed, we don't have to stay in my room. I, for one, would love to get Espeon back. Maybe you and I could cook something up?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Well, that's great. You'd barely made a rather hard decision, and now you have another one to make. Stay in the room and do something, be it ice sculpting or not, or leave the room and see what you can get up to, like pranking Espeon. Or you can stay and take a risk to see how serious Glaceon was with her offer about being naughty. After a moment of consideration, you decide-</span></div></div>",

And you were right.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She took a rather deep breath, then released it, spewing torrent of snow, ice, and ice-cold air. Rather than use her Icy Wind to assault an entire battlefield, however, she focused it in front of herself. As she did, the snow and ice began clumping together. After a few moments of letting it clump, she stopped and began brushing some snow away and occasionally even started biting some pieces. After a few moments of scrutiny at what looked to you like a very lumpy mass, Glaceon started using Icy Wind again.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After several more Icy Winds and brushings, you were able to at least identify what it looked like. Glaceon had made a round base upon which nine four-legged figures stood, sat, or were laying. Glaceon nodded to herself and glanced over at you.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Guess what I'm making yet?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Is it you and your siblings?\" You guessed. Glaceon had said there were nine of them, including her, so it felt like a safe bet. And the right one, if Glaceon's nod said anything.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yep. Might give Espeon a bigger head, but yes. Felt like making a family sculpture and sticking it somewhere cool.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You give a shiver- the room was rather cold- before asking, \"Won't it melt outside of here?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Glaceon shook her head, her tail flicking to the side rather nonchalantly, \"Not if I put it in the right place. Or if I make sure it keeps together... Though you would be right, otherwise.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Your family is big. And rather... colorful.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Glaceon gave a sharp laugh, \"Yes. Yes, they are. Honestly, I can already guess how they'd react to seeing this. Eevee would be excited. Flareon would just ignore it because he always does. Jolteon would question me on it. Vaporeon'd want a life-size version, but only because of a bad joke. Espeon would make an annoying comment about how someone's tail or something isn't right. Umbreon would compliment my skills. Leafeon would study it quietly and might work up the courage to say if she liked it. And Sylveon would comment on how cute it is.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Y-You know your au-audience well.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Ice-type turned her gaze to you after hearing your stuttered acknowledgement, \"Is something wrong?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"C-Cold.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Glaceon sighed, but nodded again, \"Right. You aren't an Ice-type. Alright. If you want to try ice sculpting, we can go somewhere a little warmer. And I've figured out how you can do it, too. Of course, if you want to do something else, you can just say so.\"</span></div></div>",

The cold was getting to you.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Glaceon rolled her eyes, but you noticed the hint of a smile touching her lips, \"Come on, then.

While it was certainly uncomfortable (what if your clothes gave way!), you found yourself slightly less bother by it. Slightly, and only because it was Glaceon. She may have eaten you before, but she was seemed much friendlier now. You felt certain that you could reasonably trust her not to try to hurt you again.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Of course, while you considered this, the Ice-type was on the move. You gently swung in Glaceon's mouth as she carried you through her and her siblings' home. You weren't sure where she was going, but she seemed to be walking slower than normal. Perhaps for your sake?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Either way, she didn't take too long to get to where she was going as she set you down in a small, unlit corner of... some room. You weren't quite sure what the room's purpose was, but you could definitely see why Glaceon had taken you here. It was cool- though nothing compared to Glaceon's room or the Eeveelution herself- and rather isolated. Here,  you two could ice sculpt without interruption.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Here we are. This should do. Now for the ice,\" Glaceon allowed her eyes to close. You watched her concentrate, then took a step back as the air around her rapidly grew colder. Fortunately, it didn't stay that way for long. A small block of ice (for her, anyways. The thing was as big as you!) formed in front of her, \"There. Give it a try.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You looked up at her, \"I'd love to, but I can't shape ice with my bare hands.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 She sighed, then gestured at the floor, \"You don't think that's rather obvious, [y/n]? Look around you. There are plenty of little chips of rock around here. Maybe they might possibly, <i>potentially,</i> be useful?\" She gave you a cocky grin and made a shooing gesture with her paw.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 With a sigh of your own, you scavenged about. Turns out, she was right. There are plenty of rocks that could function as makeshift hammers and chisels.

Luckily you didn't hit your head on her teeth, but your head did land in the back of her throat. <br>\r\nThe psychic type licked at your lower half for a moment, and you could feel her head moving around as she returned to her seat at the table. After a few minutes of this her mouth opened again, and you struggled to turn around so you could climb out, but you were instead met with a hot cup of tea. The liquid washed you into into her throat, it was unbearably hot, but not burning.  The psychic type swallowed you, and carried you down into her depths. It didn't feel as cramped on the way down as when glaceon swallowed you. The first time your face was mashed up against the walls of the throat, but this time you were encapsuled within a liquid, so you barely brushed the sides all the way down. <br>\r\nAfter about five seconds of going down you were emptied out into Espeons stomach.  Once again espeons insides we're different in contents, as this time it was already full of food. The stomach was slowly churning at the giant mass of mush that you were sinking into, you tried desperately to climb the walls and avoid it but there was no leverage you could find.<br>\r\nYou stopped sinking in at your ribs, and you did your best to not fall over and have your head sink in. Every now and then more food and tea would empty down on you, and the level of the hoop slowly rose until it was at your neck. You could hear Espeon and the others talking outside, laughing at the incident at you and glaceons expense. <br>\r\nOnce Espeon was finished eating she patted her belly lightly, sending a ringing din around her insides for you. She then returned to her room and went to bed, causing the contents of her stomach to turn over as she laid down on her side, completely covering you. You scramble back to the surface as quickly as you can. You hear gentle snoring from the thick walls around you, and you deduce that she's fallen asleep already. This is your chance to try and force your way up her throat. You try and try, but to no avail. The sphincter is closed too tightly. Which only leaves two options.</span></div></div>",

You felt the digestive system's slow progress over you as the smells and sounds changed. Slowly, slowly, the beating sound got quieter as you moved away from the heart. The rumblings of the stomach, too, became fainter as you were pushed along the winding passage. The overpowering sour smell waned as stomach acid got neutralized by bile, and the unpleasantly bitter taste was constant on your tongue. You were no longer wet, but the sticky mucus was ever present that lubricated you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">I'm not very hungry.

She walked over to the sink, filled it to the brim, and topped off the glass with ice using her powers. Cooly she downed the glass in a single swig, then filled it back up. The chatter at the table quieted as, one by one, the eeveelutions took notice of the constant sound of flowing water and Glaceon's growing belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpblue\">Wow you sure do like water.</span>\" quipped Vaporeon happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpgreen\">Um, Glacey, isn't that enough?</span>\" Leafeon asked, concerned.

And it's getting wetter by the minute. You pull your arm from your side, the mucus faintly crackling, and run a hand underneath you. No, it's not your imagination; it definitely is water and it's cool to the touch. You rock your body to the side quite freely and realize that it's no longer so cramped. In fact, you might even be able to get onto your hands and knees and crawl forward. <i>Is this the large intestine already? Yes. Yes, it very well might be. But all this water...where's it coming from?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlaceon turns in her sleep, letting out a gentle grunt of discomfort. The water inside her belly sloshes.</span></div></div>",

Her sure feet slipped mid-stride and Glaceon slid belly first on the slippery ground. She got back up as quickly as possible but try as she might she could not move her legs fast enough to regain her speed. The rumbling avalanche that chased her was only three feet away...then two...then one. She screamed as the raging snow put its massive weight on her, she was going to burst, but suddenly something very warm was on her thigh.</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlaceon woke from her nightmare and quickly got to her feet. The pressure in her bladder was urgent and the small puddle near her foot was proof. With great laboring steps, but completely silent as not to wake anyone in the house, she tip-toed as best she could on four legs towards the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her horror the door was shut and light danced in the crack between the floor and the door. She rapped on the door quickly and with some force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">Open up. Now!! I need to go!!</span>\" She whispered loudly while crossing her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">Who is that?</span>\" A voice responded. It was Flareon. \"<span class=\"cred\">Is that you Umbreon?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">GLA-CE-ON!!</span>\" She spoke her name angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">Oh it's <i>you</i>.</span>\" He put a sour tone on the <i>you</i>. \"<span class=\"cred\">Come back later, I'm brushing my fur.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was no use. He's always been a jerk to her and she's always returned the favor. She'll be sure to throw his brush in the toilet tomorrow but right now she was going to have to use the other bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlue paws hurriedly skidded across the wood floor and a pink bedroom door decorated with a ribbon silhouette rushed open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpred\">What! Who is th--!!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">Sorry\u2014Sylveon\u2014need\u2014your\u2014bathroom!!</span>\" She slammed his toilet door and turned on the light switch. Her eyes stung from the sudden brightness but she crouched over the low toilet and finally unclenched her lower muscles. The relief was instantaneous. Clear liquid splashed with force against the opposite side of the porcelain and a loud sigh of satisfaction left Glaceon's mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water had gone completely through her. What she did not anticipate at all was that, because she had drunk so much, most of it had actually filled her entire gut as well. Two minutes later after the stream had reduced to a trickle she realized the secondary pain that had been assuaged by the first. This wasn't going to be pretty. She winced and relaxed her sphincter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pressure around you was suddenly gone, and then increased dramatically. A spot of light grew and rushed towards you. Just before you were completely in the light, a meaty ring clenched around you, only one arm and your head managed to escape. You looked around and from what you could make out in the sudden burning brightness was a giant flat blue tail quavering above you and what was obviously the large pink pulsing tailhole clenching you in place. It suddenly opened again and you fell freely into a giant pool in the middle of a large white bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water coming out of her was hot and came out in spurts as she clenched her belly muscles. The pressures were uncontrollable, unlike her bladder, and not all of it was making it into the toilet she sorrowfully realized when she heard a splash on the floor, the sound of a toilet plunger falling over, and even a roll of toilet paper falling into the toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpred\">Hey what are you doing in there! You know why I banned Vaporeon from my room don't you!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlaceon rolled her eyes. Sylveon was new here and he was kind of a neat freak. Recently Vaporeon had drawn a bath for himself in Sylveon's washroom but had forgotten to turn the tap off. It went unnoticed until water started flooding in under the door, ruining the carpet. Glaceon winced again as a torrent of water left her bowels and splashed into the toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't pleasant to say the least, but it beat the tight confines of her guts. It smelled vaguely or urine and small flecks of brown dotted the water. <i>Time to swim to freedom</i>, you thought. But the walls were too steep and slippery! No matter where you trying to grab, you slipped back down. But just as you were about to give up hope, you noticed the big roll of toilet paper, nearly submerged, bobbing up and down in the water. You grabbed onto the soggy thing and climbed as high as you could onto it. You looked up and saw Glaceon's anus bulge again. Another gush of water poured out and the water level rose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If I could just reach</i>... The handle of the toilet plunger was almost within grasp. The tips of your fingers touched wood and just like that it was out of your grasp again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlaceon ran a paw gently along her belly. It was almost down to its normal size again. But it didn't quiet feel right...it gurgled loudly and she felt a movement down there. A familiar feeling in her rectum which she wouldn't hold back. She closed her teal eyes and just let it out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud <span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\"><b>*bpbpbpbrrrrrrrrt*</b></span> broke as the hot gas left her hole and she exhaled in finality. It didn't smell, as she hadn't eaten anything but that morsel of a human, but it was pleasing all the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpred\">Oi! I heard that!</span>\" Sylveon shouted and knocked on the door, demanding her to leave at once. \"<span class=\"cpred\">You're freaking disgusting!!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\"><i>Was the pervert listening at the door?</i></span> She blushed furiously in embarrassment and put her face in her paws. Yet...she couldn't but help laugh a bit. It was so naughty but it felt good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up and watched as she reached into the cupboard for a new roll of toilet paper and began to wipe.</span></div></div>",

Anything you have in mind, I'm in\" he then adds \"Yeah, we need some of your laxatives\" Leafeon explains \"Why?\" Flareon asks \"Because...\" Sylveon says whispering in his ear \"Woah, little guy's evil\" he says grinning \"Wait here, I'll get what you need. And I'll provide to occupy  the bathroom to help you\". He then enters the room and returns shortly after holding a box \" Here you go. I'm sure we'll laugh for days\" he says. You grin wildly, followed by the three pokemon. Now the only thing to do is wait for Glaceon to wake up.<br>\r\n~<br>\r\nAfter a few hours, the ice type  pokemon wakes up and exits her room. She walks in the kitchen, to find a while breakfast settled on the table. What she doesn't know is that you and Sylveon have already warned everyone else of the plan. Espeon doesn't seem interested in eating you anymore, knowing where have you been. Glaceon looks at the meal curiously before...</span></div></div>",

Meanwhile, you and the whole family are looking through the door, careful to remain unseen from the ice type pokemon. You smirk at the thought of your revenge on Glaceon, while the pokemon before you chuckle silently. Glaceon keeps eating, not thinking of where her brothers and sisters could have gone, she just thinks to this delicious meal that mysteriously was on the table.<br>\r\n~<br>\r\nHalf of an hour passes, and Glaceon ate the whole meal \"Buuuuuuuuurp\" she lets out a thunderous burp \"Freaking, disgusting pig!\" Sylveon exclaims whispering from behind you \"Silence, look!\" you point out to the ice type sister. Everyone turns their attention to her and see she is holding her stomach with her forelegs \"Owww, that breakfast isn't dealing well with my stomach\" she says in pain \"Flareon, now!\" you say. Flareon nods as he sprints in the first bathroom and shuts the door close; he then locks it \"Sylveon, your turn!\" you say \"Okay\" he replies. He then runs to his bathroom and, as Flareon did, he shuts and locks the door \"Come on little guy, there's still one bathroom, let's go enjoy the show! And remember all of you, act oblivious\" Espeon says lifting you with her tail. She then dashes in the third room and as the other two brothers, she locks the door.<br>\r\n~<br>\r\nGlaceon is now struggling in pain \"Urgh! Can't... hold... it... in.... ANYMORE! I HAVE TO USE THE BATHROOM!\" she yells. She runs to the first bathroom, the one Flareon's in. She knocks violently at the door \"Who is that?\" Flareon says acting unaware, trying to hold in his laughter \"Glaceon! Let me in!!\" the ice type exclaims \"Come back later, I have a business here\" Flareon replies. Glaceon growls as she goes for the second bathroom, Sylveon's one. She knocks at the door \"Who's that?\" comes Sylveon's voice \"Me! Open up! P-please!\" Glaceon yells, the more and more agitated \"Oh, it's you. I'm busy here. And plus you're banned from here, remember? I'm NOT sorry\" Sylveon replies, about to burst in laughter. Glaceon literally roars at this as she dashes for her last hope. The bathroom you and Espeon are in. Glaceon almost collides with the door \"OPEN UP! I NEED TO GO!!!\" she exclaims once again. Espeon giggles from the inside \"Come back later, I'm washing myself\" she says. You and her are both about to explode from keeping yourself from laugh. Glaceon grits her teeth in pain. Her last chance is to go outside the cave. She  sprints at her full speed outside \"Working of with, did you wash yourself little guy?\" Espeon asks you \"Yeah, Sylveon accurately provided to that\" you reply, resembling the memories of the fairy type washing you for hours, before finally declaring you were fully clean. Back at Glaceon, she reaches the entrance of the cave; she sees some bushes and, without second thinking, she dashes behind them. Meanwhile you, Espeon, Sylveon and Flareon open up the bathrooms and meet up with the others, then you all reach the entrance of the cave. Just as you step out a loud fart is heard, then a yell \"Aurgh!\" Glaceon screams in pain. You can't hold it in anymore and start laughing wildly, followed by the whole family. You laugh for a while, your organs almost about to blow up, when Glaceon finally steps out of the bushes, panting. She notices you all laughing \"What *pant* are you all *huff* laughing about?\" she asks, clearly annoyed \"Because, my 'dear' sister\" Espeon says between laughs \"You fell in our... I mean in the little guy's trap. You are an evil genius, little one\" she says laughing. Glaceon's eyes fix on you. You stop laughing at the ice type's gaze. Glaceon stares at you for a bit before...</span></div></div>",

She misses you as everyone gasps, but Glaceon is fast and lunges at you again. You somehow dodge again and you start run. Glaceon doesn't lose a minute and chases you in the forest. Back at the others, Sylveon and Flareon look at each other before nodding, then they rush behind their sister, wanting to help you. Back at you, you continue to run through the plants; it's not easy, because at your current size your speed is slightly reduced, and the ice type is catching up with you fast. You hear her talking \"Looks like my old 'friend' has decided to defy me. Well, I'll show him how to behave\" she says. With that she uses agility and quickly outruns you, just to stop in front of you. You crash in one of her fluffy paws and are knocked on your butt. Before you can recover, Glaceon pins your arms to the ground with her paws and nears her face to yours, so her muzzle is inches away from your face \"If the digestion didn't kill you, I'll be sure to chew this time\" she says calmly, but with a mix of and angry and offended expression. She opens her mouth wide, lettinletting a wave of frosty air get on your face. Shivers go down your back as you terrified look the pokemon lowering her mouth on you; you can see her canines, and they shine as if waiting for you. You close your eyes, waiting for the inevitable \"Any  last words?\" she asks. You open your mouth to reply, but nothing comes out. Instead, two voices talk for you \"We won't let you!\" they shout. Glaceon barely has the time to look up that she is tackled by Sylveon and Flareon. You slowly get up, thanking God for what happened. You then hear steps behind you and see Espeon rushing to you. She stops before you \"Are you okay, little one?\" she asks in a somewhat worried voice \"Yeah\" you reply \"Whg are you helping me? I thought you wanted to eat me!\" you then add \"Again, not after where have you been\" she says \"And after all, my foe's foe is my friend\". This one sentence makes you smile a little. Meanwhile, the two brothers approach you; you notice Glaceon fainted on the ground \" Are you OK?\" Sylveon and Flareon ask you. You nod as they smile \"Come on, let's go home. The others must be worried\" Sylveon says \"What about Glaceon?\" you say. The three look at her before looking at you \"She knows the way\" they say. You suddenly feel sorry for the ice type \"Uhhh.... Go ahead, I want to do something\" you say. The three pokemon nod and start  walking away. You want until they are far and you approach Glaceon. Even though she ate you and then tired to kill you, you still feel sorry for her. You got your revenge, you should be happy, but you are sad. You sigh and touch her, then you start to gently shook her \"Wake up\" you say. The ice type doesn't answer \"Wake up\" you repeat, louder this time. Glaceon starts to open her eyes. She looks around and  notices you. Her expression immediately hardens \"You! I...\" she says, but you cut her off \"Isn't enough rage for one day? Or enough beats up?\" you say coldly. Glaceon hardly stands up \"Urgh! It's all Flareon and his stupid flamethrower's fault!\" she yells in pain \"You deserved it\" you reply. Glaceon looked at you with an enraged expression but remains silent as she sits down. After a few minutes if silence you speak \"Can you walk?\" you ask. Glaceon looks at you, before shooking her head \"My paw hurts\" she says coldly, almost as if she doesn't care. In fact, you notices she is bruised on her forepaw \"Wait here\" you say. Glaceon doesn't answer and looks away as you start searching through the leaves. Thanks to your experience as a trainer, you know there is an herb that can heal her wound. Finally, after a few minutes of searching, you find it and go back to Glaceon. She looks as you get in front of her paw and apply pressure on the herb. After a bit it release a white, sticky substance. Glaceon gasps at the sudden feeling, while you pick up a large leaf and hardly wrap it around her paw. You are heavily sweating \"Do... you... feel better?\" you ask. Glaceon looks at you \"Yeah... Thanks\" she says with a sudden, yet very little smile \"Come on, let's go home\" she then says, walking past you. You mod as you follow her. Just as your take the first steps, it starts to rain. And you're sweating \"Great! Now I'll catch a cold! My usual luck!\" you say annoyed. At this Glaceon suddenly stops and looks at you \"What?\" you ask. In response she opens her mouth and takes you in, before closing her lips behind you. You find yourself once again in her cavernous mouth. You wait for her to swallow, which never happens. Instead Glaceon keeps walking, heading to the cave. Wait. This means she is helping you! Her warm mouth will keep you from getting ill! \"Thanks\" you say \"Mhh- hhhm\" is your response. On the outside world, Glaceon just steps in the cave she calls house. The others notice her. The first to talk is Espeon \"Oh, there you are. Where's little guy?\" she asks. In response, Glaceon walks over the fireplace and spits you out. You are dropped on the ground, next to Flareon, who was here. He looks at you for a moment before looking at her sister. He notices the 'bandage'. Before he can ask anything, Glaceon walks off. A few seconds later you hear a door slam. Flareon then looks at you curiously \"What happened?\". You hesitate before answering \" No clue dude. No clue \". Meanwhile Sylveon steps in the room and notices you \" Oh,there you are.... Eew, you're dripping with drool!\" he exclaims disgusted \"Better wash you up\" he says, reclutantly wrapping a ribbon around your waist \"But I'm cold!\" you complain \"You can warm up when you're clean. Come on!\" he says. You groan loudly as all the eeveelutions laugh.</span></div></div>",

I'm clean!\" you complain \"That's what you think, my tiny friend. Dirt is tricky, it can hide everywhere on your body\" he says dunking you once again. After doing the same thing for an hour now, Sylveon finally wraps a towel around your whole form and rubs it dry. He then releases a dizzy you on the ground \"There! All nice and clean! Don't you feel better little guy?\" he says, smiling proudly \"Yeah, whatever you say. Can we just get out now?\" you ask. Sylveon nods as he wraps a ribbon around your body and carries you out of the bathroom. Just then Leafeon reaches you two \"Hey you two. It's lunch time, so I came to tell you. Come on!\" she says in her usual cheerful tone. Sylveon chuckles as he follows her sister, when a thought crosses his mind \"Is Glaceon coming?\" he asks \"Glacey? I really don't know. She didn't left her room since she and the little guy came home. We should go ask\" Leafeon replies. Sylveon nods as he carries you in front of a door. Leafeon knocks with her paw \"Glacey~! It's lunch time!\" she says giggling. No answer. After a few minutes, Leafeon speaks up \"Should we check her? Oh, I have an idea!\" she says \"And that would be...?\" Sylveon asks \"Let the little guy slide under the door. He'll check her\" Leafeon says. Sylveon stares at her with a weird expression \"Are you nuts? Little guy, alone with Glaceon? That's nonsense!\" he exclaims. At least, he cares for you \"Wait, Sylveon, I think I can do that\" you say, sure that the ice type pokemon won't attack you. Not after you helped her, right? \"But...\" Sylveon tries to argue \"Just trust me\" you say. Sylveon sighs \"Fine. But I'm waiting behind the door.\" he says, before setting you on the ground. You run to the crack under the door and easily slide under it. You find  yourself in a completely blue room. The air in here is chilly; you notice the ice type pokemon sitting on a bed, looking downwards. She is giving her back at you \"Ahem\" you say. Instantly she raises a ear and turns around \"Oh, it's you\" she says, noticing you. She hops off the bed and starts wall ng towards you. You notice that she has removed her bandage, and her paw is fully healed \"What do you want?\" she asks, once she is mere inches from you \"It's... it's lunch time\" you say. Glaceon smirks at this \"You know I could simply eat you for lunch right?\" she says. But she says it in an almost joking tone, almost like she's teasing you \"You're kidding... right?\" you ask \"Maybe... or maybe not\" she says laughing \"Uhhhh...\" \"Come on, let's go eat lunch\" she says still laughing as she picks you on her head. She then opens the door; Sylveon, who was listening at it, almost loses his balance. Glaceon stares at him with a weird look \"Why exactly were you listening at my door?\" she asks. Sylveon quickly recomposes himself \"No reason!\" he says. Leafeon, who was giggling for the whole time, runs off, followed by her brother. Glaceon blinks a few times \"That was weird\" she then says, walking towards the dining room. She steps in the room, everyone looking oddly at her, noticing you are actually riding on her head \"What's up, everyone?\" she asks confused, getting no answer. The ice type simply shrugs, before reaching her seat, in between Vaporeon and Umbreon, and sitting down. She then lowers her head on the table, letting you slide on it, next to her. Sylveon then comes out of the kitchen carrying plates, that contain every kind of berry, with his bows. He then sets the plates in front of everyone. He lasts sets the plate in front of Glaceon. Everyone but you then dig in their meals. Glaceon notices \"What... are... you waiting for?\" she asks with her mouth full of food \"Dig in\" she says, resuming her meal.

You're stuck! Yet, the anus keeps crawling up your arm, which soon gets cold. The pucker keeps pulsing, your head gets out as well. A giant, blue tail rests right upon your head and you can make out one thing: Glaceon didn't wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe anus slowly works you out of the rectum. You fall, landing on your butt on the hard, cold floor.<br>\r\n\"Ouch!\" you silently exclaim, slowly and painfully getting up. You take a look at your clothes, which are now ruined by all the sticky, smelly slime that was in the ice type's intestines. You almost throw up. Now the smell will stick to your body for weeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow is your chance, you think, you can flee from this cursed cave and from the Eevee family.

Your arms get pinned to the sides as more of your body is pulled inside each time the anus pulses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour forearms are sucked in. Then your arms. Then your torso, leaving you waist deep inside, your legs flailing in despair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, eventually, those too are pulled inside the rectum. And, with a last clench of the anus, Glaceon sucks your feet in, before letting out another moan: her 'prey' was consumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me out!\" you scream as you wiggle within the smelly cave. All you hear in response is Glaceon's giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding great pleasure in having you within her butt again, Glaceon sits up, then stands on all fours as she makes her way to her bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaps onto it as she lays down one her side, her blue cheeks starting to grow red.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">Hope you're comfy up there,</span>\" she moans.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">Because it's time for some fun~!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pokemon hears a muffled cry in response and giggles as her right paw travels down to her sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlaceon feels her usually cold fur starting to grow hot beneath her paw as she closes her eyes, opens her mouth to moan and starts rubbing her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her rectum, things start to shake, while the squishy flesh squeezes you from head to toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have an idea of what is happening out there, though you're not completely sure as you can't see anything but darkness and sticky flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horrid smell starts to assault your nose as you struggle within the dark cave, trying to get out of here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll while Glaceon keeps rubbing her sex, moaning as pleasure shakes her body, overwhelms her senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo help herself, Glaceon starts to toy with you in her butt. She clenches the muscles of her rectum, using them to drag you away from her anus, deeper into the empty, but smelly cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel the strong muscles pressing hard on you as you are dragged deeper inside the intestines. This sends you into squirming and crawling wildly as you desperately try to turn around and crawl out of here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, you don't accomplish any of these things. But you DO feel the pressure starting to loosen. With your heart leaping within your chest, you notice yourself sliding downwards, towards the anus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlaceon is releasing you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe icy giantess snickers from outside as she keeps pawing herself. Yet again, she clenches her muscles, halting the human's descending within her and again dragging him deeper inside. Muffled screams of frustration can be heard from her slimy insides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlaceon keeps this up as she continues masturbating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClench-upwards, release-downwards. Clench-upwards, release-downwards, clench-upwards, release-downwards clench-upwards, release-downwards...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, with a last, ear-splitting moan, the giantess releases a stream of her juices, which stains her paw and the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paw drops on the floor next to her sex as the ice type pants, trying to regain the breath she lost during what might be the best orgasm of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack inside of her, things finally stopped moving. Exhausted, you lay still on the fleshy, intestinal floor. As much as the bulge in your pants tells you that you enjoyed this as much as Glaceon did, your head screams you to get up and crawl out of here while you've got the chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut your body is sore from all the pressure you've been put through. You can barely move your fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, the smell did not get any better, and Glaceon's... activities brought her insides to a steaming level. You just hope that this is the end of her 'fun'...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot without difficulty, Glaceon stands back up, playfully wagging her rear as she decides what she should do with you now.</span></div></div>",

You wanted to go for a walk, but seeing as how you were afraid of Pokemon you really couldn't do that. Instead you just do what you do normally, and head over to the Pokemart to brows the new items. You noticed an employee carrying a box of strange looking repels to the back, and you ask what's in it. He said it was a new repel that was recently made, and that it would work for people without Pokemon of there own. He also told you it had a few side affects, and should have been title HUMAN Repel. You took out all of your money, and ask how many this would get you. You were told that you would get about half of them. You agree, and pay for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I guess I could TRY to head to the forest...\" You say hesitantly to yourself. You then proceed to spray a can of the odd Repel on yourself.

You proceed to head into the woods, and soon regret it when you realize how fast these Repels wore off. When you were stuck in the middle of the forest, you had completely run out. You also felt dizzy, and remember the employee telling you that they had side effects. You sit down under a tree, and read an empty Repel can...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWARNING!<br>\r\nSide effects of overuse may include...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDizziness<br>\r\nDrowsiness<br>\r\nHunger<br>\r\nLoss Of Consciousness<br>\r\nAnd...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could finish reading you passed out.

Using all your strengths, you rub right in front of her.<br>\r\n\"Stop!!\" you shout, hoping she would hear you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, as a matter of facts, her big ears twitch as she stops, looking down in the snow to spot whatever called out to her. And, in fact, she sees a tiny creature standing there, looking at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInspecting closer, the Glaceon notices it is a tiny human that has yelled her to stop. She stares at him confusedly. Weren't humans bigger than that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou managed to get the Glaceon's attention. She's now staring down at you, her deep blue eyes shining with pure curiosity. You fight the urge to cower as her gaze seems to stare into your very soul. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, suddenly, you feel tired. You used every energy left in your tiny body to run and reach the Glaceon. In fact, you quickly pass out, exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Glaceon lets out a small cry, seeing the tiny human suddenly collapsing. Maybe he was  lacking energy, she thinks.

It had been fortunate for a while, and was a large example of its species, with a rounded stomach and thicker arms. As it walked along, it didn't notice the pair of vines slowly creeping up behind it, until they had grabbed it by the ankles and dragged into the bushes, shoving its feet into some tight opening in the ground. It strained and tried to pull itself free, but whatever had it was strong, and wouldn't let him go. Its ankles were being sucked in, and the interior felt thick and gooey and much too warm, and it couldn't identify what was touching it on the inside. Once its legs were securely inside, the vines came back and grabbed its wrists, tugging it from both sides and and making it impossible for the Pinsir to use its arms. The whatever-it-was was pulling it in even deeper, up to the bottom its rounded stomach. The Bug-type fought with all its might, but its main weapon was its pincher, which was useless if it couldn't bend over to bite at what was holding it. It would lean one way, the the other to try and snap the vines that were holding its arms, only to pulled in the other direction by the opposite vine. By now, it's stomach was inside the thing, and it was halfway consumed. It was then that the smell reached it, and it stopped struggling. The sweet scent... It was... intoxicating... Pinsir began to relax, looking dazed, and the vines carefully tucked its hands into the consuming maw, and its pincers barely twitched when its head was consumed, and finally its pincers themselves were claimed. The vines slipped into the ground, and there was no more movement from that place for several days, until there was a soft rumbling sound, and the hole emerged from the ground, revealing itself as the bulb on the back of an especially plump Bulbasaur. It climbed out of the hole it had used to hide while it digested the Pinsir, and now it was ready to start hunting for food again. Its bulb was unusually thick and vibrantly green, and the Bulbasaur itself was so fat it had to waddle as it walked. It was a successful predator, and was looking to evolve soon.

You just licked yourself clean under a tree and you feel pretty good about yourself. When all of the sudden it starts to rain! Your fur is plastered up against your body and you look one direction and almost close your eyes as if to say \"Yeah... that figures...\" You decide to lie down under a tree. You have some annoying habit of sleeping with your mouth open. You finally get to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up to feel something in your mouth. You swallow, and you start to gag. You don't exactly throw up, but you were really close. Lo, and behold, standing before you was a 2 inch tall human. You heard about them in legends and fairy tales. You never thought they were real... and you thought they'd be much bigger too. You stand up and shake. You are pretty dried off now, you like once or twice here and there, then shake and your fur looks nice and fluffy. Then you turn your attention back to the human. He was sitting down watching you in disbelief as you groomed yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a little uncomfortable with him just sitting there, staring at you without much of an expression on his face. You decide to play a trick on him. You get in pouncing position, then just back off with your head still close to the ground. You make a rustling sound as you enter the brush behind you. You see he obviously can't see where you're going, he's looking around in a confused way. You end up behind him. You stay in pounce position for a couple more seconds. To make sure he thinks you're gone. Once he's in a false sense of security you pounce on him, playfully of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't really need to use both paws, you have him completely pinned down with half of your right paw. You quickly turn your paw over and get him on the top side. You throw him upward as hard as you can then roll over on your back right where he is going to fall. When he lands you feel a soft thud. You had a \"mutation\" (not the ugly kind, the genetically altered, something isn't right, I'll explain after I finish these parentheses) If someone touched your tail, they wouldn't have a curse. You've always known that since you evolved. You really had no reason for it anyway. You suppose he thinks he just landed in a patch of grass. He looks around, your fur is taller from your chest than he is. When he looks up he realizes this isn't grass, but he doesn't know quite where he is until he spots your face looking directly at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have a little hiccup, it's very small you hardly move but it forces him to fall down. You find it funny he has so little control over anything around him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to...</span></div></div>",

Pokemon battles go off topic so none of those. The Pokemon might want to do several 'things' to you: eat you, befriend you, mate with you, etc. Oh yeah, I'll try and add to your interactives if you to this.(Just don't expect a long  one out of me, I'm not good at putting more than 4 paragraphs a chapter) I would like this to have more additions. If you don't have an interactive to add to I'll try and reward you with gp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon't add chapters that only have one choice.UPDATE: I WILL NOW ALLOW POKEANTHROS AND TALKING POKEMON!!!!! WHEEE!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNote: I retain the right to delete poor quality additions or nonsensical paths. Try to stay at least somewhat understandable people. -_-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNotice: When attempting to delete a small number of low quality additions, writing.com apparently decided to bug out and deleted the entire Poke Anthro Prey chain.
