Nowthat that'scleared up let's start the story.  James was trudging through the snow in a short-sleaved shirt, jeans that have been ripped in half, and starving to death. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames: (freezing) Damn it, i need to find some place warm or i'm going to freeze to death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames finally bumped into something not looking where he was going and saw it was a house. He saw a crack in the side of the house and decided it would be better to crawl in and get warm before walking longer. As James entered the house he saw a fire lit in what he thought was the front room. Being curious, James wondered if he should go sit by the fire and warm up, or stay in the crack in the wall.</span></div></div>",

But he didn't notice the girl that woke up on the couch as he walked by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirl: (whispering to herself) Is that a little person? No, couldn't be, that's impossible right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough curious, the girl walked over to the little sleeping person, and gently picked him up, careful not to wake him. The girl went back over to her couch and set down still holding the little person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirl: What am i going to do when he wakes up?</span></div></div>",
