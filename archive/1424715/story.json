If another troll other than me showed up, you could have been in big trouble,\" she explains, Max raising an eyebrow, but not questioning it, as he's with a blue lady with tusks.<br>\r\nMax soon realize that he's probably on different world, far from his, and he has no choice but to stay with her until he finds a way home.<br>\r\n\"Besides, I'm surprised you managed to avoid that monster in the cave back there, with its terrible roar,\" she adds in, making Max blush red from embarrassment.<br>\r\n\"Actually, about that, that was me. I farted back there,\" he admits, turning red.<br>\r\nThe troll looks at him with curiousity before squinting an eye and lifting a leg as a massive fart roared past her muscular bum. Gagging from the stench, Max looks on as the troll sighs in relief from her flatulence and whaft the smell away.<br>\r\n\"Now I farted, so no biggie! In fact, my friend farts even more than me and I consider myself a gassy gal! I going to meet up with her. You'll love her and she's very friendly!\" She said, grabbing him under her arm and running as fast as she can, while her butt pushes out more farts from her bowels.<br>\r\n\"Wait! You didn't tell me your name! I'm Max!\" The human shouts out.<br>\r\n\"Carly,\" she replies.<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before they reached the camp and they could hear a woman groan before farting.<br>\r\n\"Rayiln, it's Carly! I brought back a guest!\" Carly yells out, before some shuffling is heard.<br>\r\nHeavy thumps comes towards them and soon reveals ....</span></div></div>",

Is it some kind of metaphor for your lost youth or something? You imagine the paunchy belly of the boy with you inside. He slaps it a couple of times before letting out a raspy belch. <i>Really... this is starting to get ridiculous.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou expect to wake up any minute, but the dream never fades away. Instead, you become increasingly aware of an irritating itch all over your body. <i>{Nah - no way/i} you're just imagining things, of course. You try to think of the last time you felt discomfort in a dream. Well... at any rate, you'd rather wake up so as not to experience the things that happen further along. You blush recalling the anatomical processes you'd rather not dream through. <i>The kid was cute, but I'd rather not dream about being his poop.</i> Would you call such an unnecessary and gross dream a nightmare? Perhaps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n20 minutes later, and the boy has clearly tossed himself into bed, rubbing his gut lovingly. You, on the other hand, are really regretting not being able to wake up from this nightmare. The irritation turns to pain as gloppy acid oozes into the boy's stomach and onto your skin. It's melting your freakin' skin! \"Hey! Let me out kid!\" You plead, embarrassed to be totally owned by a kid younger than you. \"No way, human Max. The king will reward me handsomely for disposing of you. Besides, I'll get to add you to my chubby body. Shades told you about the prophecy, I suppose? Do you wonder, then, if you AREN'T the human child destined to overthrow the king? None of my other snacks have been. BURRRRP!\" This sends a chill up your spine - which is an accomplishment, considering you're sweltering inside the 10 year old's tummy. \"No, my delicious meal, I'm afraid the only thing you're destined for is a pile in the corner of the cave. Haha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scream as the acid flows more freely now. It seeps into your nose, your mouth, your eyes and mercilessly digests you as the boy snoozes. <i>Okay - this is definitely a dream</i> you think...<i>If this were real, you'd have passed out and died</i>... Well... unfortunately for you, this is real, but even worse, it's the Nightmare world, where nightmares are lived out to their conclusions. Since you, yourself, voiced concerns for having to live out digestion to its disgusting conclusion, this world has fated you are doomed to experience just that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear cute little snores and wish you, too would pass out and get respite from the pain of being digested slowly by a kid, but no such relief comes. His powerful gastric enzymes have melted off your skin and muscles. You're now just a sentient soup of boy nutrients sloshing around in a peristaltic washing machine of a stomach. Powerful contractions grind your bones down to gristle. On a positive note, you no longer experience pain, but are still party to the slimy, vomitous conditions around you and are shocked at the suction of his intestines which demand your nutritious slurry. Suddenly, you're afraid - you're really going to have to experience the humiliation of the whole process. <i>I wish I could just go head and wake up from this shitty dream</i> you lament. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the source for the boy's gurgling and burbling borborygmus, you sense his body's secretions- making you slippery and slimy - aiding in the breakdown of fats. His intestines demand them for use for his own pudge. Nature's call is down the line, and every now and then, a greasy fart will snap you back to the reality that you're a few hours away from being his shit.<i>NO! I definitely don't want to dream about that</i> you think with a shudder - well, you can't exactly shudder as you're getting squirted into his colon, now can you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell hits you. <i>Why!?</i> you groan. Literally - you're making all kinds of disgusting noises - enough to wake him up. All morning long, you slither through his bowels, thickening into a shitty slurry. <i>I just want out!</i> you think, unwisely reckless what you're wishing for. Now you're becoming aware that your color is slowly but surely transitioning from yellow to brown. <i>This is disgusting! Who dreams about this!?</i> You wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do... or at least that's what you think. You're experiencing it for real, of course. The long, slow trip to his butthole is coming to a close. You can feel yourself solidifying and smoothing out. <i>Oh god! This is so humilitaing. Can't I just wake up....</i> \"Help! Help! PLEASE IN HERE! Get me loose!\" you can hear the boy's crocodile tears and his trap has been set - apparently another fool is ready to fall for his for his cruel catfishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!... The key is right there.\" PFFFT. \"Right over..\" PBLBLBT \"Excuse me.... It's on that table.\" A violent contraction shuffles you southward with disgusting wet sounds and you see a little bit of light - well, a loincloth. <i>This is... unexpected. Oh, and awful- don't forget awful.</i> \"Thank you so much, food. Hehe!\" GROANNN \"How do you think I got to be so chubby if I... You know what... wait here!\" CLICK.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the protests of a young kid. Probably even younger than the boy who ate you. Another powerful squeeze and the boy groans. \"Heh- what's your name kid?\" ... \"Caleb? You believe in fortune telling, Caleb? 'Cause you're about to see your future!\" <i>oh no! he did not!</i> He did. More disgusting slick sounds and you see a six year old kid - disgust and horror splayed across his face - chained to the wall. The scene is framed by hairless butt cheeks flanking the left and right of your view. You, Max the turd, slither out of the boy's butthole. You gather he's hunched over doggy style because your slimy brown form pokes outward and then gravity drags you down along the boy's taint and balls. You leave an impressive smudge before his butthole pinches. The first steaming log you've become lands with a wet PLOP on the stone floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caleb... NGGGH! I'd like to introduce you to Max... MMMH  He had the pleasure of being yesterday's meal.\" More pushing... More pooping. <i>This cannot be happening!</i> you complain as you're slowly dumped out of a ten year old boy's butthole into an impressively large and growing pile. The boy continues, \"Although, as you can see... MMMGH The pleasure... of today's dump is all.. mine! AHHHH\" The mess you're making is incomprehensible. Finally, the last log of poop is eased out of his pucker and lands with a THWACK atop the pile. He farts a couple more times and saunters over to poor Caleb. Ripping off the boy's shirt, he cleans up his disgusting crack. \"You won't be needing this where you're going, Caleb. Taking off your clothes makes you more digestible. See... you now get the pleasure of being today's meal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel yourself phasing out of consciousness. <i>Finally! Waking up from this NIGHTMARE</i> you think in relief and shame. As embarrassing as it will be to remember, this dream will definitely be a secret... wait - you're not waking up... you're passing out. Forever. You sit and start to cool off - a very real pile of boy turds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy licks his lips as he turns to Caleb... \"Where were we?\" His stomach growls in answer. \"Ah yes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</i></span></div></div>",

I lay down and rest for a few minutes. Later I get up and pull my pants down. I squat and shit the boy out. It takes minutes until I'm empty and I look at my shit. It's riddled with his bones and clothing, I stick my hand in and remove his skull. No one messes with the king. </span></div></div>",
