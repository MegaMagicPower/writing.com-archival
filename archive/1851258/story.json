To get a better view of your surrounding you climb to the top of a nearby coffee table and look around. The first thing you see makes you gasp in shock. It's a giant picture of a family of anthro dragons. It looks like a mom, a dad, and two children. One of the children appears to be a teenage girl (about 16 same age as you) and the other is a boy (about 12 looking). <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It can't possibly be real.\" You say as you reach out and touch the image.

You quickly hide deep among the giant objects inside as you begin feel yourself getting lifted up of the ground when she starts to pick up her purse. Your surroundings have become dark as she zips her purse. Finally, you felt yourself swaying from side to side as she now begins to walk out of her house and into the street in order to visit the house of her fourth friend that is somewhere around the suburban neighborhood. You try to get comfortable in the bottom of the purse and hope that you don't get crush by the giantess' belongings which all looked big enough to break every bones of your body. Since she completely closed her purse, you're unable to look around the outside world, but by the looks of it, she seems to know where she's going so you just sit there and wait patiently for her and the others to visit the home of their friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor about twenty-five minutes, the giantess finally stops walking, revealing that the giantesses have finally reach the home of their mysterious friend.

After a few minutes, you suddenly felt yourself dropping into the ground, presumably that the dragoness have dropped her purse into the floor. Luckily, none of her enormous belongings didn't landed upon you. You decided to climb out of the purse and into where ever you are right now. Unfortunately due to the object blocking the exit, it'll might take several minutes to climb out of it. You start by climbing on top of a giant iphone, followed by a pencil, then a piece of bubblegum, and soon climb up a few other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long, tiring climb up the giant objects, you finally reached the exit of this giant purse and right at the corner of your eyes, you see a small opening that leads to the outside world; it seems that the dragoness didn't completely closed up her purse. You walked towards the small space and crawled out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step into the ground and look around, you found yourself inside a living room which looked similar to the last one, but a little different.

Most of your energy reserves had been used up while climbing out of the dragoness' purse, so the walk out of the gigantic living room and through the open backyard door was incredibly taxing. During the journey outside, you stop to examine a few of the photos hanging on the wall. Tons of family pictures showcase a group of hares in their seemingly happiest moments, from birthdays to important school events. Looks like this house belongs to that highly fashionable hare you glimpsed earlier. Speaking of which, you could see that very hare and her friends just up ahead. Hopefully that long walk would pay off after you introduced yourself. As you approached the group of friends, you ran over what you would say in your head, until finally you stood at the edge of the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEADS UP, EVERYBODY!!!\" The dragoness laughed cheerfully, raising her hand high into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wait a minute!

Unfortunately, you were standing right in the splash zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sputter madly, trying to get your now-soaked hair out of your eyes.

Oh- you think i was going to- i wasn't go to eat you.\" You sighed and closed your eyes for a moment, quick to open them again to be aware. \"Heh heh, no, I would never eat something living, let alone something that could. Or a human for that matter! Your like a legend to us!\" This got your attention; a legend? What did he mean. His eyes wandered all over you, and once sniffed you. He was very curios, and more than excited.<br>\r\n     You brought enough courage up to ask him to let you down. \"As great as the view is up here, could- could you possible but me down?\" You were becoming afraid of heights, he wasn't exactly holding you over the table anymore, let alone anything soft.<br>\r\n     He snapped out of a daze. \"What? Ummm... oh yeah. Ok.\" He looked around seemingly trying to find a spot before he looked back at you, leaning back onto the couch. \"Umm, well there isn't that great of a selection of safe seats- and i don't want to sit on you or anything- so i hope you like pudge.\" He gently placed you on his stomach, while he sat back in a slouched position, while you weren't that tiny, about five inches, his body seemed still massive to you. The warmth from the massive gut was comfortable and honestly you had thought his scales would be hard and cold, but were rather soft and squishy, very much like skin.

Whats so special about that?\" He smiled again, but to you it looked like a display of razer sharp teeth.<br>\r\n     \"Well, to be plain... humans don't exist... well shouldn't exist, they're just a myth.\" You looked in surprise, it was a logical reason for his great interest in you, and why everything in this world seemed to be comprised of anthros. \"But you, you're real.\" He lifted a finger up to you and gently nudged you bringing back his finger and giggling. He seemed so content just to look at you. \"To think, a real human! And a nice one too!\" <br>\r\n     Just then, he heard a voice coming through the halls \"Lysander!

You overheard their conversation.<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n   \"Lysander, i know its a Saturday and all, but seriously, this is too early for cartoons.\" She walked into the kitchen, how you knew this was possible was by the small clicking of her feat against the tile. \"And why are you hunched over like that?\" She decidedly walked closer to Lysander, he began to blush and subsequently gripped just a bit tighter.<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n  \"N-Nothing I wasn't doing anything...\" He looked nervously back and forth across the room. His sister came to the side of the sofa and peered down to his arching body, noticing how one hand was in his pants. She grimaced in disgiust.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n   \"Ugh, Lysander, couldn't you go in your room and do that, not on the couch!\" She sighed and walked back to her room, retorting back in a pissed off manner fashion: \"Uegh, puberty.\" <b>SLAM</b><br>\r\n    <br>\r\n    The door closed shut and you still hid there against his palm and his soft fleshy scales, honestly it was kinda of nice to have a warmth like this, the only thing making you feel the most awkward was the smell: it was a musty young smell, all too familiar with you when had 'alone' time. In unison, the two of you sighed, the hand gripping you once more to bring you out of his commando pants. He nervously brought you back out of the humid prison and into fresh air, something that was so relieving to you. \"Oh man-phew- that was a close one!\" He reached for the remote and shut off the obnoxious TV.<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n    You were still in his grasp, but you weren't minding being held by someone who obviously had a mindset of keeping you safe. \"Th-thanks. Who knows what she would think of me.\" You slouched in his hand relaxing, knowing you were safe. But the smell still lingered a bit.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n   He slowly stood up and began walking to his room, passing through the hall and hearing his sisters loud audible snoring, a thing uncommon for a beauty of her kind. Lysander stuck his tongue out in front of her door, making you smile in amusement. \"She woulda probably thought you were a rodent or something...*sniff, sniff* Oh..\" He lowered his snout to you, gently sniffing then backing away with a slight blush on his face. \"I-im sorry man... i wasn't thinking- y'know- about where to hide you and i just-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"It's alright,no harm done, besides, i know what it's like to go through this.\" He was still blushing just entering his room,it was like a normal teens room; posters on the wall,computer and a desk, a drawer. It was so similar to a regular humans, it was astonishing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Thanks for understanding.At least i didn't push you too low... wait did I?\" You laughed and shook your head. \"By the way, never got a name from you- you know mine <br>\r\nalready, so whats yours?\" He sat on his bed and looked at you with a stargazed expression, like you were a trophy or something. Leaning on his right hand, while you were still up to your arms in his grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Umm.. how bout you set me down first.\" Lysander quickly apologized and set you near the end of his bed, laying belly down and feet near the head post, arms crossed and staring at you intently, his tail wavering in the air. \"First off,my name is Jack, and second of all, i have no idea how i got here. So with your help- if you'd be willing to help me- i'd like to get back to my own world.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Oh, i'd love to help you get back!... but ummm.... how? I can't think of anything to help get you back?\" He showed a face of discontent and sighed, then snapped up again with energy grinning with all his razor sharp teeth, still freaking you out. \"I KNOW! I can search some stuff up on my computer-\" *GRRRRGLLRGGRLL* He slid a hand down to his stomach. You backed up in a bit of fear. He noticed.:Oh..heh heh, sorry, right after breakfast. By the way, ummm,how old are yah? Im thirteen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    You wiped your forehead a little, the thought of still being dropped into his boiling stomach was enough to get you sweating. \"Im sixteen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     He began to get up leaning on his hands, \"Sooo, what do you humans eat?\"...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He takes you down the same hall, passing by his sister's room with the same snoring still heard from it, and soon the two of you were in the kitchen. Despite the size, everything seemed the way how you would have expected a kitchen to be like. There was a fridge to the wall, the counter tops and sink, a table in the middle of the room, cabinets, an oven and microwave at one corner, and even a pantry on one side. The dragon teen gently places you on the table and begins rummaging through the cabinets, looking for something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll just have a bowl of cereal for today. How about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I can go for some myself.\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling out a box, he places it on the table and goes looking for a bowl. You inspect the box, which must've been around the size of an office building to you. On the front, of course, is some kind of cartoon character; a brown-furred wolf holding a spoon to his mouth in one hand, and the bowl of the cereal on the other. Moving to the back, the print went on about how it contained the essential vitamins and minerals every child needs, and stuff. Looking back to your friend, you see him already holding a bowl in one hand, and the other in the fridge. Taking out the milk, Lysander is already at the table with you, preparing his bowl. Once he was done, he puts a hand in the box and pulls out a single piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here ya go! I'm sure that you're hungry too, Jack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe places the food next to you, which must've been the size of a beach ball to you, at least! It was really just a simple spherical piece of brown chocolate cocoa, but that was your favorite kind of cereal. You both start digging in, enjoying your breakfast with your gigantic anthro friend. It was about a few minutes when you were both done. You couldn't finish your meal, of course, but you did take quite a chunk out of it. Lysander was drinking the last drops of milk before he placed the bowl back on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aah! That was good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boy, you said it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing your unfinished piece of cereal, he plucks it from you and pops it into his mouth. For a moment, you felt a tinge of fear as you almost thought he was trying to eat you. But you start reprimanding yourself for thinking that. He's been nice to you this whole time, wasn't he? Not to mention the fact he just ate breakfast...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, ready to see if we can find a way back home for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you make your way back to the dragon's room. He sits on the desk in front of his computer and he places you in front of him. Starting it up, you watch as the humungous screen flickers into life and flashes bright lights in front of your eyes. Lysander quickly adjusts the light until it was dim enough for you to see it. \"Sorry, forgot to set the brightness level yesterday.\" Blinking the lights out of your vision, you watch as he begins opening up a net program, and it immediately opens up to a search site.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what was it that got you here in the first place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some kind of glowing rock. All I remember is that when I touched it, everything went black, and here I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's try it...Glowing rock...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nin a few seconds, the search results came up, with several pages worth of possible matches. The first one was useless, and so was the next one...And the next one...And that one is just an ad! You yawn a bit as you just stare at the screen, uninformative sites scrolling by. But then, you spot a picture of something that seemed all too familiar to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou point at the picture. It was a rock, but it wasn't glowing like how you remember it. However, you do see a carving of some kind of magic circle on it. When you touched that rock, you only managed to catch a glimpse of that carving when you were whisked away to this world. But you were sure that that was the same carving you saw. Lysander quickly goes to the page where that picture was, and the site led you to what seemed to be some kind of document, or some informational piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This is the legendary \"Winlow's Stone\" which has been said to have the power to take it's owner to another world. The stone itself contains potent magical power, which allows it to travel to another realm, even without an owner. Once in possession, the owner can use it to travel to different worlds or dimensions at will. However, if no one possesses the stone for a certain amount of time, it's magical powers will transport it to a random world. This amount has been deduced to be a minimum of 48 hours to any point afterwards. When it teleports, any creature or object within it's range will be transported alongside it, but will be sent to a different location from where the stone itself will be transported too. This object may be one possible explanation to OOParts (Out Of Place artifacts) found within a number of locations of our world, but no evidence can prove this. However, several accounts have been reported of a sudden flash of mysterious light, with no apparent source.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Lysander look at each other with grave faces. If this document was true, then that means you only have two days <b>at least</b> to find it, and return to your world...Or end up stuck in this world forever...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...S-so...At least we know what we're looking for...Right Jack?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah...You'll help me out with this, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I will! I mean, we're friends, aren't we? And besides, if we're too late, you can live with me and we can be the best of friends so you won't feel lonely. But, that would mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, you already knew what he was going to say, before he even said it. It would mean having to meet with the rest of the family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, let's worry about that only <i>if</i> we are too late.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysander opens up another search site and types in \"Winlow's Stone\". This time, there were only a few good matches. All the rest just led off to something else entirely. Taking a look, it seems that there's a list of places where OOParts have been found in this world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! This one's where they have that digging site next to the park! It looks like they found a slightly radioactive object there, but there were no recordings that can explain why.\" Lysander explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's pretty much the best place to start looking.\" you say.</span></div></div>",

You sat there and watched as he packed in some food, a first-aid kit, some walkie-talkies, and a notepad and pencils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, what are those things for, exactly?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's just in case something happens. The walkie-talkies are just so we happen to need help, and the notepad is in case we need to write something down, or take notes of something. After all, It doesn't look like Winlow's Stone is gonna be easy to track down, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head, understanding. Lysander was actually a pretty smart guy, and his explanation helped ease your earlier worry. Just as Lysander finishes packing things up, you both hear an audible ring of the doorbell. He's already taken out a pair of pants to change into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, I wonder who that could be?\" Lysander muses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe picks you up and makes his way over to the door. He then hides you behind his back as you hear the front door open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Lysander! I just bought a cool game I thought you'd like! Wanna set it up in your room now?\" the person says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry Tagro, but I-I've got somewhere to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the gentle squeak of the door closing, only for a soft thud to stop it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Lysander! You'll love this game, I promise!\" Tagro says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! It's really important that I go out right now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? But I spent a lot of cash on this game! Hey, what's that behind your back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tense up, knowing that you're at risk of getting discovered. Lysander seems to be fidgeting around, as you can see with how his arms is moving around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-nothing Tagro! I don't have anything behind my back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, show me! I'm your friend, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ngh...A-alright, but only my room!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysander quickly turns around and rushes into his room, you in hand and Tagro following behind. As the two of you reach the door, Lysander looks back to Tagro, with you still out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, promise that you will never ever tell anyone about this, ever.\" Lysander said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, okay, I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you have to really promise to never tell anyone else without my permission!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! I promise to never tell anyone! Now, will you please show me what it is you're hiding?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysander slowly brings you in view. You blink as you see a giant anthro Bengal tiger, staring down at you. He seems to be around the same age as Lysander. His eyes are wide, and his lips seem to quiver slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A...A human? You've got a human!?\" he says, unable to believe his own eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. There's this thing called Winlow's Stone, that transports anything near it to another world. Jack here was taken from his world to ours, and I'm gonna help him get back, no matter what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile a little as you listen to Lysander's caring speech. He glances down at you with a smile before you both return your gazes to Tagro. The tiger anthro stops gawking and gives out a light chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heheh, Lysander, you were keeping this guy hidden from me? Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well, I'm just not sure how other anthros would react to seeing a real live human, considering the fact that they're not really supposed to exist, after all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTagro just looks at you two and starts laughing. He holds his sides as you both just look at him like he's gone insane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha! Lysander, you know that you can trust me! I would've agreed to helping him get back home if that was the case!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-really!?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah! But, what is this Winlow's Stone anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysander and Tagro sit down on the bed as you're placed on the bedside table. The two of you begin filling Tagro in with what you've learned so far, the tiger nodding in understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Well then, we really should get to that park right now then, huh?\" Tagro says, standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysander tells Tagro and you to turn around as he switches to more proper clothing for outdoor activities. Once you're all prepared, you leave the room and pass by Lysander's sister's room. However, the snoring sound is no longer heard...Lysander and you glance at each other before looking back at the door.</span></div></div>",

It was already too late as his older sister was already looking down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Lysander, what is that?\" she asked stiffly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-um...A human.\" Lysander said awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind is already frozen, along with your friend. The atmosphere gets more and more awkward as she just stares at you in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...Don't believe it...\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, can I say something?\" Tagro said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all look at him, suddenly making him uncomfortable. He quickly regains his composure as he tries his best to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you see, Jack, the human, he's not from this world. There's this magical thing, and it teleports stuff to other worlds, and, Jack is, well, a victim of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? But, that just sounds...Ridiculous!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's the truth, sis! How else could Jack be sitting here in my hand right now!\" Lysander insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysander's sister looked at you, thinking. The three of you practically held your breath, hoping that she would believe you all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...Okay, let's say that what you're saying is true. Then what are you two doing to him?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're trying to help him find Winlow's Stone so we can bring him back to his world!\" Lysander said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, what!? What stone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou three fill her in on what you know, which isn't much. But when you tell her about where you're going, she suddenly freaks out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? Lysander, you are not going to a digging site! It's dangerous!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, it's the only clue we have!\" Lysander said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right miss. Right now, it's the only chance I have.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at you with more pity than anger. After thinking it over, she sighs while shaking her head. \"Wait here, I'll get changed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? Who said you were coming with us!?\" Lysander protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen here, kiddo. If you get hurt, I'll get the blame. So I'm not gonna let you go running around blindly looking for a glowing rock and probably get yourself killed. I'm coming with you, and that's final. Besides, I'm the older sister. That means I'm in charge, got that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can feel Lysander's grip tighten a bit as the two siblings stare each other down. You knew that sibling rivalry can get pretty bad sometimes, but you just hope that Lysander doesn't accidentally squeeze you too much from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-fine! But, Jack is gonna be the leader of this search team, so you have to listen to him, alright!?\" Lysander said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough. Now, stay put. I'll be out in a sec.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for understanding, miss.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, please! Just call me Elsa. Calling me miss makes me sound older.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you mean it makes you sound as old as you look?\" Lysander slyly added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsa hits his brother in the head before retreating back into her room. You got jogged pretty badly from the impact, so Tagro suggested holding you for now, which Lysander accepted. You could actually tell that he just wanted to hold you, but then again, you're mythical in this world!</span></div></div>",

Tagro is just about to turn the knob when it turns on it's own. Thinking fast Lysander grabs you rather roughly and places you in the pocket of his jeans. You hear the door open and a loud male voice shout \"I'm home!\" You slowly peak your head out of Lysander's pocket and gasp quietly when you see an impossibly tall red dragon in a military outfit in front of you. Even by this world's standards the dragon had to be at least eight feet tall. He doesn't seem to notice you and instead turns his attention towards Elsa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this is a nice welcoming committee isn't it?\" His voice is cheerful and full of life. He takes off his hat and reveals two large white horns. Elsa, Lysander and Tagro are left speechless. The red dragon frowns slightly. \"What, no hug for your old man?\" He asked. Lysander and Elsa suddenly come to life and hug their dad. Even looking up from this angle you can tell that Lysander's dad is a good two feet taller then Elsa and seems three feet taller then Lysander. \"Ah, that's better\", the large dragon says. \"Now if you'll excuse me I have to call your mother. I know I just got back from overseas but apparently your mother was sent a strange stone from a friend of hers. Apparently her friend found a...ah what did she call it again? Oh, right a Winlow's Stone\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly feel very afraid. The dragon continues oblivious to your existence. \"Anyway, it turns out that this stone may have some connection to humans. You kids know how your mother get's on the subject of humans. She obsessed with them and goes off in her own little world. Anyway, I'll take you kids out for lunch and we can have a nice long chat on how your year's going. Oh Tagro you can come to if you like.\" Just as Lysander's dad was about to walk into the kitchen Lysander stops him. \"Dad wait.\" The red dragon turns and sees his son. \"Yes, Lysander\", his father asked? \"Where did mom's friend find this Winlow's Stone?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I can see this subject has gotten your attention to\", the red dragon comments. \"Where dad\", Lysander ask again? \"Apparently your mom's friend found it in the construction site at the park and sent it right to her. All the way to Dragovin.\" Lysander's dad turned and walked into the kitchen. Leaving the three anthros and you alone. You couldn't believe it. The stone that could get you back to your own world again was now wherever this Dragovin was. You try to get Lysander's attention and he slowly picks you up and holds you in front of his face. A sadness in his eyes. \"I'm sorry Jack\", he says. \"Don't be sorry\", you say. \"Maybe we can get to this Dragovin place, where is it?\" \"The other side of the world\", Elsa answers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart falls. So that's it. Your stuck in this world, with no way to get home. What now? You look at Lysander and his eyes seemed to fill with tears. He really did want to help you. You pat his snout gently and he rubs his eyes and looks at you. He then looks to Elsa. You follow his gaze. She looks slightly less sad but looks at you with pity. You then look to Tagro who looks just as sad as Lysander. You wonder what to do now. You then think of a way to make Lysander happy again. \"Hey look on the bright side Lysander\", you start trying to cheer your new friend up. \"At least will be friends forever, right?\" Lysander looks at you. He can tell your just putting on a show to make him feel better, but it makes him smile all the same. \"Right, so what should we do now?\" He smiles back at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if I'm gonna be here a while how about you introduce me to your dad. He seems nice.\" Your suggestion seems to make Lysander smile. \"Yeah\", your dragon friend agrees. \"He is nice. But he's also really strong and tough. He's a general in the army and is often overseas so we don't get to see him that much. Sorry, I guess with all that's happened we forgot he was coming home today.\" Lysander seemed really interested in his dad's work. He went on and on about all that his dad did and the more you heard the more excited you were about meeting him. But you were also pretty nervous. If he really was as strong as Lysander said he was maybe you should wait to meet him. But then again his dad did seem nice so maybe it won't be so bad. Finally you interrupt your friend's rambling. \"Lysander!\" You shout. Lysander looked at you waiting to hear what you had to say. \"Why don't we...</span></div></div>",

You watch as Lysander fidgets with his fingers and tries to speak. you understand why he's worried. A mythical creature suddenly appears in your world and you've made friends with it. He's probably not sure how his dad will react. You notice your friend is having trouble and gently pull on his shirt to get his attention. He looks down at you and you whisper, \"It'll be fine just tell him.\" Lysander smiles at you then turns his attention to his dad.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad, I have something to tell you\", Lysander begins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What is it son\", his dad says? The red dragon notices Lysander's body movement and look on his face. He can tell it's something serious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you know how we think humans are just a myth\", Lysander begins. \"Yes\", his dad answers slightly confused and concerned. \"Well their not just a myth anymore. Lysander's dad looks even more confused and Elsa pushes into the conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've met one dad.\" At first the dad thinks this is a joke but then he sees his children's faces and realizes their serious. \"Are you serious\", he asked. \"Where, when, how?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I met him a few minutes ago and Lysander met him this morning and Tagro met him before I did. Anyway he came to this world through the use of a Winlow's Stone and we were going to help him find another one to get him back to his world, but then you said that mom's friend sent it to her and now he's stuck here with us. He has no way to return home and the only people he knows are us. So we were hoping he could stay here with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Lysander's dad point of view)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looks at your children. If what they said was true. This could be a very important find. But you needed to see proof. You were sure this was just some prank. No way could a human exist. \"Do you have him with you\", you asked? All three nodded. \"Then let me see him.\" You thought that you had them, You thought that they would pull a little doll out and you would all share a laugh but when Lysander reached into his pocket and held his hand out in front of you. You were shocked. There standing in your son's hand was a very tiny human. It looked like it had popped right out of the pages of a book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Jack's point of view)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt Lysander's hand close around you and pull you upwards. When he opened his hand again you looked up and saw the red dragon looking down at you, mouth agape. You watched as he shook his head and reached down to pick you up. You felt his finger's curl around your body and lift you up to his eye level. Unsure what to do you laugh nervously and wave to him saying, \"hi.\" You watch the red dragon's and he is... </span></div></div>",

If you really were stuck here, then without anyone's help it would be very difficult to survive. \"Really\", answered the red dragon. \"My son and daughter seem to like you and I'm sure my wife will be overjoyed at the fact that a real human is staying with us. So do you want to live with us if we can't find a way back to your own world.\" Before you answer you asked what did he mean if you couldn't find a way back home. You thought that there was no way for you to return with out the Winlow's Stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No that's just all you know. There could be other ways for you to return that we just don't know about yet.\" Your eyes light up when you hear this. The red dragon continues. 'But if we can't find a way for you to return then, you can stay with us. So I'll ask again. Do you want to stay with us?\" \"Yes\", you shout with joy. \"Well looks like I have one more mouth to feed. Thankfully this one won't take much.\" You all laugh. \"So human what's your name? Mine is Zilconis. General Zilconis.\" \"My name is Jack\", you answer. \"Well Jack\", Zilconis begins. \"Welcome to our family.\" Zilconis turns his attention to his son. \"Lysander.\" \"Yeah dad.\" \"Take your friend and our little guest upstairs with you and find him a safe place to sleep. I'll come up to check on you wants I finish talking to your mother over the phone.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, Lysander gently picks you up and carries you upstairs. Tagro follows and Elsa stays behind to talk to her dad. \"Awesome\", shouts Lysander. I have a brand new friend and he's from another world and he's living with us.\" You can see your slightly chubby dragon friend smile with joy and for the first time in your life you feel safe and happy. \"Hey, Lysander\", Tagro calls out. \"Why don't we play that new video game while Jack finds a place to sleep in your room.\" \"I don't know Tagro, I don't feel right letting Jack explore my room at his size, without me with him. What if I lose sight of him. I could step on him, or he could get eaten by a bug. Also I think dad might be upset if I let anything happen to Jack on my watch.

Tagro picks up the game he put down, showing a somewhat cartoonish anthro with an eye patch throwing what looked like an energy punch towards the corner of the case. Must be a fighting game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ultimate Brawlers 4! It's the newest addition to the series!\" Tagro happily announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysander's eyes seem to sparkle as he looked at the case. He immediately went over to his TV, placing you under it before pulling out a gaming console in the cabinet underneath and plugging the whole thing in. You watch as the excited teen eagerly puts everything in its place before grabbing you again. The two anthros sit down on the floor, controller in front of them, as Lysander places you between them. The dragon turns everything on and takes out the disc from the case. So games look the same in this world too, huh? He pops open the console and places the disc inside, closing it and waited. The TV screen shows an intense scene, with similar music as various anthros appear two at a time, fighting each other. Lysander just stares in awe, as Tagro laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you you'd like it!\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysander nods as the title finally comes up, along with the main menu. Your giant friends pick VS mode, as a roster of character portraits appear. Lysander picks a big burly grey dragon, while Tagro picks what looks like a slim cheetah with a headband. You watch as the match begins, with Lysander going on the offensive. Tagro blocks and counters the dragon's attacks, landing some good hits on Lysander's character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, you're button mashing again.\" Tagro notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's what I always do when I don't know the moveset.\" Lysander replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as after several seconds, Lysander's character lays on the floor flat with an empty health bar. The next few matches go by somewhat painfully, with Lysander losing round after round. Tagro was laughing while Lysander seemed to be losing his cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, how are you better at this than me?\" the dragon asked, clearly frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Skill dude, skill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put a hand to your chin, thinking about what you've witnessed. The battle system doesn't seem all that complicated. Heck, you're a bit of a gamer yourself in your world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Tagro, mind if I give Lysander some tips?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge tiger teen looks down at you curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You understand this game, Jake?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have video games in my world too, just so you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Let's see how much good that'll do for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysander picks you up and sets you on his shoulder. You sit down as you put a hand on his cheek, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Tagro's capture moves are slower than regular attacks. Use that time to hit him to cancel it out. Also, down forward punch. That's a really common combo in my world. Maybe your world's games use that too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysander nods as another match starts. The big dragon takes your advice and begins doing better this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I'm kicking your butt!\" Lysander says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysander's character throws what looked like an energy ball, and hits Tagro's character, knocking down his health to zero. Lysander pumps an arm up, laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, I totally beat you!\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lysander, that's just round one. Now I can really take my gloves off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a little intimidated by that, honestly. When the second round begins, Tagro starts off with a combo move, not giving Lysander any time to react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-whoa! When did you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, skill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysander attempts to fight back, but was either dodged or blocked. Tagro smiles as he quickly pushes the buttons with his thumbs, quickly defeating Lysander with a perfect health bar, no hits. Lysander seemed horrified, looking at Tagro as he smiles back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack! I need tips!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I honestly have nothing. Maybe if I was big enough to hold the controller...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, calm down. It's just a game. We're supposed to be having fun, right? Anyway, I'll ease up on the third round, if it makes you feel any better.\" Tagro tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysander looks at Tagro weirdly before smiling. The third round begins, and the two beat each other normally. Combos, throws, regular attacks, until Lysander was about to lose. Tagro comes in, but Lysander throws another energy ball, hitting Tagro and claiming victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won!\" Lysander said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but Tagro didn't even try to block that last attack.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLysander looks at you before turning to Tagro, who was still smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just thought you could have this match. I already got a bunch before it anyway!\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you begin laughing as you continue your game.</span></div></div>",

Then I found myself here. Please don't hurt me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young dragon just looked at you, thinking. \"Well human, its unfortunate that I found you. My father loves to torture and humiliate you humans. Mom enjoys to crush you, by squeezing you until you pop, or stepping on you. My sister likes to keep you as slaves, until she grows bored. I don't know what she does with them after. But me, want to know what I like to do with your kind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were too afraid to look at the young dragon teen to answer. \"Not gonna guess, fine. I like to swallow you alive, so you'll slowly be digested. And I can see your bones the next day. Too bad I found you, cause I'm hungry. And your the perfect breakfast.\" The dragon lifts you up and opens his muzzle to show off his serpentine forked tongue and razor sharp fangs, glistening with saliva. He drops you into his mouth and closes it, when he feels you land on his tongue. Immediately he swishes you around, moaning at your taste, for several minutes. Until he finally swallows you down, pressing his fingers on the bulge in his throat. Until it passes his rib cage and disappears. You drop into his stomach and start to beat on the walls, begging to be released. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it human, struggle, your just making me feel better. You tasted by far the best, out of any other human I have eaten. Too bad I can only eat you once. Goodbye human, it was very nice to m'eat' you.\" You can hear the dragon laughing and keep hitting the walls, hearing the dragon purring. Eventually you stop, exhausted and feel liquid on your body. Knowing what would happen next, you close your eyes and wait for the pain to end...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes after about 15 minutes and realize your still alive. The boy's stomach is still working, but your perfectly fine. Guess your immune in this world. Instead of moving you remain still, to avoid the dragon boy to discover your still alive. \"Hey sis, I found a human.\" You hear, \"Oh Zene, did you at least save it or did you eat it. My last slave disobeyed me and I had to get rid of it.\" \"No Clara, I ate the human, he tasted the best so far. He stopped moving awhile ago, so he's dead now.\" \"Well at least you enjoyed a good treat, I'm hanging out with friends today so you'll be alone for a few hours.\" \"Ok sis, have fun.\" Since the dragons think your dead, you wait until the boy falls asleep, so you can try to escape.</span></div></div>",

Knowing you are close, you push forward and are able to grab one of his back teeth and hoist yourself in his mouth. Mentally congratulating yourself, you look up to see his mouth is open.

Grabbing and goisting yourself up and trying to ignore the saliva washing over you, you manage to grasp the corner of the dragon boys mouth and pull yourself out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSliding down his face, you land on his pillow, only to tumble on the bed from the foam in the pillow.

Now if I have relieved ypu of some your fears, can you please tell me why you smell so strange.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh, um, I was discovered by your son this morning, who told me what your family does to my kind. After that he ate me. I spent maybe 10 hours? Inside his stomach, salvaging whatever food he swallowed to feed myself. After I heard him snore, I forced my way into his sphincter, climbed his throat and out of his mouth. To slide down his sheet and try to escape your house\" you reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe father looks at you in surprise and responds \"You didn't die? You survived my son's digestion?\" \"Y-yeah\". The father looks at you, then gently sets you down on the sofa and reaches for something on the table. You saw him grab some sort of cloth, then use his claws, which you noticed were pitch black and very sharp, slice the cloth into two strips and hands one to you. You look at him cofused until he says \"While you managed to survive my sons stomach, I'm afraid your clothes have not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, you see you are stark naked and immediately blush. Grabbing the cloth out his claws and wrapping it around yourself, until it looked like you were wearing a toga. The father chuckles at your reaction and looks at you again. Lowering his hand and motioning for you to get on. You do so with no hesitation. As he lifts you up again and says \"Well human, it seems you are an interesting case. Our world has encoutered many humans. And I'm afraid most didn't survive for very long. However you have. A dragon's digestion is the most powerful there is. Even when Zene ate change as a hatchling, the coins simply melted away. We have a prophecy on our woelse that said a human would come here and be unique from all the others. I have a feeling that you are that human, which means my daughter and I will protect you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is more to the prophecy, but it has been so long that I do not remember it. I will need to do some research and find out. But don't worry you will be protected and cared for. And since it seems ypu can survive a dragon's stomach, I can only suggest you get used to it. For if it ever happens me or my daughter, Clara will have to swallow you to keep you hidden from my wife and son alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, quite grateful that the father is so kind. \"So what do we do now?\" You ask. The father responds \"First i get a drink as I intended to.\" Grabbing a glass filling it with water and them drinking it. \"And we head off to bed. Fortunatwly for you my wife and son are heading out tomorrow to visit her parents. Clara is staying with me so I can help her with some school work. As for trying to hide you, for now I will place you in one of my drawers, so my wife can't see you. Oh and my name is Malistrix.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalistrix heads back upstairs and turns off the hall light, opening his door and looking to see his wife is still asleep. You saw a clock on a dresser saying it was 9:32 pm. You heard a drawer slide open and felt yourself slide off of Malistrix's hand and onto something soft. Hearing and feeling the drawer close, you are then surrounded by darkness. Not having much else to do, you lay on the soft surface and fall asleep.</span></div></div>",

She was dressed similarly but with yellow highlights. The third was a redhead and she was the tallest of the bats. She was wearing a pair of glasses and a blue t-shirt with khakis. All three bats were full figured and hourglass shaped. They're beautiful, but you don't feel like letting them see you and hide behind a rock. All three of the bat girls landed feet first on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde haired one yawned and looked at her watch. \"Koko,\" she said. \"Are you sure you heard something?

This is our cave, we can't let anyone in without our permission.\" \"Oh,\" groaned Rita. \"Moira, maybe it's a cute he-bat, or better yet, maybe a robin.

They're sure to find you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is somebody here,\" said Koko. \"Somebody very small by my readings.

You look up at this bear woman to see that if she was normal sized and human she would probably weigh well around five hundred pounds. She even had what looked like black lipstick on with what looked like dyed black hair that visibly was once red. To top it all off, she was wearing nothing but a tight bright bikini designed like the Russian flag. You were looking at a big beautiful bear woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis bear woman was holding a lantern as she looked around and then let out a slight grunt. \"Dumb stupid bats,\" she says in a thick Russian accent. \"I tell them this my side of cave. Never listen. Wait, that noise too small to be bats. I wonder.\" As this bear woman stomps forward to continue to look around, you narrowly dodge being turned into a pancake under her huge paw. You're forced to grab one of her huge toenails to avoid being squashed flat. As this bear woman keeps moving, she leaves dents in the ground where she stomps and you let out a scream as she see just how heavy she is. Suddenly the bear woman lets out a confused murmur and twitches her ears. She looks down and sees you and lets out a look of excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Human! I haven't seen human in cave for years!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a scream and then you run as this bear woman gets on all fours and chases after you. \"Come back human! I want closer look!\" You keep on running but you can't see where your going and this bear woman can see without her lantern as she runs after you. But with what little you can make out, you see a crack in the wall. You think you can make it and you have to hurry because this bear is after you. \"Come back cute little human!\" The bear woman almost caught you in her mouth that time and you almost make it to the crack, you're almost home free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately you trip on a small pebble and fall to the ground. Before you can get up, this bear woman grabs you by the foot and holds you up to her mountain range sized face and smiles showing her building sized teeth. \"Please put me down!\" you yell. \"What do you want?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not worry little human,\" said the bear woman. \"I am Inga and you are now my...\"</span></div></div>",

You went wide-eyed and red in the cheeks. Please don't let her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou guessed right as Inga set her lantern down and pulled open her bikini top and placed you in the strap between her breasts before letting it go and it snapped back into place, slamming you against her body, into the brown forest that was her fur. You instantly start squirming to try and free yourself. It didn't work and everything started shaking around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vy shchekotat', cute little human!\" Inga said, laughing as she spoke in both English and Russian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no idea what she was telling you, you didn't speak Russian, but from the way she was shaking and speaking, you must have tickled with your squirming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInga walked to her side of the cave, her footpaws leaving dents in the ground where she stepped from how heavy she was. She couldn't wait to love on her new pet. She adored her little human already. And she had just gotten it! She'd never let it escape her or be taken away. Laying down on her bed, she reached down and  took her pet up in her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet again, the bear woman grabbed you by the foot and held you up to her mountain range sized face and smiled at you before bringing you to her mouth with her lips puckered. You scream and instinctively try to run, expecting Inga to try and eat you. But  the grizzly lowers her head down and you flinch as she kisses you and soon you're covered in bear silva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We sleep now, cute little human.\" the bear woman told you. then looked as you a moment <br>\r\n<br>\r\n a small piece of black string that to you, looked like a sturdy rope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rope might as well have been a noose, as you began to piece it all together, but it was too late now. In one fell swoop the giant grizzly bear anthro swooped her hand down. You weren't sure what had happened, but somehow, in mere seconds you were tied to the sole of her footpaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInga laughed again, saying the word \"golubushka\" to you, wiggling her massive toes before you saw Inga's other foot getting closer to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooooooooooooooooooo\", you yelled at the top of your lungs, as the colossal foot came in contact. Sandwiching you in between them. You were completely surrounded by fur and flesh. The thick, cheesy smell of Inga's feet was extremely powerful, and they were rubbing the smell all over her miniscule body. When she pulled her paws apart, you were rubbed raw red and gasping for breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Night-night!\" Inga cooed before falling asleep herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would seem, however, that you weren't going to get a good night's sleep, because during the night...  </span></div></div>",

Then what the bear woman does next really scares, she licks every last one of her giant teeth and then licks her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what do you know?\" she asks. \"I've found a nice and delicious little human.\" You scream as the bear woman sticks out her tongue and drools. You try to run but the giant hungry black bear snatches you up and holds you in the air by your foot. You're in utter fear as the bear woman drools uncontrollably and even licks you like a lollipop a few times. You even swallow some of her saliva and gag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-Please let me go. I don't want any trouble.\" The bear woman lets out a laugh as her huge stomach shakes. You notice she's wearing a jacket and pants that look ready to snap off. \"Let you go?\" asks the giantess. \"Sorry, but that isn't an option. There's only one thing we gals do with humans around here and that's...\" The bear woman licks her lips and snaps her jaws in front of you before she laughs again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was bad. This bear woman wanted to eat you. Then she does the unthinkable and pushes you against her bloated stomach as you muffle.

Congratulating yourself on your victory, you don't notice the black scaly claw coming for you. Zenth grips you between his fingers and holds you in front of his face. He gives you a somewhat scolding look and whispers to keep hidden. The bell finally rings, and everyone starts to leave the classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Zenth walks to wherever he needs to go next, he checks to make sure you haven't fallen out of his pocket. \"Please try to be more careful, okay?\" You smile and nod your head. You hear what sounds like ducks being strangled, and look to see several little kids running around yelling. \"So, why are there random kindergartners running around outside?\" you ask. \"Well, about everyone from kindergarten to high school goes here. But I swear, if I hear one more voice like that I'll jump out a window. Even if our school only has one floor.\" You grin to yourself, and hear several anthros talking as you enter the cafeteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to show you to my friends now, I think that they might be able to help.\" You are a little nervous, as well as shy, to see Zenth's friends, but Zenth seems pretty nice, so you conclude that his friends must be good too. Zenth picks out his food, and goes to sit at a small round table with a few other anthros sitting around laughing and eating. Zenth sits down, and starts talking with the others. \"Hey guys, I have something to show you,\" he exclaims. \"Yea? What is it?\" a wolf anthro with light gray fur asks.

It may take a few days, or more, for you to discover a way back to your home. Still, you felt confident, welcomed, and for the second time, a bit hopeful. One of Zenth's friends speaks up, breaking the silence. \"So, are you just going to stand there, or come eat? Compared to us, you probably don't need as much, so it's no trouble. Have a seat!\" You smile and nod your head, but aren't too sure where to sit. To answer your question, Zenth drops you right on the center of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next half hour passes, and by then you have learned many of the anthro's names, some of their personalities, and that they want to help you. They also give you some of their food, which fills you up pretty quickly. Eating a burger that was the size of a small house was pretty fun!  After casual talk with the anthros you discuss ideas such as where you will stay, and with who. Eventually Zenth decides to have you live with him while you are here. You happily agree, and glance at the gigantic clock. The small hand lay at 12, and the larger one close to the 6, meaning lunch was almost over.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was a pretty short class as well, in under an hour you left the school, perched on Zenth\u2019s shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it always like this at your school?\" you ask Zenth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" he replies, turning his head towards you. \"Umm, yeah! The class after lunch is always the last one. Is it different in your world?\" You laugh, nodding your head. \"Well, we don't have giant bipedal animals walking around in broad daylight. School hours are also much longer.\" A look of embarrassment appears on the dragon's face. \"I meant besides that. You really enjoy messing with my mind, don't you?\" Grinning in response, you lay back on the giant's right shoulder, exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo where exactly are we going now?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious?\u201d Zenth replied. \u201cWe already decided you would stay with me as long as you were here, and I\u2019m guessing you don\u2019t want to sleep out on the streets. So we\u2019ll stay at my house!\u201d This time you were the one with an embarrassed expression. \u201cR-right, that\u2019s what I would have guessed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter laughing at your forgetfulness, the dragon turned right onto a road lined with houses. Putting aside the scale, the houses looked just like the ones you saw every day in your town. It was still hard to believe that everything here could be so similar, yet so different. Zenth broke into a jog, interrupting your thoughts. The sudden movement tripped you up, causing you to fall off his shoulder. Fortunately, you grabbed onto the colossus\u2019s shirt sleeve before you could fall 500 ft. onto the concrete sidewalk. The part of Zenth\u2019s shirt you grabbed wasn\u2019t too far down from where you fell. It only took a matter of seconds to climb up his enormous right bicep. Panting, you pull yourself back up onto Zenth\u2019s shoulder and plop down, so that your back was to his neck. The dragon feels your movement and stops, turning his head to look at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you o.k?\u201d You feel his neck muscles tensing against your back; it\u2019s obvious that he\u2019s worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine. Thanks for stopping though.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe anthro\u2019s huge blue eyes scan over you, checking for injuries. You know it\u2019s a sign of concern, but it still sends chills down your spine. The sight of a humanoid dragon with dark scales, who\u2019s head was bigger than your entire house, staring directly at you with huge pale eyes that almost looked like moons. In fact, his head was so close to yours that it was only possible to see one eye. It reminded you of the giant, fearsome dragons you've seen in storybooks for children. You almost expected him to lunge out at any moment, filling your vision with his pitch-black face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re not hurt, I\u2019ll try to walk slower so you don\u2019t fall again. We should be at my house pretty soon.\u201d Zenth continues walking through the neighborhood, though you\u2019ve noticed that he\u2019s slowed down now. After another minute or so, you both come to a fairly large house covered in blue paint. \u201cIt looks like we\u2019re here!\u201d Zenth exclaims cheerfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom within the house you hear\u2026 <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Turning the doorknob, the dragon poked his head inside and scanned the interior for anyone. Luckily, the house was as empty as it had sounded when you were at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess we\u2019re pretty lucky,\u201d Zenth commented, wiping a drop of sweat off his forehead. \u201cHaha, look, I was so nervous about anybody else seeing you that I actually started sweating!\u201d You smiled, secretly hiding the fact that you were also sweating a little. \u201cAwesome, since nobody\u2019s here yet, I can give you a tour of my house.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few minutes flew by as your friend showed you around his gigantic (to you) living quarters. Finally, after seeing the kitchen, the living room, the bathroom, and everything else, he took you into his room. It looked mostly clean, much better than most teenage boy\u2019s rooms you\u2019ve seen in the past. There were a couple piles of dirty clothes, but that was about all. Zenth plopped down on his bed, gripping you tightly in his hands so he wouldn\u2019t drop you. He then kept you held between his thumb and index finger, above his head so that he was looking directly at you. Gazing downwards at his colossal face, you become light-headed. Zenth released a huge yawn, giving you a full view of his wet throat. You immediately winced; knowing very well what would happen if he let go. Of course he kept his grip on you, making sure you wouldn\u2019t become one of his afternoon snacks. You were still nervous however, even after he closed his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm.. do you think you could set me down somewhere? I-It\u2019s just that I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m getting kind of dizzy up here.\u201d You gave your best convincing smile to the giant dragon head below you. \u201cYeah, sure little guy.\u201d The giant shifted a bit and set you on his left palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cHold on, I just need to take my shirt off really quick. You know, hot day and all,\u201d Zenth said. You gave a small nod and waited as he grabbed the collar with one hand and gave a strong tug, helping the article slide off his body. He then tossed the shirt aside and stretched out on the bed, setting you on his now bare chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the shirt gone, you saw for the first time his tan-colored underbelly, which covered most of his stomach area. You also got to see his wings slide out from under him, which must have been folded up under the t-shirt. They were mostly black (no surprise there) but also had streaks of red down the edges. The tips could have easily touched both walls if Zenth wanted them too, but he kept them only a few feet away from each shoulder. The dragon put his hands behind his head and yawned once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what\u2019s the plan?\u201d you asked, a little bored. \u201cWell, until we figure something out, you can eat and sleep here. But I\u2019m not sure if I should show you to my family yet. They may attack, since they\u2019ve never seen a human before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a minute\u2026\u201d you said. \u201cHow do you know about humans? I remember you mentioning their name before too.\u201d Zenth\u2019s face contorted, and he responded \u201cOh yeah, that. Humans are kinda \u201cfictional\u201d in our world. Sort of like how we aren\u2019t real in your world. I mean, you\u2019ve heard of us before, right?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laughed. \u201cI guess you\u2019re right, but I never thought anthros would be real, and I never would have known they would be the size of buildings. Zenth smiled and started to respond, but was interrupted by a loud growling noise. You felt a rumble below you, and looked down to see the dragon\u2019s massive hand rubbing his empty stomach. \u201cHehe, guess I should get some grub in my gut, huh?\u201d He gave a large grin, once again frightening you. Hopefully \u201cgrub\u201d meant actual food as supposed to, well, you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u2018Stop thinking like that\u2026\u2019 you scolded yourself. \u2018Zenth\u2019s nice; he would never intentionally eat me. Besides, I\u2019m sure he has plenty of other food in his house, so why would he need to use me as a snack?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, hello? Are you still here?\u201d the anthro asked, waving his hand in front of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Oops, I must have spaced out again.\u2019 \u201cYeah I\u2019m here.\u201d Taking a few seconds to sit up, you get into a more comfortable position while on your friend\u2019s chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, so do you want to go grab something to eat? There should be some chocolate pudding lying around.\u201d \u201cThat sounds great, thanks!\u201d You feel really grateful that Zenth found you outside the school, who knows where you might be now without him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCool, let\u2019s go!\u201d The giant lowers his palm for you to step on to, and when you do he gets up and starts walking towards the kitchen.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The dragon walked into the kitchen and set you on the table. You watch as he goes to the refrigerator and begins rummaging through it. \u201cThere should be something in here that you would be able to eat. I doubt anyone will notice food\u2019s missing, since you won\u2019t eat much at your height.\u201d You nod silently, waiting in anticipation for whatever food there was in the refrigerator. After what seemed like minutes, Zenth pulled a small white container out and set it in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarely able to control your hunger, you ran over to it and exclaimed, \u201cAlright! Let\u2019s see what we got!\u201d The teenage dragon grinned and untwisted the lid. As soon as it was off a delicious chocolate smell washed over you. Zenth grabbed two bowls and set them on your table, scooping pudding into each. It was pretty obvious which one was for whom, as one bowl had a drop of the dessert while the other looked like a mountain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a minute, how are you going to eat that?\u201d your friend realized. \u201cThe only way you could get to it is if you were inside the bowl, but then you would just get covered in pudding.\u201d Taking a moment to contemplate this problem, you responded \u201cWell, if there\u2019s no other way, I guess I wouldn\u2019t mind getting a little pudding on me. Do you think you could give me a lift?\u201d The giant grinned, holding out his hand. \u201cHop on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crawled onto his palm, experiencing that rollercoaster-like sensation as you were lifted into the air. Wind rushed through your hair, leaving a whistling sound in both ears as the world turned to a blur. From Zenth\u2019s perspective, all he was doing was lifting you a few feet into the air. He was even doing it slowly, so as not to let you fall. But it still made you feel light-headed. The massive hand finally stopped against its owner\u2019s chest, making a 90 degree angle. The short ride made you exhausted, so you leaned against the dragon\u2019s bare skin while catching your breath. The warmth emanating from the skin\u2019s surface made you want to sleep. The only thing that kept you awake was the sound of Zenth\u2019s stomach, which you could hear even more clearly now that you were right against his torso. You decided to bring something up so you would forget about the possibility of being eaten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened your mouth to speak. \u201cUmmm.. why did you bring me all the way up here? I only needed to be lifted a few inches so that I could get into my bowl, remember?\u201d <br>\r\nYour friend gave an uncharacteristically somewhat-evil grin, bringing you closer to his face. \u201cOh, I know. I just thought of something that would be more fun, that\u2019s all.\u201d His words sent a shiver down your spine. Could Zenth have a more mischievous, darker side that you hadn\u2019t seen yet? Or was he just messing with you\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only way to find out was to ask, so you nervously said \u201cW-What do you mean by that?\u201d The dragon smiled, glad you were playing along. \u201cWell, I was thinking we could\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But after a short moment of terror, his words sunk in. He wasn\u2019t planning to torture you in any way! All he wanted was to use one bowl of chocolate pudding for the both of you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Zenth must have seen the look on your face, because he broke out into laughter. Your mind snapped back to reality. For the next thirty seconds or so you awkwardly hung in front of the giant\u2019s face, keeping a tight grip on his scaly finger as he continued snickering. A spray of spittle hit your cheek, and you couldn\u2019t even wipe it off. The dragon finally managed to quiet down, or at least enough so that he could talk to you. \u201cHey, there\u2019s no need to get so mad at me! At least I\u2019m not locking you up in a cage or anything, although you would make a nice pet\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZenth!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was just kidding\u2026\u201d He flipped his hand so that you were sitting safely on his wrist. You immediately took advantage of having a free arm to wipe the dragon saliva off your face. Zenth saw you do this and grinned. \u201cIf you can\u2019t even handle one tiny drop of spit, you might not do too well being in my bowl of pudding.\u201d You sighed, saying \u201cI hoped you\u2019d forgotten about that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re just as hungry as I am, so what do you say we stop beating around the bush and start digging in,\u201d the dragon teen held you several inches above his bowl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, are you sure this is safe?\u201d Before your question was answered, Zenth dropped you. You tried screaming, but you were falling so fast that even breathing was impossible. A loud \u2018thwok\u2019 sound was heard when you landed. The smell of chocolate surrounded you, and you looked around to find yourself waist-high in pudding. You scooped up a handful of the dessert and stuck it in your mouth. A delicious sensation shot through your body, and you began moving around the bowl while eating more. This was amazing! You hadn\u2019t even realized how hungry you were until now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you \u201cswam\u201d through the pudding, a giant metal object struck into it. It then rose up in front of you, carrying a large amount of dessert with it. Looking up, you saw Zenth holding a spoon. \u201cAre you enjoying yourself?\u201d He stuck the spoonful in his mouth, which quickly turned into a small bulge traveling down his neck. You smiled excitedly, replying, \u201cYeah! But try not to accidentally eat me, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d the dragon said seriously. The next couple of minutes were filled with chocolate goodness, but you eventually got tired. Your titan sized friend, however, did not. He had to use much less energy than you did, and was still happily eating. That was fine by you, so you collapsed onto the pudding and closed your eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you rested for a minute, you felt something slide underneath you. Something cold, metallic, and\u2026 \u2018Oh no,\u2019 you thought. Before you had time to react, you were carried into the air on a giant spoon. You shot a panicked look at Zenth\u2019s face, only to see that his eyes were closed with pleasure. \u2018How could this be happening?\u2019 you thought in a state of panic. \u2018Maybe he didn\u2019t see me, but if I can get him to hear me\u2026\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon\u2019s maw opened widely, showing off a display of razor-sharp teeth. A blast of warm breath hit you, and his tongue stretched out in anticipation. You knew what would happen if you didn\u2019t get his attention, so you took a deep breath and shouted his name. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you opened your mouth to shout, pudding flooded into it causing you to gag. You tried calling Zenth\u2019s name, but what came out was something like \u201cZnetnghth!!!\u201d The dragon of course didn\u2019t hear this, and you were lifted even closer to his gaping maw. Now you could feel his hot breath wash over your tiny body, and you stared at his giant teeth in a mixture of awe and fear. Each tooth had to be at least as tall as you were! Something that big could crush you without realizing it, which was just about to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teenager stuck the entire spoonful inside of his mouth, clamping his lips around it. He then pulled the spoon back into the outside world, all of its contents being dropped onto the giant\u2019s tongue. You stood up on the gigantic wet surface and looked for a way to escape. Before you had a chance though, your friend flicked his tongue backwards, launching you towards the back of his throat. You landed in a mixture of pudding and saliva, both soaking into your clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZenth!!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying once again to call out, the only response you got was a deep \u2018mmmmmmm\u2019 sound. To add even more insult, another helping of pudding was dumped on top of you. Trapped inside the mouth of your anthro friend, covered in his spit, you felt humiliation. Soon, you would be swallowed and dumped into the dragon\u2019s enormous belly, along with his snack. The giant muscle beneath you lifted up and began pushing the food towards its owner\u2019s gullet. More saliva dripped from the palate to help lubricate the already-slick chocolate pudding. A wet gulp was heard as the dragon swallowed loudly. You reached out madly, your hands clawing at the back of the tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZenth gave a short gag, feeling a tiny object stuck in the back of his throat. For a second he wondered what it could be, but brushed the idea off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMust just be some lunch that got stuck in my teeth.\u201d The anthro said dismissively. Zenth then lifted his head up to help the meal slide down his throat. You tightened your grip on the giant\u2019s tongue, screaming and pleading. Your words fell on deaf ears though, and gravity won out causing you to let go. The dragon gave one last swallow and felt his snack begin to move down his neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTight throat muscles squeezed all around you and pushed you into Zenth\u2019s belly. After falling through the muscular opening, you landed in a pool of thick stomach fluids. A large belch was heard, rumbling your surroundings. The colossal teen sighed and rubbed his gut happily. You could see the silhouette of his hand moving through the faint light of the stomach wall, until it pulled away. The light that came through the dragon\u2019s skin allowed you to see everything he had eaten. You didn\u2019t exactly want to see the contents of your friends stomach, most of the stuff you could see was just pudding and saliva. Lots and lots of saliva. The shirt you had on was dripping with the liquid, making it extremely heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, Zenth let out another belch. He then remembered you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cHey little human! Where are you right now?!\u201d The anthro poked around in what was left of the bowl of pudding, not knowing that you were inside his own, personal, \u201cbowl\u201d. After several seconds, he gave up. \u201cAlright, I know that you\u2019re in there somewhere. I\u2019ll come get you later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZenth then started walking to his room, the sudden movement knocking you over into a pile of digested food. It smelled like pizza, but given how it looked now it could have been anything. You just hoped that the same thing wouldn\u2019t happen to you. You felt the boy sit down on his bed, still unaware of the extra bit of meat he ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He shivered; it was a lot colder in here than it was earlier. Picking up his shirt, Zenth began putting it back on. As the fabric slipped over his chest and covered his once bare stomach, the light that previously shone through his stomach wall disappeared. Now that he was warmer, Zenth started to wonder where you were.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The dragon said one last word as he was more in the middle school area.

Then the anthro renamon at your table stood up she had the most calming voice and she tried her best to prusade the overly large anthro wolf to sit down and stop. It worked and she helped the blue dragon up off the ground and to the table you were at. She asked what was going on then he spoke up \"I was telling him that he had to quit the season...And take tutoring... He was angered but not as mad as when I told him he was failing every one of his classes with the lowest grades in the school...\" He fixed his glasses over his eyes. He was the absuloute smartest kid in school. A+s in every subject he even teaches others. He is a student teacher and a student tutor... Then he looked at the human silent at first but then said \"Well well well... Looks like you have a problem... Here...\"He grinned then picked up the human and said \"I can fix his size and if he knows the exact cordinates of where his home world used to be I can try to get him back with my teleporter...\" He smirked then turnned thr human around and said \"Should be easy enough. \"</span></div></div>",

They were mostly animal, as you thought, but the weird thing was that most of them wore bathing suits.

That woman wasn't a hippo, she was a Hippowdon, a Pokemon. Pokemon anthros? How was this possible. Then you walk towards the purple and white anthro woman sleeping and learn she is in fact a Mewtwo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she's no ordinary Mewtwo, she apparently underwent Mega Evolution into...</span></div></div>",

It looks nice, but there's still something offsetting about how everything looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in almost an instant the warmth of the sun vanishes as a large area of the sand around you is bathed in shadow. Turning your head back you're met with the sight of a giant, soft pink globe that looks to be dozens of feet tall and wide, but as your eyes adjust to the light you can see that it's actually the stomach of a gargantuan, obese creature with bright pink fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt vaguely bears a humanoid figure bloated with absurd amounts of fat, with arms and legs swollen like balloons. The more you look at it the more you feel that whatever it is is female, with an enormous bust tied within a light blue bikini and and extremely engorged rump, the edges of her hips peeking over the sides of her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts head also boasts animalistic features that lean towards equine, bearing pointed ears, large, bright blue eyes, and a small muzzle in place of a nose and lips, which stretches into a long, giddy smile as she curiously looks down upon you.</span></div></div>",

This one has a soft mauve coat with a dark indigo mane styled akin to a hime cut, a horn protruding through its bangs.

A pair of round-framed glasses rests on its snout, which is deep in a book she's reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twilight!\" The creature holding you repeats, interrupting \"Twilight\" from her book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rainbow?

You then look up to see that the giantess who stepped in front of you is a black, white and brown striped okapi woman, an animal related to the giraffe but with a smaller neck and a zebra-like appearance. She had an unusual figure that looked like it was pear-shaped but from the looks of it, while her legs were fat and chubby, her upper body was muscular. She was wearing pink heart-shaped sunglasses and a rainbow-striped bikini. She had slicked back white hair that was worn in a ponytail and on the top of her head, there were two small but noticeable horns. From the looks of it, she also was wearing a belt with a fanny pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe okapi woman's huge shadow was looming over you. You'd guess that she was 1000ft tall. The titanic okapi looks down and focuses her sunglasses on you before she rubs her chin. \"Gee,\" thinks the okapi woman to herself. \"That's the strangest-looking sand flea I've ever seen.\" You don't like the way the okapi woman is looking down at you and you're really not sure if she's a friendly okapi, so you start to run off while the okapi is distracted in her thoughts. The huge ungulate lady gives a deep snort and then takes off her sunglasses to get a closer look and then gasps. \"Wait a minute,\" says the giant striped lady. \"That isn't a sand flea. That's a human. I never thought I'd actually see one. Huh? I always thought humans would be bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you're running off, you hear stomping in the sand and then turn your head because the okapi woman is following you. You try to run but she only has to take two steps to catch up to you and then she reaches down, holding her enormous behind up in the air as she grabs you and makes you grunt. The titanic okapi then holds you up and then she gives a snort, blasting you with air from her nostrils and making you cough. The okapi woman then gives a smile but from your vantage point, you don't know if the smile is friendly or malicious. For all you knew, the okapi woman was planning to eat you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, if she was, she wasn't doing it just now because she takes you down in front of her rather large rear and unzips the left compartment of her fanny pack. She tosses you inside and you land with a grunt next to her wallet and her car keys. You rub your head and groan before the okapi woman zips you in and hums to herself as she walks away. She takes her beach towel and begins to stomp on her merry way as she reaches the parking lot. She walks up to a pink convertible, unlocks the door and steps inside, sitting on top of her fanny pack and consequently you in the process as you give a grunt. You're pinned underneath this pear-shaped okapi lady and you can't move as she's driving away. You were more afraid than ever because you had no idea if the anthro giants that ruled this world were friendly or not. However, that okapi woman seemed very interested to find out that she found a human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong the way, the okapi giantess stops at a red-light and then takes out her cellphone. \"Hello,\" she says. \"Quinn. This is Mercy. You're not going to believe this but I found a human at the beach today. No, I am not drunk! I'm as surprised as you are that humans are actually real. Listen. I'm on my way home right now. The light's about to turn. I'll talk to you later.\" The okapi giantess resumes driving and you try to find a way to move underneath her massive hulk. You struggle for 10 minutes but the giant okapi woman that captured and now sat on you doesn't even feel you. You wonder how her lower body can be so soft and squishy when her upper body is so beefy and muscular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can even think of an answer, you hear a clicking sound and then the okapi gives a growl. \"I knew that I should've refueled before I went to the beach. The giant okapi lady pulls over to a gas station and gets out as she begins to refuel her car. As you stand in her fanny pack, you give a sigh of relief as the okapi woman is no longer sitting on you and crushing you. You just have to wait as she refuels her car and hope nothing bad happens.</span></div></div>",

You see that her front side wasn't half bad looking, especially based on what you saw of her back side. She had a large belly and E-cup breasts. As for her face, the cow woman had long black hair and a brown spot over her left eye. Both of her eyes were bright brown like the patches on her fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cow woman takes one look and you and she's utterly surprised.

You begin to sweat, and it wasn't just from the heat--having a skyscraper-sized creature stare wordlessly stare at you was unnerving, feminine good looks aside. (She looked rather nice in that blue bikini, even on the plump side. In fact, as a normal-sized human she'd still look great--she was plump in a cute, feminine way, not flabby or obese--wait, were you staring at her? Damn, and you'd already felt pervy for grabbing onto her butt...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snap back to reality when you hear her giggle, and look back up at her face to see her expression changing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes light up with utter glee, ears twitching as she breaks out in a wide, giddy, and let's be honest, <i>really damn cute</i> grin. She lets out a giggle and--you can't believe this is happening--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifts you up to her cheek and nuzzles your tiny form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, aren't you a cutie, little fella! Was that you pinchin' my big rear just now?\" She asks pleasantly, sitting down on the towel upon finishing the question. By your perspective, just that simple act was like a building falling out of the sky. You can't help but wince at the muffled <i><b>WHUMP</b></i> the impact makes; if she hadn't felt you earlier and ended up sitting on you...!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you were alive, she was friendly, and that was good enough for now. You shake your head clear; \"Um, yes...but I WASN'T being a perv or anything; really Miss! You just...kinda walked by when I was standing by the rocks earlier, and I went flying up and...well, I grabbed on by instinct; I didn't know it was your bikini.\" You give a nervous laugh and rub the back of your head. \"And, well; I was hanging on for dear life, and when you were about to sit down...I, uh...figured I should--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get my attention before you got pancaked under my over-sized bum?\" the cheerful titaness breaks in with a smirk, cocking an eyebrow. \"Oh, and I guess we should get introduced: the name's Lisa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help but chuckle at her quip. <i>Good thing this...Lisa, has a sense of humor.</i> \"I wouldn't put it <i>exactly</i> like that, but...yeah. I'm no pervert, but survival wins over manners.\" After a moment's hesitation, you give your own name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa nuzzles you again--which actually felt pretty good--before saying, \"Practical little thing, aren't ya? I can get behind that kinda thinkin', squirt. So, what exactly <i>were</i> ya doin' around these parts? Most humans wouldn't come anywhere <i>near</i> a beach like this. And besides, you don't look like you're gonna go swimmin' or anything.\" With her free hand, she gestures to your clothes--what you normally wore every day, and that distinctly lacked swimwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it's <i>your</i> turn to stare. Looks like this place <i>did</i> have humans in it, after all. <i>Makes sense,</i> you muse; <i>Lisa's first reaction was to talk to me, so she must have known I could answer her.</i> Aloud, you recount how you got to the beach...and that anthros like Lisa were only fictional where you came from. That surprised the plump cow woman quite a bit, but she was more interested than angry or dismissive. (Though you were quick to avoid talking about how cows back home were meat animals. THAT bit of info would stay a secret for as along as you could keep it).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A world with just you little guys and dumb critters, eh? Must have been a real shocker to meet a girl like me, right?\" Lisa asks, giving her chest and udder a little shake. Even with the difference in size and species, you can't help but ogle a little...and hope that she doesn't notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa carefully flattens out her palm, letting you sit down on her hand instead of pinching you. Seated on the soft, short fur of her hand, you look up and ask, \"So....what now, Lisa? What happens next?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa responds with...</span></div></div>",

Whaddya say to some snacks, l'il guy?\" She gestures over her shoulder, at a small shack further up the beach. \"I think they're even givin' out discounts today!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you think about it, a snack sounds nice--you felt really hungry after your whole ordeal so far. Who knew near-death experiences could stir your appetite? Aloud: \"Sure, Lisa; sounds great.\" Lisa giggles at you answer as she stands up...then puts you between her ample breasts as she fishes around in a cooler for her wallet. Now, you would never call your current, ahem, \"perch\" uncomfortable by any means...but like before, you really can't help but feel a mite perverted for enjoying this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if sensing your worries, Lisa gives a laugh as she finally finds her wallet. \"I know, it ain't what you'd call polite...but I needed both hands to find my wallet. 'Sides, I wouldn't put you there if I was offended by such a thing, now would I?\" She looks down at you with a smirk, her face obscured just a little by her ample cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...guess you have a point,\" you answer. Lisa chuckles at that and walks over to the snack bar, each step sending a little jolt through her chest. It isn't much, just a little shake...but still, form your size and perspective, well....<br>\r\nLet's just say that there were a great many guys...and girls...who would pay good money to be in your position right about now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa makes it to the snack bar, asking the cashier--a skinny male alligator anthro--for some frozen yogurt. \"What flavor?\" he asks, ringing up the order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa smirks and points between her breasts. \"Well, ask my human friend here!\" The gator-guy squints--looking a bit embarrassed to be oggling a customer--before he spots you, eyes going wide. The poor guy looks utterly confused--maybe he's seen humans before, but probably not wedged between a girl's breasts. \"Er...what flavor, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold back a chuckle at his discomfort and answer, \"Strawberry, if you have it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn no time at all, you and Lisa are back at her towel, busily eating the frozen treat. Lisa scooped some of the cold treat into lid of the cup it was served in--anything else would have gotten YOU eaten by accident. There was even a tiny spoon for you to use!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...So, you just found yourself walkin' around here? Just...'poof!'...and you're hangin' onto my behind for dear life?\" Lisa asks, swallowing some of the ice cream. The cow-woman gives a little \"Mmm\" at that--not that you can blame her; this was some damn good stuff. The two of you had been chatting for a while, Lisa lounging on her beach towel while you sat on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's about the size of it; yeah. So...you knew what I was...what's the deal for humans here? I mean, with how small we are compared to anthros, I kinda think we'd end up as, well...pets. Or...y'know, eaten. Er, no offense.\" You add the last bit with a nervous grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa smiles, giving you a quick stoke with a massive finger. \"None taken. An don't worry--eatin' humans is big-time illegal! No anthro with half a bit of morals would even think of it, much less do it. As for bein' pets...well, that's the word we use, but it ain't the truth. Never heard of any anthro--'cept a few sickos--keepin humans in cages against their will, and what we normally do is more like...roommates. Humans and anthros living together--but the human has a little house of their own inside the anthro's house. Mutual respect and whatnot. We just say 'pets' 'cause it's the anthro who let the human in as a guest. But <i>nobody'd</i> claim to straight-up <i>own</i> you, little guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink, nodding. That was better than you expected. \"Do humans always live with anthros like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, there's plenty of human-only towns and cities...they're just off-limits to us anthros most of the time. There's plenty of little meet-up spots where we can mingle, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're about to ask another question when the sound of thudding footsteps reaches your ears. Most anthros had them from your perspective, but these were different: they sounded like whoever was making them was big even by anthro standards...and walking right toward you and Lisa. The cow-titaness cranes her head around, also picking up the sound, and looks at you with a grin. \"Don't worry, just one of my girlfriends,\" she assures you. \"I think she'll like meeting you, even. Get ready to meet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then you see a long tail swinging back and forth and look up to see that the anthro chick you were holding onto had long strawberry blonde hair. You then see that she has a definite feline shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you gasp and are hit by painful realization. You had attached yourself to an anthro lioness. This could be dangerous. Who knows what she'd think of a tiny human holding onto her bikini bottom. For all you know, the lioness could be hungry. But what can you do, this lioness had to be hundreds of feet tall If you tried to come down from such a height the fall would probably kill you. You let out a grain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you see the lioness's hair hanging over her rear and figure that maybe you'll be less likely to be seen hiding in the strawberry blonde locks. You hold on tight to the bikini bottom and start to climb towards the hair, your feet pressing against the lioness's mountainous butt cheeks. At one point you pause as the lioness's hand comes down to rub the cheek and scratch where you were just walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake and begin to sweat. \"That was way too close.\" You say. Then you look forward and see the lioness was carrying a giant surfboard in the other hand. \"Oh no.\" You say. Wasting no time, you quickly climb to the lioness's hair and then walk up her back. The lioness pauses once more to scratch herself as she squints slightly. \"That's odd,\" she says in a surprisingly young sounding voice that didn't fit her mature body, \"It feels like there's something crawling on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately the lioness just shrugs her shoulders and at that moment you make it all the way to her bra strap. Before you could climb any further, the lioness plops her surfboard in the water and then jumps on it as you slip and have to grab the strap as you scream. The lioness paddles forward and you look out to see that by now you're tens of miles out into open water. It looks like you're not going to be getting away from the lioness as easy as you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally once the lioness is out far enough, she stands up just as a tsunami comes forward and yells in excitement as the wave takes her forward. You scream and slip as you have to grab the lioness's hair as she surfs forward and moves gracefully. You gotta admit, she has a sweet looking ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, now's not the time for perverted thoughts, you're facing a tidal wave bigger than one hundred tsunamis. You really hope that the lioness is an expert surfer because that wave was coming up fast and if you landed in the water, it would take years for you to swim to shore. Some big water splashes down and you yell as some of it hits you and you slip and grab hold of the lioness's tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

You look to the sides and see two planetary orbs that looked pure bright orange in color that utterly outsized the Union Jack bikini bottom.

She had bright orange skin and looked quite enormous even for a hippo. Had she'd be human sized, she would no doubt weigh a ton with an eight foot wide belly, bulging thighs, breasts the size of pumpkins and a ten foot wide booty. The multi-mile hippo titaness was wearing a bikini that resembled a British flag and seemed to have a Quincy punk appearance with the mohawk in her hair. She had black eye makeup with three anti-eyebrows, three piercings in one ear, a pin in the other ear, a pierced left nostril and three piercings through her lower lip. She had a double pierced navel as well and as she yawned she showed a tongue piercing as big as an island. The hippo giantess was also covered in tattoos, including a magic 8-Ball on her lower belly and a burning skull on the side of her thigh. Overall she looked like a thug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou obviously were afraid of what the hippo giantess would do to you since you didn't know whether or not she was friendly or hostile. If she found you, she might decide to enslave you, squish you or even eat you. You hear a rumbling and move further down the right butt cheek just to be safe.

You screamed as you suddenly slammed into a long, tall wall of fur, and nearly passed out from the impact, but managed to hold onto some hairs. Looking down, you suddenly wish you hadn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown below you was the average body of an anthro, although the body was much farther away from you then you'd logically assume it would be. Confused, you look closely at the surface you were grasping. A very large...neck?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were on a giraffe! Although her neck wasn't to disturbing proportions, it was still a solid 3-4 times as long as most normal necks, not including how much taller all of her limbs were. You quickly looked around to find the hippo girl staring wide-eyed at you, as you were quickly taken into the doorway and lost sight of her. The giraffe, setting her towel on the towel rack, entered the only unoccupied shower. She was going to rinse off?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you expected a little more fanfare before a torrent of water began to wash over you, threatening to send you careening down to the giraffe's one-piece suit, or worse. Grabbing onto her neck hairs as tightly as possible did you no good, however, as the giraffe began running her hands through her hair...and they swiped over you.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You look ahead and see that the giantess you're rocketing towards is a giant anthro Zebra with silver and gray stripes but with white and dark blue hair that was worn in a mohawk with a ponytails. She was very fat, especially below the waist and was wearing a red and white striped, two piece bikini that looked as though it was painted on. As you rocket towards the zebra walking out of the pool, you grab hold of the end of her ponytail and let out a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back to see the other anthros, including the hippopotamus woman who belched you up, were getting farther and farther away and realize the zebra was leaving. She walks off and you look around to see that she was walking through town and everywhere there were giant anthers, mostly women. You couldn't believe the large variety. Two police women were on patrol. One was a muscular golden furred anthropomorphic jaguar woman with thick muscular arms, golden red hair and a pair of round red sunglasses. The other was an extremely massive and pair shaped black furred giraffe woman with red spots, long red hair and a pair of goggles on top of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also a jogger who resembled an obese hot pink skinned axolotl in a tight white jogging suit woman who had just passed a mail carrier who resembled a muscular black stallion wearing a red eyepatch. You look to the other side as the zebra waddles down the street with you slipping slowly and there appears to be a couple of skateboarders going down the sidewalk. One of them was a male dalmatian and the other was a male dachshund. Then you feel the zebra shifting as she moves and then you look to see that she had sat down at a bus stop with you still holding onto her hair. Sitting next to the zebra on the bus stop reading the paper looked like an anthro that she herself didn't seem to know. She was a female anthro cheetah with brown spots and a large booty who seemed to be reading a newspaper as she was waiting for the bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of curiosity you decide to take a closer look at the paper that the cheetah woman is reading while the zebra woman is patiently waiting. In the paper there was what appeared to be an obese reddish-brown furred wolf woman with long blonde hair and a pair of thin glasses who appeared to be wearing some kind of purple jacket. She appeared to be holding up a rock with several human skeletons embedded into it. You shiver in fear and then read the paper headline that states, \"Archaeology Student Finds Evidence that Suggest the Existence of Humans\". From the sounds of it, in this world, humans were considered a mythical species. Then it hits you; that wolf girl was in the paper for finding evidence regarding dead humans. What would happen if an anthro saw a <i>live</i> human like you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you're pondering the situation, you hear a car pull up, but surprisingly it isn't a bus. It appears to be a black convertible with four more female anthros in it and they were just as big as the zebra woman. The driver of the car was a white and rose colored Holstein cow woman with a pair of light glasses and long white hair along with a massive udder that looked bigger than her head. She was also wearing a red cowgirl's outfit complete with a large cowgirl's hat. Next to her was a pale greenish skinned rhinoceros woman with long black hair with green highlights who appeared to be wearing a green unitard. In the back seat there were two more anthro woman. One was a heavy set white furred chihuahua girl with black hair with a rose in it. She was wearing a white dress with purple polka dots over it. The last girl was a gigantic blue furred koala girl with aqua green hair. She wore a pair of shorts with the Australian flag design on them and a matching shirt. She appeared to be eating eucalyptus leaves out of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and your swimming, Zaire,\" mutters the cow girl. \"You're going to make us late.\" \"Some of us like to keep our agility up, Pasipha\u00eb.\" \"Just get in the car.\" Says the cow woman. The zebra woman obeys and gets in the backseat with the koala and chihuahua girls. However, as she does so, your hands slip and you fall screaming before landing on the upholstery of the car seat. Before you have a chance to relax, the zebra, now named Zaire, sits her plump ass down on top of you as you let out a muffled yell.</span></div></div>",

No, you were still alive. Pinned under what had to be several tons of bikini-clad zebra butt and getting a face full of badly-stretched spandex, but alive nonetheless. You could even feel all your limbs, so nothing was broken: another plus. Sure, being under the massive rump hurt like hell, and the pressure pushing you into the seat was insane, but you were <i>alive</i>. That was always a bright side, right? Right! Squirming your head around to the side, you start to laugh--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And find your breath stop short.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeneath the unaware Zaire's mammoth posterior, you were under so much pressure that you couldn't <i>quite</i> fully inflate your lungs. Though you <i>probably</i> weren't in any danger of suffocating, this still set off an instinctual panic mode. <br>\r\nYou squirmed and twitched and thrashed as best you could, trying to find some way out from under Zaire's mass; to alert her; ANYTHING! You'd survived this far, you WEREN'T going to go out asphyxiating under a chubby zebra-girl's ass!! (Even one as admittedly attractive as Zaire. Titanic size aside, she was quite the looker).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue to impotently thrash about, panic mounting...and soon, you hear a feminine grunt from above, muffled by the plump mountains pressing down on you. The pressure suddenly shifts to one side, sunlight rushing into the gap as Zaire tilts her hips to uncover you. When a giant hand awkwardly feels about for the source of its owner's discomfort, you all but grab for it and hold on tight. You don't even mind the vertigo you get from being abruptly lifted up to Zaire's face, or how uncomfortably close you are to her mouth. You can breathe properly now, dammit; that's all that matters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZaire blinks as she turns you over in her hand, looking quite confused. Still dazed from being sat on, you're only vaguely aware of the koala and Chihuahua girls leaning in from the sides. The koala girl sees you and rolls her eyes, an Australian accent (well, what else?) coloring her speech as she snarks, \"Oi; <i>another</i> human under your rump, Zaire? How many times has that happened?\" You hear the Chihuahua girl giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, humans WERE around in...wherever the hell you were, and these titanesses had seen them before. Of course, while that WAS big news, there was still the issue of how your maybe-captress reacted to having you under her sizable rear....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You are moving so fast that you can't even see where you're going as you rocket through the air screaming. Suddenly you hit something enormous and squishy and hold on tight. You let out a groan and rub your head and then look at your surroundings to see that you've hit a wall of bright white fur surrounded by black spots and yellow fur. You look up and see that you had bumped into the cleavage of a giant anthro woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for what kind, the facial structured looked canine but there were no ears and from the shape of the anthro girl's head and body, she was a gigantic spotted seal that looked as big as the hippo. You look past and see the seal girl has long whiskers and long black hair and was wearing a white and black spotted bikini. The seal girl looks down at you and gasps. You shiver in place and then she gives a smile of pure joy. \"I told them, they exist.\" She says to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUh-oh, you didn't like the sound of that. Before you can protest though, the seal girl shoves you into her purse that happened to be on the table nearby. You grunt as the purse closes and then realize that this seal girl must have plans for you. Although you had no idea what they were and it horrified you just thinking about it. Before you can say another word on the matter, you hear humming and realize that the seal girl is coming back. The seal girl lifts the purse and you feel it moving as she waddles away. You look around inside her purse to see what looks like a tube of lipstick, a large iPhone, several pieces of candy and what looked like a textbook of some kind. The book read \"The Myth of Humankind\". That was a really ominous sounding title.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder aloud what the seal girl is going to do with you but then the purse opens up and she takes out the phone, much to your surprise. You hear her pressing the buttons and you start to wonder what she intends to do with you. One hour later, you feel the seal woman putting the purse with you inside on a table of some kind and then you hear what sounded like a microphone. \"What next?\" you ask yourself. Then the purse opens up and you look out. It would seem that you were in an auditorium of some kind and the seal girl was in the center stage. \"What's going on out there?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you look up and see that the audience was filled with anthros of various species. There were four rows of six anthros, making a total of twenty-four anthros in the entire building. In the front row there was a blue pheasant woman with long curly aqua colored hair who was dressed in a dark blue sari of some kind. Next to her was a golden furred gorilla woman, heavy in appearance with blonde hair wearing a white A-shirt and pants with some kind of cape and next to the gorilla woman was an aggressive looking red furred German shepherd woman with spiky hair in a gangster style outfit with flower tattoos who was smoking a cigar. Next to the German shepherd woman was an obese purple furred tigress in a Chinese style dress with an eyepatch and she was sitting next to a green skinned cow woman with a hunched back, an enormous udder and graying brown hair. The cow woman was wearing a cyberpunk style bikini and right next to her was a peach furred jackalope girl dressed similar to a magician, complete with a top hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first anthro in the second row was a fat brown skinned pig girl in a white cowgirl's outfit who looked half-asleep. She was sitting between a white dove girl in an Arabian style outfit that resembled that of a belly dancer as well as a black furred and purple haired pear-shaped unicorn girl in a purple cocktail dress. Next to the unicorn girl was a golden orange skinned and muscular armadillo girl who was dressed like a matador and to the side of the armadillo was a fat Siamese cat girl in an orange jumpsuit that was showing off a good deal of her cleavage. The last girl in the second row was a crane woman in a purple kimono who resembled a geisha of some kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you looked at the fourth row. There was a bright pink and pear-shaped flamingo girl in an aviator's outfit who was sitting next to an albino and reddish purple haired hourglass shaped gecko girl. There was a green hammerhead shark woman dressed similar to a pirate with a pierced nose and she appeared to be arguing with a blue platypus woman in a crimson fedora. This argument was greatly annoyed a scarlet furred mandrill woman who appeared to be wearing a spotted coat. Next to the mandrill woman was a hawk woman dressed like a Native American female shaman, complete with feathers in her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally were the six in the fourth row. There was a bright golden scaled boa constrictor woman with gold earrings and a purple dress who was next to a copper skinned crocodile woman dressed like a biker girl, complete with sunglasses. Next to her was a polar bear woman in a lab coat with bizarre looking goggles and light pink hair. There was also a cyan blue humpback whale woman in a sailor schoolgirl's outfit who was snoozing right next to a orange furred nine-tailed fox woman in a samurai kimono with a blue kanji tattoo over her right eye. Finally there was a silver skinned hippo woman with long black hair, a red jacket and blue jeans who looked like she was wondering what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, everybody,\" says the seal woman. \"I know this is short notice, but I've made a shocking discovery.\" \"We'll be the judges of that,\" says the silver skin hippo girl. \"You said in your text that you found a way to put a myth to rest once and for all.\" \"That's correct,\" says the seal woman. \"The myth that human beings once walked on this planet.\" You were more terrified than ever at that comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pig woman in the second row let out a snort. \"Give us a break, Ms. Waterloo,\" she says. \"Everyone knows there are no such things as humans.\" \"I agree,\" says the bear woman. \"I teach at the university and I have never seen any proof that there are humans on the planet.\" \"What about that newspaper article about that wolf girl discovering human fossils?\" asks the gorilla woman. \"Don't tell me you believe that?\" asks the German shepherd girl as she puts out her cigar. \"That's a hoax, obviously.\" \"But what if it isn't?\" asks the flamingo girl with a grin. \"Anything is possible. After all, what do we really know about the human race?\" \"Even if that isn't a hoax,\" says the cow woman. \"Humans could be extinct by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aha,\" says the seal woman, Ms. Waterloo. \"That's where you're wrong. For at the community pool just today, I found a human. Live.\" The seal woman reaches into the purse and you grunt as she grabs you and holds you up in front of the audience. Every last anthro in the audience looks in shock at you and you're now terrified at what your fate might be.</span></div></div>",

You struggle in her hair to try and get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe good news is that you do, but the bad news is that you begin to slip down the hippo woman's wet back. You try frantically to come up but you slip and it looks like you'd fall hundreds of feet to the ground. You have to grab the hippo woman's small tail before bumping into one of her titanic butt cheeks. Your bumping into her rear causes the hippopotamus woman to stop in her tracks. \"What was that?\" she asks. \"Did a bug bump into my butt.\" The hippo woman reaches down and squeezes her cheeks a few times as you climb towards her hand and then grab hold of her thumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo woman pulls her hand back and then sees you standing on her thumb nail before she looks in utter shock at a little man right on her fingertip. \"Hello ma'am.\" You say.</span></div></div>",

Surprisingly the hippo woman just smiles to you and lets out a giggle. \"Aw,\" she says. \"What a little cutie. What were you doing in the pool little guy?\" She has a surprisingly seductive voice you would've never imagined from a creature as big and fat as a hippopotamus. She even begins to stroke you with one of her oversized fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh,\" you say. \"I don't know how exactly. I didn't expect to see such a big hippopotamus lady like you.\" The hippo woman giggles and makes her belly and breasts shake. \"You're such a little charmer. I do my best. I'm actually the widest anthro here in town. Won the Big and Beautiful Pageant three years in a row. So tell me, are you a wild human or do you belong to somebody.\" \"What?!\" \"Ooh,\" says the hippo girl. \"I'll take that as a wild. You see little guy, around here humans are pets. I think you just became mine. Well, I better be heading home to buy a cage for you. I've spent enough time in the water anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can say another word, this hippopotamus woman takes a towel and begins to wipe herself dry. The towel looks like dental floss on her big behind. Then she shoves you in between her breasts and you grunt. The hippo giantess then puts on a jacket and grabs her purse before she starts to leave the pool. As she walks away, her breasts jiggle and you are squeezed out of the gap before you are bounced up and down like a trampoline. It's actually kinda fun. The hippo woman laughs as your bouncing tickles her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're rather playful aren't you little guy,\" she says. \"Oh, I'm Heather, but you can call me Mistress. I think I'll call you Spunky since you like bouncing so much on my big body.\" You cross your arms before Heather holds her breasts together and you bounce back into the gap of her cleavage. She shoves you further down with her thumb. Heather was very beautiful for a hippo, but you couldn't believe you were now her pet. You figure maybe changing the subject might be in order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Mistress Heather, mind if I ask you a question?\" \"Go away Spunky,\" says the hippo giantess as she shakes her body. \"What does Mommy's little Spunky want to ask the big beautiful hippo.\" \"Well, you say, do you have a boyfriend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is Heather's answer?</span></div></div>",

Mistress. It's surprising that you're still single, a big beautiful hippo like you. Lemon skin as bright as the sun. Long dirty hair and that's not even getting into your body.\" Heather blushes slightly and wiggles her breasts as you grip onto her flesh even tighter. \"Go ahead little spunky,\" your new mistress says. \"Tell Mommy more about Mommy's beauty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ignore that Mommy remark. She was only saying that since you were now her pet, but if you can play your cars right Heather might just make you her boyfriend. \"Well, where to start? Your breasts are perfectly round moons and your butt could be a planet. Eek?\" You cover your mouth with one hand but Heather seems to be more interested. You guess being called fat was a compliment for a pachydermic anthro. \"You're just saying that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's the biggest butt I've ever seen. I'd almost say your bikini bottom was painted on. You're a living galaxy babe. A man could enjoy a body like yours.

The world shifts and tumbles around you as the gigantic hippo-woman gets into her car and sits down. Sitting between her cleavage wasn't bad at all--considering she was now your girlfriend, it was kinda appropriate; really--but apparently it wasn't always the most stable of seats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake off the dizziness as Heather starts the engine and begins backing the car out of its parking spot, looking back over her shoulder to watch for other drivers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Heather...what now?\" You ask, trying to strike up a conversation. Despite your lingering confusion of ending up in this crazy place, you feel safe enough to chit-chat for now. Besides, she's your new girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather puts the car in drive and makes a smooth turn out of the parking lot before she replies, \"Curious one, aren't you, Spunky? Well, I'm headed to a little diner downtown to eat lunch with the girls. I was gonna drop you off at my house first...but that was before you went from pet to boyfriend, little guy.\" She looks away from the road for a second, just long enough to wink down at you. \"So, consider this our first lunch date, if that's your thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink in wonder. A date? Yeah, it was causal, and you were more or less tagging along with Heather, but...it was a date! And all because you'd called her hippo-rump big, and she'd taken it as a compliment! Talking like that to a human girl would have gotten you punched in the face! (Not that you ever WOULD have done that, of course, but the principle was the same). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe this crazy world you'd found yourself in wasn't so bad after all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a short drive to the restaraunt--just a little sandwich bistro, with mostly outdoor seating. (Not surprising, since Heather was sill in her bikini). \"Here we are, Spunky; Garden Cafe Bistro! Now, where are the rest of the girls...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spot a small group of female anthros sitting around one of the tables, and one of them calls out to Heather. Those must have been her firends, you guessed.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You look out from Heather's cleavage in pure horror because there were five anthros at the table waiting for her and they had several things in common. 1), They were all heavyset like your new giant hippo girlfriend was. 2) They were just as monstrously big as her, to the point where skyscrapers would be footstools to them and 3) They were all <i>carnivorous</i> anthros! Heather was the only herbivore in a crowd of predatory creatures. That fact alone made you uneasy and you hide in Heather's cleavage as you look out at all five of Heather's distinct yet similarly predatory friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst of them was a giant and obese pterodactyl woman with long blue hair and tattoos of jewels on her shoulders and thighs. She was wearing a tight white shir with a pair of monstrous E-cup breasts (in scale) as well as a black skirt. She was also wearing a heavy amount of eyeliner and lipstick as she rubbed her upper right breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond of them was an enormous vulture woman with dark gray skin and black feathers with a ring of white feathers around her neck. She had long gray hair worn in pigtails with a jagged looking beak. She was wearing a purple spotted shirt that was tied in the front on her enormous breasts and belly along with a pair of tight blue jeans that exposed her underwear. She was also wearing a white cowgirl's hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third of Heather's friends was a giant red furred lioness who had slight scars on her face and a huge stomach that was almost as big as Heather's as well as a strawberry blonde main. She was dressed in fishnet stalkings and a black leather biker chick's outfit complete with a biker cap and also appeared to have a patch over one of her eyes that had a skull on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFourth of your new hippo girlfriend's friends was a giant and obese blue skinned crocodile woman resembling a Nile crocodile. The crocodile woman appeared to have rainbow colored hair and musical tattoos of various colors over her body. For clothing, she wore jeans that looked like they were coming apart at the seams and a red tank top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly was one anthro woman who looked different than the others as well as any animal you've ever seen. She resembled a hot pink furred baboon with magenta skin but had a purple colored snake for a tail that was wrapped around her shoulder and the arms and legs of a lavender furred tiger but with hands for feet like an primate. Finally, she was wearing a white kimono. She was obviously a nue, a mythical animal from Japan. You didn't know much about nues' diets but she was most likely a carnivore given that she was 1/3 baboon 1/3 tiger and 1/3 snake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're so scared of these giant and heavy anthro girls that you tuck down deep in Heather's cleavage before any of them could see you. \"Hi there Heather,\" says the nue girl as Heather squeezes her large body into the booth. \"Hasn't seen much of you lately.\" \"Well at least you have an excuse for now seeing her,\" said the lioness. \"You've been doing job interviews that haven't seemed to have been going well, Keiko.\" Heather lets out a laugh. \"Vicky,\" says the nue woman obviously annoyed. \"I told you, I was between jobs. You're such a blabbermouth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lioness gives a smug grin as the pterodactyl woman next to her rubs her own stomach. \"Things have been busy for all of us, darling,\" she says in a slight British accent. \"I'm currently having a creator's block.\" \"That's what you get for having such a demanding job in the fashion industry, Theresa,\" says the crocodile woman. \"DJ Coco never has trouble figuring out her work. Ow.\" The vulture woman just let out a sigh. \"We haven't seen Heather in weeks and you blockheads immediately start having a quarrel. It's appalling.\" She says in a Texan accent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Luanne,\" says Heather. \"I'm used to them by now.\" \"Wow,\" says Keiko as she strokes her snake tail. \"You're in a good mood hippo lady.\" The nue lets out a baboonish shriek of excitement. \"What did you do?\" asks Coco. \"Win the lottery.\" \"Actually,\" says Heather. \"I finally found Mr. Right.\" Vicky looks in surprise. \"You're the first of us to find a mate? I'll believe it when I see it.\" The lioness says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well when can we meet him?\" asks Luanne, the vulture woman. \"Where is he?\" You let out a gag. \"Right here.\" Says Heather as she reaches into her cleavage. All of Heather's friends are confused as your hippo girlfriend routes around. You try to dodge Heather's hand as to avoid being in the view of these carnivorous titans but your girlfriend grabs you and with a grunt you're pulled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of Heather's friends look at you in surprise before their faces turn to looks of...</span></div></div>",

That\u2019s so adorable!\u201d Keiko cried as a blush rose your face. \u201cWhat\u2019s his name, he looks so cuuuuute~\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to speak up for yourself and tell the girls your real name, but your new Hippo girlfriend cut you to it. \u201cHis name is Spunky.\u201d Heather nodded, stroking your miniscule form with her fat thumb absentmindedly. You let out a sigh of annoyance, but maybe them not knowing your real name is for the best. You had no idea whether or not there was a way out of this...place, or even if you wanted to leave. \u2018Spunky\u2019 would have to be your new identity here. \u201cHe\u2019s a rather courageous one. I found him snuggling up to my big ol\u2019 butt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, with a butt that big I\u2019m surprised you don\u2019t find one in there every day.\u201d Luanne faux mocked, eliciting a cutesy giggle from Heather. \u201cSometimes I get jealous that your the one with the biggest \u2018assets\u2019 in our little clique.\u201d The Texas Vulture looked down at her own bosom and wobbled it slightly. They were big, you could not deny, but Heather\u2019s rack did outsize her by an obvious margin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Luanne.\u201d Heather pushed you down back in between the valley of her cleavage, knowing sagely that the conversation was about to go into the girly territory that men of all species don\u2019t really prefer. Honestly, you would have preferred to stay involved in the conversation, but you could hear everything fine despite the layers of boob blubber clogging your ears. \u201cNo offense, but it\u2019s not hard to see why you can\u2019t get that extra \u2018oomph\u2019 you're looking for. None of us are gonna pack on the pounds at \u2018the Garden Cafe Bistro\u2019.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Coco barked up, eager to defend her friend. \u201cDon\u2019t be like that! We chose this fru-fru vegetarian joint because of you, miss \u2018I can\u2019t eat meat\u2019!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow who told you that I can\u2019t eat meat?\u201d Heather smirked, rubbing her massive, golden gut affectionately as it grumbled. \u201cIt takes longer to digest and doesn't always sit well, but I can hold down a hamburger like all you ladies. No, an all you can eat buffet is more my style, and if you want humans jumping into your ass like me, it should be yours too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...well shit, Heather!\u201d Theresa laughed out loud, leaning her head into an open palm. \u201cI went through such a pain to reserve a lunch table here because of your \u2018tastes\u2019, and now I\u2019m hearing that you hate as much as we do?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you all hate it here so much,\u201d you suddenly work your way back into the conversation, wiggling out of Heather\u2019s boobs enough for at least your head to pop out. \u201cThan what\u2019s the point of staying and make yourselves miserable when you can go someplace better?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, the five anthros were silent, kinda surprised. That is until Vicky suddenly piped up. \u201cYou know...I do know this buffet restaurant not too far from here. Good food, friendly staff\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you mean the Smorgasbord?\u201d Heather\u2019s eyes lit up like a kid on Christmas. \u201cI know that place, I go so often I have a regular discount. I bet I could call in a favor and extend it to all of us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheresa sighed in relent. \u201cWell, that\u2019s 200 dollars worth of reservation money down the drain. What the hell, this place is too stuck up for me. Let\u2019s get out of here!\u201d The lioness stood up, and soon Heather and the others followed her. The Smorgasbord was apparently just a few blocks away, so they all decided to just leg it. You could only imagine the comical sight of five, obese anthros walking down the street, chatting it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was some real quick thinking they're, my wittle Spunky.\u201d Heather patted the boob flesh around you, making you whole body quiver in tandem. \u201cThe five of us would have convinced ourselves to sit through plates of salad if it wasn\u2019t for you. I hope your ready for this big body to get even bigger, though.\u201d You blush at the thought of an even fatter hippo girlfriend. It\u2019s weird, before all of this, you had thought that fat was kinda off putting, but now\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...now all you could want was more women for you to love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, you, Heather, and the other four anthros made it to the all you can eat buffet. The Smorgasbord changed the theme of it\u2019s food each day. Today, they were serving...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maybe it was lingering fear due to her colossal size, and (normal) hippos' aggressive natures you remembered. Maybe it was shock from almost drowning, AND falling to your death, just seconds earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe it was that devilish smirk she was cracking that was putting you on edge? And the fact that she was licking her lips. <br>\r\nYeah, that was probably it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well; not quite a bug, but close. So, were you lookin' for trouble, tiny, or are you just really damn unlucky?\" The hippo titaness purrs, her hot breath blowing over you with each word. As terrifying as this whole ordeal had become, some part of your brain still thought her voice sounded...nice. Seductive, even. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, mortal fear overpowered arousal. \"T-Trouble? I-I-I wasn't l-l-looking for t-t-trouble, ma'am,\" you stammer. Despite the warm weather, you're shaking like a leaf--she's still wearing that smirk, and licking her lips...and her mouth looks big enough to swallow a tank. It doesn't take a genius to figure out the implications.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo woman sorts a laugh, the gust knocking you on your rear. \"Well too bad, shrimp; ya found it. Most other girls go gaga over you humans...but not me, not since I was a kid. Always thought you tinies were just ugly and useless.\" Every word drips contempt, and despite the mortal danger you're in, you feel offended.

Yelping in pain, you cringe away from her and whimper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you don't know your place, either.\" She snips, giving a little <i>tsk-tsk</i> of disappointment. The world seems to tilt and shift as your captor walks away from the pool, to one of the lunch tables set up on the concrete around the pool. She drops you onto the table and towers over you--smirking more evilly than before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, you get the courage to speak. \"M-my place? What do you--\" Before you can finish, the sadistic pachyderm-woman slaps her prodigious stomach, making waves on her massive girth. Once again, the implications are clear as day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In there, of course! I've gotta keep this figure somehow; how else am I gonna keep winning the Big and Beautiful Pageant every year?\" she snaps, as if that were the most obvious question in the world. Suddenly, she tilts her head, as if an idea just came to her. \"Oh, and since you tried to cop a feel on my rear earlier, your place could also be under it!\" She taunts, pulling up a nearby chair. She gives her hips a wiggle, before snatching you off the table, holding you between her fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, what to do with you? Snack, or seat cushion? Hmm...you're a bit on the skinny side, so you won't make me much bigger; then again skinny humans taste better. But it's been a while since I've sat on a human, and with this bikini it should feel <i>reeaaaal</i> nice...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe keeps musing and mumbling, as if she was choosing groceries, and not about to gruesomely harm you. <br>\r\nYou can't believe it. You get whisked away to some freaky alternate dimension, and within minutes a gargantuan hippo-woman was going to either eat you alive, or flatten you under her meteor-sized rump, all because she happened to not like humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this moment, you REALLY wished she hadn't noticed you.</span></div></div>",

For clothing, she was wearing nothing but a dark purple bikini with nightshade flower designs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see her coming and though you're mesmerized by her beauty, you remember that this woman was still a crocodile and therefore a predator, so you swim like heck as she swims forward towards you, blissfully unaware of the tiny human in the swimming pool. She even flips over and does the backstroke, shooting drops of water the size of meteors at you. You yell as one drop makes a splash on you and pushes you to the side of the pool. You hit the ceramic wall and groan and feel your head. You hear humming and realize that it's the crocodile girl who is humming and gasp. You try to run, but the crocodile girl swings her tail and unknowingly splashes chlorinated water into your eyes and makes you yell in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you were in a swimming pool the size of a city and you couldn't see a thing. This is bad. This crocodile girl was beautiful and might be friendly, but you highly doubt it, so you just grit your teeth and just keep swimming to hope for the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what happens when you can't see where you're swimming?</span></div></div>",

The tyrannosaurus rex woman lets out a yawn and scratches her side before she walks forward. You crawl deeper into her cleavage before she walks to the snack bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the t-rex buys an ice cream cone you start to wonder where exactly were you? How did you get into this weird world with giant animals, let alone dinosaurs. As you're pondering some strawberry ice cream drops on you inside the rex woman's cleavage. She has quite a sweet tooth. You really hope she likes sweets more than she likes human flesh. The cleavage you're in begins to shake as more ice cream splatters all over you. You slip out of the rex woman's cleavage but you're still stuck to her breast because of the sticky ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you see the t-rex girl....</span></div></div>",

The T-Rex woman perks up, and you peek out from between her boobs to see two more dino-ladies sitting at a poolside table. One was a skinny grey Stegosaurus woman with black splotches in a white one-piece; the other was a plump sandy-orange Triceratops lady in a black bikini. Miss Stegosaurus had a soda bottle, Miss Triceratops was eating a salad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyra--the apparent name of the T-Rex giantess--perked up and stomped over to join them, her ample breasts bouncing around you with each step. It was like being in a rockslide. \"Girls! Good to see you two. Guess we all got a day off work at once.\" She hugs her friends...which squeezes you between more pairs of dino-boobs, knocking the wind out of you. You get another big bounce when Tyra sits down, nearly pinning you UNDER one of her breasts. \"What's been up with you two lately?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finals Week,\" Ms. Triceratops answers, poking at her salad. \"Had to pull <i>three</i> all-nighters for my Economics Final. I think I faint at the sight of money now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Parents are visiting next week,\" says Stegosaurus Lady. \"Mother's a neat-freak, so I've been cleaning my apartment top to bottom. You wouldn't believe how much dust was behind my dresser! I sneezed my brains out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch; sounds rough.\" Tyra tsks in sympathy. \"All I had to deal with was some perv zebra staring at my ass at the grocery store.\" She takes a big bite of ice cream, which Triceratops Lady looks at enviously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wish I could have that without it going straight to my hips...\" she mumbles, licking her beak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all in what you eat, ladies;\" Tyra quips. \"Eat right, and you can splurge without worrying about your figure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Triceratops snorts in annoyance, and Stegosaurus Lady facepalms. \"Not this again...\" the latter grumbles, taking a swig form her soda. Looks like the other dino-ladies have had this quibble before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy for you to say, Miss I-Never-Eat-Carbs,\" Miss Triceratops pouts. \"Seriously, you only eat protein; I don't think I've ever even seen you buy <i>bread.</i> Of course <i>you</i> can binge sweets and barely gain a pound. I sneak one choclate millkshake and my bikini that covers my entire butt is suddenly a thong.\" She shifts in her seat and winces--she must be wearing said bikini right now. \"Stupid thing rides up like crazy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyra giggles at her friend's expense, licking her ice cream. \"Sarah, of course I eat tons of protein. Carnivore, remember?\" she teases her friend, but in a friendly way. \"That goes right to my muscles, unlike a silly salad.\" She glances at her tri-horned friend's meal and smirks. \"I can't help it if it's my nature to have a diet with some wiggle room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe triceratops woman, now named Sarah, smirks. \"Maybe, Tyra. But at least us plant-eaters don't have to worry about biting a spoon in half when we eat soup...or TEN spoons. On a date, in front of a whole restraunt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat quip catches Tyra off guard. She nearly drops her ice cream cone and doubles over laughing--bringing her chest to the table and slamming her breasts together, squishing your tiny form between them. It's painful, and the melted ice cream makes you stick to her left breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pffthahaha...dammit, Sarah you skank; will you <i>ever</i> let me live that down? I was picking metal from my fangs for hours!\" Despite the insult, Tyra couldn't stop laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou manage to peek over Tyra's bikini top and see Sarah put on a smug look. \"I can't help it if it's your nature to have killer teeth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three woman laugh at that, Tyra most of all. Despite the pain and danger you were in, you chuckle as well. Sarah had dropped a damn good zinger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the good humor, you had new reason to worry. Tyra's comment about carnivores confirmed this T-Rex giantess <i>was</i> a meat-eater. But <i>what</i> did she eat? She was friends with two herbivores, so it couldn't be other anthros. Maybe fish or something? (You shunted any thoughts that humans were considered edible here aside--or tried to, anyway. It did make a horrible kind of sense, considering how small you were compared to these titans...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least you're tied now,\" Stegosaurus Lady mumlbes, typing something on her phone. <br>\r\nShe was keeping score? Just how many times <i>had</i>Tyra and Sarah had that diet debate?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Ingrid;\" Tyra and Sarah chorus sheepishly, providing the third dino's name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio chat for some time, going on about new movies, town gossip and their jobs. It's sort of fun to eavesdrop, but knowing nothing about this strange world of giants leaves you with no context for much of it. You're starting to zone out, idly struggling to unstick yourself from Tyra's boob, when you manage to free yourself...<i>and fall face-first onto her RIGHT breast, accidentally <b>biting it</b>.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyra yelps, dropping her ice cream and flinching--pancaking you between her breasts once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the--Tyra; you okay galpal? Sarah asks, concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, what's wrong?\" Ingrid asks, leaning in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyra takes a breath to steady herself. \"Something, uh; in my boobs...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You were confused as first but then you remembered that She's a Dinosaur so it's natural to have tougher skin, so instead of your idea of crawling out you realised you were stuck completely until she either discovered you, took off her bikini, or by God's grace a miracle happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 10 minutes later you realise Tyra has fallen asleep sunbathing. You can do nothing but wait sadly the only good thing about being between the masses of flesh is that you have Shade.

You shake off her nose slime and then she finally notices you and her eye pops. \"Oh,\" she says. \"It was a human.\" Wait, she knew what you were.

You hold on tight to her tail and scream because the mastodon girl is getting up and walking away as she puts her cellphone away. The mastodon girl shakes her head and trumpets as she starts to walk away from the park. \"She just never listens to me. I don't know why I waste my breath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mastodon girl's footsteps cause tremors as you struggle to hold on to her tail. As you're shaking, you look down and see that you must be 500 ft in the air. That meant that the mastodon girl was way bigger than that since you were only up to her butt. It doesn't help that she keeps wagging her tail. Your hands were slipping and it looked like you would fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then you look down and see that the mastodon woman had a back pocket in her jeans. As the tail wags, you take a leap and land right in the pocket. You peak your head out and see that the mastodon still doesn't know you're there. You breath a sigh of relief. Who knows how an enormous pachyderm would do if she saw a tiny man touching her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as you look out, you see that this entire city was anything but normal. There were giant anthros everywhere, but unlike the mastodon girl, they were dinosaurs and similar creatures. There was a sarcosuchus girl getting her hair done by a tyrannosaurus girl and an allosaurus girl delivering a pizza. You're guessing the mastodon isn't originally from this city.

She also had pale pink fur and long teal hair that was worn in a combination of a ponytail and a beehive and reached down to the ground past even her own tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step back and see that the mare was somewhat fat with wide hips and a large belly that touched her knees. She appeared to be wearing a blue and white striped shirt and a pair of skin-tight jeans as well as a pair of gold earrings. The mare was also reading a book of some sort but it was too high up for you to read it. It was obviously hardcover and was a large novel. You step back and then you see that you appear to be in a park of some kind. There were giant anthros everywhere that ranged from 500ft to even past the 1000ft mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rub your eyes and see a shadow over you and then look into the sky to see a female anthropomorphic crane with an amazing hourglass figure who was flying overhead. Then you step back as you watch a giant purple and white cobra anthro slither by. You couldn\u2019t tell the gender of the snake because you were too scared of a giant carnivorous reptile following after you to get a good look of the snake or let the snake see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look out and see that there are even more anthros going around the park, at least twenty of them and they all came in various species. They were different canines, felines, equines, bovids, birds, reptiles, amphibians and even some anthros of a phoenix and a dragon. You were boggled. This was a brand new world dominated by anthropomorphic animals the size of skyscrapers. You were now afraid. After all, what would they think about seeing a tiny human?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could think anymore in the matter there is a gust of wind and the ginormous mare on the enormous bench behind you grunts and accidentally drops her book. The large book lands at your side and you scream as you\u2019re nearly flattened. The giant horse girl bends over, lifting her humongous rear into the air as she picks up her book. But then she spots you and looks in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to run but the enormous mare lifts you up by the shirt and you grunt as she lifts you into the air and sits back up. \u201cA human?\u201d she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re now very afraid.

It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve seen one. You don\u2019t see two many of them in this area. Aren\u2019t you the cutest thing.\u201d You then blink. She didn\u2019t appear to be hostile and was even grinning at you. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard of humans?\u201d you ask. \u201cThere are humans in this world.\u201d The horse giantess then smiles and nods her head. \u201cThat\u2019s right. And I just love humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a sigh of relief. You guess that the anthros in this dimension weren\u2019t as hostile or destructive as you thought. This giant, fat, pink, mare, in fact, seemed very inviting. However, that\u2019s when you see her staring down at you and hear her giggling. You\u2019re at first confused but then you decide that it\u2019s probably nothing more than harmless schoolgirl-style laughter and that the horse giantess was only giddy that she found a cute little human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then your eyes pop because the horse giantess giggles again and then licks her lips. \u201cOh,\u201d she says. \u201cI do love humans. Where I come from, you\u2019re quite the delicacy.\u201d You\u2019re now very afraid and the horse girl stares at you hungrily as her tongue moves around. \u201cAnd you appeared at the exact right time,\u201d says the giantess horse. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely starving. I\u2019m so hungry, I can\u2019t control myself.\u201d Then the mare pokes you with one of her fingernails and makes you scream aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the mare licks you slightly and makes you shiver as she coats her in your drool and then lifts you higher in the air. \u201cAnd you,\u201d she says. \u201cMy little human. You are so tiny, so adorable and so scrumptious looking\u2026 YOU COULD BE EATEN BY A HORSE!\u201d The horse giantess laughs at her own joke and slaps her obese stomach before lifting you higher and higher up as you scream. You try slipping out of her shirt to escape but she reflexively grabs you by the leg. You look down in pure horror to see the enormous mare\u2019s mouth wide open with her large hill sized teeth and her large serpent-like red tongue moving about. Behind it was the big black hole that lead to her throat and stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBottoms up, little human.\u201d Says the mare. You let out a scream as the mare drops you and you land in her mouth just as it snaps shut. You try climbing up her tongue but she shakes it around moaning in joy as she enjoys your flavor and listens to you scream as you\u2019re knocked around. You try to maintain your grip on the tip of the horse woman\u2019s tongue but you slip and slide towards her throat. \u201cNo! No! No! Oh no! Oh no!\u201d you yell as you fall into the black hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the pink horse gulps loudly and from the outside you\u2019re nothing more than a tiny bulge moving down her throat and screaming a muffled scream until you land with a big splash in her stomach juices and are submerged. You cringe and wait to be dissolved but for some reason the acids have no effect on you and you swim up to take a deep breathe. Suddenly the entire stomach is rocked about by a loud belch and you\u2019re bludgeoned by waves of slime as you\u2019re forced to plug your ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the horse smiles to herself and taps her bloated tummy, further threatening to damage your hearing. \u201cYou were a delicious little snack,\u201d says the horse as she picks up her book. \u201cNow, I\u2019m going to finish reading my novel, so you be a good little human and melt down to make my waistline bigger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously the mare doesn\u2019t realize her acids somehow have no effect on you. You have to get out of this horse belly somehow, but what are you going to do?</span></div></div>",

I can't wait to see all of the crazy things you people will write! ;) Feel free to contact my on-site email or leave me a message if you have any questions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnjoy!!! :D<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>As of today (3-24-13), gift points are back!</b> I haven't decided on a set amount to reward, so the number of gift points you earn will depend on the quality of the chapter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'd like to give a huge thanks to everyone who's added so far (2 Winged Dragon, ????, Runic, wolffury, redhurricane...) and to all of you for reading! Let's help it grow even more! The kitty wants you to...<br>\r\n /\\__/\\<br>\r\n(='o'=)<br>\r\n(\")_(\")<br>\r\n(\")_(\")   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>This interactive has gotten over 1,000 views!</b> Another huge thanks to everyone, you are all the reason it's made it this far! Maybe soon we'll have OVER 9,000 views, huh? Okay, I apologize for making that joke. But not really...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, don't be shy, leave a post if you enjoyed, want to give constructive criticism, or just want to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy reading/writing!! ^U^</td>",
