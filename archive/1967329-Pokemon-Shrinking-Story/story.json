            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ethan and Kris had met in Professor Elm\u2019s lab. They shared a short, introductory conversation as the two  waited for the Professor to bring out their starters. Though, once Kris got her hasty pick of a Totodile, she ran off with a chipper, \u201cBye!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn contrast, Ethan took his time as he chose his Chikorita. He also stayed behind to pack and say goodby to his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Ethan's rush to the next step in his journey slowed as he found a relatively rare addition to his team. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan gritted his teeth staring down a Muk. It was an anomaly for this region of Johto, so it was a prize Ethan would be more than happy to catch. \"Chikorita! Use tackle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pokemon complied, slamming directly into the Muk, lodging itself into its viscous body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh jeez,\" Ethan hummed, running over to the Muk. He grabbed at his starter's leg, attempting to free the Chikorita. It didn't budge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ethan!\" Kris called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled, Ethan stumbled and fell into the Muk. The gelatinous grime surrounded him, and he let out a surprised scream as he struggled for freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the Muk used Minimize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a matter of seconds, the Muk's form began to dwindle down until it was an inch tall blob, releasing Ethan and the Chikorita from its grasp. The tiny pokemon then began to run away, leaving Ethan lying on the ground sputtering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I think I got some of it in my mouth,\" Ethan whined as he spat on the ground. Groaning, he called back his pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Kris hummed, tugging on a few loose strands of blue hair. \"Sorry.\" She made her way over to her new aquaintance and helped him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine,\" he said, dusting off his shorts. \"It probably would have ran away with my Chikorita if you hadn't come along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Kris chuckled. \"So I guess you're heading for Violet City, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan nodded. \"I'm gonna try and take down the gym later today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKris whistled. \"That's pretty ambitious. Plus, the gym'll probably close by the time we get to Violet City.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKris nodded. \"Well, I figured we could be road buddies. Y'know, traveling together, training our pokemon, taking down gyms...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like fun,\" Ethan said, stuffing his hands in his pockets. \"Wouldn't hurt to have a road buddy for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Kris pumped her fist. She grabbed Ethan by the hand and ran down the route. \"C'mon! The Violet City Poke-Center has really good food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two shared a booth in the back corner of the Violet City Center. Kris carefully picked at her salad, chewing on a crouton, idly watching other trainers around the cafeteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really spent the entire day chasing down a Phanpy?\u201d Ethan asked, digging into his sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKris nodded. \u201cDuh. I had to.\u201d She hugged the elephant-like pokemon, and it squeaked. \u201cIt\u2019s so cute!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan chuckled. \u201cI don\u2019t really know how well it\u2019ll do against Falkner and his flying types.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Kris said, still squeezing her Phanpy.  \u201cAlthough, it would be best if I turn in for the night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner, the two went into their respective rooms. For a small fee, the Pokemon Centers offered registered Trainers dorms for one night only. Though, it was barebones with pretty much just a cot and a dresser.  Regardless, the two trainers appreciated having a place to stay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan woke up surrounded by his sheets. He scrambled upwards and fought his way past the blankets and towards the light Upon escaping, he realized that something was off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter two seconds of staring off the cliff that used to be the bed he slept on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had shrunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan felt his breath shorten as he stumbled backwards. \u201cWhat the\u2026\u201d He rubbed his eyes before scanning the room again. Nothing. He was still hopelessly small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the tiny bedside drawer next to him was his bag he brought with him for his journey. He ran over to the edge of the cot. The bag\u2019s strap hung off the edge, just high enough for him to climb up. He scaled the bag, pried open one of the zippers. A Pokeball rolled out and on the floor, releasing his trusty starter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChikori!\u201d the pokemon screeched up at its master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChikorita!\u201d Ethan called, sliding down the bag\u2019s straps and back onto the bed. \u201cGo get help!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChiki!!\u201d Without another word, the pokemon bolted out the door.</span></div></div>",

She pulled the blanket over herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChikori!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting up, Kris looked over and saw a Chikorita standing at the side of her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Kris hummed. \u201cYou\u2019re Ethan\u2019s pokemon, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chikorita jumped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should probably go back to him,\u201d she said, hugging her pillow. \u201cHe\u2019s probably worried about you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChiki!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm?\u201d She ran her hand through her hair. \u201cIs something up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChi!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKris sighed and swung her feet off the edges of the bed. \u201cOkay then. Let\u2019s see what\u2019s got you riled up.\u201d She dropped her feet into a pair of fuzzy slippers. Stretching out her arms, she followed he pokemon down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEthan\u2019s room?\u201d Kris asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know.

He tried his best to scramble back on his feet but failed to cover any ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt as if the entire weight of the world fell on Ethan. He struggled under the firm cheek, blushing furiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKris sat down on the side of the cot. She let out a sigh and looked down at the bouncing Chikorita. \"He's not here.\" She played with her slippers. \"He's probably getting breakfast or in the bathroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chikorita didn't take that as an answer. Instead, it hopped on the bed and began nudging Kris' hip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Kris asked, a bit annoyed at the pokemon's shoving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chiki!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKris rolled her eyes but otherwise stood up. She looked down at the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen her stomach dropped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying in the center of a slight depression was a tiny figure. It twitched and writhed, and the pit in Kris' stomach only expanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ethan... is that you?\" Kris knelt down to get a closer look. Sure enough, it was the same boy she had met just yesterday. And now, nearly twenty-four hours later, she almost smothered him to death. Carefully, she cupped the shrunken boy in her hands. \"Please be alive. Please be alive. Please-be-alive. Pleasebealive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny figure coughed. \"K...Kris?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a massive sigh before wiping her forehead. \"Oh, thank goodness. You're okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More or less,\" Ethan wheezed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding back up, Kris made sure that her tiny friend was fine before lifting him closer to her face. \"Ethan... I'm so sorry. I almost...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine,\" Ethan said, waving an arm dismissively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" Ethan sat up, his breathing still weak. \"Maybe we can get to Professor Elm.

But on their travels they came across a rogue group of former Team Rocket members, completely by accident,  who had decided to restart the failed organization under new management. Since then they had almost single handedly taken down the struggling evil team once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the three heroes had discovered a plot by the newly formed Team Rocket to take over the Goldenrod City Radio Tower to signal a cry for help from their mysterious former leader, who had disappeared years ago when the original team disbanded. All radio communications had ceased and been replaced by this pleading call. So Kris, Kotone, and Hibiki teamed up to take down to rescue everyone in the Radio Tower, fix the communications, and take down the last remnants of Team Rocket once and for all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So far, so good.\" Kris thought. The young, blue-haired woman had split up from Kotone and Hibiki to explore the higher levels of the Radio Tower herself. Thanks to a keycard she'd found, getting there was a piece of cake. So far her Pokemon were doing well, thanks in great part to her experienced training of them and her expert use and stock of items she always kept handy. She just hoped that Kotone and Hibiki were alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was only one room left that Kris hadn't already explored, and she was sure that the Team Rocket Executives were there, waiting for her. Kris braced herself and stepped through the door to the final room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she expected Archer, the defacto 'leader' of the new Team Rocket was inside, doing something with the radio tower controls. Kris wasn't sure what the blue-haired man was up to here by himself, but she sure wasn't going to let him get away with taking the tower and everyone inside captive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Stop right there!\" Kris shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stormed into the room with a strong confidence, but before she could even get close to the madman, she felt herself get grabbed from behind. She narrowly had time to gasp before a hand covered her mouth. Instinctively, she struggled to free herself from whoever had her in a hold, but couldn't. She did however get a glimpse of the long, red hair of her captor and knew immediately that it was Ariana, another of the Team Rocket executives, and one that Kris had beaten before with the help of her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you...\" Ariana began, turning the girl in her grip around so she could see her. \"Remember me from Mahogany Town? Hee hee, looks like this time you're all alone...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriana's creepily playful tone made Kris start to worry. She knew the Rocket higher ups were crazy, but she'd never been caught so helplessly by one before now, and she worried what they might do to her. If only she could use her Pokemon, she thought. But Ariana was holding her in such a way that throwing any of her Pokeballs was impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold it.\" Archer said in a commanding tone. Kris felt Ariana loosen up on her just a little. Archer then walked closer to the girls. \"This is the one you told me about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir. She's the little brat who beat, er, prevented us from carrying out your orders before.\" Ariana said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArcher held out his hand in front of Kris's face, making the young woman sweat. He then lightly brushed her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...? You managed to get this far?\" Archer said, he sounded amused by the girl's bravado and current state. But then, he looked worried all of a sudden, and Kris couldn't help but wonder why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boss..?\" Ariana asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer to their questions came when into the room in a flash, it was Kotone, quite literally jumping onto the scene and tackling Ariana to the floor, causing the redhead woman to let go of Kris. Kris and Kotone recovered quickly and were on their feet in seconds, facing opposite of the stunned Team Rocket executives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Kotone!\" Kris said, smiling at her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it!\" Kotone smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was pretty reckless, though.\" Kris commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it worked, didn't it?\" Kotone said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKris grinned, she couldn't deny that, she just wished the Kotone would be more careful in the future. The two girls then got ready to battle the Team Rocket executives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't going as planned.\" Archer said as he returned to his previous composure. He noticed that Ariana was still shocked by turn of events and shook his head. He knew defeat was imminent if he let the girls release their Pokemon soon. He scoffed at the thought of losing to the girls, and went to the radio tower's control panel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ariana, step back!\" Archer shouted, and he flipped some switches and pressed a button. Suddenly, a strong waves of sounds burst into the room, knocking everyone to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oww....\" Kotone cried, and covered her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is he doing!?\" Kris shouted, covering her ears as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That fool! He can't be using that experiment! Not when I'm right here!\" Ariana shouted. She covered a single ear and tried to get away from the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough their ears were aching from the sheer sound of the noise, the girls could still see. They saw as the sound waves seemed to concentrate in the middle of the room and form a pattern the radiated throughout the room directly into the them. The waves of noise seemed to take on a reddish color and the girls could almost feel the sound vibrating through their bodies. As if the pain alone wasn't enough, the new sensation added insult to injury, and Kris could almost swear that the room was getting bigger by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Archer had long since recovered, not being effected by the debilitating waves any longer and stood there watching the scene unfold. He watched in amazed satisfaction as the Rocket engineering team's latest weapon had successfully turned the tables on the girls, shrinking them little by little while they were too caught off guard to do anything about it, much less realize it was happening to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-Kris! I-Is it just me, or is the r-room getting... b-bigger!?\" Kotone cried over the noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKris couldn't even reply if she wanted to, the pain and the shrinking taking its toll on the poor girl. She felt like Kotone was right, everything was getting bigger, or no, it was they who were getting smaller! Kris felt like she should be scared of it happening, and while in the middle of a battle with her biggest enemies, but more then anything she just felt like she was about to pass out from it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, it stopped. The noise, the shrinking, everything. Kris had had enough though, and collapsed on the floor. Kotone ran over to her side and tried to shake her friend awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kris, no!\" Kotone cried. She herself was hurting from the strong soundwaves, but her worry for her friend came first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm okay, Kotone...\" Kris replied, her voice tired sounding. She struggled, but got to her feet on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKris wiped her eyes and looked at the aftermath of the sound wave strike. Kotone and her own fears were confirmed as she stared up in awe at the now massive room around her. She and Kotone had indeed been shrunk by the weird waves after all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No way...\" Kris gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my goodness..!\" Kotone joined Kris in shock. After worrying about nothing but Kris's safety for the whole time, Kotone had hardly enough time to register that they were in the same boat and had both been shrunk by the strange noise attack from before. She covered her mouth and gasped at how huge everything was to her now, and she now felt like she the one who was going to pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-Kotone, no!\" Kris caught her friend before she fell. Kotone recovered quickly and wiped her forehead, as if to relieve the stress of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe it! We've been shrunk, clothes and all!\" Kotone cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you better get used to it fast, because we've still got company!\" Kris warned. She pointed up to the massive figure of...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The giant figure that stood over the girls was none other than their beloved friend, Hibiki(Gold)! The dark-haired, jacket-wearing young man appeared to be a regular giant to the shrunken girls, standing at some 50 feet tall from their mouse-size perspective. He appeared to be looking around the room casually, as if he was looking for something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hibiki!\" Kotone cried in joy and rushed over to her now giant-sized friend and ally. The tiny brunette only reached up to Hibiki's shoe, but nevertheless, she hugged the boy's shoe tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKotone's warm reception was not unnoticed by Hibiki, who looked down and saw both Kotone and Kris standing down on the floor, reduced to only about 6 inches tall. Hibiki was shocked by this and unsure of how to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-Kotone! H-How did this happen?\" Hibiki dropped to one knee and took a gentle pose over the shrunken girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I don't know how!\" Kotone replied, teary-eyed. After all she'd been through, she felt like she could release some tension now that Hibiki had come to save her and Kris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHibiki looked down at her, feeling sad and sorry for both girls' current sizes. He was nervous around the shrunken girls, even though he'd been on many adventures with the both of them since the start, seeing them the size of dolls now made them look and feel fragile to him. He worried that they might break if he got too rough with them, and so just let Kotone cry her heart out and weep on his shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKris walked over to Hibiki, she was glad he was here, but didn't show it like Kotone by hugging his foot, instead she offered a big smile and, with her arms folded, an explanation as to what just happened to her and Kotone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was Archer, the Team Rocket 'leader' who did this. He did something to the radio controls and made some kind of soundwave that somehow shrank us down to this size.\" Kris explained more coherently than Kotone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Archer, huh? Don't worry about him. I've already taken care of him.\" Hibiki said triumphantly. Kris let out a sigh of relief at this news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long has it been? You've beaten him already?\" Kris asked, somewhat shocked by Hibiki's quick action against Team Rocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly. As soon as I showed up, he ran off and got away. I was going to chase after him, but then I wondered where you and Kotone were, since I hadn't seen you on the way up here.\" Hibiki explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good. Thank you for your help.\" Kris said. Hibiki smiled at her and Kotone, but looked sad at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, if only I'd come a minute sooner, I might've been able to help prevent this from happening to you two!\" Hibiki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Don't think like that, Hibiki! You saved us!\" Kotone shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. If you were here a minute earlier, you might've just been shrunk along with us.\" Kris offered. Hibiki seemed reluctant, but nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, girls. I promise I'll help you two out anyway I can now!\" Hibiki told them. Kotone smiled and nodded big time, happy that her friend was happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's for the best. Besides, I can only imagine what Archer and Ariana might've done with us otherwise.\" Kris shivered at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ariana, huh? Well, you don't have to worry about her either...\" Hibiki started to say.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Because she shrunk too.\" Hibiki said, and pointed across the room to the freshly shrunken figure of Ariana, now reduced to the same minuscule size as Kris and Kotone, and looking none too pleased about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" Kotone exclaimed. Even though they were enemies, Kotone couldn't help but feel bad for the Rocket executive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Serves her right.\" Kris huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHibiki stepped over his shrunken friends to go get Ariana, and hopefully some answers about how the girls all shrank. But Ariana's small size hadn't diminished her will, and she ran screaming when she saw the giant Hibiki coming towards her. However, Ariana's tiny stature made even her full sprint nothing that Hibiki couldn't cover in just a few casual steps, and the normal-sized boy caught up to her in no time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop, please. I'm not going to hurt you.\" Hibiki assured her. To show his sincerity, he made no attempt to reach out for the frightened little lady. But that didn't stop her from running anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay away!\" Ariana squeaked from the floor, panting as she ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHibiki crossed his arms and sighed. He knew Ariana was a proud woman, but he thought that even she would know when to quit. Reluctantly, and as gently as he could, Hibiki bent down and grabbed the shrunken redhead, literally sweeping her off of her feet. He held her in front of his face, similarly to how he might've held a small Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me go, you creep!\" Ariana shouted at him as she tried in vain to free herself from the comparative giant's fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHibiki stared at the shrunken woman in amazement. He'd seen Kris and Kotone all tiny already, but only now, holding a shrunken person like this, did he realize how small and vulnerable they were at their sizes. He wasn't even trying to hold Ariana too tightly at all, but she still was unable to even slightly budge a single of his fingers. He was astonished by the difference in power as well as size, but in the back of his head, he thought it made the girls look cute at their doll-sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown on the floor, Kris and Kotone watched Hibiki handle Ariana's shrunken body. They could little else in their current states. Kotone was happy that Ariana at least seemed to be all right, aside from being shrunk. But Kris watched the scene with a different view, watching carefully as Hibiki easily and effortlessly manhandled the shrunken woman. She knew Hibiki well and was sure he'd be a kind giant to her, but it still frightened her as she thought of how helpless she'd become. She hoped he'd let Ariana down soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop staring at me like that!\" Ariana spat. \"Heh heh, when I'm back to normal again, I'll have the boss shrink you down and then we'll see how you like it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not going to happen.\" Hibiki shook his head. He became a little flushed as he realized he'd been staring for too long. Not wanting to take advantage of the poor shrunken woman, Hibiki set her down next to Kris and Kotone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank goodness you're okay!\" Kotone said cheerfully, running up to the redhead to give her a hug. Ariana was caught off guard by the aggressive kindness, and nearly knocked to the floor by Kotone's hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey! Let go of me!\" Ariana protested, shoving the younger girl away. Kotone's smile didn't fade though, she was genuinely glad that her enemy was safe, despite the fact that they were about to do battle just minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Ariana could recovered completely, she was then actually tackled to the floor by Kris, who held her down and looked angry enough to slap the poor redhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kris!\" Kotone gasped, not expecting her friend to be so forceful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kris, don't!\" Hibiki yelled, but was hesitant to intervene. After handling the small Ariana before, he wasn't sure that he should even do anything. He just hoped that Kris didn't hurt Ariana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you do this to us!? Tell us!\" Kris demanded, her fist raised, ready to strike Ariana. The latter laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that's more the reception I expected! Hee hee!\" Ariana said with a devious smile. Kris got even angrier and was about to smack Ariana, but relented and instead put her hands down and shook the villain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell us how you shrank us! Or else!\" Kris demanded again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or else... what? You'll beat me?\" Ariana scoffed. \"You've already beaten me!\" She broke into a maniacal laughter. \"Look at how small we are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kris, please...\" Kotone pleaded with Kris, she wanted to stop all the fighting, knowing now was not the time for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKris was upset by Ariana's lack of cooparation, but understood that Ariana was really in the same position as herself and Kotone. Shrunken down to a pitifully helpless size, and even worse, abandoned by her boss. Kris wondered if Archer had actually shrunk his redheaded co-hort on purpose or by accident. She wasn't sure which was worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKris got off of Ariana. She screamed out in frustration and paced around to cool down. Ariana on the other hand laid there on the floor, still chuckling to herself. Hibiki stayed still, afraid to intervene with the shrunken girls. Kotone didn't like it, and walked over to the mad woman. She stood over Ariana and folded her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! You should at least tell us what happened!\" Kotone shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the point?\" Ariana settled down from her laughing fit and stared up at Kotone's angry pout. \"Archer is long gone. Bastard left me behind, I wonder if he even noticed that he shrank me down with you two fools...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The point?\" Kotone began. \"The point is that we need to find a way to get back to normal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not possible.\" Ariana replied shortly. She stood up, now standing slightly taller than Kotone even though they both shrank it seemed to be in proportion. \"That device was meant to shrink our enemies, not grow them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? What device?\" Kris asked, coming back to the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a prototype weapon. We planned to use this radio tower's waves and turn them into a weapon that was capable of shrinking anyone who dared to stand in our way. We weren't supposed to use it yet, but you can see how that turned out.\" Ariana motioned Hibiki, who looked giant to the tiny girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it can only shrink things?\" Hibiki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, didn't you hear me the first time? Or is my voice too small to carry?\" Ariana asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I heard you.\" Hibiki replied. He sat down on the floor to get closer to the shrunken women anyways. \"But there must be a way to reverse this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you been listening? I told you it's impossible!\" Ariana shouted. \"We're all going to be stuck like this for the rest of our lives!\" She turned to Kris and Kotone, and pointed at them. \"So you two better get used to it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forever...?\" Kris asked, her voice quiet as the realization set in. If that was true then all of dreams and hopes were now crushed, no more Pokemon battles, no more Pokedex filling, no more anything but living like a doll. Kris was near tears when Kotone suddenly spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! I refuse to believe that!\" Kotone shouted. \"Besides, it isn't so bad, right, Kris?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right. There has to be something we can do.\" Kris said. She wanted to believe it, and she certainly didn't want to agree that being shrunken down \"wasn't so bad\" as Kotone had put it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. You can't deny facts, look at me, I've already accepted it!\" Ariana pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Kotone's right. Even you or you're engineers don't think it's possible, there must be a way.\" Hibiki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! You tell her, Hibiki!\" Kotone yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we all just need to take a break and relax, and get our minds back. Let's rest up for now, and we'll think of what to do later.\" Hibiki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds good to me.\" Kris said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and I bet you wouldn't even need to rent more than one room! You know, because we're all so tiny!\" Kotone offered cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? Are you saying we should all share a room with Hibiki!?\" Kris's face turned red at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sharing a room with anyone. Let me go, I'll do better on my own, I bet.\" Ariana said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously!?\" Kotone asked, shocked by the redhead's attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph. Maybe that's not such a bad idea.\" Kris said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, Kris, don't be like that. She's got it just as bad as the rest of us. And Ariana, please let us help you, it's way too dangerous for you to be on your own at your size.\" Hibiki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriana thought about it for all of 5 seconds before deciding...</span></div></div>",

Small pieces of equipment were stolen and people in what seemed to be Team Plasma uniforms were all seen in the area before the thefts,\" she explained.  \"I need to see you right away.

Nate is now wearing a light green shirt, tan shorts, white socks and brown shoes. Roxie is wearing a light blue shirt, purple skit and black boots. It was the best the tiny rocker could do with the doll clothes that Nurse Joy brought. The two tinier trainers did have a laugh at Hugh's clothes. Hugh now sport a dark blue shirt that has a Qwilfish in the middle, black shorts, white socks and red shoes. Nate and Roxie notice that Nurse Joy didn't mind wearing a sun dress again as she walks around the ship.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for the group to reach Castelia City. The group was getting off the ship and onto the dock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really seem to enjoy the ride,\" Nate notes as he see's Nurse Joy's eyes sparkle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I don't really get to go anywhere since I work at the center.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate, Roxie and Hugh nod as it was fun to travel even though though they are a small size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tie my ship to the dock. Did Professor Jupiter call you back?\"  Pop Roxie asks as he ties the ship to the dock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet. I queses they're having having trouble find Bianca. By the way Nate are you going to continue fighting gym leaders and getting badges?\"  Roxie turns to young man next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! Even in my state I can't stop. My team and I are going to the champions of Unova,\" Nate beams. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My a what big thing to say,\" Roxie says as a smile. The rocker had to admit that Nate had guts to continue his journey despite his tiny size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should check out the gym,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group looks at half size nurse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really think we should?\" Hugh asks as wanted to fix this problem and kick that grunt's ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will be fine. You have to protect you!\" Pop Roxie says as the does a pose like a hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I really need to worry about this right now.....\" Roxie says as she hangs her head down as Nate pats her back to cheer her up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n____________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop Roxie carries the suit case that Nurse Joy brought as The group walks and makes it to the gym,  but notice that someone was blocking the way. Nate sighs as he recognizes the person blocking the door. His name is Clyde, he would always be near a gym to help some trainer that was coming by to help them out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Champ to be. You seem to have small problem but at least you have two lovely ladies around.\" Clyde says with a smile as the group sighs at the Gym Guide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is the gym leader in?\" Nurse Joy asks for the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. He's not here. Burgh is not here right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the group could speak they heard a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Burgh vanished again? Hmm... Isn't Burgh always vanishing, though? He always says he's got artist's block and just goes wandering out of the Gym. Hi um what happen to you? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group turns around to see a women in pink and Nurse Joy recognized her insistently. The women standing before them was Iris the current champion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those bastards from Plasma shrank us,' Hugh says as puts his hand into a fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if we could find that grunt,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" ... Looking for Team Plasma? But Team Plasma disbanded two years ago! I guess that doesn't matter! You're having problems, so I'll help you out! Hmm... Now where would suspicious people go to hide? ! That's it! That might be where they are!\" Iris says as she starts to run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What weird women,\" Hugh says as Nate says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we follow her? I'm worried about her shrinking,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could but we don't know when Professor Jupiter is going to call,\" Pop Roxie says as Roxie says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but I don't want her to shrunk,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxie didn't want the Unova Champion to be shrunk. How would that look to other champs of world. Koffing made a noise that it agrees with it's trainer<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree. We need to help her. We can't let any more people shrink,\" Nurse Joy says as Blissey smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop Roxie sighs as he held the suit case. The captain of the ship didn't know what to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Quite a powerful water type when trained,\" Joy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked, more Zubats, grimers, and rattattas attacked.  With their new friends healed, Hugh and Nate used their recent catches to get them some experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxie turned when she heard some footsteps.  Her father walked her over to the edge and she watched the three come out.  \"Finally!  I was worried when Burgh and that scientist came out half an hour ago!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, we got delayed with some battles,\" Nate said.  \"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man,\" Hugh said when he saw the tiny Bianca on her Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys!\" her tiny voice said.  She was wearing doll clothes Pop Roxie brought with him in the suitcase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Iris?\" Joy asked seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She went looking for the guy who shrank us,\" Roxie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope she comes back normal sized,\" Nate said.  Roxie nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what now?  Going to face Burgh?\" Roxie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suggest the Pokemon Center for some more readings and then Amanita's lab,\" Joy said.  The two boys looked at her with confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.  Smart,\" Roxie said.  \"In case we catch more than six.  Yeah.  I can see why that would be good.\"  Joy nodded.  \"So, what did you catch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A muk and two Zubats,\" Joy said.  Roxie smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am liking you more and more Nurse Joy,\" Roxie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, just Joy,\" Joy said.  Roxie nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grunt was looking around, both in fear and in a hunger to shrink more people.  He heard a noise and turned sharply.</span></div></div>",

If the blasted ray didn't work on Pokemon, then he would have to deal with those two powerful fire types.  He moved back into the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps it would be best to move north.

Iris nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah.  I couldn't stand back and do nothing.  Besides, we weren't harmed, were we girl?\" Iris asked.  She pet her Salemence.

The Joys came out and the shrunken one lifted a yellow box and pointed it at Iris.  It crackled.  When it got close to Salemence, it crackled a little louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, what's going on?\" Nate asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's measuring radiation,\" Bianca said.  Little Joy pulled out her shrunken balls and set them down..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes and private conversation, Nurse Joy left and walked down the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come inside,\" Joy said before looking at Iris.  \"Bring Salemence inside in his pokeball but don't touch her ball once she's inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Iris asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you could still shrink from holding her ball,\" Joy said firmly.  Iris nodded slowly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll just stay out here,\" Iris said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but I need her in a ball for a test,\" Joy said.  Iris pulled out the ball and brought her friend into the ball.  She dropped a cloth around it and lifted the ball up.  She walked in ahead of the others.  Joy led her to the healing machine and took the cloth.  She placed it on the machine and then a few of her empty balls.  They were slightly larger than Iris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy activated the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seeing if the pokeballs will shrink to your's size,\" Joy said.

The fire melts the string shoot and hits Swadloon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lights, please! Time to show you what Bug-type Pok\u00e9mon are made of! Use Struggle Bug\" Burgh says as lights turn on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwadloon breaths in and about to shoot it's attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quick Attack Flareon!\" Nate shouts as didn't want Swadloon to shoot out it's attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlareon wastes no time and at high speeds hit Swadloon with it's shoulder. Swadloon flies backwards and lands on the ground and faints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did a good job.\" Burgh said as he return Swadloon back to it's ball. \"Now time for Dwebble entrance!\" Burgh continues and throws out his second pokemon. A small crab with a rock on it's back is what come out of Burgh's pokeball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Flareon come back.\" Nate says as the fire pokemon comes to it's owner. \"It's time for Sewaddle to come out,\" Nate says as he throws out a pokeball. The Sewaddle came out of it's ball ready to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must say you have excellent tastes in Pokemon. Use Rock Polish Dwebble!\" Burgh says as the rock bug pokemon starts to shine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sewaddle use Razor Leaf!\" Nate says as Sewaddle uses it's leaves and shoots at the Dwebble. Dwebble dodges the leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice try. Use Smack Down!\" Burgh says as the Dwebble picks up a rock and throws it at Sewaddle. The rock hits Sewaddle. The leaf bug falls down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sewaddle,\" Nate says in concern voice as Sewaddle gets up again. Nate smiles at the leaf bug's determination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Use Razor Leaf!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSewaddle shoots out leaves again at Dwebble. This time Dwebble was unlucky and the leaves were able to hit the crab pokemon. Dwebble faints from the attack. Burgh starts to sweat as he returns Dwebble back it's ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job Sewaddle. Come on over her. Let Flareon finish this,\" Nate says as Sewaddle makes a happy noise and returns to it's trainer. Flareon smiles as it goes back to battle position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go Leavanny!\" Burgh says as he throws out his pokemon. The grass bug pokemon comes out of the ball. \"Mmm\u2026 I've got a bad feeling about this! Could I be in trouble?\" Burgh says in a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's finish this! Flareon use Fire Fang!\" Nate shouts as the Flareon runs at the tall bug pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leavanny use Razor Leaf!\" Burgh shouts as he hopes to slow down the fire pokemon. Leavanny shoots out leaves at Flareon. The leaves hit the fire pokemon but Flareon still went forward. Flareon gets near Leavanny and jumps at it. Flareon bites the bug pokemon as flames were on the fire pokemon's teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSewaddle made a scared noise at seeing the fire pokemon. Nate pets Sewaddle and the bug calms down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlareon jumps back after it finishes it's attack. Leavanny faints and falls on the ground. Burgh sighs as he returns Leavanny back to it's pokeball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm\u2026 It's over! You're incredible!\" Burgh shouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job. Then again I wouldn't expect the person who beat me wouldn't lose that easily,\" Roxie says with a smile as she walks over to Nate. Hugh and Joy go over to join the smaller people, Joy takes notice that Sewaddle starts to shine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Sewaddle is evolving.\" Joy says with a smile as Nate is shock and turns around. There was a big flash of light. After rubbing their eyes the group sees that Sewaddle is now Swadloon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got really strong,\" Nate says with a smile as Swadloon makes a happy noise and rubs against Nate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hoo\u2026 You are very strong indeed! I guess it's no surprise I lost. Here! Take this Insect Badge! I think it'll suit you! And you know what, I'll also give you this.\" Burgh says with a smile as he hands Nate the badge and TM disk. Nate holds the giant badge while Joy held the TM disk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Struggle Bug also lowers the Sp. Atk of the target that was damaged. I'm the best guy to tell you this. It's the little things that count!\" Burgh says with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. And Thanks to you two\" Nate says as with a smile. Flareon and Sewaddle make happy noises from the compliment from their trainer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say if you don't mind, would you battle me?\" Hugh asks as Burgh says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. But I need to heal my pokemon,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I'll show my strength!\"  Hugh yells as loud as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he always like this?\" Roxie asks as Nate replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's part of his charm,\" Joy says with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate and Roxie sigh as they both sit down near the wall waiting for Hugh's battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfuly it didn't take long for Hugh's battle and soon the group was out of the gym.

I got the system reworked for ya,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can transfer balls into a new special box,\" Bianca said from the side of the computer.  \"Oh, you have a Flareon now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate smiled.  \"He was crucial in helping me win.\" His mount was pleased with the compliment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how will this work?\" Hugh asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, enter your trainer ID then this special code,\" Amanita said as Nurse joy handed out the papers.  \"The system is now designed to monitor the energy of the pokeballs and slowly drain it to store elsewhere.\"  Roxie looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" she asked.  \"You're storing it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.  Energy can't be created nor destroyed.  It's a principal fact of the world.  This energy is sent to a specific location to slowly burn off in safety,\" Amanita said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have also alerted the Pokemon League, all the Centers in the region,\" Nurse Joy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Joy said.  Nurse Joy looked at the trainers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I presume you need healing?\"  Hugh and Nate nodded.  They handed over their balls, with Flareon going back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, going to head on north to Nimbasa?\" Iris asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the plan,\"  Nate said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elesa is in her fashion model faze right now, right?\" Roxie asked.  The Champion nodded.  \"If she tries to dress me up like a doll, I'll poison her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do Bianca?\" Hugh asked the young woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Professor Juniper wants me to travel with you to keep monitoring any changes,\" Bianca said.  Pop Roxie looked uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" his daughter asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to leave you behind but I'm worried about the ship,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The League can compensate you for hiring another person,\" Iris said.  Pop Roxie looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?  Roxie did you know that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded.  \"Yeah.  It's how any damage done fighting Team Plasma two years ago was handled,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why couldn't it be used when I was trying to be an actor?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it's for emergencies only and your new career path wouldn't fall under it!\" Roxie yelled.  Her father sighed in defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right,\" he said glumly.  \"Well I'll wait outside when you're ready.\"  He left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might want to be nicer,\" Nurse Joy noted.  Roxie looked up at her.  \"We got word on how his movie debut fared and it was a total flop.\"  Roxie nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll keep that in mind,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, let's get shopping and then head out,\" Nate said.  The balls were returned , they stocked up on potions, and they set out to the north.  Pop Roxie carrying the bought goods as Roxie rode on Flareon with Nate and Bianca on her Stoutland.  The shorter Flareon keeping up with the larger beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was easy travels until they reached the park.  hey saw the scientist from the sewers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I see another one was shrunk,\" Corless said.  \"If it's not an inconvenience, may I have a look at your Pok\u00e9mon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, no problem from me,\" Nate said as he nudged Flareon forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I appreciate your cooperation!\"  Corless took a careful examination over the fire type.  \"Oh! How interesting! Your Flareon seems to display more self-confidence than others of the same species. And you're a Trainer with merely three Badges\u2026 Fantastic! I'm not sure how you're doing it, but you're bringing out the power of your Pok\u00e9mon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, but Hugh also has three badges too,\" Nate said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How marvelous.  Oh, excuse me! I am a scientist. My name is Colress. The theme of my research is: 'Bringing out the power of Pok\u00e9mon.' Bringing out the power of Pok\u00e9mon! Is it possible to bring out their maximum power through the bond they share with their Trainers? Or is there some other, different method? I'd like to test my theory by battling with you. Do you find this acceptable?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I'm game,\" Nate said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful.  I'll be waiting at Route 4,\" he said.  Corless walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Corless.

I disagree. Conversely, it should be humans who bring out the hidden potential in Pok\u00e9mon!\" Corless continues to talk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This guy is weird,\" Roxie says as she was getting tiered of Corless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm starting to think the same thing,\" Nate agrees with comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop Roxie was getting worried about Corless and wonder if they could trust him. Joy and Bianca on the other hand were thinking the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I've heard this before.... But where?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that I think of it, I never asked your name,\" Corless says as Nate replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Nate,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2026 I'll remember that name. Well then, I will test you to see if you're a Trainer who can bring out the hidden potential of Pok\u00e9mon!\" Corless said as he takes out his electric board and a pokeball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate and Roxie get off Flareon so Nate could get ready for the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go and beat this guy,\" Roxie says and Nate nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Let's go get them Roggenrola!\" Nate shouts as he pulls out a pokeball from his bag and throws it. The rock pokemon comes out of the ball, ready to fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting,\" The blonde scientist says he throws his pokeball. The pokemon that come out of the pokeball is Magnemite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This could be bad,\" Joy whispers and Hugh asks quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magnemite is part Steel. Rock is weak against Steel,\" Joy explains to Hugh. Hugh grew worried about his friend's match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Use Mud-Slap!\" Nate says as the Rock pokemon fires dirt at the Magnemite. The Magnemite was hit by the mud. It did some damage but not enough to defeat it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Use Magnet Bomb!\" Corless said as the Magnemite launches a steel bomb that sticks to Roggenrola. It hits Roggenrola really hard and the rock pokemon falls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roggenrola...\" Nate says as he was worried about the rock pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoggenrola then stood up barely standing. The rock pokemon makes a noise to show that it still wants to fight it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It has the ability Sturdy! It can withstand a strong that can knock it out once,\" Joy explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate smiles as he sees that Roggenrola still wanted to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Let's do our best! Use Mud-Slap!\" Nate yells as Roggenrola shoots out fires dirt at Magnemite. The hit was critical and Magnemite faints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job Roggenrola!\" Nate says as he hugs his pokemon. Roggenrola makes a happy noise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorless just returns Magnemite to it's ball. With out saying anything Corless throws out another pokeball. Inside was the pokemon Klink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Roggenrola take a brake. Flareon will take care of the rest,\" Nate says as the rock pokemon understands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next battle went quick as Flareon took out Klink in one attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"Splendid! You are quite the Trainer!\" Corless says he returns Klink back it's ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see! Just like the Gym Leaders in each area or the Elite Four and Champion in the Pok\u00e9mon League, you bring out the power in Pok\u00e9mon by being kind to them! That's the kind of person you are. I'm extremely grateful for your help. This is a token of my gratitude.\" Corless says as he sits down a Protein. Corless continues to talk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"It's so frustrating! If only we could talk to Pok\u00e9mon in order to bring out their power! But there's no way a person like that could ever exist! Well then, Nate, I hope to see you again sometime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorless says as he leaves the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a weird guy,\" Pop Roxie says as Joy and Bliss go over to Nate and heal his pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job out there,\" Roxie says as Nate replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks....

She showed no interest in dating anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut to this man, it was a serious rejection and punishment was required.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did I drop that silly device,\" she muttered.  \"There it is!\"  She reached down when a wave of energy passed over her and she fell to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy your new place in life,\" he muttered.  He enjoyed that.  He enjoyed that a lot.  Now to find any of those traitors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nServine and Roggenrola were enjoying the tough battles.  Hugh's Onix was useful in traversing some of the seeper sands the tiny Shrunkies couldn't deal with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually something came low and landed not a hundred feet away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!  Just look at that cool girl,\" Roxie said.  She threw her ball and Koffing appeared.  \"Go! Use Smog!\"  The gas hit the dark flying type.  The dark flying type screeched and flapped its wings.  Koffing seemed happy but then began bouncing around aimlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Nate asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mandibuzz used Flatter.  It increases Koffing's special attack but confuses her as well,\" Joy explained.  Roxie's eyes narrowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Use Smog again!\" Roxie said.  Koffing turned to Mandibuzz and released another wave of gas.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMandibuzz screeched and flew at Koffing when a tiny ball flew and struck it.

Come and join me,\" Joy says with a smile as she gets a pokeball. Daramanian smiles as the fire pokemon presses the ball.

Please I need your help?\"  Nate bit his lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does it entail?\" he asked.  The man smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started with explaining about the place called Join Avenue.  It is meant to be a location for trainers to visit and shop, where rare items and services will be provided.  And as the manager, Nate would be in charge of bringing in vendors by inviting them to open a shop.  As the owner, he would supply the goods to the shops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what sort of shops will be offered here?\" Hugh asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cafes to eat and drink at, Salons to get pampered at, Dojos to train in, and so many more,\" the owner said.  Roxie's eyes lit up at the mention of the Salon and Dojo as a young man was coming from Nimbasa.  \"Please try him.\"  Nate blushed a little and rode Flareon before him.  The young man looked down in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi.  Um, would you like to join this avenue?  It would be a good job,\" Nate said.  The young man closed his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.  Why not?  I think I've always wanted to work with old things, look at items that need to be appraised,\" the young man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent.  We have just the equipment!\" the owner said.  One of his people ran off and a small horde arrived and set up a shop.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon a sign was up reading \"Janus' Antiques\".  The young man looked happy behind his counter.  He checked his inventory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I think I have enough inventory to sell to each of you if you want,\" he said.  \"Sorry, nothing free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't get everything,\" Roxie said as Nate directed Flareon over.  He jumped onto the counter.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can have the money tranfered still, so I would like one from each box,\" Nate said.  Janus nodded and from a super big box pulled a dirty thing.  He cleaned it off carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.  It's a Metal Coat,\" Janus said before handing it over.  Nate looked at the chunk of metal.  Janus pulled something out of the chunk C rank pile.  \"And the other one is . . . a Big Nugget!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.  Lucky you,\" Roxie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.  What can I do with either?\" Nate asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you give Metal Coat to an Onix and trade it, the Onix will evolve into a Steelix,\" Roxie said.

How did you get so small?\" Young women asks as stares at Nate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We got shrunk by a team Plasma Grunt,\" Roxie answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sucks,\" Young Women said as she cross her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are doing here?\" Hugh asks the Young women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I heard that in Gear Station you can have Pok\u00e9mon battles in the subway! So I came here to test my skills, and, what do you know\u2026 the Subway Bosses were here! Isn't that amazing? The young woman asks. The group nods as the young woman explains more.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, they're the strongest Trainers in Gear Station! And they said they'd battle if it's two on two! This is an a-MAZ-ing opportunity! Would you PLEASE battle with me?\" The Women asks Nate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. If don't mind me being five inches,\" Nate replies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks! Oh that's fine! The name's Rosa! Let's become the best partners ever and surpass the Subway Bosses! So I'll have you challenge the Subway Bosses with me, then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck,\" Roxie says as she gets off Flareon so Nate possibly use him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Nate says as he looks at the subway bosses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay with me tag battling with Rosa?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay. \"I'm a Subway Boss. My name is Ingo! Usually, I'm having Pok\u00e9mon battles in the subway that departs from Gear Station.\" The black clothed man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"I'm Emmet. I'm a Subway Boss. I love Double Battles! And I love the combination of two Pok\u00e9mon!\" The white clothes man says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny Nate and Rosa get ready to battle Ingo and Emmet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"Having a battle in a place like this is a little irregular, but this must've happened for a reason. Battling in a different place will let me see different scenery, and I might learn something, too. Now, Emmet, if you have something to add, please!\" Ingo says as he looks at Emmet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"Follow the rules and drive safely! We're headed for victory! All aboard!\" Emmet replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did he really just say that....\" Hugh whispers as he watches the battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well they usually do this on the subway. So it must be a force of habit,\" Bianca whispers back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go Servine!\" Nate says as he pulls a pokeball out of his bag and throws it. And the grass pokemon comes out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nice. Let's do our best Dewott!\" Rosa shouts as she pulls out a pokeball and throws it. The water pokemon comes out readey to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. How did she get a Dewott?\" Hugh thought as he watches the battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go Gurdurr!\" Ingo says as he gets a pokeball from inside his coat and throws it. The fighting pokemon was ready to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go Boldore!\" Emmet says as he did the same thing as Ingo. The rock pokemon come out of the ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll let you go first,\" Ingo says with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Do you mind if I go first?\" Rosa asks her tag battle partner. Nate nods his head as Rosa turns to face the subway bosses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! Dewott use Water Pulse on Boldore!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dewott shouts water out of it's mouth and it hits the rock type hard. But in the end it was still standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like Boldore has Sturdy,\" Nate notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very nice try. Gurdurr use Low Kick on Servine!\" Ingo say as the fighting pokemon jumps and kicks the grass pokemon. Servine stood tall after the attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job buddy! Servine use Leach Seed on Gurdurr!\" Nate yells as Servine did what it was told. The grass pokemon shoots out seeds and the seeds land near Gurdurr. The seeds grew fast and soon tangled the fighting pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impressive! Boldore use Power Gem on Dewott!\" Emmet says the rock pokemon attacks with a ray of light that sparkles as if it were made of gemstones. Luckily Dewott doges the attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice try!\" Rosa says as Dewott was ready to attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGurdurr felt some of it's energy leave as it went to Servine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dewott use Razor Shell on Boldore!\" Rosa says as the water pokemon uses the shells on the sides of it's legs to attack the rock type. Boldore got hit by the attack and fainted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very nice. Use low kick on Servine!\" Ingo says. The fighting pokemon does it's attack but misses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice! Servine let's finish this! Use Leaf Blade to finish this,\" Nate says as the grass pokemon runs at Gurdurr as it forms a sharp leaf like a sword and attacks Gurdurr. The leaf sword hits Gurdurr and it was a critical hit. Gurdurr faints after the attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Ingo and Emmet return their fainted pokemon back to their balls, after words the two had something to say to the tiny trainer and normal size trainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"Bravo! The combination of you and your Pok\u00e9mon is truly fantastic!\" Ingo says with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"I'm Emmet. While I may have lost to you\u2026 I had a good time! Let's play again sometime!\" The white clothed man says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"Yes! Definitely! Next time, please ride the subway and battle with us there! Well then, we're off! All aboard!\"\" Ingo finishes as the subway bosses go back into the building behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa returns Dewott back to it's ball and she turns her head to look at her tiny tag battle partner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were so tough, even when they were holding back for us! That's the Subway Bosses for you! I want to get even stronger and battle the Subway Bosses when they're giving it their all! Thanks, Nate! This is a token of my appreciation! Please take it\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\nRosa sits down a small device in front of Nate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you have the Vs. Recorder, you can record your battles with your friends or battles on the Battle Subway! Nate! I had a really great time battling with you! I hope we can battle together again sometime! See you!\" Rosa finishes as she leaves the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job,\" Roxie says as Nate returns Servine back to it's ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. What should we do now?\" Nate asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I want to get some sleep,\" Pop Roxie says as it was a long day for the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I need to get more supplies,\" Hugh says as he looks through his bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to visit my cousin,\" Joy says as Bliss wants to with her trainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll get a room at the center and look at my data,\" Bianca explains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't think of anything,\" Roxie says as she tries to think what she wants to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to check out that amusement park. Do you want to come with me?\" Nate asks the white hair women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. I've got nothing better to do,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop Roxie was about to say something but Joy stop him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Just be back around seven\" Pop Roxie says as he goes to the Center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Pops,\" Roxie says as she gets on Flareon to join Nate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHugh, Joy, Bliss and Bianca nod and join Pop Roxie in walking to center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's have some fun,\" Nate says with a smile and Roxie agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlareon makes a happy noise as it starts to move. Roxie held Nate tight as they ran to the amusement park. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A biker was there having what seemed to be a Triple battle.  Could be a rotation but she wasn't to sure at the moment.  The crowd was too thick to squeeze through.  She looked at the grass to the north and walked towards it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen to the left she heard something.  A soft moaning was coming from between some trees.  She invesitgated and saw a small grotto between the trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome,\" she said, unaware there was a frustrated man close behind her.  He too was blocked by Charles.  Right now Charles was too covered to be hit, but he could take his frustration on this woman.  As she entered the grotto, he fired and felt a lot better as she passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\"  Nate whispered as he looked up at the giant Ferris Wheel.  It was big before but now to him and Roxie surpassed all imagination.  Flareon continued walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you ever been on there?\" Roxie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never.  You?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once,\" Roxie said.  \"It was wa few years back.\"  Nate nodded when Flaeon stopped.  His ears tilted around and turned to flowers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it boy?\" Nate asked.  A small cat Pokemon looked out from the flowers and ducked back down.  \"Huh.  What Pokemon is that?\"  He pulled out the Pokedex and aimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>No Data Available.  Require update.</i>\" the Pokedex announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A foreign pokemon.  Hmm.  Light skin.  Pointy ears.  I think it's a Meowth,\" Roxie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a bad feeling.  Let's go check this out,\" Nate said.  Flareon walked over and the Meowth popped up again and hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" Roxie called.  She heard a startled  yelp.  \"Hey!  Look!  We don't mean you any trouble!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go away!\" called the voice.  Meowth hissed again.  Flareon growled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were you shrunk?\" Nate asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" replied the voice.  A female head popped up and revealed her pink hair.  \"Oh, you too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way.  You're Yancy!\" Roxie said.  The girl named Yancy blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know me.  How did this happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Team Plasma,\" Nate said.  He blushed a bit.  \"You lost your clothes, didn't you?\"  Yancy nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess we should call Pops to bring some clothes,\" Roxie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I . . . I would be most appreciative,\" Yancy said.  Roxie pulled out her Xtransceiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa slowly came too.  She was on something soft.  Was it a bed?  Why was it vibrating?  Why was her hair unbound?  Her eyes opend and saw the trees far above her.  Blinking, she saw she was in the arms of a giant pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, she realized it was  a Minccino and another second until she realized it wasn't big.  She was small.  She was also getting cold because she was naked.  Her clothes were a distance away while her bag was close by.  Reaching in, she pulled out her tiny balls and unleashed her Dewwatt and pansear.  They were giant to her, which meant they were normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank goodness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pansear, would you make a fire?\" she asked.  Her Pansear used ember and a small fire was started.  The Minccino holding her liked the warmth.  She looked at her Pokemon.  Did she keep them close or send one to the Nimbasa Pokemon Center?</span></div></div>",

Nate took notice of pink hair girl shivering a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It might not be much but here,\" Nate says as he pulls of his shirt and holds it out for Yancy to take. Roxie and Yancy blush a bit from Nate taking of his shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey what are you doing! Your making her blush,\" Roxie says with a slight blush on her face. Yancy shakes her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it's fine.

Roxie still had little bit red when she thought about Nate seeing in the buff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three stood there in silence for a couple of seconds before Nate brakes the silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must travel a lot. I've never seen a Meowth before,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. My job requires me to travel a lot. It's been fun traveling to different regions\" Yancy replies as the pink hair girl felt the tension leave the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That good to hear that you've been doing well,\" Roxie says as she looks at Yancy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two know each other?\" Nate asks as Roxie looks at Yancy. Yancy had the look \"Please don't tell him about my job,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We happen meet each other years ago,\" Roxie lies for Yancy. Yancy sighs happily in that Roxie didn't tell Nate what her job was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate felt like Roxie lied but figure that Yancy must want to keep her job a secret. So Nate went with the lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's neat. So where did you go?\" Nate asks as Yancy blushes a bit but talks about her travels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three shrunkies were having fun talking about their journeys. Yancy was surprised that Nate and Roxie's travels were doing very well even they were shrunk. Yancy heard about about Nate and Roxie's friends and Roxie's father. In turn Yancy talk about her travels through out different regions. It also seem like Flareon and Meowth were getting along even after exchanging some growls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three shrunkies stop talking and two pokemon stop playing to see.... </span></div></div>",

Walking over, he knelt down.  When he saw Nate without a shirt, he glared for a brief moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, here you go,\" he said.  He handed the bag over and Roxie helped take it to Yancy.

You just caught this guy today?\" Nimbasa Joy asked.  It was beyond friendly to the shorter Joy as she pet it with a special glove.  The local Chansey was ready with some cleaner to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.  From what Nate said his Sewaddle was the same.  Right Hugh?\"  The pointy-haired teen nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  Wouldn't it be funny if being shrunk somehow cause Pokemon to become super friendly with us?\" Hugh asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's an interesting theory.  We would need to test it out on something else,\" Bianca said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if Swadloon or Nate's Eevee or your Eevee Hugh evolves soon within  a day, it could verify it,\" Little Joy said.  Hughgot up and rolled his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll go train my Pokemon for a bit.  See you in an hour or so,\" he said.  Joy nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be safe,\" she said.  Hugh walked out of the Center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYancy emerged wearing a pink dress and handed Nate his shirt back.  Meowth gave an approving mew.  \"Thanks.  Would you mind giving me a ride to the Pokemon Center?\"  He shook his head and dropped  so she could get on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go Flareon,\" Nate said as Roxie got back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHugh looked up at the Big Stadium when he heard a noise.  Turning, he saw a Dewott looking about and calling for help.  \"What's your trouble?\" he asked.  Dewott spotted in and waved him over before running towards Route 5.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYears ago when his sister's Purrlion was stolen, he had a bad feeling in his gut.  Now it was back.  He started running and readied his Xtranscevier.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the barrier whose sign warned of the chance of rain the next day, he came to Route 5.  A crowd for something was still around despite it being night.  Hugh focused on the Dewott and went to what looked like was a small grotto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he entered, he spotted the clothes on the ground.  \"No,\" he whispered.  Then he looked closer.  \"Rosa?\" he called out.  He saw a fire burning with a Minccino and Dewott next to it.  Hugh approached carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's you!\" came a voice.  It was high above him.  Looking up a Pansear was in the trees holding a small figure.  \"You're from the train station with Nate!\"  Hugh nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you got hit by Team Plasma,\" he said darkly.  \"I can help you get back to the Pokemon Center.  We should have some clothes for you there.\"  She nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go down now,\" she told her Pansear.  \"Dewott, water gun the camp fire.\"  Dewott put the flames out.  Hugh began to blush and walked to her clothes.  The skirt was too long but just wrapped about, it would give her some decency.  When he came back, he noticed just how long her hair was without it in buns,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.  You have a lot of hair,\" Hugh said.  Rosa smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swore when I was ten to not cut it until I was League champion,\" Rosa said with pride.  Hugh set the skirt down and turned around.  After a minute and the sound of Pokemon returning, she said, \"Turn around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she was held by Dewott.  Both Minccino and Pansear were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go,\" Hugh said.  Taking the rest of her clothes, they left the grotto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As it would be ill advised to use the proper showers, Nimbasa Joy made them baths by heating some water up in pots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn clean clothes, the shrunkies and shorties met up in the main area.  Some food was out for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what are you doing today?\" Rosa asked.  Nimabsa Joy gave her a paperclip to use for her hair rolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to challenge the gym,\" Nate said.  Rosa nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elesa is a tricky fighter from what I heard,\" Rosa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know anything about her?\" Yancy asked, looking at Roxie.  Roxie coughed down some water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might.  But I don't like giving help when it comes to challenges.  They're called that for a reason,\" Roxie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Roxie.  I appreciate it,\" Nate said sincerely.  Hugh nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree,\" Hugh said.  He noticed Rosa smile as well.  \"Something on your mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm happy you won't be pressuring me to cheat,\" Rosa said.  She pulled out of her badge box which revealed she had the Bolt Badge already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you are going to challenge Elesa you should hurry,\" Nimbasa Joy injected.  \"A show is about to start.  When she starts a fashion show, you'll have to wait outside until it's over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thanks!\" Nate said.  He pulled out a pokeball and released Servine once more.  \"Um, Roxie, you want a ride?\"  The rocker smiled.  Hugh helped them to Servine as Bianca reached and released Stoutland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you two need a ride?\" Bianca asked.  Rosa nodded.  Joy helped them down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll use my own,\" Yancy said.  She called out her Meowth and climbed on before he hopped down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We best hurry,\" Joy said as she hopped down with Hugh and Pop Roxie took up the rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nine rushed in front of the train station as a bell went off and into the amusement park they went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop Roxie was breathing heavily as he tried to keep up with the lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was for not as the doors to the new gym closed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blast,\" Hugh said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what now?\" Nate asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could try and see who is visiting Join Avenue,\" Joy noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard there is a hidden grotto in Lostlorn Forest,\" Bianca said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh . . . we could just wait in here to catch the next one,\" Yancy said.  \"The Ferris Wheel shouldn't take too long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's also the old gym which has some fun roller coasters in it,\" Rosa said with some excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You went in them before?\" Hugh asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!  I wonder what they're like at my size,\" Rosa said.  Hugh and Nate looked at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Staying in the park sounds best,\" Hugh said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  I agree,\" Nate said.  He looked at the Ferris Wheel.  \"That looks like a fun idea.\"  Yancy smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind if I join you?\" Roxie said.  \"I know they usually only allow two people inside, but since we're so small . . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can always find out,\" Nate said.  Yancy's smile seemed fixed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.  That should be nice,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Roxie, Bianca, would you like to join me in the Roller Coaster?\" Joy asked.

I'm usually doing my gym leader duties. I'm even having a harder time getting practice time in for the band in me,\" Roxie explain her problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm always traveling and listening to my bosses.

But I've been having a lot of fun on this journey with everyone. I've had fun talking and traveling with you Roxie. Yancy we wouldn't mind if you join us in travels.

Her buddy struck once more and she tossed a tiny ball.  It struck Roselia and the ball closed up.  It shook before dinging and returning to Roxie.  \"Gotcha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sound really excited,\" Yancy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poisons are my specialty.  I have a few but not this one,\" Roxie said.  \"It's a nice one to have against people who try using ground-type against me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm happy for you,\" Nate said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Roxie could respond, Bianca spoke up.  \"Oh look!  There's a gap in the trees.  It's likely a hidden grotto!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like where Rosa found that Minccino?\" Joy asked.  Bianca nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go see what's hidden here,\" Nate said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHugh walked with Rosa on his shoulder.  They took a turn and saw a backpacker examining a tree.  He straightened up and turned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah.  Hello,\" he said.  Hugh came up to the taller guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" Hugh said.  Rosa waved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a strange dilemma has befallen you,\" the backpacker said.  \"You should be careful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Hugh asked.  The man smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rumors say the dangerous Pokemon Zoroark lays in wait in these woods.  You never know when it might come out,\" the backpacker said.  He walked past them, nodded, and smiled once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHugh and Rosa felt a shudder and he turned quickly to see the man shift into tall black Pokemon with a long bushy tail.    It gave them a toothy grin before vanishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa.  Did that just happen?\" Nate asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  Yeah it did,\" Nate said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate went into Grotto on Servine.  His friends waited outside.  Before him in the grotto was a Pokemon with two pincers on his head.  \"Pinsir\" the Pokedex said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like a bug-type.  Come out Lucario!\" Nate said.  His new friend looked at him and then the Pinsir.  \"Quick attack.\"  Lucario raced in and struck.  Pinsir took the hit and caught it to throw Lucario.  Lucario landed hard.  Pinsir seemed to be smirking.  It seemed different.  What just happened?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Force Palm!\" Nate said.  The attack landed and Pinsir shuddered.  It seemed paralyzed before raising up and striking Lucario hard.  \"What's going on?\"  \"Swadloon!\"  The grass-bug pokemon looked at the fallen Lucario.  It let loose an angry noise.  \"String Shot!\"  Pinsir raced to grab Swadloon but stumbled.  The string wrapped up and caused the Pokemon to fall hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting no time, Nate threw a Net Ball and it struck. The ball dinged. The ball vanished, going to Nate's PC.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate returned Lucario and felt angry at getting his friend in a bad spot.  \"Let's see what Joy has.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYancy walked around the entrance.  Roxie was talking with her new Pokemon.  Joy and Bianca were talking about some Pokemon they found in the dessert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this?\" she whispered as she found a spot of something yellow.  She touched it and tasted it.  \"Honey?\"  She heard a buzzing noise and looked up.  An angry Combee was above her.</span></div></div>",

But we got smaller,\" A voice replies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuck looks up to see a only larger baker women Jenn wearing his vest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenn. Are you alright,\" Charles asks as he final gets up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine. Also looks like everyone has clam down,\" Jenn replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharles turns around to see that everyone on route five had gotten smaller and that three tiny people were helping calming people down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those sure are brave kids,\" Charles says he sits down. Jenn nods as she smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n__<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There they are!\" Rosa shouts as she sees Nate, Roxie, Yancy with newly shrunken people. Hugh still holding the tiny brunet <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those bastards,\" Hugh whipsers under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well better give them their clothes,\" Pop Roxie says as he goes forward but Joy stops him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey what are you doing?\" The middle age man asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you forget they have radiation. We don't want you to get shrunk as well,\" Joy replies and Pop Roxie nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca had a worry look on her face as she watches Nate, Roxie and Yancy. Joy took notice of Bianca's worried face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's on your mind?\" Joy asks. Bianca glumly looks at the slightly larger nurse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like you said they have radiation. I'm worried about Nate, Roxie, and Yancy. They could have gotten radiation on them and they could get smaller,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy had a shock face. True the thought did come up in the little Nurse's head but she assumed that 5 inches is when the shrinking would stop. Joy hoped that Bianca theory is wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

My Mamoswine was hit and touched me later,\" Clay said.  \"My height isn't why I called though,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ran into the mysterious shrinker,\" Little Joy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nearly had him,\" Clay said.  \"I was able to injure one grunt, and got another in the beam's path but the shrinker escaped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to the one who was shrunk?\" Nimbasa Joy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's where I come in,\" Driftveil Joy said, \"My Chatot's cage is a nice detainment place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, thankfully only one big victim and you minor decrease,\" Little Joy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I wouldn't say that.  Five Ex-Plasma people who've made up shop in my city.  Three were shrunk before I could reach them and two found their friends and touched them within the hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no,\" Little Joy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  So are you heading here then?\" Clay asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that we know for certain they are there,\" Little Joy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDewott was not a forgiving Pokemon.  It continued to glare even as Hugh's head was inches from Rosa as they watched the scenery.  \"Thank you again for last night,\" Hugh said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome Hugh,\" Rosa said softly.  She blushed.  She wanted to move closer but was hesitant.  Hugh respected her views . . . but what if he didn't like her like that?</span></div></div>",

Rood looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe his name is Grant,\" Rood said.  \"Ghetsis often looked for people who had no real family.  Grant was lonelier than most.  He was seeking prove himself and elevate his position in the our old group.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think he had much skill with using Pokemon,\" one ex-member said.  \"He was the sort who couldn't use a a sewaddle with a Magmar, if you catch my drift.\"  Clay nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, this could be the one thing he is successful at,\" Clay said.  Rood nodded.  \"Now, who could have built this device?  Even knowing what to get, Ghetsis didn't strike me as the scientist.  A manipulator and planner, yes.  But to build this . . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am afraid, I don't know who the newest scientists in that branch are.  And your assessment of that man is apt,\"  Rood said.

Upon entering,  the group saw Clay sitting a distance away talking to some birdcage and a group of people looking down from a table top.

Like a Purrloin?\" Rosa asks as Hugh grew a bit happy that Rosa asks about the Purrloin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Pok\u00e9mon you speak of is not in this place. I imagine it is still being used by Team Plasma now. Just as you say, our apologizing doesn't solve anything. But you can't move forward unless you admit you were wrong and apologize\u2026 Team Plasma made Trainers suffer\u2026 I feel terrible about it\u2026 How foolish we were,\"  Rood explains as sad expression is on his face.

Actually, I have a favor to ask of you. Could you please look after this Pok\u00e9mon, Zorua?\" Rood asks a Zorua jumps on the table as soon as it was called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Zorua. Those are very rare,\" Joy says as she looks at the dark type Pokemon. Rosa without any hesitation says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Thank you! That Zorua is one of the Pok\u00e9mon that my lord N relied on as a friend during his journey,\" Rood explains as the others were surprise to hear this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is one of N's pokemon,\" Yancy says as she look at the Zorua. The Zorua looks very friendly and seems to taken a liking to Rosa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.

Ghetsis is a person she would remember for the rest of her life, the person that almost destroyed Unova and hurt her friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Team Plasma is an organization created by a man named Ghetsis to help him take over the Unova region. The one he groomed to help him further his nefarious aims was N. N was a strange boy who was called the child of the Pok\u00e9mon.\" Anthea finishes and Concordia starts to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N was an orphan. I heard that right after he was born, he upset people with behavior that suggested he could talk to Pok\u00e9mon. When he was living in the woods with Darmanitan and Zorua, Ghetsis took him in. We are also orphans Ghetsis took in. Our task was to take care of N.\" Concordia finishes up their explanation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group is surprise to hear about Anthea, Concordia, and N's past. Pop Roxie grew angry from hearing how Ghetsis would even use kids for his plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord N is a wonderful person who has the power to understand the hearts of Pok\u00e9mon. But still, he has much to learn about understanding the hearts of people... I hope he will develop this skill while he travels with the legendary Pok\u00e9mon to atone for the trouble he caused in Unova as the king of Team Plasma,\" Rood explains as the group nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This Plasma is different...\" Nate thought as he wants to continue to talk with Rood and the others. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Clay is about stop until he heard the sound a door sliding open, the gym leader turns around to a person wearing a black top hat with red ribbed silk, white domino mask covers the top of his face, a crimson scarf that covers bottom half of his face, wearing scarlet cape and under that a black suit with a black tie, and black loafers. The person in the strange outfit is surprise to a smaller Clay and a tiny women in a cage. Clay was about a bad day and now it became worst. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you weren't suppose to come out until the PWT! What are you doing here Crimson?\" Clay asks with anger clear in voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a moment for Crimson but soon he replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry. I started to get a cramp and figure I could use a walk. Though I had my doubts about what you said three days ago, it looks what you said is true,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny woman notice that Crimson's voice sounded deeply ragged and heroic at the same time. Crimson then turns his attention from Clay to the tiny woman in the cage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. You're wonder about her? She's part of that Team Plasma. Trying to get information out of her right now. But so far she's being stubborn,\" Clay explains as the tiny woman starts to shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right! I will not betray my Master! We will soon take over Unova!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay grew angry from hearing this woman say the same thing over and over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You keep on saying that! Do you understand what you are doing?\" Clay asks the tiny woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do. I will do anything for my master,\" The tiny woman replies with pride in her voice. Clay couldn't believe what he was hearing. Crimson look at the tiny woman and asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you would do anything?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" The tiny woman replies with a smile on her face. Crimson nods and then pulls out a pokeball from his belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakata come on out. I need you for a test,\" Crimson says as he throws the ball and a Samurott comes out of the ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey what are you planing?\" Clay asks as Crimson goes over to a chair, picks it up and turns it around to face the tiny woman in the cage and sits down in the chair. The tiny women starts to silently to panic and wonders what Crimson is doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you pass this test, Clay will let you go. But if you fail it you must tell him everything you know,\" Crimson says as Clay says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are doing!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all. Fine by me, what do you want me to do?\" The tiny woman asks as she is ready to earn her freedom and return to Team Plasma. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrimson looks over to Sakata and stares at him. Sakata looks at his trainer and nods, understanding what Crimson wants him to do even without saying anything. Crimson then turns to the tiny woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to order my partner Sakata to take out his razor shell blade and tell him to stab me in the heart,\" Crimson says in dead serious manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay, Driftveil Joy and even the tiny woman went into shock after hearing what the test is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-Please change the test. If your pokemon does that, you will die,\" Driftveil Joy says as she didn't want to see someone to die in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrimson waits silently for the tiny woman to make her move. The tiny woman didn't know what to do, back when her team mate was about to step on their tiny ex teammates it made her feel sick but she figured she would get use to it. But still the thought of killing someone bothered her, even hurting a pokemon bothered her as well. These thoughts went through her head until she heard Crimson's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you follow your master's orders, this is what he'll make you do. Can you really take a life away? Be it a human or pokemon?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny woman starts to sweat from Crimson's words and wonders what she can do. Clay and Driftveil Joy watch as the tiny women opens her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I can't do this,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay and Driftveil Joy both happily sigh at the conclusion of this test. Crimson gets up and goes near the tiny women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got me. I'm not that strong enough to follow through with my pledge with Team Plasma,\" The tiny woman says as starts to tear up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're wrong,\" Crimson replies as the tiny woman is shock and looks up at the giant.

You were able to make your own choice in this matter and manage to keep your bonds from breaking,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" The tiny woman asks as she didn't understand what Crimson is saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must have had Family, friends and your trusty partners,\"Crimson says as he looks over to Sakata. Crimson then continues. \"You've had them even before joining Team Plasma,\" The tiny woman understands and remembers her family, friends and her trusty pokemon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But my bonds with them were broken as soon as I join Team Plasma,\" The tiny woman says she down at the cage's floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That may be true. But they can still be repaired, if you had followed the path of your masters then those bonds would truly broken forever,\" Crimson replies as the tiny women nods and Crimson continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No matter what happens in this life, you mustn't lose sight of those who truly care about you,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrimson finishes and turns to look at Driftveil Joy and Clay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry that I cause you worry, Miss Joy and Clay I'll go back to my room until you give out your signal,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright. As long as everyone is alright,\" Drifveil Joy says with a blush on her face from how calm Crimson is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just get back,\" Clay says as he forgives Crimson. Crimson nods and looks at Sakata. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to go partner,\" Crimson says, Sakata nods and Crimson returns Salata to his ball. Crimson starts to leave until he heard a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Sayuri! I'll try my best to help out and try to repair my bonds, \" The tiny orange hair woman says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you Sayuri. I hope we can become good friends,\" Crimson says as he leaves. Crimson went back to his hiding place and waits for the PWT to begin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay is glad that Crimson helped to get Sayuri to talk but Clay was surprise to see that Crimson talked more then he usually would. But Clay shakes that and goes back to talking to Sayuri. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Honestly I would,\" Sayuri said.  Clay sighed.  She seemed honest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know why they built the shrinking device?\" Clay asked.  Sayuri looked at him with some disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You.  You gym leaders and the Elite Four and Champion.   If they could remove you from play, the defenses of Unova would crumble,\" Sayuri said.  Clay nodded.  He recalled fighting with the others against the Sages two years ago.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes sense.  It would also make stealing easier from a five inch person,\" Clay said.  Sayuri nodded.  \"Speaking of stolen, that Watchdog.\"  Sayuri looked up and then down.  She nodded slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay opened the door and held out a giant hand.

He looked at her.  \"He also fought against Ghetsis two years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He did?  How did he survive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the bonds with his friends.  He didn't waiver from his convictions.  Could be a stubborn guy but has a good heart,\" Clay said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so different from you,\" Driftveil Joy said from the counter.  She picked up the phone and dialed a number.  Sayuri laughed and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you help me with something?\" Sayuri asked Clay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Depends on the request,\" Clay said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you help me catch a Pokemon?  I want to do more than sit around,\" Sayuri said.  Maybe.  Maybe if she could build her own bonds with her own Pokemon, she would become who she wanted to be those years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I can do that,\" Clay said.  \"Driftweil drawbridge has Duckletts on it.  Route 6 has a larger selection.  But Clay Tunnel is not stable at the moment.\"  Sayuri nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoura laid his large body next to Rosa and fell asleep.  \"So, where is N?\" Bianca asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.

Clay sets Sayui down as she looks down the bridge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I brought you where you wanted,\" Clay says as Sayui looks up at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for this,\" Sayui says with a smile and looks on the bridge to see a Ducklett not so far from the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Here you go,\" Clay says as he hands Sayui some tiny pokeballs. Sayui wonders how Clay could have gotten such a small pokeballs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some how they were able to shrink some items to help the other trainers that were shrunk. Clay explains to Sayui about the ball, Sayui nods and Clay continues to talk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you don't have a pokemon on you, you can borrow Palpitoad for a little bit,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSayui nods as Clay throws a pokeball and Palpitoad comes out of the ball. The water ground pokemon looks up to his trainer waiting for his order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Palpitoad, will you help Sayui battle with that Ducklett over there?\" Clay asks his pokemon. Palpitoad nods and gets ready to fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now show me what you can do,\" Clay says to Sayui, the tiny women nods and turns to face the Ducklett. Clay quickly explains what moves that Palpitoad knows before Ducklett took notice the group and then went into a battle position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Palpitoad use Supersonic,\" Sayui says as the Palpitoad listens and generates odd sound waves from its body towards Ducklett. The Ducklett gets confuse and tries to attack Palpitoad. But sadly Ducklett hits herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Use Round,\" Sayui says as Palpitoad closes it's eyes and starts to sing. The song is able to hurt Ducklett. Ducklett tries to attack again but hurts herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I better catch her before she hurts herself any more,\" Sayui thought as takes one of the pokeballs that Clay gave her and throws it at Ducklett. The ball hits Ducklett and sucks her in into the ball. Clay and Sayui watch the ball move around until there is a ding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job. Now go meet your new partner,\" Clay says to Sayui. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSayui nods and goes over to where the pokeball is and picks it up. Sayui lets Ducklett out of her ball, Sayui is a bit scared seeing the giant duck and wonders what the duck will do. Ducklett looks down to see it's trainer, the blue duck then coos happily and starts to it's head on her tiny body. Sayui is surprise at first but then starts to pet Ducklett.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like you too girl,\" Sayui says with a smile on her face. Clay grins a bit at the sight and turns to Palpitoad and back to Sayui.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two did a good job,\" Clay says as he turns a happy Palpitoad back to its ball. Sayui turns to face Clay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. But your Palpitoad did most of the work,\" Sayui explains as Ducklett looks at Clay as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now give your self some credit. You took your first step on become a better person,\" Clay explains as Sayui nods as she looks at Ducklett.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ducklett.... I hope we can become good friends,\" Sayui says with a smile. Ducklett let's out a happy coo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's time for me to return to the gym. Come along Sayui,\" Clay says as he turns around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... I'll go back to Center,\" Sayui says as she gets on Ducklett. The Ducklett then walks next to Clay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. You'll come with me.

It looked up at him happily.  He pulled out a stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to become a bit stronger?\"  Eevee nodded and let the stone touch him.  He glowed and became larger.  Vaporeon cried out in joy.  They started walking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, maybe when we're done, we can trade your Onix with a metal coat on it for my Bouldore and then trade back,\" Nate said from Servines back.  Hugh nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea.  Why don't you battle first?\" Hugh said as they approached the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose who were just observing stayed above to watch on a screen,  Nate, Hugh, and Rosa walked down the path and through the challenges of the trainers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Nate.  I know you can win,\" Roxie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if I should have traded him another Pokemon.  Wobbles would have been a great help,\" Yancy said.  Roxie looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wobbles?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Wobbeffut,\" Yancy said.  Roxie nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really did travel a lot,\" Roxie noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two tinies and one half-sized teen made it to the final platform.  Sitting on a table was the plasma grunt from before with a ducklett next to her.  \"You!\" Hugh called out.  Sayuri looked back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Sayuri has left Team Plasma.  I hope some good battles against you can show her the true bonds that can develop with one's Pokemon,\" Clay said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did you steal that Ducklett from?\" Hugh demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No where.  I caught it with Clay's help,\" Sayuri said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get started,\" Clay injected.  \"Who is first?\"  Nate stepped forward.  He got off Servine and smiled eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe battles were intense.  Against Krokodile, Servine won easily waited for the next fight.  Against Sandslash, Servine suffered from Sanslash's Fury Cutter and Nate brought him back.  Pinsir came out and looked at the enemy.  He used Focus energy while enduring a Bulldoze attack and struck quick with Brick Break, knocking Sandslash back hard.  Pinsir celebrated and seemed tobuff up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gonna get intense,\" Clay said with a smirk as Excadrill came out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Sayuri wondered.  Pinsir rushed in once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Revenge, Pinsir!\" Nate called out.  Pinsir glanced back but waited as Excadrill used Slash.  The second he was hit, Pinsir delivered a powerful response and knocked Excadrill out.  Pinsir celebrated happily.  Clay returned and pulled out a badge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good work,\" he said.  Nate accepted the badge and Clay went to a healing Machine.  \"Next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHugh took a breath and stepped forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Clay led with Krokodile.  Pignite went out first and struck hard with Arm Thrust.  The sand crocodile summoned Sand Tomb but Pignite was affected but hit Krokodile and won with several strikes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Sandslash about to come out, Hugh brought Pignite back and set forth Onix.  Onix used Curse to gain defensive and offensive strength at the cost of some speed and endured the Bulldoze attack.  Using it once more, Onix was sluggish  but easily handled the second attack.  Tossing a Super Potion on it, Onix was revitalized and used tackle on Sandslash.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it!\" Hugh called out happily.  Sandslash unleased another Bulldoze and Onix endured it.  With another Super Potion to help it, Onix struck Sandslash and won.  He roared with pleasure and glowed a little.  Hugh checked his Pokedex and smiled.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcadrill came out once more.  \"Dragonbreath!\" Hugh called out.  A stream of blue-white flame flew out and hit Excadrill as it came at Onix with a Bulldoze.  Onix fell back.  \"Thanks buddy.  You did a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A dragon move against a part steel type wasn't very smart,\" Clay said as Hugh retrieved his Onix.  BeforExcadrill froze up and Hugh smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got what I wanted.  Now Vaporeon!\"  The blue pokemon came out and glared at Excadrill.  \"Let's continue Onix work!\"  His water pokemon cried out in agreement.  \"Water Pulse!\"  The paralyzed Excadrill took it and began to wobble around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Use bulldoze!\" Clay yelled.  But his strongest Pokemon hit itself with a claw.  \"You confused him.\"  Clay smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Water Pulse again!\" Hugh said.  another torrent of water let loose and struck Excadrill.  Once again, it injured itself.  Wobbling on both feet, a third Water Pulse took it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good.  You used what you had well,\" Clay said with a smile.  \"Come here.\"  Vaproeon and Hugh walked forward and accepted the badge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Hugh said as he knelt to hug Vaproeon.  Rosa smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn,\" she said.</span></div></div>",

Bianca reached out and pet the blue duck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just caught her?\" Bianca asked.  Sayuri nodded.  \"I have a good read on how close Pokemon become with their trainers.

Now he had power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid he want to surrender it so easily?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHugh looked down to the first floor of the Center where Sayuri and her Ducklett were being looked at by the Joys and Bianca.  He and Nate were before the trade machine and set the balls in the machine. The names <i>Onix</i> and <i>Boldore</i> were on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's hoping you don't end up shrunk from this,\" Nate said.  Hugh nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed,\" he said before hitting the button.  The balls glowed and rolled into the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.

It looked at Rosa and licked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Minccino certainly loves you,\" Bianca said.  Rosa shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on boy,\" Rosa said.  Minccino tilted its head and became blurred.  Zoura appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A zoura.  That's rare,\" Sayuri said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It belonged to N,\" Bianca said.

Both glowed and shook.  The register names changed to <i>Gigalath</i> and <i>Steelix</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's trade back now,\" Hugh said.  Nate nodded and Hugh pressed the button.

The middle age man then puts the pencil and note book on a table and starts to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I need some fresh air. I'll be right back,\" Pop Roxie says as he exits the center. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYancy turns around about to say something to Roxie but notice the Rocker girl had a regretful look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It might be better they get some time alone before meeting up again,\" Yancy thought as she starts to think of her own family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n__<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop Roxie wonders through the city market trying to find a drink to help him calm down, luckily he finds a place selling Moo Moo Milk. When he gets closer he sees a person in a black top hat with red ribbed silk, white domino mask covers the top of his face, a crimson scarf that covers bottom half of his face, wearing scarlet cape and under that a black suit with a black tie, and black loafers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop Roxie is shock at seeing the person in that costume. The costume person gets a bottle of milk and starts to leave. Before the costume person can leave Pop Roxie calls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey wait up Crimson!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe person stops and turns to face Pop Roxie. After a few minutes Pop Roxie speaks up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's not much trouble could I hang out with you?\" Pop Roxie hoping that he could have a chat with Crimson. Crimson nods and Pop Roxie smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Thank you. Um could you wait a minute? I need to get a drink first,\" Crimson nods again and Pop Roxie gets his drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two get out of the market and find a bench where they can sit together. The two start to drink their bottles of Moo Moo Milk. After a few sips Pop Roxie starts the conservation<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for coming. I know this kind of random, a person asking a strange to hang out,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrimson shakes his head and replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no problem,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He He Thanks,\" Pop Roxie says and Crimson notices that Pop Roxie as a big smile on his face. Pop Roxie then continues to talk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, the reason I wanted to talk to you is because that costume brings back a lot of memories back in my younger days,\" Pop Roxie explains with a sad look on his face. Pop Roxie continues to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even back then I've always had dreams of becoming a movie star. I even got in frights with my own Pa about it since he wanted me to become a sailor just like him. It reminds me that a couple of minutes ago I had a similar fight with my daughter. I didn't have anything against my father or daughter but you know when a person has a dream they stubborn about making it come true.\" Pop Roxie says and takes another sip of his milk. Crimson takes a sip of his own milk and continues to listen to Pop Roxie's story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One day my best friend told me that he wanted to become a directer and he I told him I wanted to become an actor. Both of us were pretty naive back then when it came down to making movies, we got everyone we knew to help us start a movie. First we came up with an idea about a super hero and then from there we just made it up as we went,\" Pop Roxie says a warm smile on his face and takes another drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And during that time I meet some who became very important to me,\" Pop Roxie says with a huge smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you meet your future wife there?\" Crimson takes a guess at who Pop Roxie meet during the making of that movie. Pop Roxie looks at Crimson with a surprise look on his face but then it turn into a blushing smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. You hit the make,\" Pop Roxie takes one more sip of his milk and continues to talk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"During the filming it was love at first sight for me. I would get so nervous around her and I usually would screw up my lines when we were filming. When ever that happen she would always laugh at me, at first I thought that she must think of me as a joke. But then she would come up to me and help me remember my lines. Soon we started to hang out off set and it become more intimate,\" Pop Roxie says with a slight blush on his face but the middle age man continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then we finish the movie and some how we got the big city to show in their theater. But in the end people made fun of it, critics hated it and it became a flop. I got really depress from seeing all of our hard going the drain but my future wife told me that I was wonderful and that good came out of it. When she told me that and when people came to us asking for autograph, I knew without a doubt I wanted to marry her. So I asked her to marry me right then and there and she said yes. I started to work with my father so we could get money for the wedding, soon we got married and had a child soon afterwards. So I figured since I have a family that I want to support and protect I deiced to quite acting all together and work with my father. Three years later my father passes away and I fully take over the business. My wife supported me any way she could and took are our daughter and told her stories about a hero from long ago. But some years later my wife passed away because of a sickness that was going around. You know what she told when she was on deathbed? She told to follow my dream of becoming an actor and take care of our daughter. Can you believe that? She still thought of others even if she was in pain,\" Pop Roxie says and he turns his head to face Crimson. \"It must be boring, listening to this old guy's story....:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's actually interesting,\" Crimson replies in kind voice. Pop Roxie is a little surprise and says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're just special boy, aren't you?\"  Pop Roxie smiles cheerfully and returns back to telling his story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After that I took care of my daughter, and then years later my daughter finally got a job. So I figured that I could go back to being an actor. But then my daughter and I started to get into fights about it. My daughter says I'm troubling everyone with this \"Hobby\". I don't know what to do any more,\" Pop Roxie looks down at the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should tell her how you feel,\" Crimson says as Pop Roxie looks at Crimson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Do you think she'll listen?\" Pop Roxie asks as Crimson nods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop Roxie then gets up and throws his empty milk bottle into the trash can. He looks over to Crimson and says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. You're too kind,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop Roxie then starts walking over to the Center. Crimson watches Pop Roxie leaves and looks up at a clock. Crimson gets a little nervous and throws away his empty milk bottle and puts his right hand into his pocket and walks over to where the PWT building is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I hope so too,\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n____<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop Roxie and his tiny daughter were in a room together. It took a few moments but Pop Roxie is able to tell his story. Roxie is silent for a couple of minutes and says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that\u2019s why you wanted to become a movie star,\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop Roxie nods in agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you ever tell me this?\u201d Roxie asks with a serious tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop Roxie stares at his tiny daughter and replies.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt first I didn\u2019t want tell since you were so young at the time. But when ever I tried we got into a big fight about it and got harder since you were so talented in music and pokemon battles,\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxie knew that he was right, they would always get into fights and she was very young when her talent in pokemon and music started. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.

There\u2019s not many spots left,\u201d Clay says and everyone soon went inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group went over to the registration table to sign up.

Pop Roxie, Joy, Yancy, Bianca, and Sayuri find some open seats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan this crowd is loud. But I can\u2019t blame them. I feel the same,\u201d Pop Roxie says with a smile and throws some punches in the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. But I hope everything goes okay,\u201d Yancy says as she worried about Team Plasma coming in and ruining this event. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have nothing to fear, there seems to a lot of guards around. Plus Clay really wants this to go through, he must figure that people need something to take their minds off the shrinking and Freezing of Unova,\u201d Joy explains and the others nod before they hear the announcer start to talk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWELCOME LADIES AND GENTS TO THE POKEMON WORLD TOURNAMENT! I HOPE YOU ARE READY! IT\u2019S TIME FOR OUR FRIST MATCH! ON THE LEFT IS SOMEONE WHO IS SEARCHING FOR ANSWER! COLRESS!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd cheers the blonde hair scientist comes from the left and enters the arena. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s here!?,\u201d Sayuri thought at seeing Colress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAND ON THE RIGHT IS A CHALLENGER THAT OUR VERY OWN CLAY PICKED OUT! HE DOESN\u201dT SAY MUCH AND GOES BY THE NAME CRIMSON HERO!\u201d The announcer shouts and the crowd cheers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop Roxie and Sayuri both start to smile at hearing the name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dDo you two know him?\u201d Joy asks as Pop Roxie replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course. He\u2019s a true hero.\u201d Sayuri nods in agreement with Pop Roxie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe challenger known as Crimson Hero comes out and everyone sees what he was wearing. Crimson wore a black top hat with red ribbed silk, white domino mask covers the top of his face, a crimson scarf that covers bottom half of his face, wearing scarlet cape and under that a black suit with a black tie, and black loafers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd cheers from seeing Crimson and Pop Roxie and Sayuri join in cheering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy\u2026 what interesting style choice,\u201d Yancy says as she watches the match. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca notice that Crimson\u2019s top hat is now covering his eyes as final gets on stage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs a researcher, it is the truth and the ideal way things should be that I seek. The latent power of Pok\u00e9mon\u2026\u201d Corless begins but Crimson raises his right arm and bends it and puts his hand near the top hat. He puts his index finger on the top of the brim and his thumb under the brim to bring it up so he could see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo more words! Let\u2019s have an Honest Battle!\u201d Crimson says in a deep ragged heroic voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorless wonders if he should be happy or annoyed by this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cALRIGHT! IT\u201dS TIME FOR THE BATTLE TO BEGIN!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrimson and Corless both threw their pokeballs. A Stoutland comes out of Crimson\u2019s pokeball, while a Magneton comes out of Corless\u2019s ball. Stoutland gives out a glare that makes Magneton scared and lowers the attack of the electric steel type pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Stoutland has the ability Intimidate,\u201d Corless says as the blonde takes this in consideration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cConnery use Work Up!\u201d Crimson yells as the normal type pokemon starts to get rouse and his attack and special attack start to increase. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMegneton use Thunder Wave.\u201d Corless says as Megneton launches a weak jolt of electricity at Connery. Connery tires to dodge but the electiricity hits the Stoutland\u2019s legs! Connery soon is having trouble moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPoor Connery,\u201d Yancy says as she sees what is happening to the Stoutland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cConnery return!\u201d Crimson yells as he returns the paralyzed pokemon back to its ball. Corless wonders what pokemon is going to take the next attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow use Thunder Shock!\u201d Corless shouts as Megneton starts to charge its attack as Crimson throws out his next pokemon. It is a Cinccino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe careful Celia,\u201d Crimson says and the Cinccion nods and gets ready for Megneton\u2019s attack. Megneton shoots out a jolt of electricity into the sky and then the jolt is heading down towards Celia. Celia tries to doge but Thunder Shock is able to hit the normal pokemon. After getting shock Celia gets up and is barely standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is bad. It doesn\u2019t look like Celia is going to survive the next attack,\u201d Joy says as she watches the match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Crowd grows worried and stays in silence waiting for what will happen next. Corless wonders too as Crimson gives out his next order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCelia use Bullet Seed. Crimson says as Celia breathes in and then starts to shoot out multiple seeds at Megneton. The first wave hit Megneton and electric steel pokemon screech in pain. The second wave came and hit Megneton again, Corless was surprise to see the Cinccion know Bullet Seed but shakes his head as he remembers that Bullet Seed should probably stop right about now. A third wave went and hit Megneton then a fourth wave hit Megneton and it is a critical hit. Corless became worry as he saw that Megneton is very weak after so many hits from Bullet Seed. Then the final wave of seeds went out and hit Megneton! Megneton slowly went to the ground faints. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd starts to cheer for Crimson\u2019s victory as Corless returns the fainted Megneton back to its ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou put a lot of trust in that Cinccion? Did you really believe that Cinccion would be Megneton?\u201d Corless asks he gets his next pokemon readey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course! I trust my partners with my life and they trust me their lives. With these bonds gives us true strength!\u201d Crimson shouts in a heroic manner. The crowd to cheers after hearing what Crimson said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat a cheesy line,\u201d Joy thought but smiles at Crimson\u2019s bond with his pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorless nods after listening to Crimson answerer and throws out his next pokemon. It is Elgyem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCelia use sing!\u201d Crimson says and the Cinccion starts to sing a soothing lullaby to Elgyem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cElgyem use Psybeam!\u201d Corless says as Elgyem ignores the singing and lets out a peculiar ray at Celia. The beam hits Celia, after trying to stay up Celia but ends up falling and faints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd on Corles starts to cheer as Crimson returns Celia back to her ball. Crimson under his breath, without any one realizing it whispers to the ball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards Crimson puts Celia\u2019s ball back onto his belt and pulls out his third pokeball. Crimson then throws the ball to revel his final team member, a Watchog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGaze use Confuse Ray,\u201d Crimson says at the Watchog exposes a sinister ray from its eyes towards Elgyem. Elgyem starts to feel confuse and tries to stay focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cElgyem use Psybeam once more!\u201d Corless says as he hopes that Elgyem can get in an attack. Luckily for Corless Elgyem is able to shoot out another Psybeam and it hits the Watchog. Gaze is still able to stand after the attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGaze use Bite,\u201d Crimson says and the Watchog runs up to the Psychic and attacks it by biting it and running back to its battle position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUsy Psybeam again,\u201d Corless says as Elgyem tries to attack but hurt itself instead. In the next turn Gaze bites again and finishes off Elgyem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd cheers as Corless reaches for his final pokemon. Corless throws the pokeball and it\u2019s a Klink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGaze use Confuse Ray again,\u201d Crimson says as the Watchog exposes another Sinister ray from its eyes to Klink. Klink gets hit and is now Confuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKlink use Thunder Shock!\u201d Corless says as the Gear Pokemon starts to charge electricity. A jolt of electricity shoots from Kink into the sky. The jolt then quickly falls to the earth and hits Gaze. Gaze falls over after the attack is finish. The Crowd cheers again, as Crimson put Gaze back to his ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for your hard work,\u201d Crimson whispers to Gaze\u2019s ball with out any hearing him. Crimson then puts Gaze\u2019s ball back and pull out his final pokeball. Crimson throws the ball and Connery comes out of the ball. Connery is still paralyze from what happen eailer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd cheer again as this is the final battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cConnery use Work up!\u201d Crimson says as Connery to rise his Atttack and Speacial Attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKlink use Thunder Shock!\u201d Corless says as the gear pokemon is able to pull through the confusion and attacks with a jolt of electricity. The attack hits Connery but the normal pokemon is still able to stand tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cConnery use Bite,\u201d Crimson says and despite being paralyzed the Stoutland goes up to Klink and bites the gear pokemon. Klink a bit of Damage from the attack as Connery went back to it\u2019s corner.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKlink use Thunder Shock! Corless yells as Klink tries to attack. But in the end Klink hurts itself in confusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd starts to cheer loudly as it seems the next attack will finish this battle Crimon and Corless both look at each and understood that the next attack will finish this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cConnery use Bite!\u201d Crimson says as the Stoutlands charges at Klink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKlink use Thunder shock!\u201d Corless says as Klink starts to charge for its attack. Klink shoots out the jolt of electricity up in the air. Just as Connery bites into Klink, the jolt of electricity lands on Connery. The entire arena is now covered in smoke.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Winner is... </span></div></div>",

After the smoke clears, Klink is still floating in the air as Connery lies on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWOW! What a match! Looks like Colress is moving on to the next round as Crimson is knocked out of the tournament!\u201d The announcer shouts as the crowd cheers for Colress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrimson and Colress go up to where their pokemon are. Crimson returns Connery back to his ball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for the good fight,\u201d Crimson whispers to Connery as the costume man puts Connery\u2019s ball back on his belt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cBefore you leave, can you answerer this question for me? Do you think bonds bring out a pokemon\u2019s strength?\u201d Colress asks Crimson, the costume man answers the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dI think you answerer that question with that last attack,\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nColress is a bit shock to hear that answerer but then starts to chuckle. Sayuri is shock to hear Colress chuckle in a good manner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose I did put my trust in Klink during that final move,\u201d Colress says as he looks over to Klink with a small grin on his face. Klink sees this and smiles and goes over to his trainer and starts to make happy sounds. Colress nods as he returns Klink back to its ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrimson and Colress turn around walk off the arena, Colress took a quick look at Crimson before his sight on the exit of the arena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrimson\u2026.. I hope we are able to fight again,\u201d Colress thought as he walks through the exit. Crimson also went the exit at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay. We\u2019ll take a little break to clean up the arena! The next match will begin in thirty minutes!\u201d  The announcer yells. Pop Roxie and Sayuri were sad that Crismon lost but were happy that Crimson is a good sport. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca was in deep thought through out the match. Bianca then pulls out a pokeball and gets her Stoutland out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBianica where are you going?\u201d Joy asks as the tiny blonde gets on the normal type pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just need to check up on something. I\u2019ll be right back,\u201d Bianica replies and whispers into Stoutland\u2019s ear. The Stoutland nods and starts to move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder what is that Bianica wants to check up on?\u201d Joy thought.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Luckily for Bianca she finds the resting room for Crimson. With Stoutland\u2019s help, the tiny woman is able to reach the nod of the door and opens it a little. Carefuly Bianca and Stoutland look through the opening of the door. Bianca is surprise to see that Cheren is in the room and also that Crimson did not have his top hat, the white domino mask is on a desk in front and the crimson scarf is under his chin. Bianca also notices that the pokemon that Crimson used during the fight are out of their balls and they are fully healed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry that you lost. These guys are still getting use battling,\u201d Cheren says to the unmask Crimson. Crimson shakes his head and bends over to the three pokemon infront of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey did great with a trainer they barely knew,\u201d The unmask Crimson says in a calm sounding voice instead of his deep ragged heroic voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s just like you. It feels like three years ago,\u201d Cheren says with a warm smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany thoughts went though Bianca\u2019s mind as she watch the scene. Memories of first journey come into head. Bianca slowly realizes who Crimson is. Bianca slowly opens her mouth and asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTouya?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unmask Crimson and Cheren heard Bianca and both turn around to see the tiny Bianca on her Stoutland. Bianca smiles as she sees that Crimson is in fact her friend Touya. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya is an old friend. Touya had come to Nuvema Town to stay for the year since his parent\u2019s were always traveling around because of their jobs. Touko\u2019s parents took him in since Touya\u2019s family and Touko\u2019s family are close friends. Touko parents decided that Touya would go on a pokemon journey along with Touko, Cheren and I. During that year Touya went on a journey and during it Touko and he became the hero\u2019s of ideals. But sadly Touya had to leave when his year in Unova end. Though Touya always sent letters to her and his other friends it\u2019s nice to see him person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca get a good look of Touya notice that his eyes still peeked out of the fringe of his hair, his normal facial expression make him look like he is set in half-glare. Touya even still retained his look of a wild guy with a bad attitude. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw the shock expression on Touya and Cheren\u2019s faces. Touya is able return back to his normal look as Cheren says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBianca! Quick get inside before any one finds out who Crimson is,\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca nods as Touya opens the door a little bit while still standing behind it. Bianca and Stoutland quickly come in and Touya shouts the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Bianca and Stoutland got comfy in the room, the tiny lady felt strange as she has to look up at Touya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you got shrunk as well. Was it the same guy who shrunk Virbank\u2019s gym leader?\u201d Cheren asks and stops Bianca\u2019s thought of looking at the giant Touya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. I managed to get away though he still got me,\u201d Bianca says with a sad expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad that you\u2019re safe,\u201d Touya says as he looks at the tiny women with a warm smile. Bianca smiles at the brown hair giant. Bianca thought that Touya always knew what to say to cheer someone up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Touya. But if I could ask, why did you wear those clothes?\u201d Bianca asks her old friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can explain that one,\u201d Cheren replies for Touya. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dIt all started when\u2026..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n__<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was two days ago and Cheren is in Driftveil City because Clay had just call him for something. It is in the middle of the night and Cheren is starting to irritated from waiting for Clay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat does he want to talk about even though he could have just said it during our call,\u201d Cheren though as he tries to stay calm while he stands around Clay\u2019s mansion door. Cheren then hears a bird up in the sky, Cheren looks up to see a Braviary flying in the sky and someone is riding it. Cheren is surprise to see someone flying in the middle of the night and watches the Braviary on the ground. Cheren goes where the person and Braviary are to see who they are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis could be a Team Plasma grunt. I better be careful,\u201d Cheren though as he holds on a pokeball.  When the normal type gym leader gets a better look of the pair he knows the person who rode Braviary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTouya!\u201d Cheren says after getting a better look of the person who rode Braviay. It is indeed Touya. Touya did not have his hat on, he still had his blue hood from two years ago on and wore a shirt under the jacket, black pants and the same boots that he wore two years ago along with the same bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s been awhile since I last saw you,\u201d Cheren says as he was happy to see his friend again after so long.  Touya nods as the two heard a door open, the two young men turn to see Clay standing near his door steps. Clay has a surprise look on his face to see Touya and Cheren standing there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are just standing here for you. Come on in,\u201d Clay says as Touya and Cheren nod and the two go inside Clay\u2019s mansion. Touya and Cheren both sit down on a couch. Clay let Touya to take out his pokemon. Touya has a Samurott named Sakata, a Braviay named Brave, a Eelektross named Eelek, a Lilligant named Lily, a Scrafty named Scraf, and a Reuniclus named Reu. Touya\u2019s team took a rest along side Clay\u2019s team. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m surprise to see you back here. What brought you back?\u201d Clay asks Touya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI heard rumors about Plasma. And that Unova is starting to freeze,\u201d Touya explains in serious manner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you haven\u2019t heard about the shrinking device?\u201d Cheren asks as Touya <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya just looks at Cheren with a confuse look on his face. From this Cheren concludes that Touya didn\u2019t of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll talk about that later. The reason I called you here Cheren is for you to take part in the Pokemon World Tournament,\u201d Clay says as Cheren looks at Clay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not doing it Clay. Besides we should be thinking of a way to beat Team Plasma,\u201d Cheren says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know that. But the people of Unova need some cheering up. I think this Tourment will take their minds off the shrinking and the freezing of Unova,\u201d Clay replies to Cheren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay and Cheren start to picker until Touya says nonchalantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll sign up for the tournament and Cheren can go around and look for Team Plasma\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay and Cheren look Touya and then both agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dThat sounds good but we don\u2019t want you out in the open. It would be too dangerous. Plus we don\u2019t want anyone to get in your way,\u201d Cheren says his worries about the plan. Even if the majority people believed that there is just one hero ideals, most would pick Touko. But there seem be some to think that Touya is the only hero and some think that both of them are heroes of ideals or some think neither of them are. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat could be problem\u2026 I think I have a solution,\u201d Clay says as he gets up and goes into a different room. Touya and Cheren wait for Clay to come back with a box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI bought out some old movie studio. Luckly they had some costumes and I think this will fit ya real well,\u201d Clay says as he pulls out the costume and shows it them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey wait isn\u2019t that from that old movie Crimson Hero?\u201d Cheren asks as Clay nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dYep. I got lucky and found this beauty in storage. I\u2019m surprise that no one tried to take and make a quick buck off it,\u201d Clay says as he thought the Crimson Hero was quite good despite the hamness of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think that Touya can really fool people?\u201d Cheren asks as Touya gets up. Clay gives Touya the top hat, white domino mask and crimson scarf. Touya puts them on and says in a deep ragged heroic voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeware evil doers the Crimson Hero will bring justice to all those hurt others!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay and Cheren stare at Touya and were surprise at how much he sound liked the man who played Crimson in the movie. They knew they could go with this plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n__<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s how it went. Then Touya and I switch pokemon before he went against that Corless person. But it looks like Touya didn\u2019t last long,\u201d Cheren explains as Bianca nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you have your team back then?\u201d Bianca asks Touya and Touya nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dSince you lost, why not join me in guarding and look for Plasma the rest of the Tournament? Keep your costume on as well not to attract any attention,\u201d Cheren says as Touya nods with the plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you plan to do Bianca?\u201d Cheren asks the tiny women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dI would like to join you two on this job,\u201d Bianca says with determine eyes. Cheren is about to inject but Touya says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright. The more the merrier as they say,\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheren looks at Touya and back to Bianca. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dOkay. So Bianca who are going with?\u201d Cheren asks ready for either answerer.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll go with Touya,\u201d Bianca replies as Cheren nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll get going now. Be careful out there you two,\u201d Cheren says as he leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon it was just Touya and Bianica in the room. Bianica felt nervous about alone with Touya and tries to think of something to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dSo do you know where Touko is?\u201d Bianica asks and Touya shakes his head. In truth Touya hasn\u2019t heard from Touko for about two months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay. By the way how did you change your voice back then?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya takes a breath and opens his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dYou would be amazed what you can learn when you travel the world,\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianica is shock to hear her voice to come out of Touya\u2019s mouth. She wonders what else Touya learned during the last two years. <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

People cheered, none louder than Pop Roxie, as she was about to come out.  Some gasps and cries of shock when she was carried out on a plate.  She was set down as the camera zoomed in closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!  Time for a good show!\" she yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AND NOW FOR HER CHALLENGER, A YOUNG WOMAN WHO JUST STARTED OUT NOT TO LONG AGO!  THE AMAZING ROSA!!!!\" cried the announcer.  Cheers from her friends were among the loudest as she too was carried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorless watched both with interest.  Just how would these tiny trainers handle themselves?  It would be most stimulating data.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxie smiled at Rosa.  \"Get ready! I'm gonna knock some sense outta ya!\" Roxie said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think this will be easy,\" Rosa said as she tossed out a tiny ball.  Dewott glared at his opponent.  Koffing was sent out by Roxie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BEGIN\" called the announcer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Koffing!  Smog!\" Roxie called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dodge and use Scary face!\" Rosa replied.  Dewott jumped to the side and glared fiercly.  Koffing shuddered.  \"Now Faint Attack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smokescreen Koff!\" Roxie called out but it was too late.  Dewott rushed in and seemed to vanish.  Roxie blinked in confusion when her Koffing was hit.  His smokescreen missed completely.  How did happen?  Unless . . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxie lifted her arm up.  \"Return Koffing!  Go Whirlipede!\"  Roxie called as the cylindrical bug sat there.  It was struck by another Faint Attack.  The bug growled in pain but Dewott clenched his arm as he didn't look good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Rosa whispered.  Not only was he poisoned but if Roxie saw through the disguise . . .  \"Return!  Go Pansear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bug bite!\" Roxie yelled before the switch happened.  But Whirlipede missed the water type and hit the fire monkey.  The damage was negligible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flame Burst!\" Rosa said.  The powerful fire blast got a critical hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rollout!\" Roxie called, as she hoped this would work.  Her pokemon spun and raced at Pansear but the monkey jumped out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flame burst!\" Rosa said.  The blast hit and Whirlipede fainted.  Roxie glared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go!  Mandibuzz!\" Roxie yelled.  The buzzard came out and glared at her opponent.  \"Use Pluck!\"  The bird soared and swooped down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yawn!\"  Rosa yelled.  Mandibuzz got drowsy but got a critical hit too.  Pansear cried out in pain and flew back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Use it again!\" Roxie called.  Before Pansear was ready, it got hit and fainted.  Mandibuzz landed and put her head under her wings.  She was snoring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa returned Pansear and sent out Dewott once more.  Rosa returned Mandibuzz and sent out Koffing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This seems familiar,\" Rosa said.  Roxie looked over Dewott but couldn't tell if it was poisoned now or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go,\" Roxie said.  \"Use sludge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dodge and use Razor Shell!\" Rosa said.  The shell flew hard and fast, knocking out Koffing.  Roxie growled and sent Mandibuzz back out.  She continued to sleep.  \"Roxie!  Do you concede?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  You think I can't win?\" Roxie asked in a confident tone.  In truth she was worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to hurt your Pok\u00e9mon more than needed,\" Rosa said.  Roxie looked at her sleeping friend.  Who knew if she could wake up in time?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorless watched with interest.  \"Interesting dilemma,\" he muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me Sayuri, what would you do?\" Joy asked.  Sayuri looked over at the large Joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.  I think . . . I think since this is just for fun right now, I would retire,\" Sayuri said.  \"I wouldn't want my Ducklett to be injured in this situation,\"  Joy nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxie clenched her hands.</span></div></div>",

The tiny women kept on taking glances at her giant friend.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s great that Touya is back, it\u2019s been so long since we\u2019ve talked in person.\u201d The tiny blonde thought with a smile but soon the smile turn into a frown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I wish he could visit when there no trouble in Unova. He always gets drag into conflict. I wish he would have a nice relaxing trip when he visits Unova,\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya turns his head to see that the tiny blonde has some troubling thoughts on her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you need to talk, I\u2019m here,\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca snaps out of her thoughts when she heard those words and looks up at the giant. Even with his face cover up, she could still sense Touya\u2019s concern for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo that\u2019s alright. But thank you anyway Touya, you really know how to cheer me up,\u201d Bianca says with a bright smile on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya nods and smiles under his disguised and could feel Bianca\u2019s appreciation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are always nice to be Touya. It brings back memories of when we first started our journey.\u201d Bianca thought as she continues to talk with Touya.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n____________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree years ago<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca runs out of her house as fast as she could. Today was the day she would start her Poke\u2019mon journey It a nice sunny day in spring as she ran to her best friend Touko\u2019s house. The blond greets Touko\u2019s mother as she runs up the stairs. She then gets to Touko\u2019s door and opens it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry that I\u2019m a little late Touko. Sorry Cheren. Sorry\u2026\u2026\u201d Bianca stops and sees there is another person in the room. The extra person is a young man with brown hair that wears a red/white hat that has a black poke\u2019ball in the center of it, a light blue with some dark blue near the top and near the hands and it has a hoodie, a black shirt under the jacket, black pants, and shoes that were mostly red with some black and white sole. But what really got Bianca\u2019s attention is how the young man\u2019s brown eyes look like they were giving her glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout time you showed up,\u201d Cheren says as he cleans his glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCut her some slack. Morning Bianca,\u201d Touko beams with a smile on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning Touko. Um who is this?\u201d The blonde asks as she glances at the extra person in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh him. That\u2019s Touya he\u2019s the son of my parents best friends. He\u2019s staying here in Unova for a year since his parents are to busy working. So parents deiced that he should go on Pokemon journey with us, Also he doesn\u2019t really talk much,\u201d Touko explains as the blond looks at Touya. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca wonders what to say until she saw Touya raise his arm wanting a hand shake and says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca smiles at and shakes Touya\u2019s hand with her own hand. Touya\u2019s face remains neutral though out the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe seems nice. But his expression didn\u2019t really change much,\u201d Bianca thought as the stop their hand shake <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith introductions done let\u2019s pick our Pokemon. Why don\u2019t you go first,\u201d Cheren says as he looks at Touko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Since it was delved here you should get first pick,\u201d Bianca adds with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, Thanks,\u201d Touko says with a smile as she opens the box. There are four balls in the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne for each of us,\u201d Touko smiles as she picks her starter she then turn around to face Touya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey why don\u2019t you go next? Is everyone fine with that?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine with it,\u201d Cheren says as he waits to get his pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s alright. Go ahead Touya,\u201d Bianca says with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya nods and goes over to the box. Touya looks at the pokemon for a couple of seconds and picks his starter. The starter that Touya picks is the pokemon Oshawott.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheren and Bianca then pick their pokemon, after getting hers Bianca then says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEveryone has chosen a Pokemon! ...So that's that! Hey, I know! Let's have a Pokemon battle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Cheren says as he gets readey to battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group then had their Pokemon battle. Bianca took notice that Touya spoke clearly as he gave out his orders and notice a little spark in his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter their battles Touko\u2019s room became a mess. Luckily Touko\u2019s mother wasn\u2019t mad as she said she would clean up the mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, um... We can clean up...\" Bianca starts and then remembers something.<br>\r\n\"Oh! Wait! I've gotta go home first. Thanks for having us over!\" Bianca says as she left Touko\u2019s house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca then went to her home to tell her parents the good news. The blond enter her home and told her parents the news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be a Pokemon trainer! You don\u2019t know how dangerous the world is,\u201d Her father says as he looks at his daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, I'm... I'm a good Trainer who got a Pok\u00e9mon and everything! I can totally go on an adventure!\u201d Bianca yells as she runs out the door with some tears going down her cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca stops in tracks when she sees that Touya is waiting for her outside her house. Touya notice that Bianca is crying a bit. Bianca sees that Touya notice and wipes her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh... It's OK. ...It's fine! I'll be waiting for you in front of the lab, OK?\u201d Bianca says as to avoid talking about what happen in her home. Bianca starts to leave but hers a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you need to talk, I\u2019m here,\u201d <br>\r\nBianca turns her head to see that those words came from Touya. Bianca smiles and can feel Touya\u2019s concern for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you. I think I\u2019ll take you up on that offer one day,\u201d Bianca says with a smile as Touya nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh we better get going,\u201d Bianca adds and soon the two left Bianca\u2019s home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_______________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was the start of our friendship together. You helped me out a lot during that one year. And I guess that\u2019s why I started to fall for you,\u201d Bianca thought as the two continue their look out duty.  <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

There wasn\u2019t really a need to tell Pop Roxie everything just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay Crimson this might seem strange but do you mind if I could try out your costume?\u201d Pop Roxie says as he claps his hands together waiting for answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good time to ask that question Pop Roxie,\u201d Bianca says as the tiny woman is afraid for Touya\u2019s safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on. Pretty please?\u201d Pop Roxie once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya stood in thought for a minute and found his answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay. Let\u2019s go back to room so you can try it on,\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop Roxie shakes hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you very much. I knew you were a good spirt when I first meet you,\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf it\u2019s okay with Crimson, then it\u2019s okay with me,\u201d Bianca says with a smile. She worried that something might go wrong but shook that feeling off and the three went back to Crimson\u2019s room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy is surprise at how well Rosa is doing against Colress and notice that Sayuri\u2019s mood has improve. Joy figures that Sayuri and Colress must have known each other. But why do they know each other and why would Sayuri be afraid of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGO ROSA!\u201d Yancy and Sayuri yell as loud as they could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_______________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya, Bianca and Pop Roxie made it back to Touya\u2019s room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm Bianca do you mind if you stay out here?\u201d Pop Roxie asks with a faint blush on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay. But you have to not look at Crimson while he\u2019s changing. Crimson is a shy person,\u201d Bianca explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay. I wouldn\u2019t look at him,\u201d Pop Roxie says as the men enter the room. Bianca kept watch outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the room the two go to the side to take off their clothes. Touya made sure to get his pokemon out first and put their balls on a near table. While Changing Pop Roxie saw from the corner of his eye that Crimson has a scar on the right of his stomach. Pop Roxie didn\u2019t say anything but thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you do to get something like that?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya still wearing the head parts of the costume as well as blue boxers walks over to Pop Roxie and hands him the rest of the Clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh thank you. Here you can try on my clothes; they might look good on you,\u201d  Pop Roxie says with a smile He switches clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya nodes as he starts to put on Pop Roxie\u2019s Sailor Uniform. The Finish changing as Pop Roxie looks into a mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t have the whole costume on. But still good with this on,\u201d Pop Roxie says as does heroic poses.<br>\r\nTouya smiles at seeing Pop Roxie enjoying being the costume figure he might as give him the rest of it. While Pop Roixe continue to pose, Touya took off the head parts of the costume and put Pop Roxie\u2019s sailor hat on and made sure the hat is covering his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think it would better with the complete collection.\u201d Touya says as he hands the rest of the costume to Pop Roxie. Pop Roxie is stun but smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you very much. This means a lot to me, \u201c <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya nods as Pop Roxie finishes the costume. Pop Roxie takes a breath and says in most heroic voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo more words! Let\u2019s have an Honest Battle!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop Roxie then did a pose and Touya claps for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re too kind,\u201d Pop Roxie says as he blushes under the mask.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Zorua!\" Rosa said.  She grimaced as she returned him.

They then threw the metal balls on the ground and soon large amount of smoke comes out of the balls and soon covers the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d An innocent asks as they try to clear the area in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same people who threw the smoke bombs remove their disguise to reveal those who threw the smoke bombs were Team Plasma.

But I didn\u2019t know they were planning the attack on this building with smoke bombs,\u201d Sayuri replies as Roxie smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if just smoke, I think I know who can help,\u201d Roxie then pulls out a poke\u2019ball and lets out Koffing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Koffing inhale all of the smoke!\u201d Roxie says as Koffing nods and starts to suck up the smoke. Koffing sucks so hard the smoke filled room soon became visible again in a matter of seconds. The crowd of innocents saw some Team Plasma near exits of the room and saw they had poke\u2019balls in their hands and bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey they took my poke\u2019mon!\u201d A little girl shouts as she tries to find her poke\u2019ball that held her pokemon. Sayuri saw the little girl is on the verge of crying, The exmember of Plasma felt shame at see the sight, as she once did the same to others as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright men it\u2019s time to get out of here!\u201d A grunt yells and the others agree. The Team Plasma grunts all ran out the four exits of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPLASMA! GET BACK HERE!\u201d Hugh yells with fury in his voice as he starts to chase a group of grunts that went through the east Exit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHugh! Wait up, Servine we have to follow Hugh,\u201d Nate says and Serine nods. Nate then gets on Servine and the two follow the half size young man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to admit, I can\u2019t just stand around either. I\u2019m going after a couple of grunts myself,\u201d Rosa says as she sends out her Minccino out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll join you. I can\u2019t let them take any more Poke\u2019mon,\u201d Roxie says as she gets on her Koffing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright. Let\u2019s go Minccino and Roxie!\u201d Rosa says as she gets on Minccino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe careful you two!\u201d Yancy says as Roxie and Rosa nod and the two shrunkies both run after the group of grunts that went through the North exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have to try to get everyone to calm done,\u201d Joy says as she starts to get up. But stops when she sees that Some Team Plasma grunts coming from the west exit. It seem like the grunts were running from something, that something is someone who is wearing the Crimson Hero Costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s Crimson!\u201d Sayuri shouts happily as she sees the Costume Hero. Joy and Yancy notice that Pop Roxie wearing a Gliscor mask and Bianca riding her Stoutland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad to see you two safe,\u201d Yancy says as with a smile. Joy notice that something is a bit off with Pop Roxie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPop Roxie what are you doing?\u201d Joy asks the strange looking to her Pop Roxie. Touya turns his head to see the haft size nurse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just gonna help Crimson here,\u201d Touya replies in Pop Roxie voice. Pop Roxie and Bianca were surprise that Touya is able to mimic Pop Roxie\u2019s so well after just meeting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne the grunts in Plasma group saw his chance. He threw a poke\u2019ball that lets out a Liepard and both charge at Touya. Touya saw the attack coming from the corner of his eye, he then pulls out a poke\u2019ball and sends out a Scrafty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cScraf use Focus Punch,\u201d Touya says as the Scrafty closes his eyes and takes a fighting stance with one hand taking a form of a fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWay to slow! Liepard use Hone Claws!\u201d The grunt yells as the Liepard attacks Scraf while The grunt attacks Touya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Grunt throws a punch with his right arm, but Touya is able to doge that attack and grabs the grunt\u2019s right hand and then elbows the grunt with his free arm. The grunt falls down after being hit. The Leipard attack gets doge by Scarf and the dark fighting type pokemon hits the Leipard with its fist and the normal type gets knock out. Sayuri and Yance were surprise to see that Pop Roxie able to do and have a Poke\u2019mon, Joy knew something is going on but figures she would be able to talk about it later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeam Plasma became worry after see what the sailor did their comrade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to get away with that!\u201d A male grunt says as he starts to pull out a poke\u2019ball but Pop Roxie stops him by punching the grunt in the gut with this right hand and then grabing the grunt and throwing him across the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way we\u2019re letting you get away with this evil act criminals!\u201d Pop Roxie yells in heroic manner, he thought he should be out of breath but his adrenaline rush kept ready to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. I\u2019m not sitting by either,\u201d Bianca says as pulls out a poke\u2019ball and let\u2019s out her Unfezant, ready to battle. Yancy, Joy and Sayuri agree and they secretly let a poke\u2019mon out that they own to guard the remain the exits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have to get out of here!\u201d A Plasma grunt says as the others agree, the group look around to find an exit put saw that the remaining exits were being guarded by a Ursaring, Muk, Ducklett and Darmanitan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is not looking good\u2026.\u201d A grunt thought as he looks at their situation. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrant figure that a flying poke\u2019mon would do better than a surfing poke\u2019mon. So Grants picks a poke\u2019mon called a Tranquil, now he just needs to find right time to run away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheren while on patrol in the south part of the building, saw that Team Plasma grunts were running around. Cheren then chases after them until they come out of the building. Cheren notices that the grunts are getting on a boat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that\u2019s what they\u2019re using as a base,\u201d Cheren thought as he looks at the boat, Cherne didn\u2019t have any more time to think as he hears voices behind him. The young gym leader turns around to see Hugh, Nate, Rosa and Roxie coming out of different exits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere did they go? Oh, Rosa and Roxie followed us,\u201d Hugh says as he sees the two shrunken women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe were chasing some grunts,\u201d Rosa explains as Roxie notice Cheren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what brings you around here Cheren?\u201d Roxie asks as the shrunken humans turn around to see the young gym leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was on portal duty for the tournament, I saw some Plasma grunts and followed them and saw they were getting on the boat over there\u201d Cheren explains as he points to the boat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s fight them head on!\u201d Hugh says as he ran towards the boat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJeeze we better follow him,\u201d Nate says as the others agree. Nate, Cheren, Roxie and Rosa then chase after Hugh to join him on getting on the boat. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Stop him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheren saw the device and guessed it could be the shrinking device.  Even if it wasn't, it was something Plasma wanted badly and that was reason enough to get it.    He shoved through the wall of grunts as a Triad member was moving close to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!  I won't become some nobody again!\"  Grant yelled.

Scraf, Unfezent, Ursaring, Muk, Ducklett and Darmanitan were able to take out any Poke\u2019mon that the grunts used and Touya and Pop Roxie to care of the grunts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that\u2019s taken care of let\u2019s get everyone to safe place and return any Poke\u2019mon they have to their owners here,\u201d Joy says and the others agree with the plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop Roxie Keep an eye on the grunts as Joy and Secirity return the fresh stolen Poke\u2019mon back to their owners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSayuri is happy she is happy to help as she sees the little girl from earlier gets her Poke\u2019mon back goes over to the sailor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for getting out Poke\u2019mon back Mister,\u201d The little girl says with a smile. Touya looks at the little girl and stays quite for a bit and answers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really should thank Crimson, he\u2019s the reason we were able to stop them,\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little girl nods and yells at the mask hero in red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for saving my Poke\u2019mon and everyone else!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop Roxie blush a bit under his mask and replies back without turning around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. That\u2019s what a hero does,\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl smiles and returns back to her parents. Colress who remain silent for quite some time finally spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think it would be better you tie those grunts then keeping Crimson watching them.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. I think we should tie them up first,\u201d Yancy agreeing with Colress even though it felt strange to agree with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll get some rope,\u201d A security person says as they ran out to get some rope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya went over to a grunt and kneels down near the grunt. Touya then went through his bag, everyone thought he was getting rope out of his bag but what he brought out is a first aid kit. Touya then open the kit and starts to bandage up the grunt that he hurt earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing that? They tried to steal our Poke\u2019mon and now your fixing them up. Why are you helping theme?\u201d A woman in the crowd asks the sailor.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same grunt that Touya wonder about the same thing as the sailor patches him up. Touya after finishing the bandages on the grunt in front of him, and moves to the grunt and answers the women question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you need a reason to help someone?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman is caught off guard from Touya\u2019s answer and Pop Roxie stairs the young man help the injured grunts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat guy is too kind. He would even help the people who tried to attack him and steal others Poke\u2019mon,\u201d Pop Roxie thought as watches the young man help patch up the injured grunts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat just like Touya, always trying to help someone,\u201d Bianca thought with a smile as she watch Touya patch up more grunts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt about it. That\u2019s not Pop Roxie, whoever it is able to bandage up the grunts really,\u201d Joy though as she saw how of a job that the sailor did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya goes over to last grunt who is still injured. The grunt looks at the sailor disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou bastard, you\u2019re just doing this out of pity for us. Well I\u2019m not having it!\u201d The grunt says as he punches Touya in the face. Touya is unable to doge the attack but take it on. The mask and hat that Touya wore feel off him, luckily Touya is about to catch both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-it\u2019s you! One of the bastards that ruin out plans years ago!\u201d The grunt shouts as everyone around looks at sceen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the Heroes of ideals,\u201d A man says as he gets a clear look at Touya\u2019s face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSayuri froze in shock at seeing Touya. This is the same man who helped destroy Team Plasma plan two years ago. The tiny hair orange hair women knew she would have to get over hatred over the two heroes of ideals but figure she would have time to accept her peace with them. But she didn\u2019t count on one of them being here right now! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat plan didn\u2019t last long,\u201d Bianca says with a sigh and starts to worry for Touya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou knew that he was here Miss Bianca?\u201d Yancy asks and the other tiny women nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat explains why Pop Roxie would know first aid,\u201d Joy says as she watches the scene in front here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nColress watches as he figures that Touya must have been Crimson earlier when they fought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInteresting. So you were the person I fought earlier. You must have switch clothes with that Sailor that is with shrunken humans.\u201d Colress thought as he watches what Touya would do now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya says nothing as he puts the mask and hat down some where safe and opens the first aid kit once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell are you doing? I don\u2019t want your help! Get out of my face!\u201d The grunt yells as he throws another punch. Touya catches the fist this time and looks to see that there are cuts and starts to bandage it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other grunts are surprise that the man they hated for so long would still help them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod Danm it! Leave me alone!\u201d The Grunt yells as he tries to use his free hand to hit Touya again. But what surprise everyone is that the Red Costume Crimson is the one who stops the fist from hitting Touya again. Touya is surprise to see Pop Roxie standing right next him. Everyone is surprise as well and even Colress seems a bit surprise from the actions of the old sailor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing!?\u201d Pop Roxie yells as he holds the Grunt\u2019s fist firm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat does it look to you! I\u2019m trying to hit this good for nothing again!\u201d The Grunt replies with a smug look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop Roxie then took of his mask with his free hand and looks the grunt right in eyes. Sayuri is shock to see that Pop Roxie is wearing the Crimson costume and that meant that Touya is one who was wearing it earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis good for nothing is helping you out. He\u2019s still helping even after you suck him one. This guy shows kindness to even his enemies! Do you think your Team Plasma buddies would come back for you! Would they come back help you out like this Good for nothing is doing?\u201d Pop Roxie asks as the Grunt and the rest of the grunts were shock to hear something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right. I don\u2019t think any of them would come back for me\u2026..\u201d The grunt says to Pop Roxie and looks at Touya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-you know we\u2019re not going to forget your kindness. Even if it takes some time I hope all of you can forgive us one day,\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya nods and finishes bandaging the last grunt. The Secirity person came back with the rope and ties the grunts up and waits for the police to come to pick them up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you very much mister hero,\u201d Touya says to Pop Roxie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-It\u2019s no problem. I\u2019m glad I was able to help you out. You would have done the same for me,\u201d Pop Roxie replies as he looks at the young man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorless is very surprise at how Pop Roxie acted and became interested in Touya. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYancy is very surprise that everyone didn\u2019t go up Touya the moment that his mask fell off. The crowd didn\u2019t want to bother Touya and figure they shouldn\u2019t be bugging him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSayuri stay silent as she looks at Touya. Bianca goes over notice that Sayuri is trouble, the tiny blonde figures that Sayuri must still not trust Touya after figuring it out that Touya is Crimson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSayuri about Touya\u2026.\u201d Bianca says as she tries to get close the other tiny women. Sayuri shakes her head not wanting to talk to Bianca about Touya. Touya saw this and says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay Bianca. She has the right to not trust me,\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure? Well if it\u2019s fine with you\u2026.\u201d Bianca says as Sayuri looks at Touya. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow can he be so calm and kind? He really is too kind for his own good. But I that\u2019s what I like about him\u2026\u201d Sayuri thought with a bit of a blush on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya and the shrunken maidens notice that Colress is walking over to them with Pop Roxie behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey leave him alone would you,\u201d Pop Roxie says as he doesn\u2019t trust Colress at all. The scientist ignores Pop Roxie and starts to talk to Touya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are become interesting Half Hero of ideals. Not only were you able to bring out potential of those Poke\u2019mon you used to fight me before. You were able to bring out this old sailor potential as well,\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya and Bianca take notice that Sayuri seem scared of Colress, figuring that they must know each other from somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry to intrude. But I must ask to leave,\u201d Joy says as goes over to Colress as the half size nurse notice Sayuri scared expresstion. Colress really wanted to talk more to Touya but figures he should go. But before he went he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTouya why do you think I\u2019m here?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca, Pop Roxie, Joy and Sayuri wonder what Touya\u2019s answer would be. Touya looks at Colress and says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s for science right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColress looks at Touya and smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCorrect. Thank you for answering my question. Good day,\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nColress starts to walk away and thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo wonder why he wants you dead Touya along with the other one. You\u2019re very sharp about people and Poke\u2019mon,\u201d <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Sensing what was happening, the Triad tried to pull Cheren before himself to take the brunt of the blast.  It worked, for the most part because as Cheren did shrink faster, the lack of his height shielding him only gave the Triad a few inches leeway on Cheren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Grant was airborne with his Tranquil flying him away, Cheren was no taller than Nate and the Triad member about twice his height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Nate yelled but sensed a force grabbing him.

We have to get pass them.\u201d Clay thought as he tries to think of a plan. But luck is not on Clay\u2019s side as the reports spot them and ran at the three. Right Lights, cameras and video recorders were now on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMister Clay can we get a live interview with you along with the two behind you?\u201d A news woman asks as she puts a mike in front of Clay. Clay huff pushes the mike away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry but we\u2019re in hurry so if you could please move,\u201d Clays politely asks the news crew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA video camera man moves in closer to get better look on Clay\u2019s face, as he moves in the video camera man trips on the cord and starts to fall. Touya seeing this, on instinct he catches the video camera man before he falls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm thank you,\u201d The camera man says as Touya nods and stands the cameraman back up. The Gliscor mask he is wearing starts to fall off again. It seems the grunt who punched him earlier made the strap weaker in the processes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop Roxie and Clay see this happening but can\u2019t do anything to stop it. Luckily before the mask fell on the floor the Camera man who Touya save just a second ago catches the mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh boy your mask almost broke. Here you-\u201cThe cameraman starts but looks to see who is under the mask. The Cameraman is shock to see that It is one of the heroes of ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for saving that. It\u2019s a gift from a friend,\u201d Touya says in a thankful manner as he takes the mask back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe mask is the only thing that concerns you right now!?\u201d Pop Roxie thought as Clay become angry as the news crew start to take pictures and record Touya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSTOP THAT! DESPOSE OF THOSE PICTURES AND VIDEO\u2019S RIGHT NOW!\u201d Clay shouts as the news crew looks at the cowboy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026. We\u2019re live right. We can\u2019t really dispose of them. They on air and on the net\u2026.\u201d A Newsman replies. The news crew turns off their equipment as they see Clay\u2019s anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI SHOULD TAN YOUR HIDES AND GET YOU FIRED FROM YOUR JOBS! YOU JUST PUT HIS LIFE IN DANGER!\u201d Clay shouts as the news crew start to get frighten from Clay\u2019s threats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThings aren\u2019t looking good,\u201d Pop Roxie thought as he watches Clay chew out the news reporters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was an accident, they were just doing their jobs,\u201d Touya says as he remains calm as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay and Pop Roxie couldn\u2019t believe how calm can be right now. Clay snorted as he looks at the news crew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe lucky that this guy is very understanding,\u201d Clay says with anger as he steps and starts to call the news station with his Xtransceiver. Clay looks at Touya and thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow can you be so calm all the time? I\u2019m glad that you\u2019re on our side,\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe news crew is surprise at how Touya is able to forgive them for revealing that he\u2019s in Unova. The news crew start to whisper among themselves and all came to an agreement. A news woman went over to Touya to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello I\u2019m representing the news crew. We are dreadful for what happen here and we want to make it up to you, so we\u2019re going to call our partners\u2019 in the news and tell them not bother you from now on. I hope this makes up for what happen earlier,\u201d <br>\r\nTouya nods back with a smile on his face, the newswomen smiles back and goes back to tell the crew the news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya then goes into the changing room afterwards. Pop Roxie is amaze at how well Touya handle the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrant barely hangs onto the Tranquil as he flies away from Driftveil City. He happily sighs about his escape being successful. He wonders what he would do now as he flies on ward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya comes out of the change room, now wearing a his blue jacket that he wore two years ago, white shirt under the jack, black pants, and the same running shoes that he wore two years ago.  Touya is also carrying Pop Roxie\u2019s sailor suit. Clay and Pop Roxie were outside the room waiting for Touya to come out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you went back to your normal clothes? Well there\u2019s no point in hiding any more since people already got ahold of those videos and pictures. I\u2019m going outside now, I need to check on those five who went near the ships,\u201d Clay says as he leaves the two alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya gives Pop Roxie back his sailor suit back and starts to follow Clay but Pop Roxie stops him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm thank you for your help earlier. I don\u2019t think I would have done those things if wasn\u2019t for you giving me back this costume or the courage. So thank you again,\u201d Pop Roxie says as with a warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya could feel Pop Roxie\u2019s apparition for him. Touya then replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was your own strength.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop Roxie starts to laugh happily at Touya\u2019s words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKid, I think you\u2019re giving me too much credit.\u201d Pop Roxie says with a smile on his face. Pop Roxie then with hand takes of the red scarf that he had on and presents it to Touya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know this isn\u2019t much. But I want you to have this scarf; they say that when you wear a scarf you can become a hero. And you know that the hero never dies,\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya looks at the scarf and smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you. I\u2019ll cherish it,\u201d Touya says as he takes the red scarf. Pop Roxie smiles as he was glad that Touya accepted his gift and his friendship. Touya felt that he made another life time long on the course of his journey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Touya puts the scarf in his bag and the two set out to follow Clay outside. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Stories were exchanged about what the other group did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate, Hugh, and Rosa look to see one of the heroes of ideals. The young man didn\u2019t look heroic and seem to glare at them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya shook his head at his tiny friend as he came around. Luckly it\u2019s been an hour since Cheren shrunk, so he wouldn\u2019t be able to shrink anybody else. Cheren then got into some doll clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what will we do now? If this shrinker has escaped, is he not helping Plasma?\" Bianca asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe. But that doesn't mean we can just trust him,\" Hugh said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which way did he go off to?\" Pop Roxie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He went north,\" Cheren said. Bianca gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Professor Juniper is north! She's going to the Celestial Tower,\" Bianca said. \"We have to go that way right away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can carry you on my Brave,\" Touya suggests, the Brave that Touya spoke of is his Pokemon Bravairy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea,\" Cheren said, \"But not everyone here has Pokemon who can fly and he might stop and take other paths.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if we follow you on the ground then?\" Nate suggested. \"We can come on ground and through Chargestone cave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like a fair idea. The men should be close to finishing the repairs on the bridge,\" Clay said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I have a thought,\" Joy said. \"They want to use the power of a legendary dragon right? What if we had other legendaries to help us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That could work,\" Touya says and starts to think. They could possible wait until the other hero of ideals, Touko to come back with Zekrom, N could even come back here with Reshiram. They could possible go to the other Legendaries that Touko and him captured and release before he left. If they are not able to do those two options Touya figures he would fight what ever Ghetsis is planning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only problem is legendary Pokemon are hard to find,\" Bianca said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite. There's a rumor in the cavern under here lies one,\" Clay said, nodding to one direction. \"Could be worth a look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya notice where Clay is pointing and knew what the cowboy is talking about the Relic Castle. Touya knew what the rumor legendary Poke\u2019mon about to talk until Cheren says.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Okay, so you guys get that legendary. We'll fly ahead to warn others,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya looks around to see that everyone agree with the plan, the one hero of ideals then figures they might as well get more Poke\u2019mon on their side. The tiny orange hair woman is silent for a few minutes and she and her Ducklett go over to Touya. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I go with you?\" Sayuri asks as she looks at the giant. Touya bends his knees to look straight into Sayrui\u2019s eyes. Sayuri blushes but still keeps her eyes straight on Touya. Touya notices that Sayuri\u2019s eyes have a spark in them, wanting to change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, welcome aboard,\" Touya says with nod, Sayuri smiles at Touya agreeing to take her with them. Bianca held in a frown and moves closer too Touya. Clay nods as he would tell the police that someone is watching over Sayrui.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHugh couldn\u2019t believe what he is seeing. How in the world could someone who fight Team Plasma two years ago could so easily accept them. Hugh didn\u2019t know how to feel at the moent but his gut still told him not to trust the tiny ex-plasma. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so some of us can get supplies for the next leg of the journey. Who wants to go into the cave?\" Roxie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go,\" Joy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too,\" Hugh said as he wants to go somewhere to think. Rosa nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll get the supplies,\" Nate said. Yancy stayed near him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Roxie, would you mind staying here? I have something I want to walk with you about,\" her father said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Well, best of luck you guys,\" Roxie said with a smile. Touya nods and releases Brave and Bianca, Sayuri and Cheren put their pokemon back into balls. Touya gets on his large bird friend as Bianca and the others wonder where they will sit. Touya picks up Bianca, Sayuri and Cheren and sits them on his lap. Bianca and Sayuri both blush as they sit on Touya legs while Cheren sits Indian style. Touya looks down at the tiny humans before they left and saw that the women were both red. Bianca and Sayuri notce Touya\u2019s staring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re alright Touya. Don\u2019t worry about us,\u201d Bianca says as Sayrui adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! Let\u2019s get going!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya nods and looks at Brave and nods. The bird pokemon understood what his friend wanted and soon the large bird and its mighty wings took them to the sky.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Bianca normally would not mind if someone joins them but something didn\u2019t quite feel right. Sayuri felt very embarrass as she sits on the giant\u2019s lap and felt weird being Bianca as well, the orange hair women couldn\u2019t put her finger on why. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya notice that Bianca and Sayuri were not talking and wonder what is wrong. Touya starts to think what to say so the two tiny women could start talking. Touya then figure what could bring them together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay Sayuri what are planning on doing after this? Touya asks in a nonchalant way.

It might not be the same as you, but I understand not know what you want to do in your life,\u201d Bianca explains with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you didn\u2019t start out at become a professor at first?\u201d Sayuri asks wanting to know more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep. When I left on my journey along with my friends I didn\u2019t really know what I wanted to do. But along the way I began to figure out what I wanted to do with my life with the help of my travels and the help with my friends,\u201d Bianca explains with a smile.

I hope I can have that energy when this is all over,\u201d Sayuri says as she admire at Bianca\u2019s strength. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do it alone, I\u2019ll help you out.

She spotted a few trainers in their walk but they chose not to battle them, not yet anyway.  They weren't here for that type of training and would need to conserve their strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, just because their human comrades refused, Boldores and Woobats came at them frequently.   Joy used her Zubat and Rosa sent out Dewott as to fight them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen dust clouds formed in their paths, Hugh sent out Steelix and scared away any Onix or drilbur who tried fighting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy kissed her Zubat after one battle and applied a basic potion.  \"At this rate, we won't have many potions left,\" Joy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I don't think it will be too much longer,\" Hugh said.  A dust cloud formed again but no pokemon emerged.  They did find another Red Shard and pocketed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Number six,\" Rosa said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey exited into a south-going chamber where a pristine pool of water lay.  Many basculin watched from below the water's surface.  The tell-tale bobbing tails of the Marill family were visible in the center of the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I had a Pokemon who could surf,\" Joy said softly.  \"I wouldn't mind trying to catching one of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Either would be a good one to have,\" Rosa said.  They turned and walked away from the pool and continued onward into darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we?\" High mused as they walked.  \"I mean on the map.  If we went up right now . . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likely in the ocean,\" Joy said.  \"If this goes to Relic Castle as Clay said, then we would have to bypass a lot of routes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter one tough battle for Joy against a Raticate, her Zubat began to glow and enlarged.  Golbat looked at his trainer and hugged her once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like you too,\" Joy said, before petting the larger bat.  They came to a fork in the road.  Someone had carved into the wall Relic Castle was to the north and so they walked that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSand was noticable on the hard, dry ground as they approached a hole.  It was dark with little light but they entered anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about five minutes of darkness, they emerged into a stone room.  It was perfectly square and obviously very old.  Yanmask and sandiles came at them now, frustrated at these humans coming into their ancient home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHugh's Vaporeon made quick work of them.  They trio continued onward until they came to a north-facing door.  They entered into that chamber and there she stood.  Taller than any of the shrunkies, the red wings with black spots flapped gently as it kept itself aloft.  \"I think it's female,\" Joy said.  \"The colors aren't as vibrant as they are in the Pokedex system.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a pretty good eye,\" Rosa said.  Hugh nodded and pet Vaporeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, time to battle her,\" Hugh said.  Joy held out her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" Joy said.  \"Let me try talking to it first.  It seems since we've been shrunk, we can reach closer to our Pokemon a lot quicker than we would at normal size.\"  Hugh thought about this and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right.  Nate's Sewaddle was really friendly before he even captured him.  But do you think it will work on a legendary?\" High asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We won't know until we try,\" Joy said as she began to walk forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" Joy said. Volcarona's head shifted and looked at the tiny Joy.  \"I am Joy.  My friends and I have been changed by some malevolent men.  They want to hurt many Pokemon and we would like your help facing them.  Would you join us?\"  The great bug Pokemon remained still, save for the minor bobbing it did to stay afloat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if you don't want to help us, I would like to be your friend,\" Joy continued as she stopped about six feet from her.

The bird Pokemon answered and began to fly lower.  Trees grew in size and to the south Grant saw a town just past the mountains.  He wouldn't go there just yet.  Instead, they landed not far from a great tower he had only read about.  Tranquil was panting softly and he looked at it with cold eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I better get out of this uniform,\" he decided.  He pulled down his mask and set the clothes aside.  He wore a plain whit shirt and blue jeans beneath his uniform.  He carefully set his hat down.  \"I can't wear this anymore.  Not until I become the ruler of Plasma.\"  He covered them in the bushes and went back to the trail. Tranquil followed and still panting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my,\" came a soft voice.  Grant turned quickly and saw a woman holding some groceries.  \"Do you or your Pokemon need a rest sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  Well, I guess I could,\" he said.  He didn't want the bird to drop him on the way to the next town.  He followed her to a cottage closeby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor Juniper and  Elite Four member Marshal looked at the red-haired gym leader who jumped off her Skarmory before them at Twist Mountain  \"Professor, I just got a call from Clay,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?  How is the tournament going?\" Juniper asked.  \"I hope it can draw in the elusive champion from Kanto.  He is so quiet and rarely gives interviews.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.  Team Plasma attacked but were stopped.  A majority escaped on their frigate, but the shrinker . . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still can't conceive of such a person being able to shrink people,\" Marshal said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe it.  My father was in contact with the owners of the missiing compoents,\" Juniper said.  \"So, was anyone else shrunk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.  Cheren.  But there is good news.  Touya is back and helping them out,\" Skyla said.  \"He, Bianca, Cheren, and a former Plasma member should be arriving in the city within the hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That young lad?\" Marshal asked as he recalled their battles.  \"Good.  Is the Heroine here too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And a former Plasma member?  The one Clay said he caught?\" Juniper asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She might be worth talking to,\" Marshal said.  He pulled out two Pokeballs and opened them.  Sawk and Throh appeared.  \"I need you boys to do me a favor.  Watch this entrance and don't allow anyone to enter.\"  They nodded.  \"I'll be back shortly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSawk said something and Marshal nodded.  \"You may spar against each other,\" he said.  Both seemed happy and turned to face the other.  Skyla brought Skarmory back into her ball and they started walking towards the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrant watched as a simple nap recovered his stolen Pokemon.  \"Thanks,\" he said, happy he didn't have to shrink them to avoid notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be safe and come again if you are tired\" the girl said.  Grant nodded and walked out of the house.  he turned towards Twist Mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I continue on foot?\" he wondered.  If some of the people after him had flying types, or worse he was spotted by the frigate, he would be in trouble.  Going on foot would be the best option.  He started on the path to Twist Mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see the city,\" Touya said to his companions as he stroked the back of Brave's neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so pretty from up here,\" Sayuri said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.

In their wanderings, they did find more shards, Pokemon, and a few items someone dropped.  Both ladies held in a chuckle at Vaporeon wearing the Rocky Helmet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, should we climb down this ledge?\" Hugh asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.  I don't think we'll be able to climb back up,\" Rosa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it could be an interesting find.

It seems like what is causing Unova to Freeze is also causing all of these blizzards that happen,\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya took in the information and starts to think. If the shirker were to use that Tranquil and fly into the Blizzard, would they be able to follow them.

Grant didn\u2019t\u2019 really know what to do, since most Pokemon he would use would just ignore him and walk on ahead but it seems like this bird Pokemon is sticking with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright.

Come on let\u2019s just move on,\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tranguil nods as the two start to move. Grant wonders why this Tranquil is affection but shakes it off as he needs to think more about his plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTranquil stares at Grant and remembers two years ago. Two years ago the Tranquil use to belong to Trainer that the bird could no longer remember his original owners name.  Tranquil remember being happy with his original owner as they train and played but one day his old owner released him. Tranquil didn\u2019t quite understand why his own left him, His original owner told the bird Pokemon that they were just using them and hurting and that green hair man was right. The original owner left Tranquil as the bird made strong cries and tries to convince his owner that they did nothing wrong but it was no use, Tranquil was left alone, as the bird Pokemon cried from being left, Strangers then found the crying bird Pokemon. They attack the heart broken Pokemon and catch it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next two years Tranquil was with Team Plasma and the bird Pokemon is treated terribly. The Tranguil would be hit for doing nothing wrong and even push beyond its limits with out rest. The Tranguil began to think that it deserved to be beaten for not being good enough to be with it original owner. But now He was with this man, this man used him to fly into the sky for some reason. At first he thought this new man would be like the others, at first it seems like that, but this man let him rest after flying so hard. That is the first time that anyone showed the bird kindness in two years. The man even let Tranquil be out of his ball for a lot longer and didn\u2019t do anything to him. Trainquil figures this must his second chance at getting a trainer and he would help this man no matter what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh crap!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTranquil is snap out of its thoughts and sees that the man seems scared. The man gets in the bushes and drags Tranquil with him. Tranquil wonders why and turns to see that two fighting Pokemon are guarding the entrance to a cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDanm it. What am I going to do about those two?\u201d Grant whispers but notice that people were coming out of the cave. He is shock to see gym leader Skyla, Professor Juniper and Elite Four member Marshal were the ones coming out of the Twist Mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDanm it. Why did they have to be here? What am I going to do?\u201d Grant whispers as he starts to get scared. There was no way he could shrink all them, one of them would be able to doge and take him on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTranquil notice that Grant look trouble and starts to rub his head on Grant\u2019s leg to make the human better. Grant felt something rubbing his leg and notice that the bird Pokemon is rubbing leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat a strange bird\u2026 Wait! That\u2019s it!\u201d Grant thought as he looks at the bird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay Bird, do you want to help me out?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tranquil nods and Grant smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright can you go distract those guys over there? I\u2019ll hit them with this zapper, while two fighting Pokemon are concentrated on the new tiny people, I\u2019ll get on you and we\u2019ll fly over this mountain. What do you say? I\u2019ll give a berry or poke\u2019block or something if do this,\u201d Grant explains to the bird Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tranquil nods, willing to help to show that the bird would be a good partner. Grant smiles and says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright. Time to put this plan into motion,\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Also the famous Professor Juniper, but did think much about that. While Grant is praising him self and his new little friend, Tranquill flies though the sky with all of its might! The blizzard is getting stronger and the bird poke\u2019mon is having trouble keeping its flight straight. Grant starts to feel Tranquill\u2019s movement starting to shake and gets worry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Are you alright!?\u201d Grant asks trying to get a better grip. Tranquill chirps happily, trying to make its new partner feel calmer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTranquill is able to fly over the mountain through the blizzard and the two see a city in distant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe almost to Icirrus city, when we get there we can rest for a bit,\u201d Grant thinks out loud and Tranquill chirps once more from Grant being kindness to let it rest. A strong wind comes from behind the two that carries snow from Twisted Mountain! Tranquill gets hit hard by the snow and starts to fall to ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have to be kidding me!\u201d Grant yells as the bird poke\u2019mon and him self start to fall to the ground. Grant with out any hesitation uses his other hand and pulls Tranquill to him and holds him close and turns around so he would take the impact of the fall. \u201cWhat the hell am I doing!?\u201d Grant thought as he tries to understand why he is doing this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for the two the ground is pack with soft snow, Grant is able to hit the ground with no problems. Unfortunately Grant passes out from falling from a high distance. Tranquill is able to regain consciousness and sees that Grant is holding him. . Tranquill is yet surprise again by its new partner\u2019s kindness! This person would even protect their live to protect the bird poke\u2019mon. Tranquill saw they were near a house, the bird poke\u2019mon knew what it must do. Tranguill is able lift Grant on its back and heads for the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n_____<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya and others continue to walk Route 7 until they saw something moving the grass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe careful it could be a wild Pokemon,\u201d Cheren explains as Watchog waits to see what is in the tall grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya, Bianca, Sayuri and Cheren are surprise to see what comes out of the tall grass. It is a Skarmory and a Sawk, but the steel type poke\u2019mon is carrying the shrunken Skyla and Professor Juniper while the fighting type is a carrying the shrunken Marshal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dProfessor!\u201d Bianca shouts as she sees her teach the same size but naked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBianca!\u201d Juniper yells as she sees her pupil again and sees she is not alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheren turns his head to give the new shrunken people of modesty.

A light blue, white, and an orange one and goes over to over the new shrunken people and puts the cloths near them. Touya blushes a bit as he gets a better view of Skyla and Juniper naked forms and turns around steps forward a bit to give them some room to put on the cloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you very much Touya!\u201d Skyla shouts with a blush on her face from Touya seeing her naked. Skarmory picks up the light blue and white cloths and gives them to the shrunken women. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have my gratitude as well Touya,\u201d Juniper calls with a slight blush from being naked in front of the others. The two quickly make some clothes from the cloth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to agree. We were lucky to run into here,\u201d Marshal says as Sawka gives him the orange cloth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. But I wish were able to meet before you ended up this way,\u201d Cheren sighs wishing they were able to get to Mashal and others a bit earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell at lest we got here so we could give something to wear,\u201d Sayuri tries to lighten the mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to agree.

I think you would be able to help him get his act straighten up,\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny humans are surprise to hear the older women request that Touya would become friends the shrinker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOkay, Grams I help him out since you asked,\u201d Touya replies while working on something with the sewing machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you very much dear,\u201d The old woman says with a smile and goes back to cook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s just like him, always willing to help someone,\u201d Cheren says with a sigh but is kind of envois at Touya\u2019s kindness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but he if continues to do this, one day it\u2019s going to bite him on the butt,\u201d Sayuri says her concern about Touya actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026 But that\u2019s what I like about him,\u201d Bianca says with a smile as the blonde watches Touya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to agree.

It\u2019s just like that time with Tornadus and Thundurus,\u201d The young women in front the TV says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? How so?\u201d Sayuri asks wonder what the connection between Touya and those two legendary poke\u2019mon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Touya along with women named Touka, both came in this house when lighting storms and tornadoes were near this area. Granny told the two of them at how Tornadus and Thundurus would cause trouble for us. They said they would do something about it since Granny feed some of her vegetable soup. At first we thought they were trying to be kind, but later they came back with both Tornadus and Thundurus at their sides. They made the two legendary poke\u2019mon apologize for causing us trouble,\u201d The old man says and starts to chuckle at remembering that memory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! They fought and capture them just to make them apologize to a old women?\u201d Sayuri thought wonders how strong Touya and Touka are now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep. I remember that Touka caught Tornadus and Touya caught Thundurus,\u201d Juniper thought as she was surprise to get data on those two legendary poke\u2019mon back then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya smiles as he finishes what he is working on doll clothes for the new shrunken people.

I . . . grabbed the bird and took the impact,\" Grant replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're lucky we have so much snow or you'd be dead,\" Mark said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you have such a loyal friend too,\" Alice said as she massaged Tranquill a bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I . . . do?\" Grant whispered.  He looked at the bird who saved his life.  Why?  Was it repaying the kindness he showed it?  Her? Or was it more?  She was cery happy to help him before.  She isn't like what Ghetsis said Pokemon were.  They aren't just tools.  His eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I was traveling with a toy for . . . a cousin.  did I lose it in the fall?\" Grant asked.</span></div></div>",

Pokemon were more than what Ghetsis said?  Could N be the one walking the true path?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice came over with some tea when he glanced up her right sleeve.  A white \"A\"-like image was inside her clothing, but with a circle at the top.  Huh,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?  Something the matter?\" Alice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your tattoo, it is interesting,\" Grant said.  Alice's face went pale and she stepped back, the tea tray dropped to the floor.  Mark was over to her quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alice, what's the matter?\" Mark asked.  He glared at Grant.  \"What did you say to her?\" His voice was hard now.  He looked like a contained volcano close to erruption.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice took a breath and calmed herself like a sea after a storm.  \"Nothing.  It's nothing,\" she said softly.  She bit her lip and looked down.  She didn't want him to catch her lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry for asking about the tattoo,\" Grant said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tattoo?\" Mark asked.

I need to know,\" he whispered back, \"Is . . . Is it the shape of an 'A' or 'M'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A . . . for Aqua,\" she said as she looked him in the eyes.  The pain she tried to keep inside poured out with her tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aqua?\" Grant asked.  \"Are they like Plasma?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.  We wanted to work together with our Pokemon, to make their lives better.  We focused on expanding the seas to help water pokemon primarily,\" Alice explained, not looking from Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While Team Magma focused on expanding the lands and reducing the surface area of water,\" Mark said.  He rolled his left sleeve up, revealing a red and black M-like shape.  Alice gasped when she saw it.  Silence fell as Pooch opened an eye to watch the conflict.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You . . . . Your . . . .\" Alice whispered.  She stepped back.  Mark took her by the wrist, grasping as gently as he would a grape.  He pulled her gently towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still your boyfriend.  I . . . I care about you Alice, regardless of your past.  Remember what that hero taught us?\" Mark asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hero?\" Grant whispered, but his saviors didn't seem to notice him any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither land nor sea could win completely against the other, or many would suffer.  They need each other,\" she said as she remembered seeing that hero stand before the mighty Groudon and Kyogre when the incredible green dragon came from the sky.  She left her team not long after, taking a ferry to Sinnoh, but left soon after when the team there was causing trouble.  She made her way here and found Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I've come to realize, I need you . . . I love you,\" he replied.  Tears, now of joy, came from her eyes.  She went to him and hugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrant watched in awed silence.  He thought to his own actions, to the team he was part of.  Would they be as accepting of his choices?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no.  You Skyla was shrunk?\" Castelion Joy asked as she talked with Mistralton Joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.  As was Lady Professor Juniper and Marshal,\" her cousin said.  Driftveil Joy gasped at the thought of one of the Elite Four was shrunk now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the weather there like?\" the tinier Joy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty bad, but I think the Chargestone Mountains will block the brunt of it from going any further,\" the Joy on the phone said.  \"Look, I'm sorry but I need to go.  Some people came in with some injured Pokemon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go.  By all means,\" the shrunken Joy said.  The call ended.  She turned to where her friends were eating and packing up the goods between those who could carry things and those whose Pokemon would act as mules.</span></div></div>",

I don't know what it was, but it was amazing,\" Nate said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's tell the others,\" Hugh said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate nodded and allowed his friend to carry him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you both let go of them?\" Bianca asked as they rested in the Pokemon Center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Touko and I didn't feel right holding the Four Swords of Justice,\" Touya said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I wonder where they could be now,\" Cheren said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Swords of Justice?\" Sayuri asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Four Pokemon who defend others from evil actions.  They came to me and Touko when we faced Plasma before,\" he explained.  Sayuri nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate explained to the others what transpired as a new person approached them.  They turned to see Rood standing there.  \"Forgive me for coming like this.  I was wondering if Miss Sayuri is here, but . . . I don't believe just what I saw.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was it a big blue Pokemon?\" Nate asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.  Cobalion is a truly majestic Pokemon,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've heard  Cobalion and the others appear when Pokemon are in danger,\" Joy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed Miss Joy.  I must wonder did Cobalion appear in front of you merely by accident? Or to plead with you to solve a problem? Unlike Lord N, I don't have the ability to understand the minds of Pok\u00e9mon. Therefore, I don't know what that Pok\u00e9mon is thinking. But if you can befriend Cobalion, it will be a great asset to you on your journey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure it isn't some coincidence,\" Roxie said as she put her hand on Nate's shoulder.  Rood nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Sayuri is off with one of the heroes who helped stop you before, going after the one who shrank us,\" Rosa said.  Rood nodded again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand.  Best of luck:\" Rood said.  They nodded and continued on their way.  Nate was silent as he thought about the Pokemon they saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey entered the deep cave, their hairs raising up from all the electricity in the air.</span></div></div>",

His Pignite grunted in approval as he led the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A great many Pokemon here are weak to fire,\" Joy said as her Darmanitan carried her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which makes those Boldores a real pain,\" Roxie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went to the lower region when a noise caught Hugh's attention.  A strange cooing sound, like one of sadness.  \"Hey, hold up,\" he said to the others.  \"I want to check this out.\"  The others nodded.  He moved to an outcropping of rocks as quietly as he could move.  His Pignite surprised him with the level of stealth the sumo pig could use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly Rosa followed behind on her deathly silent Zorua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA ferroseed was under the cropping, crying it seemed.  There was a strangeness about it.  Hugh couldn't put his finger on.  \"Hey there,\" he said.  The Pokemon turned and looked at Hugh.  It hopped forward and stared at the shrunken human.  It made a happy sound and looked past Hugh to Rosa and her mount.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZorua made a happy noise and moved forward on his own volition.  He carefully rubbed against the iron barbed pokemon so as not to get hurt.  \"They . . . know each other,\" Hugh realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could this be one of N's Pokemon?\" Rosa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably.  Like Darmanitan,\" Hugh said.  \"Hey Ferroseed, do you want to come with us?\"  The grass-steel looked at him and nodded.  Hugh brought out a Pokeball and tossed it at him.  He captured the Pokemon easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSayuri looked out at the now calm snowfall. \"This is bad. From what they're saying we're going to be here for three more days,\" Cheren sighs deeply at being stuck at the center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we'll use this time to rest,\" Juniper says as the tiny professor needs to check up on things while they're staying at the center. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May . . . May I ride on my Ducklett?\" Sayuri asked, looking up at the giant hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we trust her?\" Marshall asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course we should,\" Touya said.  \"You treat someone like a criminal and they will soon believe the worst of themselves.\"  Sayuri smiled and nodded.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, mind if I go out and practice riding her?\" Sayuri asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll come too,\" Bianca said with a smile.  Sayuri nodded and they went out into the snow-covered lands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good to those two are getting along,\" Skyla says with a smile. The flying gym leader then looks at Touya. \"Touya there's something I want to talk to you about. So can some where a little more private?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya nods his head in agreement and Touya picks up the tiny flying gym leader and goes to more private area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm. I wonder what they are going to talk about,\" Cheren thought. Cheren didn't think about as Marshall and him have a talk as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Ducklett came out and shivered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sorry girl,\" Sayuri said.  \"Would you mind giving me a lift?\"  Her Pokemon squeeled in joy and lowered herself.  Sayuri climbed on top and was soon in the air.  They didn't go very far from the ground, just enough practice to stay on board.  But as they flew by the trees, a gust of wind came at them and unsettled the flying Ducklett, and threw Sayuri off her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca yelled and raced after her, calling out her Stoutland to carry her through the snow.  Ducklett shot into the woods after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSayuri groaned and shivered in the deep cold.  Her body ached as snow covered up her tiny exit.  Her breathing became quick as she feared for her own life.  She was going to die.  She was certain of that.  But then something was pushing the snow away.  A hoof of some Pokemon.  Once cleared, a pale yellow muzzle reached in and pulled her gently out.  Her Ducklett made a happy nose and she was put on Ducklett's back.  Her eyes couldn't focus properly on the one who saved her as it ran off quickly, but there watching her was another Pokemon.  Her eyes focused a bit and she recognized the creature.</span></div></div>",

Ducklett at first is surprise at the other Poke'mon but when the duck sees that her master knows the electric type, the blue duck relaxes. Sayuri pets the electric bug and the Joltik makes happy sounds from Sayuri's touch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sayuri! I'm glad to see you okay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSayuri looks to see where the yell come from and sees that the shout come from Bianca while riding the Stoutland. The Stoutland stops where Sayuri is and the other tiny woman gets off the dog Poke'mon to check on Sayuri. At first Bianca starts to shake from stepping into snow since the blond's doll shoes were not the best in the snow. Bianca shakes it off as she goes over to Sayuri. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look okay,\" Bianca says as she gets next to Sayuri. \"But are you feeling okay?\" Bianca then touches Sayuri's head. Bianca felt even colder from touching Sayuri's head. \"You're freezing now. We need to get back to the center,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Alright,\" Sayuri replies and then looks at the Joltik and asks. \"Do you want to come with me? It must lonely with him gone,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoltik makes happy noises from Sayuri inviting him to join her. Bianca wonders for a moment how Sayuri knew this Joltik but is happy that Sayuri is able to make another Poke'mon friend. Bianca helps Sayuri gets on Ducklett as Joltik gets on as well. After making sure Sayuri would stay on Ducklett the tiny blond went back to Stroutland and gets on the dog Poke'mon. The group goes back to the Center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_____<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's what I want you to do,\" Skyla says to the giant hero and waits for his response.  Touya nods in agreement and would do the request that the tiny flying type gym leader asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what is it that you two talking about?\" A voice asks as from behind the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya turns his head while Sklya moves to see who ask the question. The person who ask the question is no other then Juniper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Professor. I was just asking Touya to do us a favor,\" Skyla answers for the older woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the favor?\" Juniper asks as the Professor is getting a bit curious about what the favor could be.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... It's about how you wanted to fly to Opelucid City,\" Skyla starts to explain and then continues on when Juniper nods. \"I with the weather the way it is I don't think the plane nor Pokemon would be able to get there. So I figure we can go to Lentimas Town since its the closest place where we can land. But since I've reduce to five inches I asked Touya here to fly the plane,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really. Touya can fly a plane,\" Juniper impress that the young man also had another life skill. \"When did you learn to fly a plane,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....\" Skyla starts and then answers the question. \" He got some lessons from me. I owed him one since my old gym puzzle almost hurt him badly.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuniper remembers that Skyla's old gym puzzle involved people being shot of cannons. So it was Touya who put a stop to that puzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I felt like a bird,\" Touya comments on the gym's old puzzle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you understood what I was trying to do. Must people didn't understand what I meant with the cannons,\" Skyla says with a smile on her face, happy Touya understood what the old gym puzzle meant.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuniper sighs with a smile. The young man would say some weird things from time to time but it seem to make people happy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of couldn't talk for long when they heard the door to center open. Since Cheren and Marshal were closer to the door they saw Bianca riding her Stroutland with Ducklett carrying a freezing Sayuri and Joltik.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happen?\" Cheren asks as the Stroutland gets closer to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sayuri fell on off Ducklett. She's fine but I think she need to warm up a bit,\" Bianca explains what happen to the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get her room then,\" Marshal says, he didn't really trust the ex-plasma member but didn't want her to freeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can do that. But I think someone should be with her,\" Mistralton Joy says as picks up the Ducklett with no problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Touya and I can be with until she warms up,\" Bianca volunteers her self and one the hero of ideals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll join you as well. I want to make sure she's okay,\" Skyla adds as the red head would trust Sayuri since Touya put trust in the ex-plasma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll come with you as well. There are some things I want to ask her,\" Juniper adds as well wanting to know as much as possible what Plasma is doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Thanks everyone,\" Sayuri says through some shivers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take you to the room now,\" Mistralton Joy says and then adds. \"Also I had a talk with my sisters from Driftveil. Your friends are on their way,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good. Soon we'll be back together then,\" Bianca says with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMistralton Joy while carrying the Ducklett that had Sayuri and Joltik to a room. Touya picks up Skyla and Juniper to help them to get to the room and follows the Mistalton Joy. Bianca joins as well and Chereen and Marshal watch them leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we'll stay here to explain the situation to them then,\" Cheren says as he waits for new friends to come though the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's going to be nice the fresh new faces,\" Marshal says with a smile. \"Some of them are your students right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. I'm proud of them as well,\" Cheren complements Nate and Hugh.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMarshal nods with a smile, glad that Cheren was able to find his path. </span></div></div>",

But because, unknown to Grant, Bird being released willingly by her former trainer made any checks like that be past with flying colors.   She was clearly happy being back near him as he walked outside as Pooch sniffed through over three feet of snow for his device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this much snow typical?\"  Grant asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.  We might get a few feet, but nothing like the blizzard from the past few days,\" Mark said. Alice walked out of the home.   She carried a tray as she trudged through the snow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyone want some hot cocoa?\" Alice asked.  Mark smiled and went to her.  He killed her on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love some,\" Mark said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grant?\" Alice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.  Please,\" he said.  He went to her and took the hot mug.  It was well made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSudden barking made Grant jump, spilling his drink onto the snowy ground, and he turned to see Pooch the Mightyena was digging through the snow.  He lifted his head and the shrinking device <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it,\" Grant said with a smile.  Pooch walked over to him and Bird made some happy noises.  Grant took the device and took a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful.  You did great Pooch,\" Alice said.  The dark pokemon barked joyfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I must be going,\" Grant said.

At least let me pack you some food and other gear,\" Alice said.  Grant stopped and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would probably be wise to have,\" he said.  \"Thank you for your kindness.\"  His friends nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get inside.

It\u2019s true that the Frigate could fly high in the air but there\u2019s no way it can go that high up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe the reason for it being cold is because of an ice type Poke\u2019mon,\u201d Bianca suggest as the science assistant is throwing out ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think Bianca is right,\u201d Touya agrees with the tiny blonde\u2019s hypothesis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think Bianca is right as well.

It wasn't the normal way, with her hand and his entwined.  His hand was pulled and pressed against her chest.  He had never touched a woman there before (not to say he hadn't dreamed about it).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just being here, you and your girlfriend,\" Yancy said as she seemed oblivious to her actions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With all the electric charging about, you could have a real nice picnic,\" Roxie added as she took the other arm.  \"You get a free light show.  All you need is some repel to keep away unwanted guests.\"  She glanced at Yancy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate walked the fine balancing act with both women at his side and holding his arms.  \"Especially since everything seems more beautiful when we are this small.\"  Both young women looked at him and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrant finished his preparations when he looked out the window on the clear day.  The great tower rose up high into the sky.  He thought back to several years ago when Lord N ascended it and found one of the legendary Pokemon waiting for him.  Tranquil rubbed against him as he looked and he absentmindedly scratched her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Alice said with a smile.  \"I have everything packed up for you.\"  Grant turned to her and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Grant said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, traveling in this cold is dangerous, especially alone,\" Mark said.  \"I''d ask you to at least travel with another person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I got Bird,\" Grant said.  \"Thank you for everything.\"  He accepted the pack and noticed unused Pokeballs in the side pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be well Grant.  I hope your journey is a wonderful one,\" Alice said.  Pooch barked happily.  Grant walked out of the building with Bird at his side.  He looked at the snow-covered town and considered his options.  He could see this mysterious tower or head on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince he shrunk those three south of the mountains, who knew when the next trouble would find him.  He should be moving.  But at the same time, he knew not all his foes could be beaten by just Bird and he might not get lucky the next time with her distracting them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe he could make a new friend in the tower.</span></div></div>",

But oddly enough, in one pouch, some Pokeballs could be found.  A note was in that pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Grant, when I was putting together this sack, I noticed you didn't have any Poke Balls.  I don't know how many you hadm but it is always wise to travel with a few in case you want more friends.  I hope they help you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour friend,<br>\r\nAlice.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrant smiled and grabbed a blue one with yellow stripes on it.  He recognized it as a quick ball.  He looked at the dragon sharpening his claws on some stone and the other one just standing very still.  Throwing now wold increase his chances of getting them.  Getting ready, he threw the ball hard at the taller statue-like Pokemon.  However, his aim was poor and the ball struck the dragon instead.  The statue pokemon turned and looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Golurk</i>\" it rumbled before the ground began to shake.  Grant steadied himself and Bird took to the air.  The Quick Ball returned to Grant's hand, signalling a good capture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bird, Wing attack,\" Grant said.  Bird trilled and flew.  It struck the Golurk but the Pokemon wasn't affected much.   \"Maybe they are stronger than I've faced before?\" Grant realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGolurk then began to glow yellow.  It moved surprising speed and slammed hard into Bird.  Bird screamed in pain and fell to the ground.  Bird was barely awake and badly injured  Grant recalled Bird and had an angry look in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't hurt my friend,\" he muttered before calling out his freshly caught Druddigon.  \"Dragon, slash him up!\"  His Pokemon  glared at him and then to the Golurk.  He scratched his muzzle instead.  \"Please!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The dragon-type walked towards the Golurk and made a growl.  Golurk's fist became hard and it struck Druddigon.    Grant's new Pokemon growled in pain as it looked at the ghost-ground type.  Golurk seemed to be moving slower now.  A sneer formed on Druddigon's face and now slashed at Golurk with darkened claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGolurk fell back in pain.  It made a cry of pain.  Grant picked out a black and green ball.  He threw it hard and this time struck Golurk.  The tall Pokemon rumbled against the ball but fell to the ball's power.  Druddigon smiled and went to sleep.  Grant brought back Druddigon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a pain you are, you Dragon,\" Grant muttered.  His thoughts turned to the injured Bird.  He looked at the Pokeball.  Before he would continuue on, it would be best to go back to that city and give her a rest at the Pokemon Center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe the Joy there could explain what happened with Dragon too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate's face was very red as he and his girls returned to Hugh and the others.  They continued their way through the electric cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong the way, Roxie and Yancy would make sly comments about things while glaring at the other one.</span></div></div>",

He stumbled through the doors and looked around.  \"Roxie?\" he called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, you just missed them,\" a store clerk said.  \"Mister Clay took them to the south.\"   Pop Roxie sighed and nodded before turning around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheren landed before a grand building with lights  He got off his Unfezant and put him back in his ball.  Glancing around, he saw the great ship at port.  He moved to the vending machines were a man dressed strangely was waiting.  Cheren stared at the man before they gave each other a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to see you man,\" Cheren said.  Crimson smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likewise.  Shoot.  It's been, what? Eighteen months?\" Crimson asked.  Crimson took his mask off and Cheren looked at his childhood friend's cousin.  One of the heroes of Unova who helped change N's mind.  He could have claimed one of the great dragons, Kyurem, but chose not to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think so.  So, I'm a gym leader now.  Bianca's a research assistant for Prof. Juipers.  What's up with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Been around to new lands.  Met other champions.  One guy was a real silent type, you know?  Though he was a wicked battler.  Oh Touko sends her love,\" Touya said.  Cheren nodded and thought about the one who did take the fame to let her cousin sit in the background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you are okay with this?\" Touya asked.  Cheren nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea.  Clay knows about it too.  Oh, do you know Plasma's latest action?\" Cheren asked.  Touya's eyes darkened a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I saw Clay,\" Touya said.  He saw the shock on Cheren's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clay was shrunk too?\" Cheren asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only about a foot.  His Mamoswine took a hit and touched him a little time after,\" Touya said.  Cheren sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is really strange.  Why?  What's the point?\"  Cheren asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know why.  I was able to convince one shrunken grunt named Sayuri to turn away from Plasma and told Clay.  I overheard,\" Touya said.  Cheren listened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.  Well, here are my friends,\" Cheren said before bringing out Stoutland, Cinccino, and Watchdog.  \"Follow him for a short time, okay?\"  His Pokemon nodded and returned to their balls.  The Crimson Mask went on and he accepted his Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Crimson said before walking off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClay led the group of shrunken persons to the great building. \"Here we are! Whaddya think? Great buildin', huh? Here's where the Pok\u00e9mon World Tournament takes place! Ain't she purty? Follow me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really amazing sight,\"  Bianca said.  \"This is so exciting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.  To meet so many people,\" Joy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they entered the building's reception a man dressed in strange clothes was up near the front.  He walked into the hall down the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, the first tournament is the Driftveil tournament,\" Clay said.  \"Eight challengers and only one can become champion.  I'm going to join.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A chance to rock people off their seats?  Count me in,\" Roxie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a great idea,\" Hugh said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it does,\" Nate said.  \"Will you join Yancy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, are foreign Pokemon allowed?\" Yancy asked.  Clay shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not for their tournament,\" Clay said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll do it,\" Bianca said.  \"Been a while since I've done something like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then walk up there and get registered,\" Clay said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group nodded and registered.  The participants waited in separate rooms for their turn.  Joy and Yancy walked to a private viewing box and found Cheren there.  \"Oh.  I'm sorry,\" Cheren said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Cheren,\" Joy said as she sat down and they waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First up in this premiere battle!  The calculating scientist Corless!  And his opponent the mysterious Crimson!\"  A tall man with a confident walk moved forward and a masked man came from the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we go,\" Cheren said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrimson looked at Corless.  \"Nice mask,\" Corless said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.  The same to you,\" Crimson said.  He pulled out a ball and tossed out Stoutland.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorless pulled out magneton.  \"Begin!\" came the announcer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wild charge,\" Crimson said.  Stoutland barked and rushed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thunderwave.' Corless said coolly.  The electrical blast struck Stoutland but he still hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strength,\" Crimson said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mirror shot!\" Corless said.  Stoutland tried to move but couldn't.  The blast hit him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheren bit his lip in frustration.  He knew the plan.  He knew why Crimson was here, but he didn't like this one bit.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Ungh! Get back here, you!\" Hilda shouted as she ran through the woods, chasing down her prey, a rather quick Zebstrika.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teenaged girl trainer, Hilda, had been scouting Pokemon in the woods to add to her ever growing collection so she could fill out her Pokedex. Unfortunately for her, her luck had not been up to snuff so far, with many of her attempts ending in failure. And as luck would have it, this newest attempt was looking to end the same way, as Hilda soon lost sight of her much needed Zebstrika through the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dang it!\" Hilda said as she slow to a stand still. She hit the air in frustration, and promptly sat down on a nearby tree stump to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far her luck wasn't so good, but she had something new on her side today. Hilda reached into her purse and pulled out a small gun-shaped peripheral. It was an invention by the famous Pokemon Professor Juniper, who had given the latest device to the young brunette for all her hard work on filling up the Pokedex. But Juniper hadn't just given the device away, she'd warned Hilda to be very careful with it and not to overuse it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you said it was still in experimental phases, but I think you'll get why I have to use it after I catch a whole bunch of Pokemon!\" Hilda justified use of the device to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda looked over the device, eyeing its gun-like shape and deceptively simple controls. Two buttons, a red one labeled \"Shrink\", and a blue one labeled \"Grow\". Hilda smiled to herself, this size changing ray gun was just what she needed to capture some Pokemon. In her mind it made sense that if she could shrink a Pokemon down to pocket size before attempting to catch it in a Pokeball, then its capture would be easy simply because it was made smaller and weaker by the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda got up off the stump and turned the device over, pointing it at herself. She recalled the demonstration that Juniper had given her at the Pokemon lab...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarlier in the morning, Juniper had used the size gun to shrink and grow various objects around the room. She told Hilda that she'd been working on the ray for weeks, and after many revisions, was almost ready to reveal it to the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcited by the prospect of size changing, Hilda begged for a turn with the gun, and after a few more tests, Juniper allowed her to try it out for herself. Hilda practically beamed as she zapped things up and down in size around the room, getting a feel for handling the size ray. But then, in her excitement, Hilda tried something a bit crazy and zapped Prof. Juniper on \"Shrink\" mode, quickly reducing the genius woman down to the size of a doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda's eyes went wide as she watched her beloved Professor shrink down in size, bewildered and amazed by the whole process. Juniper on the other hand was not as pleased with the results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings got a bit heated after that, but Juniper tried to remain calm and explain how to reverse her shrinking to Hilda. Embarrassed, but a little amused nonetheless, Hilda listened to the Professor and quickly restored her to full size. After that, Juniper snatched the size gun away from Hilda and explained to her that it was not a toy to be used like that. Hilda hung her head low in shame and listened to the lecture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, Hilda and Juniper said their goodbyes on good terms after that, and the topic of the size ray had been replaced with discussion about Hilda's progress on her Pokedex. Hilda smiled as she left the lab to continue her journey. All the while, Juniper never knew that Hilda had secretly taken the size ray with her, having smuggled it into her purse when Juniper had left the room for just a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda grinned as she imagined the uses she could get out of this gun, and merrily rode her bike out of town...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all that the truth was that Juniper had not technically given Hilda the right to use her latest creation, but she had actually given her warnings, plenty of them. Now that Hilda was out here in the woods, and desperate from her lack of success so far, she felt she'd earned the right to use it at least once to see if it would help her any.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Professor!\" Hilda said happily, if not a little smugly as well, as she hugged the device to her chest. She then set it down on the same tree stump she was just sitting on and played with the settings. She knew that it was as simple as pressing one of the two buttons to get it into either mode, and then simply pulling the trigger to activate it. Hilda smiled and set the device to \"Shrink\" mode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, to wait for a Pokemon!\" Hilda exclaimed. Time passed, with no Pokemon coming by. Hilda was starting to get restless and bored. She set the size ray down on the tree stump to go look for some Pokemon to lure back, but just as she did a Pansage popped out from the bushes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Hilda exclaimed with a fist pump. Pansage wasn't exactly a rare to get Pokemon, but she'd take any win she could get at this point. She looked down and grabbed at her Pokeballs instinctively, but before she threw one, she remembered the size ray she left on the tree stump. She put the Pokeballs back in her purse and turned to grab the size ray, but when she looked up she saw that the Pansage had already grabbed it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! You let that go! That's mine, and it's how I'm going to catch you!\" Hilda yelled, pointing at the Pokemon and stomping over to it. The Pansage cried and looked worried, as if it understood what Hilda was saying to it. It looked around frantically in a panic, before its eyes locked onto the size ray. It aimed the size ray at Hilda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" Hilda gasped as the tables had turned on her and stopped in her tracks, holding her arms up high as if she were being robbed. She started to worry that this Pansage was smarter than she thought, but realized that there was no way a Pokemon would really be able to figure out how to use such a complicated device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda chuckled lightly as she realized how foolish she was being, and decided to quickly run over and get the device back from the Pansage. But just as she did, there was a bright flash that shot out from the ray, blinding Hilda momentarily and once again stopping her in her tracks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda covered her eyes. Though she couldn't see, she could still hear the Pansage cry out as the ray activated. Hilda cried too, but this was from knowing that when she opened her eyes again she was going to see the world from a much different perspective.

But to her surprise, she'd shrunken way smaller than she ever expected!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny girl stood still from the newfound fear of her expanded surroundings, trees that towered over her before were now like skyscrapers in Castlelia City, flowers and bushes now took on the same towering stature that the trees had when she was normal-sized, and even the grass she was in now threatened to swallow her up it was so big, blades of grass were nearly as big as she was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda couldn't be more than 3 inches tall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe recently reduced girl took in her new, much bigger world, with awe. She was equal parts afraid and amazed by how small she had become. She wondered if this is what Juniper had felt like when she had shrunk her. But that was in a more controlled setting, Hilda thought, out here in the wild, only 3 inches tall, was a completely different story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pan! Pan! Pansage!\" The petty Pokemon cried from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda looked up and saw the culprit of her shrinking dancing high above her on a tree stump. Pansage's were normally not so big, but at her new scale Hilda likened the creature's comparative size to that of an Onix, or even bigger! And the stump that it was on was even bigger than her house!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you... you thief!\" Hilda hesitated to say the words a little, knowing full well that she had stolen the size ray in the first place to shrink some Pokemon. She thought it ironic now that she was the one being shrunken by Pokemon instead!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give that back!\" Hilda stomped her tiny foot and pointed up, way up, at the towering Pokemon. Hilda's curiosity at the her and the world's new scales was gone, replaced by an angry 3-inch tall girl's determination to catch this menace of a Pokemon, not to mention get herself back to normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlways athletic and somewhat hot-headed, Hilda wasn't going to let being shrunken to smaller than a Joltik stop her from getting her revenge. So she ran over to the stump, not caring about what she would, or even could, do to the much larger and much stronger Pokemon to get the size ray back. All she cared about was getting the size ray back, growing herself back to normal, then shrinking the Pokepunk and catching it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Hilda soon ran into her first roadblock, the very stump she needed to climb to even get face-to-toe with the mean Pansage. As she noted before, it was even bigger than her whole house. But luckily for Hilda, her new size allowed her to see some new tiny details on the dark bark, namely small little indents that she could use as handholds to climb up the worn-down former tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda wasted no time in starting her ascent, climbing up the stump with a renewed vigor courtesy of her will to restore her size. On the way up, Hilda took some time to appreciate that being small allowed her to climb that stump, but at the same time she knew that if she hadn't shrunk in the first place, she'd never need to worry about such things. It was interesting to the shrunken girl that her small size seemed to make climbing the rough stump a little easier. Hard surfaces like the stump might've been a pain to deal with at normal size, but in her reduced state, Hilda was having no trouble lifting herself towards her goal at the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of climbing, Hilda finally pulled herself up over the top of the stump. She stood up triumphantly, smiling brightly and feeling confident, amazed at how much energy she still had after that. She wondered if her reduced weight had anything to do with it. After celebrating her small victory, Hilda looked ahead and saw that...</span></div></div>",

But when she looked down she saw that the size ray was still there, much to her relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear I'll get that Pansage back for this!\" Hilda promised to herself as she walked over to the size ray. The tree stump was not so large, so it wasn't a long walk. What amazed Hilda though, was the fact that she actually had trouble fitting on it before when she sat on it at her normal size, but now it was big enough that she could walk across it at all. This reinforced her thoughts that she was way too small and needed to get herself back to normal pronto!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda walked up the size gun, noticing how big it was to her now. It towering over her like a small building, even though she holding it comfortably in one hand just minutes ago. Hilda shook her head, she hated how she kept comparing herself to everything, it was an instinctive reaction, and one that did interest her a little to see how small she now was, but one that made her feel all the smaller nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is the shrink ray, it's pretty big now...\" Hilda noted, putting her hand on it's side. The device didn't appear to be damaged at all, Hilda noticed with relief. The only thing that she needed now was to figure out how to operate it at her size, and in a way that she could restore herself. But being stuck only 3-inches tall has a huge hindrance to that plan, as she was far too small to both pull the trigger and receive the ensuing blast of energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What to do... If only there was a delay function...\" Hilda murmured to herself, hand on her chin as she thought about how to approach this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, first things first, I better make sure I can still even push the trigger in...\" Hilda surmised, hoping that she wasn't too small and weak to do at least that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda moved, hopping over the trigger's handle like a large fence and moving closer to the trigger itself. Hilda stretched her arms out and prepared herself to push hard. Much to her surprise, the trigger went in. Hilda grunted and pushed harder, pushing the trigger all the way back. The gun activated and fired a blast out into the woods. Hilda quickly turned and looked to see what got hit, but the blast fired deeper into the woods than she could see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda shrugged, she was happy that she could at least pull the trigger, but wondered how to do it in a way that she'd be able to activate it on \"Grow\" on herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a thought came to her. Her clothes, purse, and everything else had shrunken along with her, and that included her Pokeballs! She could just use her Pokemon to push the trigger for her! She slapped her forehead at her oversight and laughed. Hilda then thought for a second before remembering that she'd only brought one Pokemon with her for her trip. She slapped her head again, this time for her lack of foresight. She'd thought it would be okay to only bring one Pokemon since she hunting in a pretty low level area, and so opted to bring only her Emboar with her while she took some eggs out of Daycare to hatch them in while hunting for other Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well, Emboar, come on out, big guy!\" Hilda shouted as she threw her only Pokeball on the stump, it opened and out came...</span></div></div>",

The normally 5'3\" Pokemon had reduced in scale along with its trainer perfectly, leaving it just a little shorter than Hilda, much like normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Emboar, I'm so sorry!\" Hilda ran over to and hugged her beloved Pokemon. It snuggled up against her in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emboooaarr....\" Emboar cried softly, and with a bit of confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Don't worry, boy. I'll get this sorted out soon!\" Hilda assured her Pokemon. She stood up and pointed at the trigger of the size ray. Emboar watched her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See that?\" She asked. Emboar nodded. Hilda smiled, proud of her Pokemon for being so strong even with all this weirdness. \"Good. I need you to push it back as far as you can, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmboar nodded and flexed its muscles. It waddled over to the trigger and placed its hands on the trigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can do it!\" Hilda cheered, fists clenched in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emboar!\" It roared, fire flaring up from its pores as it pushed with all its might. The trigger gave way and soon the pig Pokemon had activated the size gun much like its shrunken trainer had a minute ago. A blast fired out from the gun, once again shooting away into the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" Hilda cheered, hugging Emboar from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emboar...\" Emboar said, sounding a little tired from the exercise. Hilda noticed her Pokemon's exhaustion and petted its head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for your hard work.\" She started. \"But I need you to do it one more time for me, think you can make it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emboar!\" Emboar cried loudly, showing its confidence. Hilda smiled at it, but she knew that doing this was quite a lot for the shrunken Pokemon, even if it refused to show it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good boy! That's what I want to hear!\" Hilda exclaimed, patting Emboar's back. She then hopped back over the trigger's handle. \"Okay, I need you wait here and only push the trigger when I tell you to, okay?\" Emboar nodded with a grunt. Hilda gave it the thumbs up. \"Great! Once I'm back to normal, I'll take the gun and grow you back too! Let's do this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmboar proudly cried its name one more time. Hilda nodded, and then ran off to the front of the size ray. When she made it to the front, she noticed that she was still just tall enough to easily take the blast from the gun, the one that would finally get her back to normal size once and for all. As interesting as being tiny was, Hilda knew it was just better to be a normal-sized girl rather than a tiny one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda smiled as she thought about what she would do once she returned to normal. First, she'd grow her beloved Emboar back to size, and then she'd find that evil little Pansage and shrink it down for good to add it to her collection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her plans set, Hilda shouted the go ahead for her Emboar to push the trigger in again. It cried out loudly and did as its trainer commanded. Hilda waited, and braced herself for the ensuing blast of energy, happy to get back to being big again...</span></div></div>",

The tiny girl squeaked as the blast hit her, the bright light of it forcing her to close her eyes again. But the sensation passed shortly, only to soon be replaced with a more familiar feeling of changing size. Hilda thought it felt the same as before, but then thought that it might feel the same no matter which way you changed size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could feel herself moving, like if she were in an elevator in a department store. A feeling of falling down washed over her, like before, even though she wasn't moving at all. The light died down shortly, as did the weird feeling of the blast. Hilda thought it was now safe to open her eyes again, so she rubbed her eyes and slowly opened them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Emboar! I hope I didn't crush you when I grew..!\" Hilda said as she rubbed her eyes. She looked down and didn't see her Emboar anywhere, or even the size ray for that matter. In fact, instead of seeing the tree stump as being smaller, it instead looked like it was even bigger then before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda gasped as she realized her mistake. Slowly, she looked up, and when she did, she nearly fainted. The biggest thing she had ever seen before was now towering over her, the size ray was ominously monolithic before her. The device was bigger then ever but there was no mistaking what it was, and what had happened to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda had forgotten to check on what mode the size ray was on before, and as luck would have it, the size was still on \"Shrink\" mode. Hilda had made the horrible mistake of shrinking herself to an even tinier size!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... way...\"  Hilda cried. She felt weak all of a sudden and fell to her knees, eyes wide with fear as she stared up at the skyscraper sized ray gun above her. She scampered away from it, moving backwards. She got up and started to run from the imposing structure, but it was useless, she ran for almost a minute, barely making any progress. The stump was now so huge that could run for 10 minutes and not reach the edge of it, or rather she was now so small that she'd never make any sort of distance at her new especially puny height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could I be so stupid!?\" Hilda fell to her knees again and hit the wooden surface of the tree stump that was now practically her whole world. She began to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she shrank the first time, it was scary to be sure, but it was kind of fun too, like going on a big adventure. But now that she'd been shrunken twice in a row, any semblance of fun to be had was now replaced by a very real semblance of danger. Hilda was so small now that she could almost fit in between the rings of the tree stump, she couldn't be more than a millimeter tall now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emboar? Emboar?\" The familiar, although now magnified cry of her Emboar came from the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emboar?!\" Hilda gasped, looking up for her Pokemon. She saw it, even shrunken her Emboar was like a giant to her and she had to remind herself that it wasn't Emboar that had grown, but rather she that had shrank a second time. It was a little smaller than her before, but now it was so much bigger than her that she worried it might not be able to find her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda ran over to her precious Pokemon, needing it now more then ever. She just hoped that she could get its attention...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hilda huffed as she made the jog towards her Emboar. She could hardly believe that the stump that she easily sitting on before at her normal, then expanded to the size of a large building when she shrank to 3 inches tall, had now blown up in size compared to her that it was like running miles across a wooden platform. She positive that Emboar was only a few inches away, but at her size a few inches was quite far for her to run, and it was starting to exhaust her minuscule body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-Emboar!\" Hilda yelled out when she got close to her Pokemon. She ran a few more steps before slowing to a halt, hands on her knees and panting a little from all the physical activity she'd done today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda panted, and then looked up at her Emboar, it was close enough now that Hilda could compare herself to it at her new size, noting disappointingly that she didn't reach halfway up its little leg stumps, if she were closer, she'd be eye-to-toe with the big little Pokemon. Hilda rolled her eyes, annoyed by just how small she'd become. Luckily Emboar still had some height, and Hilda knew that she needed to get its help more then ever now. \"Emboar!\" She shouted again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emboar?\" Emboar cried out in confusion, seemingly hearing her tiny calls. The shrunken Pokemon looked left and right for its trainer, but didn't see anything. Hilda saw Emboar's reaction and shouted at it again, this time as loudly as she could. Emboar's ears perked up and it then looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emboar!?\" The pig Pokemon cried, staring down at Hilda with a shocked expression on its face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi...\" Hilda said to it, waving up at it. She smiled weakly, happy to not be too small to be found by her Pokemon, though at the same time she felt a little embarrassed that she'd messed up and shrank herself again. In a way, she'd felt like she'd let not only herself down, but Emboar as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emboar!\" Emboar cried happily and got down closer to Hilda, quickly scooping the tiny trainer into its hands before she could react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" Hilda yelled as she was lifted up. Emboar brought her in front of her face, and it smiled wide at her, repeating its own name in joy. Hilda couldn't help but smile back, it seemed that Emboar could understand what had happened after all, either that, or Emboar could feel her emotions and wanted to try cheering her up. Hilda preferred to think it was a mix of both, her Emboar was pretty smart after all. \"Thank you for all your help, Emboar! I'm sorry, it looks like we're going to be stuck like this for a little while, I made a little mistake...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emboar!\" Emboar cried again, this time shaking its head. It snuggled up to the tiny trainer and purred. Hilda laughed, being tickled a bit by Emboar's fur. The shrunken girl returned the hug by wrapping her tiny arms around Emboar's head as much as she could reach, to her it was like hugging a big, soft ball, it felt so warm to touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, boy. You've done a lot for me so far, but I need you to help me out just a little more, okay?\" Hilda asked, to which Emboar enthusiastically nodded. Hilda grinned and pointed over to the back of the size ray. \"Good! We need to go over there so we can press the button to change the settings of the ray back to grow. Think you can do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emboar!\" The fire Pokemon cried proudly. It placed Hilda on top of its head, where she layed down comfortably, holding onto its fur for support. Emboar then took off, dashing around the size ray to the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warm texture of Emboar's fur made the ride comfy, and Hilda could relax. She started to think that things were going to work out after all. All she needed was for Emboar to press the \"Grow\" button on the size gun, then place her in the barrel of the device and push the trigger in again to get her back to 3 inches tall, after that one more push of the trigger would get her back to her normal height, for real this time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they get to the back of the size ray, they see both the \"Shrink\" and \"Grow\" buttons close enough to the ground that Emboar could easily reach them. Right now, the \"Shrink\" button was still pressed in, confirming the device was still on its \"Shrink\" mode. Emboar grunted and went over to the \"Grow\" button. The fire-type Pokemon flexed its muscles a bit and then pressed hard into the button, Hilda cheered it on all the while...</span></div></div>",

It tried again to push the large button in, struggling to get a good grip on it to really press it in with all its strength. It struggled against the oversized button for a minute before reaching its limit and slumping down against the size ray's side. \"E-Emboar...\" It cried out weakly. Hilda gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay, Emboar?\" Hilda asked, worried for her Pokemon. Emboar nodded, slowly as to not throw Hilda off of its head. Hilda smiled weakly and pet the top of its head. \"It's okay, boy. I know you're doing your best...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda looked up at the button, the big red button seemed to be taunting them with its very existence. It was right there, and all they needed to do was push it in! Even though Hilda was trying to keep Emboar's spirits up, she was feeling sad. If Emboar couldn't press the growth button, then they'd both be stuck like this, forever!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dang it...\" She whispered under her breath. She glared at the growth button, then looked down softly at Emboar, who was tired from all its exertion. She sighed and pet it again. \"It's okay, it's okay...\" She repeated to it softly. She wished she could let it back into its Pokeball to take a well-deserved break, but she was afraid that if she did that it would shrink down to her scale, as its Pokeball had shrunk along with her the second time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmboar sat still and tried to recuperate some energy to try again, not wanting to disappoint its trainer, no matter how tiny she was. After some time passed, and Hilda kept trying to relax it, Emboar got up and went to try again, only to be stopped by its trainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emboar, wait!\" Hilda cried. \"It's no use, we need to try something else...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmboar grunted and ignored her, putting its hands on the button again and getting ready to push.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, wait!\" Hilda shouted, her voice loud and commanding, despite her size. Emboar immediately stopped what it was doing and perked its ears up to listen to her. \"Save your energy, Emboar. You'll need it if we want to get off of this tree stump.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emboar?\" Emboar was confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, boy. We're going to try climbing down.\" Hilda told her Pokemon her plan. \"There's no way we'll be able to reverse this on our own, so we need some help! Now we can wait around for somebody to come, but I think that we're too deep into the woods for that to happen. So! It's better to just try and find some help on our own!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda explained her plan with confidence, but in truth, even she wasn't sure if this was such a good idea. She was tiny at her new size, smaller than most things, but still big enough that Emboar and her could interact easily enough, but she'd be like a speck to a normal-sized person. Even though Emboar still had some size on him, even if they found somebody that could help them, they'd never hear her cries for help, much less even see the minute girl! And there was the issue of just leaving the size ray in the middle of the woods, someone or some Pokemon might come by and take it while they were gone...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with all these problems though, Hilda knew that sitting around and waiting wasn't an option. She wanted to take a plan of action, and she wasn't about to let being only about a millimeter tall stop her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So come on, Emboar! Let's leave this thing alone for now, and climb down this stump, and find ourselves a savior!\" Hilda finished with enthusiasm. She patted Emboar's head to get it going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emboar!\" Emboar shouted its approval of her plan.

She felt bad for making Emboar do everything for her, especially because she knew that it had shrunken too, it was just that she was far smaller than it, so she had no choice but to rely on it for pretty much everything now. Emboar didn't seem to mind too much though, and that made Hilda glad that she had such an amazing Pokemon with her, she just wished she'd brought her whole team with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda's comfy ride then turned into a more bumpy one as Emboar started its descent down the barky side of the tree stump. Each time Emboar would climb down, or move its arms and legs to a lower foothold, it knocked her up into the air. She yelped out the first few times it happened, but after a while she got used to it and made it a habit of holding on tightly to Emboar's head fur so it didn't happen again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way down, Hilda noticed that the same foot and handholds that she'd used to climb up the stump when she was 3 inches tall had now become like huge cliffs on their own at her smaller size. It really looked like she was climbing down a huge mountain, instead of just a small stump only a few feet high. She was thankful she had Emboar here to help her, otherwise she'd never make it down the barky edge of the stump on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes passed as the climb down continued smoothly, with Emboar deftly maneuvering down the stump. Soon, Hilda and Emboar got close to the ground. As they did, HIlda noticed that the grass was threatening to swallow them up, or rather just her, as even the blades of grass, minuscule even at her previous shrunken height, were now comparable to trees in their relative size to her. Emboar climbed down into the grass, at its size it was just a little smaller than the grass, but to Hilda it was like being inside a forest inside a forest. She could hardly believe how small she was now, and this only just solidified the fact that she was the smallest living being in existence right now. Even a Joltik, the world's smallest Pokemon, would be like the size of a Wailord to her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry I took your device, Professor! I'll never do anything like that again!\" Hilda quickly whispered to herself the promise, hands clasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda gulped, worried for what would happen to her if she were to get separated from Emboar here. Even now, sitting on top of Emboar's head, she could only just barely see over the grass forest, and that was only if she was standing up. If she were to fall off or something now, she'd have no way of traversing the forest-like blades of grass herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmboar on the other hand, was having little trouble navigating through the grass. Even though the shrunken pig Pokemon was a little smaller than most of the blades, it was able to use its other senses to make it trough. Eventually, it broke through the grass and came out into a more open area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Emboar, so far so good.\" Hilda said, perking up a little from being out of the grass. But even being free from the grass forest did little to help her nerves, as she could still look up and see humongous trees looming high above her, telling her that her journey was far from over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this new area, Hilda could at least see a bit far ahead and plot a course for her and Emboar to go. A large lake was in front of them, and to their sides more woods lay out for them to explore. Hilda wracked her brain for any sort of mental compass she might have as she tried to recall a way out of the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she tried to concentrate on that, she couldn't help shake the feeling that being near a clear lake like this was a bad idea. If there was a lake, there was bound to be Pokemon coming and going all the time. The last thing she needed now was to get stepped on by a Pokemon, what a horrible way to die, she thought grimly. Even though she had Emboar to help her, she doubted it could take on any wild Pokemon in a fight, she just hoped that if it came to it, Emboar could still outrun them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly...</span></div></div>",

She wasn't able to tell for sure, but something in her gut made her think that this Pansage was the same one from before, in other words, the reason for her shrinking in the first place and the cause of all of her problems! To make matters worse, this Pansage now looked like a giant that was hundreds of feet tall at her ultra tiny size! As much as she'd like to get her revenge on that Pansage, there was little hope of doing so at her current pitiful height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emboar, watch out...\" She whispered to her Pokemon, whose ears perked up at her suddenly serious tone. \"That Pansage is the one responsible for shrinking me in the first place, I'm sure of it! Look at how it's looking at the ground, like it's looking for a 3-inch version of me!\" Hilda gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe super shrunken girl wondered if wild Pokemon were even capable of such thoughts, but something about this Pansage made her feel queasy and uneasy. Regardless of whether or not this Pansage was the same one as before, Hilda knew that staying around the monolithic monkey was not a smart thing to do, at either her or Emboar's sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's try and sneak away from it, boy...\" Hilda commanded softly.

Hilda looked over at the Pokemon making the commotion, only to see that it had spotted her, or rather, it spotted little Emboar, and was now running over to them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emboar!\" Emboar cried and picked up its pace, running as fast as its reduced legs could carry it. Hilda cried out too, both worried that Pansage would catch up to them, and afraid that she was going to fall off of Emboar's head from all its running!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda looked quickly took a look behind at their pursuer, and saw that Pansage's height had given it an immeasurable advantage over Emboar's inches tall height, and the Pansage was quickly gaining on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry, Emboar! We can make it!\" Hilda shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny trainer looked ahead and tried to focus on where they should go for safety, but the grass from before was now long gone, and Pansage was chasing them away from the rest of the forest, and right towards the lake. Hilda gasped as she realized that they'd fallen for Pansage's trick, it had lured them right into a trap, a trap that ended in a watery grave or a hungry Pansage's mouth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...\" Hilda said softly, she closed her eyes to think about a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmboar was keeping a good pace away from the Pansage, despite the massive size difference between the Pokemon. But it and Hilda were about to be stuck between a rock and a hard place. A hungry monkey behind them, and a huge lake ahead of them, and that was if they were even able to make it that far! Hilda was sure going into the lake would be the end of both her and her Emboar, but at the same time there was no other way to escape winding up as lunch for the Pansage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make a break for the lake, Emboar!\" Hilda ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emboar!\" Emboar cried it agreement with her plan, knowing full well that wasn't capable of swimming, but sure that Hilda had an idea in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Hilda had no grand ideas of what to do when they got to the lake. She knew Emboar couldn't swim, and she wasn't sure if she'd be able to swim across the lake at her size, as even the smallest of ripples in the water would be like tidal waves to her. But if she could hide out in the lake long enough for the Pansage to lose interest in her and Emboar, then they might just have a chance of making it out of here alive!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it!\" Hilda said as a sudden idea came to her. \"Emboar, come on! To the lake!\" She shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmboar hurried up as much as it could. They'd made it to the bank of the water, and Emboar was about to jump in when suddenly the pursuing Pansage swiped at Emboar with its hands, knocking the shrunken fire Pokemon into the air a few inches and launching it over the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aahhhh!\" Hilda screamed as both her and Emboar went flying over the lake. It seemed like a long distance to travel to her, but in reality, it was only about a foot or so. Nevertheless, Hilda and Emboar both soared through the air for a few seconds, miraculously, Hilda managed to hold on tightly enough so as to not fall off. The diminished duo then landed into the lake with a splash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda held on tight as Emboar cried out and tried to stay afloat. Hilda felt bad for her shrunken Pokemon, she could see how much effort it was putting in to keep both itself and her above water. Now, Hilda thought, was the time to implement her plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come back, Emboar!\" Hilda yelled as she grabbed its Pokeball and touched it to Emboar's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emboar!?\" Emboar cried out, understanding now what Hilda's idea was all along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pokeball opened before Emboar could do anything, and bright red light shined out and \"zapped\" Emboar, encasing its whole body in the light before making Emboar disappear into its Pokeball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Emboar now back in its Pokeball, this left Hilda alone all of a sudden, and the mega mini girl fell down from where Emboar was and into the water below. She plunged quite a ways into the water, but managed with some effort to pull herself back up to the water's surface. But, as she anticipated, the ripples in the water, unnoticeable to any normal-sized by-standers, had become huge waves at her size, and she struggled to stay afloat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Thank you, Emboar. Let me take it from here, I just need to stay here long enough to make that Pansage go away, it won't notice me at least...</i> Hilda thought, even as she fought to keep herself from being swallowed up by the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn between being bobbed up and down in the water, Hilda managed to watch the shore all the while, noticing the Pansage's confused reaction to Emboar's sudden \"disappearance\".

Leaving her bite-sized body curled up into a ball in the Basculin's stomach, unconscious, but unharmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes passed, with the Basculin swimming freely through the lake of the woods, leaving the shore where the Pansage waited far behind. But inadvertently trapping Hilda even deeper into the lake. It hadn't even noticed the speck-size teen when it swallowed her, it was actually just going for another snack in the water, and had only swallowed her along with it by accident. Even now as it swam, the Basculin was unaware of its hyper shrunken passenger, and had turned off its need to digest anything inside it for the time being, keeping Hilda safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Hilda started to wake up. She rubbed her head as it, along with the rest of her twice-reduced body ached a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What happened...?\" Hilda murmured as she tried to recall the last few minutes. \"I remember getting shrunk... twice... and then running away from that evil Pansage, and then..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda took a look around her, noting how hot, damp, and dark her surroundings were.

She shot up and started running through the insides of her devourer, trying to find a way out.

Now, we can get out of this mess, but I need to your help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmboar nodded its approval of Hilda's latest plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so all I need you to do is scorch the inside of this Basculin for me, alright?\" Hilda asked, to which Emboar nodded again. It stated to flare up its flames. Hilda gasped and quickly motioned her hands for it to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" She cried. Emboar stopped and looked down at her. \"Okay, okay, we're stuck in a Basculin, Emboar. That means that most likely we're way underwater, even though this lake didn't look too deep, at our sizes we can't take any risks! So follow me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda pointed over to the back of the stomach. She told Emboar to move over there. Emboar scrunched itself up some more and waddled over to the back of Basculin's stomach. In the back, Hilda and Emboar found the Basculin's uvula hanging just a bit above the small tunnel of its throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what we need to hit, buddy.\" Hilda pointed up at the target. \"I'm thinking if we can get Basculin here to throw us up, chances are that we'll be spat out of its mouth, hopefully from the top of the lake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmboar grunted and nodded, it prepared its flamethrower move and fire shot out from its mouth, all the way up to Basculin's uvula. Hilda winced as she waited with anticipation as to whether or not her latest plan would work as she hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBasculin's whole body seemed to shake, and its sudden and wild movements shook Emboar and Hilda around the insides of its stomach.

Hilda screamed as she realized that it was most likely the remains of Basculin's last meal, now being regurgitated, along with her and Emboar!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda and Emboar were then both quickly shot up through Basculin's throat, getting soaked in its nasty waste in the process.

But she was trapped in a huge pile of it, Hilda screamed in disgust and clumsily fumbled her way out of the foul pile. She then spotted the lake water and immediately ran towards it, not caring about her safety in the moment and just wanting to be clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emboar!\" Her Emboar shouted, and ran off after her. It caught up to the millimeter tall girl in a few seconds, and swooped her up into its arms once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thank you...\" Hilda said, happy that Emboar was still able to help her, but she couldn't help but groan from how nasty her day had become. It was doubled by the fact the Emboar itself was covered in Basculin's vomit, and the amount on Hilda had mixed with the stuff on Emboar, creating an awful concoction that made Hilda double over and nearly throw up herself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Emboar seemed to understand where Hilda was going when it picked her up, as it went over to the shore of the cave and placed its hand that had Hilda on it down for her to get off. Hilda smiled up at her intelligent Emboar and gladly hopped off. She went over to the water of the lake and quickly jumped inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aahhh... That's sooo much better!\" Hilda exclaimed in relaxation. She might have been afraid to jump in the water before at her terribly tiny height, but here in the cave the waves seemed to not be as strong, so Hilda could float and even swim in it, provided she didn't stray too far from the bank. So Hilda did just that and let the water naturally wash off both her body and her clothes, she was still soaked, but at least she was clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emboar, I wish you could enjoy this...\" Hilda sighed. She looked over at her pig Pokemon to see that it was just watching and waiting by the bank of the water. Hilda shook her head, she knew that as a fire-type Pokemon Emboar would never set foot into water, but at the same time it would never get clean if it didn't wash off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Emboar, let me help you get cleaned up, okay?\" Hilda said as she swam back to dry land. When she got out of the water, she grabbed Emboar's Pokeball and looked at her Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emboar!\" Emboar nodded enthusiastically, seemingly ready and wanting to be cleaned off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This should work! Come back, Emboar!\" Hilda commanded as she tossed her Pokeball at Emboar. The Pokeball opened and sucked Emboar inside once again. Hilda went over and picked up the Emboar-filled Pokeball. She smiled at it. \"Take a rest, Emboar. You deserve it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda then tucked the Pokeball back into her purse and took a look at the cave she had been shot into. It was very dark inside, and her eyes hadn't adjusted well enough to see further into the depths of the cave. However, it wasn't too large from what she could tell. On the other side, the exit was painfully obvious from the way the light shined in from the outside. Hilda nodded to herself and began walking towards the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda was confident that she could make it out of the cave by herself. It would take her a while at her size, but she could make it. She felt Emboar deserved a break, and not only that he was still quite big and visible, but if she went off on her own then there would be very few Pokemon or people that would even be able to see her at her current size. So even though she hated being stuck the size of a speck, Hilda was able to use that unfortunate fact to her advantage and sneak around unseen, at least, she hoped she could...</span></div></div>",

She had half a mind to let Emboar back out and simply ride him to freedom, but she knew that if she did so she'd lose her stealth approach. So she walked on, trying to think of what to do once she made it out on the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Find help. Grow back. Shrink Pansage.\" Hilda repeated to herself, mumbling what had become a mantra in the past few minutes of her travels. She was completely focused on getting her revenge on the petty Pansage that she hardly noticed the creepy-crawly sounds coming from behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tik. Tik. Tik.\" A wild Pokemon's cry was heard. Hilda gasped, now hearing the approaching Pokemon. She quickly turned around and looked, but only in time to see that it was a family of Joltik that had been stalking her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, crap!\" Hilda cried out, and tried to run. But it was too late for her, as one of the pursuing Joltik jumped her, knocking her out in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith their prey out cold, the Joltik gang gathered around Hilda's unconscious body. They cried out their names as they seemed to be cheering. One of the Joltik went forward and, using its mouth and mandibles, deftly wrapped Hilda's body up in its web, encasing the poor girl almost completely, only her head was still visible after the job was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Joltik cried their names out again, and followed their leader as it carried Hilda deeper into the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed as Hilda lay unconscious in her new captivity. Time enough that Hilda was able to recover and wake up. The captured girl yawned as she opened her eyes and woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what... happened...?\" Was the first thing Hilda could say. She tried to wipe her eyes to wake herself up better, but for some reason she found that she could only move her head. She looked down and saw the rest of her body was encased in a sticky, thick, white substance, almost like a spider's webs. She tried to move, tried to break free, but quickly learned that the web was far too strong for her to break on her own. Her mind raced as she tried to piece together how she ended up like this, but then she remembered the Joltik chasing her and then... She gulped as she realized what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been captured by Joltik!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, not again!\" Hilda cried. Not only had she been taken by a wild Pokemon again, but this time she couldn't even get Emboar out to help her. She was strung up near the top of the little cave, being suspended in the air by a string. Hilda felt bad as she realized now that she hadn't been in a cave at all, but instead it was merely a little nest of Joltik and Galvantula. She guess that if she were normal-sized, the \"cave\" would only come up to about her waist. But before she could feel too sorry for herself, the Joltik returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monstrous-looking Joltik crawled along the cave's walls to her. Hilda gulped as she now got a good look at her predators. At only 4 inches tall, Joltik were the world's smallest Pokemon, but to her, the little guys looked like the size of Wailords! If she didn't already feel insignificantly small before, she was certainly feeling tinier than ever now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey, what do you want with me?!\" Hilda shouted. She knew that normally Pokemon wouldn't attack humans, but she figured by now that most Pokemon didn't even see her as being human anymore, instead she was more like a tasty little crumb-sized morsel for them. One that Hilda wasn't sure what they were going to do with...</span></div></div>",

So the micro-sized girl started to rock her body back and forth, suspended as she was by a single string of web, this allowed her to swing herself around in her bindings. Hilda even knocked into the approaching Joltik, startling it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Take that, you little pests!\" Hilda shouted triumphantly, being shrunken so small was still a scary thing to her, but by now she'd have been in far too much trouble at her reduced size to let herself get stopped here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda got some strong momentum from swinging, and the speed at which she swung meant that none of the Joltik could catch her. So she swang on, back and forth, hoping to weaken the single string of web that kept her held up to the top of the cave. It seemed to be working too, as Hilda could feel it slowly start to break. Hilda was getting a little dizzy from all the swinging though, she had started with some control over her path, but now that she was going so fast she had spun out of control and was now just trying to match her movements with the motions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tik! Tik! Tik!\" The Joltik cried. The spider Pokemon shot out more webs at Hilda. One of them hit her and sent her flying in a different direction, totally knocking her off her path, but keeping her encased in her web bondage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agh!\" Hilda grunted from being knocked all over the place, she was about to throw up if this continued much longer. Hilda tried to get back in control of her swings, but it wasn't easy, as she now had multiple Joltik trying to spit webs at her too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>They're trying to get me! I have to get out of this!</i> Hilda thought. She was close to breaking free, she knew it.

Luckily the ground wasn't too far down after all and Hilda landed without injury, although it stung quite a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally!\" Hilda shouted in frustration. She wasted no time and shaking off the last of the weakened webbing around her and breaking free of her strung-up bondage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith herself finally freed, Hilda got up and took off running. She knew the Joltik would be on her like a pack of Houndoom's on a group of defenseless Deerlings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tik! Tik! Tik!\" The cries of the angry Joltik confirmed for Hilda that they were going to be giving her chase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, come on!\" Hilda repeated to herself as she ran from the approaching horde. She fumbled through her purse for the single Pokeball she had that contained a Pokemon, that being her beloved and much needed right now Emboar. Hilda felt around for a few more heartbeat boosting moments before grabbing her desired Pokeball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Emboar, I choose you!\" Hilda yelled as she tossed the Pokeball in front of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA light flashed from the Pokeball and out popped Emboar, just as big as it was before. It was looking rather relaxed from its nap, but at the same it was rather confused as it saw the large group of Joltiks swarming around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buddy! Down here!\" Hilda cried as she caught up to her comparatively giant Emboar. Her Pokemon looked down and grunted in shock as it saw its trainer running for her life with its Pokeball in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmboar swooped up Hilda in its hands and quickly placed her on the top of its head. It waited just a moment for Hilda to get situated before taking off in the fastest run it had ever made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda sighed in relief as she held onto her spot on Emboar's head for dear life. She looked behind and saw that Emboar was actually managing to lose the Joltik pursuers, despite its size. She smiled weakly and thanked her lucky stars that she still had Emboar around to help her. If she were by herself, then she'd have never been able to outrun the Joltik at her pitiful height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hilda counted her blessings, a sudden shadow crept over the tiny trainer and her Pokemon. Hilda looked up and saw something crawling above on the walls of the cave, but it was too dark and the creature was moving too fast for her to make out. Then suddenly, Emboar backed up into a stop. A huge creature jumped down from the walls to in front of Hilda and Emboar, startling both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pan! Sage!\" The giant Pokemon, now seen by Hilda to be a Pansage, cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... No...\" Hilda said softly, looking up at her nemesis in horror. The Pansage had returned again, only this time it was aware of her presence, or at least Emboar's. To make matter worse the green monkey Pokemon had effectively blocked the exit, trapping both Hilda and Emboar inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wild Pansage swiped at the stunned Emboar and, by extension, the millimeter-tall Hilda, and...</span></div></div>",

It's been a good day since her two friends Cheren and Touya and herself started their poke'mon journey. Even though she had a bit a rough patch when she told her father but she pushed through and decided to go on this adventure no matter what with her new Pokemon partner Tepig. She already went through her town, oddly enough there were strange people in knightly costumes in Accumula Town but the blonde didn't really pay much attention to it and gather supplies and went on to route 2. In few minutes the blonde was able to get her second Pokemon, Lillipup. Everything is going well on her first day of adventuring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything is going so well!\" Bianca thought with a huge smile. \"Looks like I can handle my self,\" The blonde thought as well thinking about her father telling her to stay home. Even though she loved her dad she couldn't let a chance like this pass up! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder how Touya and Cheren are doing?\" The blonde thought as the last time she saw them was in Accumula town. \"Maybe they stayed to see what those people knights in costumes had to say. Well I hope we can meet up again,\" Bianca then figures they could meet in Striaton City and have some drinks and some snacks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts didn't last long as she saw two of those knight costume people right in front of her. The two knights didn't notice the blonde as they talk to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do think these experimental things can really help us Liberate Pokemon?\" The female grunt asks as she holds up a small Black and White ball in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" The male grunt replies with a bit of spirit in his voice. \"The scientist told us that these will help lord N with his plan.\" The male grunt then adds. \"But unfortunately they have not made many of these so we have to be careful with them,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes of course. We have to save them when we need them most,\" The female grunt agrees with her comrade. \"We should be going, we need to finish our mission,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to be quick. Let's get going,\" The male grunt said as he starts to run towards Striaton City, this causes the female grunt to let a groan as she quickly tries to put the Black and White Ball in one of pockets as she hears a yell from the Male Grunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm coming!\" The female grunt shouts back as she starts to run but unknowingly throws the Black and White ball backwards and it lands near the blonde trainer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! She drop her ball. I better go give it back to her,\" Bianca thought, the blonde didn't really understand what the two knights were talking about but the kind girl knew they would feel bad about losing something of theirs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond picks it up and squeeze it a bit and suddenly the ball pops and some dust gets all over Bianca and her bag. The blonde coughs from inhaling a bit the dust as well, Bianca wonders why they would be carrying something all this. While the poor girl goes through a coughing fit she didn't notice that her own body is changing. The blonde starts to get smaller and smaller, her shrinking stops once she reaches the height of five inches tall clothes and all! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Bianca is able to regain her sight she sees that things a bit different now. The glass looks quite tall to her now, but something didn't seem right. The blonde takes a looks sees that it's just normal normal grass but it's as tall as her self. Trees also look like towers to her and now a rock looks a table. It didn't take long for the blonde to figure out things out as she realizes something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I've become smaller!\" Bianca shouts as she looks once more and sees how everything is huge now. The blonde starts to freak out a bit at her new sights but is able to calm herself down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't be freaking out right now. It's my first day!\" The blonde thought but she was still scared being this small. Bianca at lest looks on the bright side as he clothes and bag shrunk with her. She knew what she had to do and that was to find help, but at her size it could be hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's right! I can get some help from my Pokemon,\" Bianca thought with a smile on her face as she digs through her green bag and pulls out the poke'ball that is holding Lilipup. \"I hope she can help me,\"The blonde thought as she threw the ball and Lilipup comes out and the pup......<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had just started his Pokemon adventure along with his two friends Bianca and Cheren. His first Pokemon is a Oshawott which he nicked named the male water type Kenki. Touya is in thought as he thinks about what happen in Accumula Town. Cheren and him learn about this group called Team Plasma that are trying to liberate Pokemon along with a mysteries green hair young man that went by N. Touya is wondering what N meant by hearing Kenki's voice, the brown hair boy didn't have much time to think more as he hears a bark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya looks and sees that the bark is coming from a Lilipug, he then remembers when Bianca, Cheren and himself were on route 1. The blonde told him he should get more team mates on his team, since it would be quite dangerous to push Kenki so much. So Touya decides he should try to catch the pup Pokemon and when he is about bring out the poke'ball that holds his Oshawott he hears a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Touya!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man stops himself from bringing out Kenki, he knew that voice belong to his childhood friend Bianca. He looks around to see where the blonde is. But he is unable to find Bianca. He then hears her voices once more when Lilipug gets close to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Touya! I'm down here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya looks down and sees that there is a five inch figure on the pup pokemon's back. The young man bends his knees a bit so he could a better look at figure and then is able to see that the five inch figure is Bianca! The brown hair young man is quite shock at seeing the blonde at a small height while Bianca blushes a bit at the young man's stare. After a few minutes of silence, Touya breaks the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did this happen and are you alright?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I picked up some strange ball that was drop by a person that looks a knight and it popped and covered me in some dust ,\" Bianca answers the first question and then answers the second question with a smile on her face. \"I'm doing fine despite being so small,\" The blonde is quite happy that young man is concern about her safety. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya nods and has a smile on his face, he then figures that the person the blonde is talking about might a grunt of Team Plasma. Could this be a way where team Plasma can liberate Pokemon from their trainers. He didn't have much time to think as he hears Bianca's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Touya could you carry me?\" Bianca asks the giant. \"This little pup is getting a bit tired,\" The blond could see that the Lilipug panting a bit from the running along with the battle Tepig earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mind,\" Touya replies with a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much,\" Bianca said with a smile as she gets off her Lilipug and pulls out the pup Pokemon's ball. \"Thank you for helping me,\" The blonde tells the Lilipug. The pug barks happily as it returns to it's ball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Bianca puts the ball back in her green bag as Touya places his left hand hand down on the ground with his palm open. The blonde smiles as she climbs onto the hand. When Touya sees that the tiny girl is on the palm of his left hand, he lifts his left hand towards his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya feels his cheeks heat up a bit as he looks at the tiny girl. Bianca is quite a beautiful girl to young lad and being able to feel her tiny body brought out some of these feelings. Touya grew a bit of crush on the blonde but thought she wasn't interested in him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca had her own thoughts as well as she thought the giant looks quite handsome and likes the feeling of Touya's warmth. The blonde also grew a crush on the brown hair teen but figure that he wasn't interested so she didn't act on these feelings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter starring at each other for a couple of minutes Bianca is the first to speak.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what should we do Touya?\" Bianca asks as wanting to know what young man wanted to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya thought about it, it is going to be night soon and he is half way on route 2 so he could go all the way back to Nuvema Town or move forward to Striaton City. he could possible go back to Nuvema Town and hopes that Professor Juniper is still in the city and get her help or maybe get some help from Professor Juniper's friend whose name is Fennel.

Touya smiles and nods to the small Bianca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'm going to put you in my bag then,\" Touya said as he opens his bag with his free hand and slowly moves the hand that is holding the small blonde towards the bag. It few seconds Touya puts his left hand in his bag at the bottom of the floor of the bag. The small blonde then climbs down the giant hand and steps on flooring of the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca is quite surprise at how spacious the young man's bag is, sure there are a few books, extra clothes, and other items in the bag but the small blonde could still move around quite well. The blonde then quickly realizes that she is spending to much time about thinking about the bag notices that Touya's hand is still in the bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Touya I'm off your hand now!\" Bianca shouts up with all her might and hopes that he can hear her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Be safe Bianca,\" A whisper like voice came from above and the left hand leaves the bag and soon Bianca's world becomes a bit darker as Touya closes the bag up with bits of light coming through some a little bit of the seeps from the top of the bag. Bianca sits down and tries to comfortable while sitting on the book as she feels her world start to move a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya makes his way back to Nuvema Town and hopes he is able to find Professor Juniper and get help for the small Bianca.

With the tiny Bianca safely tucked away in his bag, the walk there was easy, even for the shrunken blonde. Once Touya stepped back into his hometown he made a beeline for Prof. Juniper's lab. He knocked on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in!\" A feminine voice called from inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya opened the door to the lab and walked inside. There he saw Prof. Juniper looking over some things on her desk. When the professor saw that it was Touya who had come in she smiled and got up to talk to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Touya, what brings you back so soon?\" She asked. \"Having trouble on the road?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya shook his head. He hefted his bag up, gently, to Juniper's desk. \"Take a look at this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuniper watched with a curious expression as Touya reached into his bag and pulled out what looked like a small child's doll. But on closer inspection she saw that this was no doll, it was Bianca! Touya placed the tiny figure on Juniper's desk, next to his bag.<br>\r\nJuniper looked at it for a little and wondered why, and how, Touya had a doll of Bianca in his bag. When all of a sudden, the tiny figure started to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Professor!\" Bianca squeaked, waving a \"hello\" to Juniper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuniper gasped and covered her mouth with her hand. The doll was not a doll after all, but a tiny Bianca in the flesh! The Pokemon professor could hardly believe it was real, but she was staring right it, a real, living tiny person. Juniper's curiosity got the better of her and she poked the tiny girl in her tiny stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh! That tickles!\" Bianca giggled, recoiling from Juniper's giant finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuniper was amazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I... How did this happen?\" Juniper asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca explained to her how she got so small, seeing team Plasma and picking up the ball, how Touya found and helped her, and everything. Juniper listened intently, and calmed down as the story went on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's almost unbelievable.\" Juniper said. \"I wouldn't believe it if I wasn't looking at you right now. Thank you for taking care of her, Touya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya smiled and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, do you think you can help me, professor?\" Bianca asked, hopeful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think there are some tests we need to run first.\" Juniper said. Bianca looked saddened by the answer. Juniper saw this and tried to cheer her up. \"But I'm sure we'll figure something out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now.\" Juniper began. \"First things first...\"</span></div></div>",

It also surprised the professor when Bianca tells the older woman that her Lilipug didn't shrink with her, so Juniper asked to the tiny blonde to bring out her two Pokemon. Bianca did what she was told and saw that even Tepig remain it's original size, the pig Pokemon saw her shrunken trainer and nuzzles her, the tiny tiny blonde is happy to see that her first Pokemon is worried about her as she gave the Tepig some pets on it's snot. Juniper sees nothing is wrong with the Pokemon either and goes to her next test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the professor quick scans Bianca and two Pokemon and looks at her computer to if there is anything wrong but sees that it's taking a while to even processes the data. Juniper sighs at seeing that it's going to take the entire night to even finish. The professor looks at the clock on the wall and sees that it's six thirty pm.

But knew it would be safer for her to stay home but seeing Bianca's determination about wanting to travel the older woman couldn't help but smile and thinking about when she started her journey. Touya has no objections since he wants Bianca to go on her journey as well since that's what she wants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay you don't have to go home but you have to stay with Touya or me,\" Juniper said to the tiny blonde. \"So who do you want to stay with tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca is happy that Juniper is will listen to her and could fell that Touya agrees about not telling her father.

Fennel has better equipment here then I do at my lab,\" Juniper answers the question. \"But it might difficult to run test now since Fennel and my self are so small,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's alright. Amanita can run the test,\" Fennel adds and looks at her giant younger sister. \"I shown her how to work the machines,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I know how to work them but I don't think I can handle it all by myself,\" Amanita said feeling a little over whelm about doing this all on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry you Touya here. He help you out,\" Juniper said looking at the giant Pokemon trainer. \"I'm sure if you tell him what to do he can be an excellent assistant,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanita looks at the older boy and wonders what he will say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope I can be assistance Dr. Amanita,\" Touya answers want to help out any way he could.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanita is quite happy to see that Touya is willing to follow her orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Let's get the test started then,\" Amanita said ready to work and help her tiny older sister out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

It's about noon as Amanita runs the finale test they could and looks at the results and sighs at what's on the screen. The tiny girls are on a desk as they watch Amanita.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again nothing,\" Amanita said as spins her chair. \"What ever they are using it's quite hard to find,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had the same problem,\" Juniper said to the grade school giantess. \"There's nothing wrong with the body once you get hit and inhale and seems that what ever gets into our body system doesn't last for long enough for us to even study it,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who ever made this must be quite impressive,\" Fennel adds wanting to learn about what could possible be in the Black and White ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we really need to get one of those balls,\" Bianca notes as the blonde figures that it would much easier to to understand what happen to them if they get the source of the problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it seems that way,\" Juniper said and then looks at Touya. \"Touya you're going to have help us once again. We're going to need you to get one of those balls, but you have to find out a way not to get your self shrunk,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya nods in agreement will to take on the mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Let's do our best on this mission!\" Bianca beams ready to help and go on a journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be counting on you,\" Touya replies to the tiny blonde with a smile. Bianca sees this and blushes a bit at Touya's words and his warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! I'm amazed Bianca. I would never do something like that,\" Amanita notes at the tiny blonde's courage to continue her adventure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing much,\" Bianca replies to the grade school giantess. \"It's just I want to go on this journey,\" The tiny blonde being quite humble about her reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuniper and Fennel are both proud about Bianca chose to continue on her journey and wonder what they should do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I still think it's cool,\" Amanita replies feeling admiration for the tiny blonde. \"So Sis what are you and Professor Juniper going to do then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good question,\" Fennel replies and then looks at Juniper. \"Let's have a quick talk Juniper,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I agree,\" Juniper says back and soon the dark blue hair woman and light brown hair woman start to whisper to each other. Touya and Amanita could hear them all since they spoke softly, even Bianca couldn't hear what the two older woman are talking about.

It's going to take thirty minutes for our food to get done,\" Amanita said as she gets off the phone. \"I did my best for you Sis along with Professor Juniper and Bianca so you guys have the smallest meals that you want,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you very much,\" Fennel said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya nods as he is about to go down stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See ya in a bit Touya,\" Bianca shouts to teen boy as loud as she could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya smiles as he turns around waves back to everyone as he goes down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can go if you wanted to,\" Juniper says to Bianca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine Professor.

But let's get your clothes order first alright,\" Amanita adds feeling they should do one task first. The three tiny girls agree and soon they start their shopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_________________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince he had some time, Touya checks the Dream Yard once more. Maybe he could find something that could help with Bianca and the other getting their height back. Sadly he is unable to find anything to help as he exits the building and sees a girl coming towards him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" The girl said with a smile. \"You're from Nuvema Town right?\" Touya nods in a yes manner. \"That's neat. That must mean you got a Pokemon right? So what did you pick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oshawott,\" Touya replies to the girl with brown hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, would you mind taking a Pansear then?\" The girls asks. \"I'm giving away some of my Pokemon's litter,\" The girls explains more to Touya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya looks at the girl and then thinks about Kenki and how nice it would be to have a new team mate and friend. It also makes Touya a bit happy about having another Pokemon as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I can take your Pansear off your hands,\" Touya answers and the girl smiles as she gives the brown hair boy Pansear's pokeball. With his free hand Touya goes into his hand brings out Kenki's ball and then get the Oshawott out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenki looks at his trainer and sees that Touya extra poke'ball. Touya smiles as he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to meet your new friend Masou?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenki makes a happy sound as Touya lets out the fire monkey Pokemon. It doesn't take long for Pansear to warm up to his new trainer and Kenki, Touya is happy to have another team member and friend to join them. Touya tells them that they have to be going and so returns them back to their balls. The brown hair boy looks the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you very much,\" Touya thankful for the girl's kindness and waves her goodbye. The girl waves back and hopes to meet more kind trainers like teen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya didn't waste time as he went in and out of the cafe/gym, he would challenge the gym some other time right now his top priority is getting the food back to the girls. He quickly walks back up to the apartment and knocks on the door. Amanita opens the door and is happy to see food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Touya,\" Amanita said with a smile as she let's him in. \"Let's get get the others and have a nice meal,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya nods in agreement. </span></div></div>",

Touya introduced the gang to his newest Pokemon, Masou the Pansear, who was a big hit. Bianca enjoyed the food, it was huge to her! While Juniper and Fennel discussed more ways to grow back, amongst other things. And Amanita watched her shrunken sister and friends with bewilderment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dinner ended and Amanita offered to clean up, Touya then offered to help her. While they were cleaning up, Amanita remembered something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! That's right!\" She started, shooting up. She looked at Juniper. \"When I ordered your clothes, the site said it would take a whole week for them to come!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A whole week?\" Juniper asked, a little surprised. She hadn't seen the checkout process, so this was news to her. \"Did they lose all their Delibirds?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know!\" Amanita admitted. \"That's what they said. It might take longer too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So does that mean..?\" Touya started to ask, before Bianca answered him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. Looks like we might be stuck in town for a while!\" She squeaked, sounding a little excited for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Touya said, looking down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter?\" Bianca asked, but then got a clue. \"Oh, you're sad because you want to continue on your journey...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's okay..\" Touya said honestly. \"I have to watch over you all, and there's a Gym to challenge here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Touya picked up the last of the mess and went to throw it away. Amanita and the tiny girls just watched, thinking he wasn't being as honest as even he might have thought. The shrunken ladies especially thought they were holding him back...</span></div></div>",

The three tiny girls were still on the kitchen table as Amanita is the computer trying to find a way for the package to get her quicker. Touya after cleaning everything up is now sitting on the couch reading a book that is from his bag that is titled \"How to make delectable and balance meals for your Pokemon and your self camp out edition\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. But the question is how,\" Juniper adds as the professor tries to think of a way to improve his mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah....\" Bianca said as she takes a quick look at Touya and then remember something. The blonde remembers when Cheren, Touya and herself got their Poke'mon and Touya battled them both. She notice there was a glint in his eyes as they fought. \"I know a way,\" Bianca said happily as Juniper and Fennel look at the blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya continues to read his book, feeling that's he is getting better understanding at making better meals along with balance and making good portions for everyone. He then starts to think about what everyone should have dinner until a voice interrupts his thoughts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Touya! I want to have a battle with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya turns his head and sees a Munna carrying the three tiny girls on her back. Touya looks confuse for a moment looking at the tiny blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry you don't have to have the battle here. Luckily I have a test room where nothing can be broken,\" Fennel adds hoping that Touya will take the challange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you say Touya?\" Juniper said, hoping that Bianca is correct and also she wants to see how Bianca and Touya will handle the battle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya closes his book and then smiles at the tiny girls. He quickly puts the book in his bag and pulls out his two poke'balls, the girls are happy to see that Touya is smiling. Soon they enter the test room so they could have the battle, the room is quite simple with nothing being in it besides some logos on the floor indicating that it's a testing room for Pokemon to show their moves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Let's get this battle started!\" Juniper shouts as loud as she could as Fennel and herself are on the outside and in the middle of the room while Touya is on the left while Bianca is on the right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Penelope here will be my first Pokemon,\" Bianca said ready to fight, Touya is happy to see that the tiny blonde is nicknaming her Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on out Masou,\" Touya said as he throw's the fire monkey ball and soon Pansear comes out ready to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Penelope use Yawn!\" Bianca shouts as loud as she could and the pink Pokemon is able to hear her tiny trainer. Penelope makes a fake yawn as a small dust comes towards to Masou.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Masou quickly doge an use lick,\" Touya says as the Pansear avoids the yawn by running around it, the fire monkey gets close to the pink Pokemon and then licks it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is bad for Bianca,\" Juniper notes, ghost attacks are especially strong against psychic types. Fennel nods and also adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plus it looks like Lick extra effect is kicking in as well,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuniper and looks and sees that Penelope is having trouble moving, the Pokemon Professor knew that the Munna is under the effect of paralysis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong Penelope?\" Bianca asks as the tiny blonde sees that her Pokemon is having trouble moving. Juniper and Fennel both give each other a look that have to give Bianca a lesson about types after this battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Masou finish this with Incinerate!\" Touya shouts as Masou shoots a fire ball from it's mouth at the Munna. Munna could not move and gets hit by the fire ball and gets knocked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you fore your efforts,\" Biacna said as she returns Penelope back to her ball. The tiny blonde puts the ball back and then pulls out another ball and shouts. \"Let's do our best Allie,\" Bianca throws the ball and the Lillipug comes out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This will be an even match,\" Fennel said seeing that either Pokemon had a direct advantage over the other. Juniper nods in agreement as Touya makes the first move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Masou use Lick,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMasou quickly runs towards to pup Pokemon about to lick it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allie use tackle!\" Bianca shouts and the Lillipug rams into the fire monkey, Touya watches as it looks like the attack is also a critical as well! When Masou falls back everyone can see that the fire Monkey is out could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did it Allie!\" Bianca shouts happily as the pup Pokemon barks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did well, Masou,\" Touya kindly says as he returns the fire type back to it's ball. Touya then picks up another ball throws it as he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's do our best Kenki,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Oshawott smiles as it gets ready to fight. Juniper and Fennel both start to feel excitement as they watch the battle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allie use tackle once more!\" Biacna shouts as the pup Pokemon runs towards the sea otter Pokemon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Use tackle yourself Kenki,\" Touya said as the Oshawott runs towards the pup Pokemon as well. The two Pokemon soon clash against each other as they both hit each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds Allie falls down, the hit from Kenki is too much for the pup Pokemon and she faints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Allie for your help\" Bianca said as she returns the Lilipug back to it's ball. The tiny blonde puts the ball back into her bag and then pulls out her last Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on out Fia,\" Bianca shouts as she throws the ball and comes out is a Tepig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuniper and Fennel watch the last match happen as Kenki is able to beat Fia easily with a water gun. The older woman are both happy to see that both trainers did their best and it seems they enjoyed the battle. Biacna returns Fia back to her ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did a great job Kenki,\" Touya says as the water type makes a happy sound. \"Thanks for the match Bianca,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome. I hope this makes you feel better,\" Bianca replies as she is happy to see the giant teen being hapy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya looks at Biacna and then looks at the other tiny girls and realizes they did this since they thought he was sad about not traveling fast. The teen boy kicks himself mentally for making the tiny girls think that he was holding him back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you two are done let's go heal your Pokemon with my own healing machine,\" Fennel said happy to have bought that Poke'Center healing machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we'll give a lesson about types,\" Juniper said as Bianca nods happily, the blonde wants to know about the different types.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya nods as well, the brown hair boy is happy the girls still want to help him. Touya thinks to himself that he'll enjoy traveling this slow and taking up the sights, the pokemone, the people and possible learning about the tiny girls. Touya bends a bit and place his right hand the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Touya!\" Bianca beams as she climbs up the giant hand and onto it's palm. Juniper and Fennel both smile as they climb on as well, Touya blushes a bit from feeling their bodies on his hand. This is something he would need to get use to. Touya carrying the girls and Kenki walking by his trainer exit the testing room and back to the living room. Next......<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Touya and Bianca decide to let their Pokemon rest in their balls and the otter Pokemon enjoys being out of his ball and eating some berries. While Kenki eats he watches as the tiny Juniper and Fennel both start a lesson about types to Touya and the other shrunken girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the lesson, Touya feels that he has gain more knowledge about how Pokemon types work. Bianca on the other hand need some extra work on remembering types so Juniper continues to help the Blonde. Even though Bianca got some answers wrong and confuse about some the information the blonde is happy about learning about her Poekmon. Touya looks and sees that Kenki fell asleep, the brown hair boy puts his jacket on the Oshawott deciding to let Kenki stay out of the ball for the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nice of you,\" Fennel says as she walks near the giant teen. \"You're going to make a great trainer,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Touya replies with a smile, happy about the complement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well since you're happy help me with making dinner,\" Fennel adds with a smile. \"Everyone is going to want to eat something and since everyone is busy it's up to you and me,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya looks and sees that the dark blue hair woman is correct, Amanita is still on the computer while Juniper and Bianca are still working about types. Touya then nods to agree to help the tiny Fennel to make dinner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great. Let's get cooking,\" Fennel said as Touya puts his left hand on the ground the tiny woman gets on his palm and soon the two go into the kitchen. \"Let's see what's in the fridge,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes Touya and the tiny Fennel gather enough ingredients to tonight dinner, it will some burgers and a salad on the side. Fennel knew she couldn't really fry the meat, but at least she could wash and chop the vegetables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Touya you handle the burger meat while I take care of the vegetables,\" Fennel said with a smile as the tiny scientist is ready to help make dinner. Fennel is tall enough to use the sink and use a small enough knife. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya nods as he does his job and starts to fry the burgers. It's quite easy for Touya since it's a simple cooking recipe when he sees that doing well he turns his head to see how Fennel is doing and sees that tiny dark blue hair woman is washing the vegetables but sees that Fennel is getting some water on her self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Touya I can handle this,\" Fennel shouts as she sees the giant looking at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you need a bit of help, You don't want all of your clothes to get wet,\" Touya replies, Fennel looks down and sees that he is telling the truth. Her lab coat is now wet and shirt with few drops of water on it as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you can help me,\" Fennel said as Touya nods as he walks over to sink, the dark hair woman gets out of the sink takes off her lab coat as she goes to the knife. \"And I'll chop the veggies,\" Touya nods but blushes a bit as he gets a better look at Fennel's figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya nods once more as he washes the vegetables while the tiny Fennel starts to cut up carrots. Fennel smiles as Touya and herself work together on the salad and sees that the brown hair boy is quite good at washing vegetables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are going to make a good husband someday,\"  Fennel comments on Touya's talent in the kitchen. \"Who ever is going be your wife is to love a helping hand. I can envy her,\" Touya wonders what Fennel means as the dark hair woman continues. \"Since I'm a scientist it's quite hard to catch a guy since I work so many hours I doubt any guy would want to marry someone like or Juniper,\" Fennel giggles a bit at the end but with seems a bit sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure any guy would love to marry you,\" Touya said wanting to cheer the tiny Fennel up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you're just saying to be nice, but Thanks Touya,\" Fennel replies back a smile. \"He'll definitively made a good husband someday,\" The dark blue hair woman thought as Touya finishes washing the vegetables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sis!\" A voice comes from behind Touya and Fennel, the two turn around and see Fennel's younger sister at the kitchen entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Amanita are working on dinner,\" Fennel yells as loud as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see that but you water all over yourself,\" Amanita said as she gets closer. \"Well at lest this is a bit easier. Juniper and Bianca are taking a bath and you can join them so we can your bath taken care of,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Fennel replies want to take a bit of a bath. \"I'll leave everything to you Touya,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brown hair boy nods as he goes back to check on his burgers. Fennel smiles once more and thinks he defiantly make a good husband. Amanita picks up her sister and takes the tiny Fennel to the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for the bath, soon Bianca, Juniper and Fennel are out and fully dress. Bianca is wearing her pajamas from the other night while Junpier and Fennle both wear some shits and pants from Amanita's dolls. Luckily Bianca's underwear seem to fit well enough for the older woman. The group then has dinner with Touya and Amanita. Juniper, Bianca and Amanita eat and think the burger and salad both taste good, Touya and Fennel are happy to see their cooking is bringing smiles to the others. Bianca, Juniper, and Fennel will sleep on Amanita's dresser while Touya sleeps on the couch. Everyone agrees on sleeping arrangements, Touya cleans up as Amanita takes the tiny girls to her bed room. Soon everyone falls asleep. The next morning....</span></div></div>",

Touya says morning to the Oshawott as he gets up from the couch. Kenki makes a happy sound as Touya walks around for a bit and sees that he is the only one that's up. The teen boy decides to make breakfast for the three tiny girls and the grad shooter. Touya and Kenki both enter the kitchen and the brown hair teen takes the the right ingredients to make some waffles. As he starts to make the batter the grade school scientist comes into the kitchen. Amanita is wearing pink pajamas with a Munna pattern on them, at first the young scientist is scared to see the teen boy in the kitchen but then remembers that it's Touya. Amanita then walks into the kitchen and says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good Morning Touya,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning,\" Touya replies as he starts to stir the batter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh he's making breakfast, he did the same thing last night but with Fennel's help,\" Amanita thought as she walks to the laptop to check the news of the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenki watches his trainer and starts to memorize the way Touya moves his wrist, the Oshawott starts to move wrist the best he could. and starts to his wrist while holding his sea shell. After checking out the news Amanita gets back up and sees that the water Pokemon is copying Touya movement, the grade school scientist wants to study it but realizes that it's seven am. Amanita quickly runs to her room to check up on the tiny girls, the brown hair girl sees that the tiny girls are all starting to stir.  It didn't long for Amanita to pick them up and move them towards the kitchen where the tiny girls see that Touya made waffles and has some whip cream and strawberries with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This looks good! Thanks so much Touya!\"  Bianca said as she and other tiny woman get place on the kitchen table. Touya nods in response, happy to see that Bianca is going to enjoy her breakfast. Touya quickly makes some berry mix meals for his Pokemon team along with Bianca's Pokemon team. Bianca and Touya both let thier Pokemon out and soon the Pokemon eat their breakfast as Touya sits down at the kitchen table. Touya sees that everyone is enjoying their meal, he looks at the tiny girls and sees they are still in their pajamas, Biacna enjoying her piece of waffle with pieces of strawberry, Fennel is almost studying food rather eating it but sees that the dark hair woman is eating it. The brown hair boy the looks at Juniper and sees that Pokemon Professor does not have her hair in a pony tail, Touya blushes a bit and thinks Juniper looks cute with her hair hanging down. Touya stops staring and then gets to eating his waffles, but unfortunately for him Fennel notice him staring at the Pokemon Professor and starts to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's got laughing?\" Juniper asks her collage friend and the dark hair woman stops and looks at her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing. So Touya what do you want to do today?\" Fennel asks the giant, Touya looks down at the tiny dark hair woman replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to challenge the Striaton Gym,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good. I want to challenge them as well,\" Bianca adds as she finishes her breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I want to join you two. I want see how well you will do,\" Juniper said want to see the gym battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too!\" Fennel adds as Amanita sighs at her older sister's energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but I think everyone should get ready to leave then,\" Amanita says as the others agree with a nod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone quickly take turns taking a shower and getting dress. Touya is wearing a white shirt, black pants and his red/black boots. Amanita is wearing the same exact clothes from yesterday as the tiny girls wear the same clothes they ware yesterday as well. Touya puts the tiny girls in his bag and soon Touya and Amanita walk of the apartment and head to the Striaton gym. </span></div></div>",

Touya wonders how a gym battle is going to be, he was in the gym yesterday since the cafe' and gym and both of the same. Who ever was the gym leader must be in the very back. Amanita is wondering at how Bianca is going to battle until she hears a voice coming from Touya and her left side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're taking the gym right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya and Amanita both stop and turn their heads to left, the grade school girl saw a teen black hair and glasses as Touya sees his other childhood friend Cheren. Touya fist pumps with his right hand to indicate to Cheren that childhood friend is right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good to see you're up for it,\" Cheren said smiling a bit. \"I'm going to challenge it myself,\" The black hair teen then looks at the younger girl with Touya. \"So who's your friend Touya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\"m Amanita,\" The grade school girl answers for herself. \"I'm going to watch Touya's battle with the gym leaders,\" Cheren nods hearing this and glad to seeing Touya is making friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good you're making a friend,\" Cheren comments on the brunette grade school girl. \"Also there's something I need to ask, have you seen Bianca? I haven't seen her since two days ago,\" Touya and Amanita both knew where the blonde is, in Touya's bag. Before Touya or Amanita can answer the question Cheren continues to talk. \"I want to ask about Professor Juniper as well. I tried to call her yesterday and couldn't get a hold of her and tried again but I didn't get an answer. Have you heard from Professor Juniper?\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs Touya and Amanita both try to think of a way to answer Cheren's question, the tiny girls in Touya's bag hear what's going on outside of the bag. Fennel sits on one of Touya books while Juniper and Bianca stand on the bottom of the bag's cloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well do you think we should tell him?\" Fennel asks the other two shrunken girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know we can trust him,\" Bianca said with a smile, Cheren is her childhood friend as well and knew he would be a good help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuniper on the other hand wonder if it's good idea to idea to invole Cheren in this, also how could they possible be able to give their answer to Touya and Amanita. Juniper then remembers about Xtransceivers! The Pokemon professor knew that her Xtransceiver is still at her home at it's normal size and Juniper remembers that her collage friend accidentally broke their Xtansceiver during experiment. That would mean that Bianca is their last hope, Juniper then looks at Bianca and asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bianca did you have your Xtransceiver with you when you shrunk?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. It's in my bag,\" Bianca answers back. \"Oh! We can use my Xtransceiver to give Touya the okay about telling Cheren about what's going on,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I was thinking as well,\" Juniper said, happy to see the blonde getting the idea. \"But I think we should think about this before we call. We have to make sure we all agree about telling Cheren about what happen,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca and Fennel both nod and soon the tiny girls have a quick talk about what to do. It doesn't talk long and soon Bianca pulls her Xtransceiver out of her bag and dials Touya's number. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya hears his Xtransceiver ringing and raises heft arm to his face to see that it's Bianca calling him on his Xtransceiver.

The two figure since Touya's Xtransceiver is closer enough to Bianca her self it might work with her Xtransceiver. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheren becomes curious when he hears Bianca's voice. He watches as Touya says okay to Bianca as Amanita looks at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go to more of private place,\" Amanita suggest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheren nods in agreement, wanting to find out what Bianca could be talking about.

The grade school girl nods her head and then turns to Cheren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bianca along with Professor Juniper and my sister have been shrunk to small size because of team Plasma and right now they are in Touya's bag,\" Amanita explains the basics to Cheren. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black hair trainer looks at Amanita not really believing what Amanita is telling him. Before Cheren could question the grade school girl Touya's Xtranscevier goes off once more. Touya quickly answers the Xtranscevier and everyone in the alley hears Juniper's voice come out of the device. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Touya, I think Cheren will be convince once he sees us,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya answers okay as he ends the call and then puts his hand into his bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken girls see the giant hand, Fennel is bit worried about Touya just snatching them but then sees the giant hand lays down on near them Touya is keeping his palm open and waits for the girls to climb on.

He's always been that way,\" Bianca adds remember her child hood with the brown hair trainer. The blonde then climbs onto the giant hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true,\" Juniper thought as she remembers at how well Touya is taking care of his Pokmeon right now. The orange hair woman smiles at how grown up Touya is becoming as she gets onto the giant hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Touya feels that all of the girls have gotten on his hand, he slowly lifts his hand out the bag and carefully pulls his hand close to his chest so girls out have a wall behind them so they would not fall. Cheren watched Touya put his hand into this bag and pull out something, but the black hair trainer didn't really see what Touya pulled out and gets a closer and look is quite to see to see that Amanita told the truth.

Cheren understood what Touya was doing but he still felt this could a bit much for Bianca to handle, but he remains silent as he remembers that Bianca still wants to continue this journey despite her reduce size.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait aren't we suppose to keep ourselves hidden?\" Bianca asks, despite a bit ditzy even the blonde knew that a tiny young woman would cause some up roar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It should be just fine if we show ourselves with the gym leaders,\" Juniper answers the blonde's question and continues to talk to explain herself. \"After Touya and you left my lab to get a night rest I contact the Pokemon league and other trust worthy people and explain what's going on. I'm sorry Bianca I never told you since I thought we could fine a cure when we went to Fennel's,\" Juniper looks down with a frown on her face since the light brown hair woman feels that she broke Bianca's trust about telling someone about the blonde's condition but she had to warn people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright Professor Juniper, you were just looking out for everyone. If you can trust those people with what I happen I can trust them as well,\" Bianca replies back with a smile.

The gym is run by triplets, all young men,\" Fennel said with a smile and continues to talk about the gym leaders. \"It's not going to be to bad since they're the first gym trainers usually.

Good job,\" Juniper praise the blonde trainer, happy that Bianca remembers how types work with each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Professor Juniper,\" Bianca happy to impress Juniper about a little bit of knowledge. \"I must have remember because of the extra lessons that you and Professor Fennel taught Touya and me last night,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome Bianca,\" Fennel said with a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll be watching you three as well.

Touya looks around as it looks like same along with a red current blocking further ahead of the other rooms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" A voices from the left side of the group, everyone looks and sees a women cashier behind a table along with some pastries that were baked just this morning. \"Are you three to have breakfast or to challenge one of the gym leaders?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Him and me are going to challenge the gym, she only here to watch,\" Cheren speaks for everyone and the cashier nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, just walk towards the curtain and press the switch to move on,\" The cashier finishes and goes back to looking the bake goods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three look over the current and see that there is a fire symbol on the red curtain along with three switches on the floor in front the current are three colors. The switch on the left is green with a leaf symbol on it, the middle is red with a flame symbol and the switch on the right is blue with a water drop symbol on it. It only took a second for Touya and Cheren to figure out the puzzle and both step on the blue switch and a sound comes out of the speaker and the red curtain opens up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The puzzle of the gym doesn't seem to hard,\" Cheren notes as it looks like the gym is quizzing the challenger on what types have advantages over the other types. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even so be careful the trainers will cause you some trouble,\" Amanita said a little worry about how this will go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will be, thanks Amanita,\" Touya answers for Cheren and himself and Amania smiles back and thinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be cheering for you three,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Touya, Cheren Amania move forward and....... </span></div></div>",

Then the group watches as an another person comes behind the green hair young man and moves to the green hair young man's left and twirlers around and faces Touya and the others. The group sees that the second person has red hair that looks like a flame and is also wearing a waiter suit as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Chili! I light things up with Fire-type Pokemon,\" The red hair waiter says with confidence and the group looks at the green hair young man again and sees that another person come out behind the green hair waiter and move to his left and twirlers around before facing Touya and the others. The group sees that the third waiter has blue hair with a bang covering the right side of his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a Water-type specialist, and my name is Cress. Pleased to make your acquaintance,\" The blue hair waiter said in a soothing voice and the finally the green hair waiter then spins around and faces Touya and the others and says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And my name is Cilan. I like grass type Pokemon,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it's true there is three gym leaders in this gym,\" Cheren said as he look at the three gym leaders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, and all three of them are brothers,\" Amania adds as well since her sister and herself have talked to the to the brothers on occasion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was nice trick,\" Touya commenting on the two other brothers hiding behind the one name Cilan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. We've been working on that some time,\" Chili says in somewhat proud way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I wish I was out to see the trick,\" Bianca's voice coming from Touya bag. The gym leaders hear the voice and they wonder what is going on until Touya quickly puts his right hand into the bag and waits a couple of seconds. The three brothers watch as Touya pulls his hand out and they see three tiny girls on the young man's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! So you're Touya and this must be Bianca and.... Professor Juniper and Professor Fennel!?!\" Cress braking from his calm personility to see who the other two tiny people Touya's hand are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, We've got shrunk as well,\" Fennel said as she rubs the back of her head with her left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll make sure to inform everyone tonight after everyone has their battle here,\" Juniper adds as well and continues to talk. \"So who should go first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good question,\" Cilan says as he looks at the three challengers, normally it would just be one trainer coming up to them, but they never really had three trainers come up at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm too fired up to think! Let's just have a triple batter. That should work shouldn't?\" Chili said as the red hair waiter is getting anxious for a battle to happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I think it could work but I think it would be best to ask our challengers if that would okay,\" Cress says to his fiery brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. So how would you three like to battle?\" Cilan asks the three challengers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mind, since we're childhood friends we'll work together well,\" Cheren agreeing with joining Touya and Bianca on a team and face the Striaton City gym leaders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! We're going to be totally unstoppable!\" Bianca beams as the tiny blonde agrees as well. \"Also when we win you have to do your trick so I can see it,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll show the strength of our bonds,\" Touya adds on, agreeing as well to the triple battle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Touya, I'm surprise you can say that with a straight face,\" Amania comments on what Touya said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, how about the three ladies not battling enjoy some snacks and drinks at the table over there,\" Cless said as he points to a table in the left corner of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay that sounds good,\" Amania agreeing with Cless's suggestion. \"I'll take Professor Juniper and Sis off your hands then Touya,\" The brown hair youth nods his head as the grade school girl walks over and places her arms close to Touya's hand with an open palm and waits for the two older women to climb on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll be cheering for you three,\" Juniper says with a smile as she climbs onto Amania's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck,\" Fennel adds and soon follows Juniper and gets on her younger sister's giant palm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanai while holding the two tiny women walks over to the table, Touya in the mean time pulls his right hand near the collar of his jacket and Bianca slowly gets up and sits down on Touya's left should, ready to take on the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright with everything ready let's battle,\" Cilan says with a smile as he pulls a poke'ball out as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\"m getting fired up!\" Chile adds as he pulls a poke'ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's have a good battle,\" Cless adds as well with himself pulling a Poke'ball out as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya, Bianca and Cheren both nod as well as they get a poke'ball out out as well and soon everyone throws their poke'ball as they say the Pokemon's name or nick name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on out Masou!\" Touya exclaims as the fire monkey comes out of the poke'ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's do our best Penelope!\" Bianca yells but comes out like a squeak to some of the giants and the psychic pig comes out of her poke'ball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go Purloin!\" Cheren shouts a cat Pokemon comes out of his poke'ball<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to shine Lillipup!\" The gym leaders all yell at once as three pup Pokemon come out of their poke'balls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the table, Amania is siting and watch the battle while Professor Juniper and Professor Fennel are on the table watching the battle as they share one giant cookie together from taking a small piece off from the giant cookie. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Cheren is able to do his own thing as he was able to get one of the Lillipups over to him for a one on one fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It quite interesting to see how they battle,\" Fennel says as she watches the fight as she takes another bite of her cookie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Juniper agrees with her collage friend as she takes another bit of a cookie. \"Touya and Bianca are working together quite and Cheren is able to hold his own in the battle,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're doing well.... but it looks like they could be doing better,\" Amania said as she observes the battle as she takes a sip of her drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's still the early part of the battle so let's see where it goes,\" Juniper said,feeling confident about her student's potential as Pokemon trainers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Masuo use Incinerate and Penelope use Psybeam!\" Touya says as the two Pokemon fallow his orders and the two pokemon do their attacks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pansear shoots out some fire balls from it's mouth as Munna shoots out a pink energy beam from it's forehead and both attacks hit the two Lillipugs. Both pup Pokemon let out a cry as they both fall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Use Scratch to finish this Purloin,\" Cheren says as the cat Pokmeon quickly runs up at the Lilipug and scratches the pup Pokemon and the Lilipug falls down as it makes a cry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCilan, Chile and Cress smile sadly as they see their Lillipugs get beaten by the challengers and all three brothers take out a poke'ball and return each Lilipug back to it's ball and said thanks to their Poekmon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job everyone!\" Fennel cheers for the group as loud as she could yell. Juniper and Amania are happy as well but it's not over yet as the gym leaders still have their last Pokemon left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! Looks like things are heating up!\" Chile says as he pulls out his final poke'ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll put all our hopes on our last Pokemon,\" Cress says as he pulls final poke'ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like this is our last chance,\" Cilan adds as he pulls out his final poke'ball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya with the tiny Binca on his shoulder and Cheren watch the brothers throw the poke'ball and see what kind Pokemon were in the ball. The three see the three Pokemon are Pansear, Panpour, and Pansage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's their last Pokemon,\" Cheren says as and he is able to tell his Purloin to attack until Cilan yells. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Triangle formation!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya, Bianca and Cheren watch as the elemetal for a triangle formation as they put their backs on each other and start to twirler around while keeping their backs on each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This could tricky,\" Cheren said as he watches the elemental monkeys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Use Work Up Pansage,\" Cilan says and the leaf type monkey starts to have an green energy around him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Pansear it's your turn. Use Lick on that Munna!\" Chile commands and soon the three together charge the pink psychic Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! If they hit Penelope with that lick attack she's get badly jut an possible paralyzed,\" Bianca says as she watches and tries to think up something. Touya being the only one to hear the tiny blonde since she is on his shoulder knew that he had to make sure to help out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Masou get in front of Penelope and use Incinerate on those three spinning monkeys,\" Touya said as his Pansear runs to where Munna is to try to get in front of the psychic Pokemon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think it will be that easy,\" Cress says and then says his command. \"Panpour use Water Gun on the challenger's Pansear,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the three monkeys are nearing Penelope with Mosou running from the left, when Panpour is facing Masou water monkey then shoots out a water attack from it's mouth at the fire monkey. Touya watches as Masou is not fast enough to doge the water attack and gets hit. Along with getting small damage from one the Lilipup and plus this Water gun, the fire Monkey then falls backwards and faints. Cheren watches and knows it would be news if Munna gets it hit so he hopes his plan will work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Purloin run over there and use scratch before that Pansear uses it's attack,\" Cheren says as the cat Pokemon starts to run towards three spining monkeys and the Munna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just like my brother said. W-We're not going to make it that easy,\" Cilan says and then continues. \"Pansage use Vine Whip!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheren figures that one of those monkeys would attack, but with the monkey spinning around Pansage would have a hard time hitting the cat since it's not even facing Purloin he believes that they may have a chance. Unfortunately for Cheren and Purloin they didn't notice the vines coming out of the tree on top of Pansage's head! The vines then quickly reach over to the Purloin and both vines hit the cat Pokemon on both sides of it's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darn, I shouldn't have underestimated them,\" Cheren thought as Purloin faints from the hit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Bianca tell Touya what she wanted to do or Touya could say, Pansear uses it's lick attack on Penelope and the poor psychic type gets hit with a critical and soon faints from the attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a dangerous combination,\" Amania said after watching what happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The gym leaders are no push overs that's for sure,\" Fennel adds as Touya, Bianca and Cheren return their fainted Pokemon into their balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but I know those three will be able to do this,\" Juniper said still confident in her students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\"m sorry Touya,\" Bianca says as she makes sure that Penelope back into her ball. \"It I wasn't so slow on this battle stuff, Masou or Cheren's Purloin wouldn't have gotten hurt and fainted,\" Bianca looks down on the ground, Touya looks at the tiny blonde on his should and sees the frown on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay Bianca and plus it's not over yet,\" Touya says to the tiny blonde as he pulls out his last poke'ball. \"Let's go Kenki!\" Touya then throws the ball and the water type comes out as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you and I are on the same page,\" Cheren says to Touya as the black hair trainer throws his last pokemon out and a Snivy comes out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right Touya,\" Bianca thought as she pulls out a poke'ball and throws it and yells. \"Fia do your best!\" The Tepig comes out of the ball and looks ready to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope they can figure something out,\" Amania thought as she continues to watch the battle.... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No one has a made a since Touya and the others sent out their starter Pokemon. Cheren tries to think up a plan to beat their triangle formation as Touya is thinking as well but is keeping on eye on The triplets and the elemental monkeys. Bianca is watching as well but soon starts to a little at her stomach at seeing the elemental monkeys spin so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish there was a stop them,\" Bianca said as she looks down and continues to talk. \"Maybe we could attack from above... No that would never work,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though the tiny blonde thought she was talking to herself, Touya was able to hear her. The Brow hair youth then smiles as he gets an idea from Bianca's talking to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a genius Bianca,\" Touya whispers to the tiny blonde on his should. Bianca blushes as she was the only one that could hear Touya say that, she was about to ask how but when she look into his giant eye she sees a spark in it. The tiny blonde figures that Touya must have made a plan after hearing talk to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't about that,\" Bianca says back and then looks at her opponents. \"But If I was able to help I'm glad. Use Tepig to help with your plan,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya nods with a smile as he says. \"Fia shoot Ember around them!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tepig follows that young man's command and shoots out fire balls around the elemental monkeys. The monkey Pokemon try to stay in formation as they try to doge the attacks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheren turns his head around and is about to ask Touya what he is thinking until he sees that Touya is looking at him. The black hair trainer sees a spark in brown hair trainer's eye and Cheren smiles as it seems like Touya was able to think of something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They have something planed,\" Cilan thought as he watches the challengers and tries to see if they have something plan but the gym leaders is bit worried about his Pokemon as he takes glances at The elemental monkeys. When the green hair trainer took glances at Touya and Cheren he notice that the brown hair trainer mouth was moving but no sound was not coming out before he went back to watching his Pokemon doge flame and he look at Touya once more and notice he the he blowing a bit and the green hair gym leaders starts to get confuse about what Touya is doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can doge those!\" Chile yells as he is only paying attention to the fight and not the trainers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What ever you have plan, there's no way it will work,\" Cress thought as he closes his eyes feeling confident about their victory.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds of Fia continuing shooting out embers the Elemental monkeys, Touya then says. \"Fia aim above them and fire!\"  Fia smiles and the Tepig then aims up and fires a ember above them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait above!?\" Cress says as he opens his eyes surprise to hear Touya's command to the Tepig. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's dumb why would you fire above us no at us?\" Chile talks to himself about what's going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would he do that....\" Cilan thought as he looks above the elemental monkeys and sees something that terrifies him. The green hair gym leader sees that a small Leaf Tornado is above them and that's not all, it has water being carry in it as well from the wind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCilan did not have to warm his brothers as the ember hits the Leaf Tornado! The Leaves in the Tornado burn to a crisp and the wind stops but unfortunately for the gym leaders the water did not evaporate from the fire! The water the was stuck in the tornado soon pours on the three monkey Pokemon, the monkeys make loud cries as the ember had made the water in the Leaf Tornado boiling hot. The monkeys stop their spinning and seprate from each other to shake off the hot hot water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya, the tiny Bianca and Cheren knew this was their chance and they gladly took it as they use their Pokemon's strongest attacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kenki! Use Razor Shell on Pansear! Fia use Flame Charge on Pansage!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Snivy end this match with a Leaf Tornado on Panpour!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Oshawott, Tepig and Snivy follow their trainers orders and go in for the attacks. Kenki pulls his shell of his chest and covers the shell in water and slashes the fire Monkey and in one slash the Pansear let's out a cry as it faints. Fia chargers at Pansage as fire surrounds it's body and the Tepig hits the grass monkey and the Pansage makes a cry as well and faints. Snivy spins his tail and makes a leaf tornado come out of his spin and the leaf Tornado moves fast and hits the Panpour and the water monkey makes a cry as well and faints as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-We lost,\" Cilan said surprise to see that him and brother lost and their power triangle formation got beaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe it,\" Cress said as he was not handling the lost well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you beat us!?\" Chile asks as the red hair waiter has not figure out how they lost to their opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can explain that,\" Cheren said as the gym leaders return their unconscious and the black hair trainer continues to talk. \"While Fia was distracting with her ember attacks, Touya was able to mouth me his plan,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you two were able to read other lips,\" Cress said quite impress at how well Touya and Cheren could communicate with their mouth flaps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's what you two were doing then,\" Cilan adds as the green hair gym leader was able to see some of what Touya and Cheren were doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good and all but you have to explain what you did,\" Chile said, wanting to hear the full explanation of the plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's what you want,\" Cheren said as he takes a small breath and explains. \"When we were reading each other lips Touya asked me if Snivy learn Leaf Tornado yet, I told him yes and he asked me to shoot one in the air just above your Pokemon. Luckily for us you three had your attention on Fia and her attack so I was able I was able to indicate to Snivy with a hand single to use Leaf Tornado  and place it above your three monkeys. Then Touya was able to form his single to Kenki to shoot a water gun and have it stay in the air by having be in the leaf tornado,\" Cilian then quickly remembers that Touya was blowing earlier and he just realizes that was his single to his Oshawott to Water Gun.\"Then to finish it up Fia shot a ember at the leaf tornado with the water in it and cause the tornado to stop and also to heat up the water and then it fell on your three Pokemon,\" Cheren finishes explaining the plan. \"It was thanks to Touya's plan we were able to win this match,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't entirely my idea, Bianca helped out and you helped as well Cheren,\" Touya said feeling like he shouldn't get all the credit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Touya,\" Bianca said, even though she only help with the idea she was glad she was able to help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your too kind sometime Touya,\" Cheren sighs but has a smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gym leaders smile and are happy to have to have such strong trainers as they are about to talk someone opens their mouth first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You three did an excellent job, but you should also be paying attention to Your Pokemon as well,\" squeak like voice said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya along with the tiny Bianca on his should and Cheren turn around and see that Amania walked up to them while carrying the tiny Professor Juniper and Fennel. The three trainers from Nuvema Town look at their starter Pokemon and notice that a white light is surrounding their Pokemon! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our Pokemon are evolving!\" Bianca exclaims and is happy to see that Fia is getting stronger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone watches as Oshwott, Tepig and Snivy evolve and turn into their new forms. Kenki is now a Dewott, Fia is now Pignite and Snivy is a Servine. All three Pokemon are silent for a moment and then start to celebrate their new forms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've become so strong Fia!\" Bianca shouts as loud as she could to her Pignite, even though Fia could only hear a little bit he could feel his trainer's pride in him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've really prove you self Servine,\" Cheren said as he walks over to his newly evolve Pokemon pat on it's back. Servine let's out a happy cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenki looks at his trainer and wonders what Touya is going to say, Touya looks at the Dewott for a moment and closes his eyes and opens again and gives Kenki a a sincerer close smile at the water type Pokemon. Even though his trainer didn't really talk, Kenki could see though the brown hair trainer's smile and eyes that Touya was incredible proud of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that you're done explaining and seeing you're Pokemon evolve, let's give you three your badges,\" Cilan said as his brothers Chile quickly gets three badge cases. \"We'll also be giving a case as well to hold your badges,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Touya could you hold onto mine. It's to big to fit my bag?\" Bianca asks the young man, Touya nods in agreement as Chile gives Cheren on badge plus badge case and gives the other two to Touya. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not all we'll also be giving you this TM,\" Cress says he holds three CDs in cases as well. \"This is TM 83 Work, you read the TM does on little piece of that comes in the case,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how am I going to use it?\" Bianca asks as the TM was to big to use on her device. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Bianca, Amania and I will make something that will help you out,\" Fennel said and Bianca smiles and is happy that she knows people like Fennel and Amania. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group quickly say their goodbyes to the Gym Leaders and Touya puts the tiny girls in his bag and Cheren, Amania and himself walk out of the gym. Cheren looks at Touya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in the boat as you, I have to stay back here as well.\" Cheren said and continues to talk. \"My mom and dad need help with something so I'm staying in Nuvema town for the next days,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya nods as they both stop near the apartments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is our splitting point, see ya some other time Touya, Amania and everyone else,\" Cheren said with a smile as he starts his walk back to Nuvema. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya and Amania wave goodbye to Cheren and both enter the apartment and wait. </span></div></div>",

The group go their separate ways in the apartment. In the the living room, Touya is siting on the couch reading a book that is title \"Don't think, feel TM edition.\", Amanita and the tiny girls are in the kitchen enjoying their talk together. Amanita sits on a chair while the tiny girls were on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you said you were going to help me with TMs but how are you going to do that?\" Bianca asks as the tiny blonde takes a piece of berry that's near her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's easy,\" Fennel starts to explain after she takes piece of the berry that tiny girls were sharing. \"We'll just make a cable that can connect to Touya's device so you can use it,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That should work well,\" Juniper said as she takes a piece of the berry as well. \"You should be able to us HMs as well,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" Fennel said as she stands up. \"I think I have a HM somewhere, I\"ll give it to Touya and the two of you can use it,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Professor Fennel,\" Bianca says with a smile happy that Touya and herself have another move to teach their Pokemon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right I have something to give Touya as well,\" Amanita said as the grade school girl just remembers since her sister brought up the HM. \"I have an extra Pal Pad laying around I'll just give to him, even though he has a Xtransceiver the Pal Pad will help him save space on it,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's very nice of you,\" Fennel comments on her sister generosity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey! You make sound like I never do anything nice,\" Amanita talks back to her older sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca and Juniper both a giggle at the two sisters interaction with each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n_______________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDay 2<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the second night Touya stayed in Fennel's apartment, last night Amanita explain about that they will connect Touya's device to Baican's device so the tiny blonde could teach her Pokemon TMs and HMs. The grade schooler also gave him a Pal Pad as well, it would come in handy to write down other numbers along save some space on the Xtransceiver along with an HM with the move cut. Touya, Amanita along with the tiny girls chose to eat breakfast at the Cafe today and when they went in, Touya and Amanita saw that the gym leaders along with a few staff were having trouble with the cafe. Cress explain to the two that some some their chiefs came down with a cold and now they were short on staff. Touya volunteers to help out and so does Amanita, the triples are happy they are willing to help and sent them into the kitchen. Touya puts on a apron along with taking off his hat and Amanita join as well with putting a apron on as well and since it was just the two of them and Cilan allowed it the tiny girls are will to work. Touya and Bianca let out their Pokemon and asked them fro help as well and the Pokemon agreed and they would help wait tables. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's going to be so much fun,\" Bianca said as she is wearing a green shirt along with her orange pajama pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's going to be quite interesting,\" Juniper adds, the Pokemon Professor wondering if they should even help with them being tiny they might get in the way. Juniper is wearing a plan white shirt with blue pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's going to be okay Aurea. Plus it's going to be fun cooking at this size,\" Fennel ready to help cook, the dark blue hair women is wearing a pink shirt with white pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I better keep on eye on her.... Big Sis has strange ways of cooking,\" Amanita thought and the younger sister tries to remember that last time her sister cooked and it did not turn out good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya took on the majority of the work, by working with the ovens, stoves or anything that requires multiple task done at once. At first Touya had some troubles  working a larger kitchen but after a quick lessons from the triplet brother he gets the the hangs of things. While cooking the brown hair youth would take glaces at what Amanita and the tiny girls were doing, Amanita was quite helpful in the kitchen even though she was a much of a beginner as Touya, it came from having to helping her sister stay on the recipe of what ever food they were making. The tinier members of the are working quite hard as all three of them were able to work together using the kitchen utensils to help add the extra ingredients to the dish also did good work on mixing the many drinks the cafe serve as well. After the time to stop severing break stop the part time workers took a break. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanita and the tiny girls are having a nice breakfast of pancakes, fruit and some juice, the Pokemon are eating some fresh berries as well. Touya is cooking his breakfast and enjoying a glass of orange juice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey thanks for the help man,\" Chile said as his brothers walk over the brown hair trainer. \"You saved our buts,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes we a owe lot to you and the girls,\" Cilan adds as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome, it was a good experience in cooking,\" Touya replies back to the brothers as he flips the pancake in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really look on the bright side things huh,\" Chile said and then \"Well you're welcome for the cooking lessons,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of you can leave after you finish your meals. The morning is the only time when we're really busy,\" Cress said as he washes his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must say though working together with some types of people it's sort of like Pokemon battling,\" Cilan comments as he looks at the temp workers. \"There are many types of people in this world,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah some you work together well with and others can be total disasters,\" Chile chimes in the conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but we must not over look that something special might come out if you work with opposite of your ideals,\" Cress adds as well and continues to talk. \"Like us, we all have different personalities,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes that's true,\" Cilan said with a smile as the other two brothers nod in agreement. Touya looks at the three brothers and had to agree he was learning a lot from being around Bianca, Cheren, Professor Juniper, Professor Fennel, Amania and the three brothers of course. The brown hair trainer then gets an idea and quckily goes to his bag and pulls out the Pal Pad and walks back to the brothers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you want our numbers?\" Cress asks as Touta nods up and down as a yes. \"Sure I don't mind, besides we have a sort of a bond as well since I picked a water type for my starter as well,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would be fantastic, we could exchange recipes to each other,\" Cilan said looking at Touya as a friend he could share his love cooking with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! You gotta to tell me how battles go to!\" Chile beams wanting to hear more battles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the three brothers give Touya their numbers in the Pal Pad and Touya gave them his as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was night as everyone is doing their own things, Touya is in the kitchen washing dishes, Amania and tiny big sisters are making inventions that would help the Bianca, Juniper and Fennel herself with their journey with Touya. Bianca and Juniper in the living room are having another lessons on Pokemon and the Pokemon were having their free time. Kenki and Fia are training together in the test room, luckily for the Dewott he was able to have two sea shells as swords thanks to Fennel and Amanita went to the beach earlier that year and brought back some shells. Since Kenki only had sea shell the grade school girl gave the Dewott one of the sea shells she had so Dewott would have two. Touya and Dewott thanks Amania fro the sea shell. Penelope and Allie were with Bianca and Juniper as the like being around their tiny blonde trainer. Last Masou is also in the living room looking at some fashion magazines, he flip through the magazine until stooping at a page with Pansear wearing a scarf that has a flame pattern on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth be told, Masou didn't mind battling other Pokemon but the Pansear interest was more into fashion. Just as the fire monkey continues to stare at the magazine, he didn't notice that Touya come out of the kitchen, the trainer sees Masou looking at something and walks over to see what the Pansear is looking at. Masou tenses up when he hears footstep and turns his head and sees it's his trainer, the fire monkey starts to feel a little afraid as his first instinct is that Touya would get mad at him for interest in fashion, So Masou runs away and goes into the training room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's weird,\" Bianca said as she watches the scene with Masou. \"I wonder what cause Masou to act that way,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good observation Biacna,\" Juniper said and continues to talk. \"What ever it was I think it must have to do with that magazine,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah and something to do with Touya as well,\" Bianca adds as Touya picks up the magazine and looks at the page that Masou was looking at, a few seconds later Touya puts the magazine in his pocket and walks back to the couch and sits down and looks like he is in thought. \"I want to ask but it looks like Touya is thinking of something,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it would be best to leave Masou to Touya then,\" Juniper adds, though she is a bit worried as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n____________________ <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDay 3<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing much happen that day, everyone just took it easy. Touya left to get some groceries and came back with the groceries along with an extra bag for some reason. Touya even asked Amanita if they had a sewing machine, unfortunately Fennel and Amania didn't own a sewing machine, but luckily the one of the neighbor own one and let Touya and Amanita borrow one. Later after eveyone went to bed, Touya stays up and starts to mess with the sewing machine.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Day 4 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the new morning for everyone and as they are about to have the breakfast the Touya cooked for them, Touya and Bianca get their Pokemon out to let them have their breakfast but Touya stops Masou before he could take a nimble in breakfast, Bianca and Juniper both watch the screen about to happen. Touya is wearing a white shirt with black pants while the Amanita and the tiny girls are wearing pajamas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like we're going a conclusion from what happen the other day,\" Juniper said as she watches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait what happen?\" Fennel asks as she takes a piece of the french toast that Touya made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Masou was reading some magazine and when Touya went to see what he was reading, Masou run away. Professor Juniper didn't have a chance to see it since Touya took the magazine and put it in his pocket,\" Bianca explains to the dark hair women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I might know what magazine that was, I think it was so sort of fashion magazine,\" Amanita groggily said as she is still a little sleepy. \"By the way I didn't notice at first but look at Touya's fingers,\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny girls look and see that Touya's fingers do indeed have bandages on them. The girls were wondering what's going until Touya pulls a scarf from his pocket, it wasn't the most extravagant scarf and it has a simple flame pattern on it as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, it's the best I could,\" Touya said as he gives Masou the scarf, the brown hair trainer figured out that Masou must have wanted to have the scarf but looking at the price of it, there was no way he could afford it at the current moment so this is the best he could do right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMasou looks at the scarf, it wasn't as good looking as the scarf in the magazine and the flame pattern on it looks quite simple unlike the flames in the magazine. But despite that Masou looks at the scarf with a smile on it's face and quickly puts it around it's neck and makes a happy cry. Touya look at the fire monkey and is happy that Masou is enjoying it. Kenki looks happy as well to his team happy as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like he likes it,\" Amanita said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! Looks like everything went better then expect,\" Bianca said with a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like letting Touya handle this was the right move,\" Juniper thought with a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's sweet,\" Fennel said with a smile and then adds. \"Since Touya knows a bit sewing he'll be able to repair our doll clothes if they ever get rip,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true,\" Juniper adds, it would be nice to someone to be able to repair their clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya hears this and wonders if he should keep sewing at least be able the tiny girls with repairing the doll clothes and maybe make some doll clothes for them as well but he doesn't really have time to think about as the group eats breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Touya and Amanita were working on fixing tonight's dinner the shrunken girls were having a talk among themselves on the kitchen table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say Bianca could you help me with my research?\" Fennel asks the blonde as they wait in for dinner to be ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure I would like to help,\" Bianca answered back and then ask. \"What would you like me to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.... I need to get some dream mist from Penelope,\" Fennel answers back and then explains. \"Before this shrinking thing happen I was researching dreams of Pokemon and trainers,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fennel's been doing this research for years as well. Heck I remember right you've doing research even back in collage,\" Juniper adds with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! You've put a lot of committed to this research,\" Bianca notes and is impress by the dark blue hair women. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! I believe that dreams have powers of their own,\" Fennel said getting a bit exited at talking about her research. \"The best way to test this theory is getting dream mist from a Munna or Musharna,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dream mist.... that's what forms after Penelope eats a dream right?\" Bianca asks not certain about the answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep that's right,\" Juniper said with a smile, happy to see that Bianca's studies are helping her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. So we're going to need Penelope to someone's dream,\" Fennel then looks at the with trickster like smile. \"I think we should use Touya as a test subject,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Why would we do that?\" Bianca asks, feeling a little bit nervous about but also wanting to know what Touya dreams about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we should ask him first,\" Juniper adds, seeing the gears of her collage friend move and guess that Fennel would just say they should do when he asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're no fun, Aurea,\" Fennel puts at her best friend. The tiny girls then share a giggle among them selves. Even though some of their talk sounds like squeaks, Touya and Amanita were able to understand some of it. The grade school girl blushes at her sister plan and then whispers to Touya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry that big sis, she gets caught up in her research sometimes,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, she's very enthusiastic,\" Touya whispers back in a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanita sighs at Touya answer and starts to feel a little worry Touya's safety around her sister since he's being to nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n__________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDay 5<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a new morning, but the only ones up are Touya and Amanita. Touya is wearing his normal outfit as he puts on his boot. Amanita watches and asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where are you going?\" Amanita asks as Touya stands up after getting his shoes on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going back to my house to celebrate my birthday with my Mom and Dad. I'll be back in time for dinner,\" Touya answers the question in a nonchalant and Amanita nods her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll be seeing you later,\" Amanita says as Touya nods and then leaves the apartment, after a few seconds the grade school girl brain gets hit with the information! \"Wait it's Touya's Birthday!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanita quickly runs into her bedroom where the tiny girls are sleeping on her dressing. The grade school girl reaches her dressing and starts to ask the tiny blonde some things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Bianca did you now it's Touya's birthday today?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Touya's birthday.....\" Bianca tierly says and then after a seconds the tiny blonde gets up and Amanita could see the tiny blonde's orange pajamas. \"OH MY GOSH! I forgot about Touya's birthday!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat' wrong Bianca?\" Juniper asks as she starts to wake up, Juniper is wearing white pajamas as Bianca looks over to the Professor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Professor Juniper I forgot Touya's birthday,\" Bianca answers back and the light hair brunette looks at Bianca for a moment and then takes in the information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today is Touya's birthday!?\" Juinper said as she forgot about as well with being shrunk and trying to find a cure for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh today is Touya's birthday?\" Fennel asks as she gets up, Fennel is wearing pink pajamas with a flora pattern on them and then the dark blue hair women continues to talk. \"We have to do something nice for him,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...... We can make a birthday cake!\" Bianca suggest as she gets up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A birthday cake, yes that could work.... But it will be difficult for us to do,\" Juniper said as she gets up. \"Even with Amanita here to help us, our size makes things a bit difficult,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's going to be fine,\" Fennel said to the two. \"I think he'll like anything we make,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True,\" Amainita thought as Touya is a nice enough guy to accept any type of present. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca and Juniper both knew they were right but they still want to make a fantastic cake for Touya's birthday despite their disadvantage. Bianca and Juniper give each other a look and a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's do our best to make the best cake!\" Bianca exclaims as she is ready to make the cake. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Amanita, with the help of the tiny girls, got things set up in the kitchen for making Touya's birthday cake. And so, Amanita and the tiny girls worked together to make their surprise cake for Touya's birthday. Although Amanita was the one who really did all the work, Bianca helped as best as she could at her size, and Juniper was the one giving the shots, while Fennel tried her best, mostly at eating the ingredients and mixture. Soon, a batter had formed in the large bowl they used.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch this!\" Bianca yelled. She grabbed the spoon with both of her hands and started to stir. Because of her small size, she had to exert herself to move the spoon even a little though. Amanita and Fennel laughed as they watched their tiny co-worker mix the batter. But Juniper was less amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful, Bianca!\" The Pokemon professor warned the other tiny blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" Bianca cried as she slipped and fell into the bowl, disappearing into the thick mixture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bianca!\" Juniper and the others all shouted, worried for the girl's safety. They watched for any sign of Bianca in the mix, but there was nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on!\" Amanita said. She reached into the batter Just as she did though, a tiny blonde head popped out. The young girl retreated her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha ha!\" Bianca was laughing, covered in cake mix. Her head was just barely above the mixture, but she was otherwise fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bianca! Are you okay?\" Juniper asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine! I taste like cake!\" Bianca said happily, licking herself of the batter that covered her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank goodness!\" Amanita said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that girl... Amanita, get her out of there would you?\" Fennel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanita nodded and did as she was told. Bianca was sad to leave the tasty mixture behind, but okay with it. Amanita handed her some paper towels to clean herself off with. Bianca used them to do just that, when not eating the rest off herself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that incident, the rest of the baking went smoothly. An hour of work later, the cake was ready to go in the oven. Some time later the timer went off, signaling the cake was ready to be taken out of the oven. Amanita pulled the cake out and carried it over to the counter top. The young girl held it with just one hand, and it started to waver in her grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful, Amanita!\" Fennel warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got it!\" Amanita replied, and quickly held up the cake pan with both hands. \"Phew!\" She sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca gasped. \"That was close!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amanita!\" Fennel scolded. Her little hands on her tiny hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, sis. Watch out!\" Amanita warned the tiny girls and slowly lowered the cake pan down next to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, it's hot!\" Bianca said. Although she was far from the desert, by her scale at least, the heat still got to her. She and the other shrunken girls kept their distance from the burning pan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. We'll have to wait a little before topping it.\" Juniper said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we will. But for now, just look how it turned out!\" Fennel said, eyeing the cake hungrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, Touya's going to love it.\" Juniper said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks perfect!\" Bianca cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sure does! I can't wait to have some!\" Amanita said happily.</span></div></div>",

First Amanita takes the bake good out of the pan, the tiny girls on the counter top can see the vanilla/chocolate cake in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never thought I would see so much cake in my life,\" Juniper comments as the light hair brunette compares herself with the giant cake and sees that the cake reaches up to her neck. Juniper notice the width of the cake is about twice her own height! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I have in my dreams,\" Fennel comments and is happy that dream is going to become reality soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So all we have left to do is put the icing, cream, and strawberries on it,\" Bianca said as she looks at the cake as Amanita puts bowls down near the cake that contain what Bianca mentions along with tools to help them with the decoration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright all there is left to do is decoration,\" Amanita said with a smile as she gets a large offset spatula and gets a big glob of icing and puts it on the cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I can help,\" Bianca said as she walks over to the the smaller offset spatula, it was about her size and the tiny blonde tries to pick up and able to lift up a bit from the ground but barely keep it up as Bainca puts the small offset spatula down. \"That's-\" the tiny blonde is huffing a bit. \"hard to pick up,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bianca I don't think we'll be much help with the icing,\" Juniper said as the Pokemon Professor figures that Bianca, Fennel and herself will not be able to lift much because of their small size. The light hair brunette sees that Bianca is frowning from not being able to help with the decoration. \"We can help with putting strawberries on the cake,\" trying to cheer up the blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, if we work together we can lift one up,\" Fennel adds wanting to cheer up Bianca as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright that sounds good and all but I think I'll handle putting strawberries on the top. Don't want your feet to dirty the cake,\" Amanita said and the tiny girls agree and soon Amanita and the tiny girls get to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile working Amanita wonders why they didn't have Bianca's Pokemon to help them out, but the grade school girl figures that the tiny girls want to help making the cake themselves. Amanita watches as the tiny girls pick a single Strawberry together and move it over to the the corners of the cake and place it near it, the grade school girl smiles and gets back to work on her part. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was about night when Touya returns to the apartment building, it was quite the day as he and his Pokemon spent time at his home and did enjoy his time with his parents, both giving him Pok\u00e9dollars, books, and some movies he wanted to watch as well. Touya also meet with Cheren as well, his childhood friend wished him a happy birthday and gave him some Poke'ball and potions along with some berries. When the brown hair trainer got back to Striaton City, he meet the triplet gym brothers and once they found out that it is Touya's birthday they give the recipes for their coffees teas. Touya walks up the stairs and reaches the apartment that Fennel and Amanita both live in and knocks on the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a minute,\" Amanita answers from behind the door. Touya wonders why Amanita wants to him to wait but the young man didn't get much time to think as he hears Amanita's voice once more. \"Alright come on in,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya opens the door and when he enters he hears a popping noise and some confetti flying near him. Touya notice that the tiny girls are on Penelope and wearing the clothes they first shrunk in along with Fia, Allie and Amanita with a popper in hand. The Munna moves closer to Touya so the tiny girls could say something to the young man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy Birthday Touya!\" The tiny girls shouts along with Amanita from the back with a smile on their faces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya is quite surprise to see as well a birthday cake that is square shape with white icing, cream and strawberries on the cake as well being all around the cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The cake's the best thing we could do on short notice,\" Bianca said with a bit of embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you enjoy it,\" Juniper adds happy to be able to help as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. It's something special to get bake goods from cute girls such as us,\" Fennel says with huge smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One also keep on eating during her work time,\" Amanita comments at the tiny dark hair woman eating some of ingredients during their cooking process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look there's enough to share,\" Fennel pouts at her younger sister bringing up that up in front of he young man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for you the cake,\" Touya says with a smile on his face. He really didn't expect Amanita and the tiny girls to bake a cake for him. He sees the tiny girls blush a bit with smiles on their faces while Amanita has a smile on her face along with a light blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since that's all settled, let's get to eat,\" Fennel said her mood being better after being thank by Touya. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it's time to enjoy that cake!\" Bianca chimes with a smile as her stomach rumbles a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to agree with your stomach Bianca,\" Juniper adds as Bianca blushes a bit from the Pokemon Professor commenting on her stomach rumbling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya then gets out two Poke'ball and lets Kenki and Masou and tells the Dewott and Pansear about the cake and small party and both of the Pokemon both smile and happy to have another chance at cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya and Amantia take a place at the kitchen table as Penelope sits on the table and the tiny girls get off the physic Pokemon and onto the table. Soon everyone has a piece of cake, the tinier members of the group sharing a piece of the cake. The tiny girls watch as the giant starts to eat his piece of the cake, his piece containing both vanilla and chocolate with a strawberry on top of it as well. Bianca, Juniper and Fennel all watch and see that Touya quite likes the cake as he finishes his first piece and gets another one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like Touya really likes our cake,\" Fennel comments as the tiny girls have a chat among them selves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well he really love sweets,\" Bianca said as she remembers that the young man eating many sweets over the hears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad were able to give him something for his birthday,\" Juniper adds as she takes a piece from their cake as well and takes a bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Bianca and Fennel agree with a nod and then both of them take piece of cake from their giant piece and eat it as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Touya, Amanita, Pokemon, and the tiny girls enjoy their party that night, after a few hours the group finishes their party clean and head straight to bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya asleep on the couch starts to feel the beams of the sun through the windows, the young man starts to stir and opens his eyes sits up with a yawn as well. He looks around and sees that Kenki and the other Pokemon are sleeping on pillows on the ground. Touya then recalls that Bianca and himself let their Pokemon stay out their Poke'ball for tonight since it was a special occasion. Touya then gets up quietly so he can start making breakfast for everyone but the young man sees that one Pokemon wakes and sees it's no other then Kenki. The Dewott walks over to his trainer without waking up the other Pokemon, Touya is amazed at how well the Dewott is able to move around, from the way Kenki walked it was like a scene from an old Samurai movie. Kenki looks at his trainer and sees that Touya is wearing a long sleeve shirt that reach his elbows and that the top color is black and on the sleeves while the bottom half is white and black shorts as well. Touya figures that Kenki must want to join him the kitchen and so Touya asks the Dewott and Kenki nods his head in agreement. So the two went into the kitchen and Touya starts to make french toast as Kenki trains by stretching his legs out. While cooking Touya takes glances at his starter Pokemon and sees the Dewott training, Kenki is quite a hard worker at training so hard and the brown hair youth wonders what Kenki wants to with all that strength. Touya didn't have much time to think about it as Amanita came into the kitchen. The grade school girl is wearing purple pajamas and looks at Touya cooking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Touya thanks for cooking breakfast again,\" Amanita said with a smile as Touya answers back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no problem. Cooking is really fun,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanita is happy to see that Touya is enjoying cooking breakfast, but the school girl happy mood didn't last long since it was the day that the doll clothes would come in and soon Touya, her tiny sister and other two tiny friends will be leaving. The grade school girl was okay about being alone in the apartment since Fennel would go to places while she stayed behind. But this time it's different, Amanita will not know when her sister will get back and possible be back to her normal size. Amanita was able to hold these thoughts back since Fennel was still with her but now it's the day for Touya and the others to leave it's going to be hard to keep these thoughts from bothering her. Amania gets a cup from a cabinet and a carton of orange juice from the fridge and sits at the kitchen table and pours the juice into the cup. As the grade school girl does this Touya puts down a plate in front of her, Amanita looks and sees a freshly cooked french toast with whip cream and strawberries and blue berries on it. The young man also puts a bottle of syrup and a fork and knife next to Amanita on the table as well and goes back to back to cooking more french toast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Touya,\" Amanita thankful for the breakfast and quickly picks up the bottle of syrup and puts some on the french toast and then cuts it up with the knife and then picks up a piece of the cut french toast with fork and puts it into her mouth. The grade school girl feels the fluffiness of the french toast and the syrup combine making the dish sweet. \"Oh I'm going to miss having your cooking Touya. Big Sis always tries the recipe drastically,\" Amanita takes another another piece of the french toast and eats it and then looks at Touya. \"By the way if Big Sis gets distracted by something she's interested in she always loses track of her surroundings.... So you gotta to watch over her,\" The grade school girl starting to feel some tears forming from her telling Touya about how reckless her sisters can be sometimes. While cooking Touya takes a glance and sees that Amanita is about to cry, even though Amanita is a genuis at her young age she was still grade school girl that is not going to see her sister for awhile. Touya then sets the spatula down and walks over to where Amanita is sitting squats down so they could be eye level. The young man then brings up his right arm and with his right hand being clinch except for his pinky finger extending out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll protect your sister I pinky promise,\" Touya says with a warm smile, Amanita looks at the young man and sees that Touya's smile is sincere and the grade school girl giggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you can be so cheesy and keep a straight face,\" Amanita says through giggles as she raises her left arm to Touya's level and then puts her left pinky finger on his pinky as well. Kenki stops training and watches as his trainer and Amanita both do the pinky promise chant, even though he didn't really understand what's going on but he could sees that it really important.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing the chant, Touya and Amanita both smell something burning, the young man looks at the stove and sees that it's the cooking french toast that's burning! Touya quickly stands up straight and swift movement to the stove is able to get the stove and get the french toast out and put on a plate. The french toast somewhat burnt along the edges but still mostly looks good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess this one is mine,\" Touya said not wanting any the girls to have the burnt french toast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make sure to cut the burnt parts off. It's not healthy to eat those,\" Amantia said as she gets from her chair. \"I'm going to check if Big Sis and the other woke up yet,\" Amantia leaves the kitchen to check up on the tiny girls who are in her room. Even though Amanita is still has worries, she knows that things will be okay since Touya is looking after her sister and the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes everyone is at the kitchen table, The Pokemon eating some fruits and some french toast near the table. Touya and Amanita sitting at the kitchen table enjoying their breakfast and the tiny girls on the kitchen table enjoying their breakfast as well with a corner piece torn off from one of the french toast. The tiny girls are in pajamas, Bianca in orange, Juniper in lime green and Fennel in purple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Touya your cooking is as good as ever,\" Fennel said as she dips a piece of french toast into a bit syrup that was in a small measuring cup that Touya gave the tiny girls so they can get some syrup on their pieces of french toast. \"Traveling with you is going to be fun if I get to eat good food like this,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!\" Bianca said as she eats a piece of her french toast as well with a bit syrup on it as well and then says. \"I hope we can have fun on this journey,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Bianca I hope as well,\" Juniper adds, even though the Pokemon professor is glad to see that Bianca and Fennel are both happy about traveling but she hopes that they are able to find a cure for reduce sizes. \"Amanita what time will the package with the doll clothes arrive?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanita looks at the tiny light brown hair woman and remembers the last update she remembers she read and then answers.... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I\"m glad they arrived early,\" Fennel said and then looks at Amanita. \"Your doll clothes work well enough but in some areas they're kind of of tight,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya has a curious look on his face from what Fennel said and is about to ask until Juniper talks first since the tiny light brunette saw the curious look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I Think it's time for us to try some of these clothes on,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay sounds good and it looks like everyone is done eating,\" Amanita said and looks at Touya. \"Sorry to do this but can you clean up while I take them to try out these clothes? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya nods in agreement about cleaning up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh before we go we should put Fia and the others in their balls,\" Bianca said as she sees that the Pokemon are done eating as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's an good idea since we're going to leaving soon,\" Juniper agreeing with Bianca about putting the Pokemon back into their poke'balls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya and Bianca put their Pokemon back into their balls, Amanita picks up the box along with the tiny girls and the grade school girl walks back into her room. Touya picks up the dirty plates and cups and other utensils and starts to wash the dishes, while washing the dishes Touya wonders what Fennel meant when she talked about tightness. Did the doll clothes make it hard for them walk around in? Touya takes a note that if he ever makes any doll clothes for the tiny girls he would have think about how comfortable the doll clothes will be. Touya is able to finish cleaning everything and the young man decides to change out of his night clothes and does this by picking up his bag and enters the bathroom. After a few minutes Touya comes out of the bathroom with different clothes on, he is wearing his blue jacket unzip showing that he is wearing a white shirt, black cargo shorts, and his red shoes along with black socks. Touya walks back into the living room and sees that Amanita is in the living room in her lab clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for washing the dishes,\" Amanita said as she notice the kitchen is clean and then says. \"Also they put on their new clothes,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya looks at the living room table and now sees the tiny girls in their new clothes. Bianca is wearing her green beret with a white strip on it, a bright orange blaze unbutton showing a black and white stripe shit under the blazer, white skit with orange shoes with black laces and long lime green socks. Juniper has her hair down and it looks brushed with how straight her hair looks, white tank top, lime green jeans, and red and white shoes. Fennel is now wearing her hair in pony tail with her bangs looking the same as well, a pink shirt with a purple floral pattern with a white over shirt, black shots along with pink shoes with white laces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how do we look?\" Fennel asks the giant as she does a twirler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You all look cute,\" Touya answers back to the tiny girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Touya,\" Bianca said with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, thank you very much,\" Juniper adds with a little smile of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!\" Fennel exclaims and the says. \"Amanita can you give him the bag of clothes,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. I'm also going to give Touya the other things that we made,\" Amanita said as she goes behind the couch and brings out a small suit case and hands it over to Touya. \"This has all of their clothes in this suit case as well little some items that my big sis and myself have made as well. The items included in suit case are miniature version of items such as washing machine, dryer, an small machine that works like poke'center so Bianca can heal her Pokemon and some items for the bathroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we're all good to go,\" Bianca says with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like we're about to go on our journey now,\" Juniper says as well with a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. Take care of yourself Amanita,\" Fennel said to the giantess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will. Don't cause trouble for Touya and the others,\" Amanita replies back with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey don' say something like that about your big sister,\" Fennel pouts at the grade school girl.

Touya then lifts his hand up to his chest as the tiny girls take a look at Amanita before they leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye Amanita I hope we can meet again!\" Bianca shouts as she waves her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. You're going to be amazing researcher,\" Juniper said with a warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!

The young man keeps on walking until he walks out of the park and into route 3.

Cheren sent out his Snivy first while Touya sent out a Pansear that he nickname Mousu. Even though Snivy was able to beat Masou, the fire type of monkey was able to do enough damage for the Dewott to be able defeat the grass type and then Kenki was able to beat Purrloin quite easily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the battle Cheren.\" Touya said, the young man could see that his friend was upset about losing but Touya could sense the strong conviction of Cheren and his team. Touya knew better then anyone that Cheren wants to the Champion of the Unova and he could see how much Cheren and his Pokemon wanted to become the strongest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheren looks at his Childhood friend, even though feeling frustration from not being able to beat Touya the black hair lad sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least I was able to get a better understanding of how you battle,\" Cheren said trying to look on the bright side of things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n_________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you were right Bianca,\" Fennel said as the dark blue hair woman could hear what the two giants were saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.....\" Bianca replies, the blonde was happy that Touya won but feels bad for Cheren for losing.

Touya sure can run when he needs too,\" Bianca thought as she ducks back down from the wind hitting her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya notices that the Plasma grunts are nearing a two way path, the young remembers that if you go left you will be on the way to the next town. If those Plasma grunts went left it would be harder to catch them, but if Touya is able to make the Plasma go straight forward he would be able to trap in cave that's just forward of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile running Touya is able to put his right hand into his that held his Poke'balls and pulled out the ball that held Kenki.

Bianca gives a nod to the Professor as so does Touya but he makes sure his head shakes don't disturbe the tiny girls on inner jacket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are we going to do about that Drilbur?\" Fennel asks, happy about the two trainers wanting to further their education but what are they going to do about he Pokemon in front of them right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya looks at the mole Pokemon and thinks to himself that maybe having another member on the team wouldn't be so bad. The young man then looks at Kenki with with a smile on his face, The Dewott knew what his trainer was thinking and nods and gets ready to battle with the Drilbur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Looks like Touya wants to get another friend,\" Bianca said she watches Kenki get into a battle stance and let's out cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Drilbur jumps from the cry coming from behind him and falls over, Touya is amaze at how Drilbur is so focus on his surroundings he didn't notice the group. Drilbur quickly gets up and turns around and sees the Dewott and a trainer. Drilbur quickly figures out that they want to fight and gets into his battle stance, but Touya and Kenki both see that the Drilbur is off, the mole Pokemon is shaking a bit but that does not stop the Drilbur charring forward at Kenki. The Dewott is able to doge Drilbur's scratch attack with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kenki use Razor Shell,\" Touya says to Kenki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenki nods as he takes the shell on his right side and swings the shell with putting water in the shell making a water slash that hits the ground type Pokemon. Drilbur is quite weaken by the water attack and Touya took his chance as the young man take a Pokeball out of his bag and throws it at the Drilbur. The mole Pokemon does not have time to doge the ball and gets hit and gets warp into the ball. The poke'ball that holds the Drilbur falls onto the ground and starts to shake, Touya and Kenki both watch and hope they are able to catch the mole Pokemon. The ball stops shaking and they both hear the sound of ball capturing the Drilbur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got a new friend Touya,\" Bianca happily says, the tiny blonde is glad that Touya got his third team mate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you two can grow together,\" Juniper said, happy as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you think of an nickname for him?\" Fennel asks the giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya nods his head up and down and walks over to the the ball and picks it up. Touya then looks at Kenki and then says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for your hard work,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenki smiles as he puts the shell on his right side again as Touya lets out the Drilbur, the mole Pokemon looks around and sees that he has been caught by this trainer and other Pokemon. Drilbur wonders what they are going to do with him until he saw the trainer bend his knees to get closer the ground Pokemon and take out a blue spray bottle from his bag and sprays him with it, the ground Pokemon squeezes expecting pain but in fact feels the opposite of it. The Drilbur feels a bit better and sees that there are tiny People on this trainer's shoulder. Before the ground type Pokemon can question some things the trainer speaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope that helps Simon,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrilbur looks at the trainer and stares him for a couple of seconds before the trainer starts to talk about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't like that nickname?\" Touya asks wondering if he could come up with nick name. The Drilbur shakes shakes his head, he didn't mind the nick name and quite like having a name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good,\" Touya said with a smile and then says. \"You really love digging don't you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon nods his head as he loves to dig and explore the Wellspring caves ever since he was born. he would always dig all day and all night as well. Though the Drilbur is close to exploring the entire Wellspring Cave and is wondering how much longer he can find anything new in this cave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well come with me you'll get dig a lot more and see new locations,\" Touya said, since he knew that Kenki and Masou each had something they really wanted to do. He wonders if Simon had a dream about digging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon shows a shock express and then turns into a smile, it sounds nice to the ground type Pokemon. It would be amazing to find new things in caves and possible more to improve his digging skills as well. It looks like being partnered with trainer doesn't sound so bad. Simon lifts it's right claw and extends to Touya. Touya smiles as he careful holds Simon's claw so it will not scratch him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome aboard Simon, I'm Touya,\" Touya said as both of them stop their shake of hands. \"That's Kenki over there and you have another friend Masou,\" The trainer explaining more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Bianca by the way,\" The tiny blonde talks to Simon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice to meet you Simon. I'm Fennel,\" The tiny dark blue hair woman adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good to see you're healthy Simon,\" Juniper said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon nods and is happy to meet these tiny people, he never seen a human that small and wonders why Touya would has them and why are they were with them. The ground type didn't really have time to think as Touya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's time to get going, I'll let you later alright<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon nods agreeing to go back to it's ball but remembers something quickly digs into the ground. Touya, Kenki and the tiny women are wondering what's going on until SImon comes back and is holding onto some items!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like Simon is quite the gather,\" Juniper notes at all the items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya nods as he looks at all the times, TM 46 Thief, a dive ball and escape rope. Touya smiles as he puts the items in his bag and gets ready to put Simon back into his ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you very much,\" Touya said and Simon smiles brightly as he returns back to his ball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya gets back up and looks at Kenki and sees that Dewott is ready to leave as well. Touya nods with a smile and soon the Dewott and his trainer leave the Wellspring caves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to get back to that girl first,\" Bianca says not wanting to keep the girl waiting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya nods as well, Kenki nods too and Touya puts the water Pokemon back into it's ball and starts to walk towards to where the preschool and day care are.</span></div></div>",

Touya looks and sees that it's Cheren coming down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to thank both of you,\" The daycare lady said then looks at Touya. \"Thank you young man for getting Cino back for Amy,\" the daycare lady then looks at Cheren. \"Thank for helping keeping all the other children calm,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya is impress with Cheren for being to keep everyone calm, the brown hair trainer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for holding down the fort,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to take a compliment some times Touya,\" Cheren comments on Touya putting more praise on others then himself. The black hair trainer then looks at the daycare lady and says. \"It's fine Miss Autumn, I was just trying to my job while my friend took are his part. Cheren starts to walk away and while doing so says. \"Have a good day everyone and we'll see each other some other time Touya,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya nods as daycare Autumn nods as well, the preschool girl Amy stops her hugs and sees that Cheren is leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks again mister!\" Amy shouts happily, earlier Cheren was able help her calm down and told her that his friend is definitely going to get Cino back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheren sighs, but in happy tune and gives Amy a wave goodbye as he leaves, Touya notice this and smiles. Cheren always is good with younger kids and good at teaching as well, without Cheren's help Touya wouldn't be as knowledgeable as he is now. Touya believes that Cheren would be a good teacher if the black hair trainer wanted to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a fine young man,\" Autumn smiles about Cheren, the daycare lady then turns to Touya. \"Did any of you're Pokemon get injure? I can help heal them,\" Touya nods in agreement, his team did get a few scrapes from battling Team Plasma's Pokemon. Touya remembers that he has to get some potions as well to help heal Bianca's Pokmeon as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright I'll heal up you're Pokemon then,\" Autumn said as Touya let's out Kenki, Masou and Simon form their poke'balls and Autumn heals then with a up a full restore that she is carrying. Touya is surprise to see daycare lady have a full restore on her and before he can ask he hears a loud voice, the tiny blonde had to cover up ears since the voice is louder then it could possible be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Autumn Dear! Is everything okay!\" A loud voice yells from behind Touya, the brown hair trainer is able to see yelled at the person goes pass him and close to Autumn. Touya sees that it's and an old bold man that looks very concern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandpa, you came back from your errand to Nimbasa City?\" Autumn asks as she finishes healing up Touya's team of Pokmeon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I did. But that's not important right now. Your grandma told me on my Xtransceiver that one of your students Pokemon was stolen,\" Autumn's grandpa said still worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine grandpa Touya here was able to get Cino back for Amy,\" Autumn explains to grandfather and then looks at Touya. \"This is my grandpa, my grandma and him run the day care next door to the preschool I work at,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this young man helped you out? Then I'll have to reward you,\" The daycare man said as he runs into the day care house, before Touya and Autumn could say anything the daycare man comes out with a dark blue bicycle. \"It's not much but should help you on your journey and this thanks for helping out my grand daughter and her student.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya just did what he though was right, he is about to say no but sees that the daycare man is quite admiration about giving him the bike. Touya looks and sees that Autumn, Amy and even Cino want him to take the bike as well. Touya knew he couldn't refuse and says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you every much,\" Touya thanks for the daycare man giving the dark blue bicycle to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome sunny. By the way this bike can fit in your bag as well, it's easy rearrange the bike so it can fit in there,\" The daycare man said as he hands the bike to Touya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you're ready to set off then,\" Autumn said happy they were able to reward Touya but sad they couldn't give Cheren anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before you mister I can get your Xtransceiver's number?\" Amy asks older trainer. \"I want to be your friend,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds good. Add me as well,\" Autumn adds with a smile. \"I could always use a good person to talk to,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always give trainers my number as well,\" The day care man said with a smile and then adds. \"Your friend also helped out yes? Well tell him that if he ever need his Pokemon to look after he can drop them off here free as charge as well. Same goes for you as well,\" The day care kindness showing through again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you ever much,\" Touya answers the three and soon they each give out their Xtransceiver numbers to each other. Bianca is happy that Touya is making friends with everyone but some wishes she could join in the conversation with the giants as well. The tiny blonde makes sure that to come back her once she regains her height back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya puts his team back into their poke'balls and stats to walk away while wheeling the bike as well and waving goodbye to his new friends. Bianca out of habit stands up and waves back but then remembers she is suppose to be hidden and hides once more. The tiny blonde hopes that they didn't see her but Amy was to make out a tiny little blonde human with a green hat on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Touya is even friends with a fairy!\" Amy exclaims to Cino, Autumn and her grand father look at each other and both have a warm smile at Amy's imagination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n_____________________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya makes sure that he is alone as he gets on the bike then gets an idea. The bike a basket in front and a cloth that covering it, looks like that's how they were able to transfer Pokemon eggs, Touya looks at Bianca asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want a ride? We can have Professor Juniper and Fennel ride as well,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds so much fun!\" Bianca happy about getting a ride as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya's Xtransceiver starts to ring and the young answers it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fennel and I want to take the offer as well,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya smiles as they end the call, in a matte of minutes the tiny girls are in the basket ready for their ride. Touya then starts pedal at slow pace so the girls can have a nice look at their surroundings. The group's next destination is Nacrene City and Touya wonders when they will make it there.</span></div></div>",

With Touya's help the girls are in the bag once more and Touya is able to fold the bike up and place it in his bag, making sure that will not hurt the tiny travelers with him. After getting the bike put up, Touya goes to the Poke'center and gets a room and enters the room. Touya sees that it's one bedroom, with a bed, dresser, a TV on the dress, a table and couple of chairs and a rest room with a sink and shower. The room feels comfortable to Touya and soon the tiny girls fell comfortable in the room as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya is sitting on the bed with a book near by and Masou in front of him. The young man is learning to give out massages to give his Pokemon a bit of happiness and Masou want to get one so the fire monkey would be able to pose easily. Touya is now wearing a white shirt with some black sweat pants, in the right hand corner Kenki, Fia and Simon are doing a bit of training together, Simon getting a bit fighting experience from learning how to use his claws to a good slash and learning how to doge from Fia since the fire pig is becoming more in tune with it's fighting type. Allie is taking a nice nap near the bed. Penelope is floating near the table where her trainer and other tiny women are. Bianca is wearing a white shirt, orange shorts with long black socks. Juniper is wearing a white tank top with lime green short shorts and Fennel is wearing a white night gown with purple flower pattern on the gown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is a mini version of your dream machine?\" Bianca asks the dark blue hair women. The tiny blonde looks at the machine that is made out of a compute, storage device and another deice that looks like it takes in data plus some wires that can put a person or pokmeon as well. Touya had help Fennel get this mini deice from his bag and Fennel is able to set it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.My sister and I made a mini version of it so I can still do my research on dreams,\" Fennel answers Bianca's question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It must have been easy making copy that fast since it's so small,\" Juniper comments on Fennel and the grade school girl's quickness on building the machine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! That's also why I have to ask you if you don't mind if I use some the dream mist from Penelope for testing it out?\" Fennel asks the blonde, Bianca looks at the Munna and sees that Penelope is agreeing to let Fennel use the dream mist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She says yes,\" Bianca replies and Fennel starts to smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So who is going to be the test subject for this device?\" Juniper asks since that is the last part that her friend needs to figure out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be doing it,\" Fennel said with a smile. \"I think I'll even put another test as well,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of test?\" Bianca asks wondering what Fennel is thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking have of someone messing with by body while I sleep, we'll be able to record the date and see how that effects my dreams from the dream mist and will be shown on the compute there,\" Fennel explains to Bianca as she points at the computer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you have in mind?\" Juniper curious about what her friend has plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see,\" Fennel says with a smile and the dark hair woman run close to the edge of the table and yells. \"Touya can you come over here! I need you for something,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya had just finish giving Masou a massage, the young man hears Fennel's yells. Touya thanks Masou for letting him practice massages on his body, the fire monkey smiles back and starts to flex. Touya's massage is quite good for beginner to the fire Monkey as he flexes more as Touya gets off the bed and walks over to the table. When Touya gets to the table Fennel smiles and starts to explain what Touya has to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Touya! I was wondering if you could help me out. I'm going to be put myself under some dream mist and record my dream to see if anything has change since I've become smaller. That's when you come in, I want you to give me a massage so Juniper here can see that changes my dream on the computer screen,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you just want to get a massage since he was reading up on it,\" Juniper thought as Fennel saw that is one of the books that Touya has in his bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds nice. I might have to get one later as well,\" Bianca thought with a smile, the tiny blonde sees that Masou liked it getting one so Touya must be good at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya wonders if he should do what Fennel is asking, he is just starting to learn how to give out massages and he didn't want hurt the tiny woman from not having experience with dealing someone or Pokemon that small.

Fennel appeared to be laying down on a table or mattress of sorts. A large blanket covered her whole body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we looking at, Professor?\" Bianca asks Juniper in the real world as both watch the screen intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Fennel's dream, it's happening in her subconscious as we speak.\" Juniper explains, analyzing her coworker's dream at the same time. \"Since she's getting a massage from Touya in the real world, I suppose that's way we're seeing her getting a massage in her dream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true, the scene had expanded to reveal Fennel was indeed laying down for a massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, I never expected Fennel to be so simple.\" Juniper says, but then thinks of something. \"Although, this might be a result of her shrinking...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Bianca asks curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Fennel suspected something might change in us because of our shrinking, so she probably wanted to run this test to see if dreams might've changed as well.\" Juniper states. \"Still, I guess she can be simple at times...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I don't think Fennel is as simple as you might think, Professor.\" Touya says nervously as he watches the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn it, the scene has pulled back yet again to show that Touya was there as well, confusing the young man as he watched himself on the screen. But as the scene continued, it made sense. Dream Touya flexed his hands and stretched his arms, then got down and began rubbing dream Fennel's shoulders with his hands. Fennel was dreaming of Touya's massage! Not only that, but the massage that \"Touya\" was giving the professor's dream-self quickly shifts into a much more 'touchy' one than the one the real Touya was giving the shrunken woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya in the dream grabbed the blanket that dream Fennel was using to cover herself, and in swift motion, threw it off onto the floor, leaving Fennel completely naked, though she was laying on her front, so nothing could be seen in the dream. In the real world, the watchers gasped and blushed, and all wondered if this is how Fennel thought of Touya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the dream, Touya massages Fennel's whole body, rubbing down every inch of the full-sized woman as she moaned into it. Fennel face in the dream was red, but one of complete satisfaction as she smiled, clearly enjoying the young man's touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's that feel?\" Touya asks in the dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it... Right theeere...\" Fennel purrs in her dream-state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is... unexpected.\" Juniper says as she watches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Touya! What you doing to the professor!?\" Bianca yells up at the real Touya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No-Nothing! See?\" Touya pulls his hands away from the tiny woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden in the dream, Touya pulled away from Fennel. She looks up at him, shocked and confused, but mostly disappointed that his expert hands weren't massaging her body anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What gives?\" Fennel asks in the dream. But Touya says nothing and just stares at her. The image on the screen starts to blur out gradually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the real world, Fennel's tiny body started to rock a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Touya! I think you not continuing the massage is making Fennel start to wake up!\" Juniper yells urgently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should I do?\" Touya asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want him to continue this weird dream?\" Bianca asks, a little annoyed by how Fennel dreamt of the young man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it is strange. But I'm not sure if I have enough data to go over with her just yet.\" Juniper tells the two. \"It's up to you though, Touya.

Juniper smiles and is about to tell Touya and Bianca the good news but hears Dream Fennel talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That feels so nice,\" Dream Fennel closes her eyes and continues to talk. \"I've been on my feet all day from check on my dream research,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuniper sighs, even in her dreams Fennel is still thinking about her dream research. Juniper sees that Dream Fennel still has something to say to the Dream Touya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really didn't need to do this, I mean you were just starting your own Pokemon Journey and now you're staying behind to help me,\" Juniper could see that Dream Fennel's relax face change into melodically look. Juniper sees that Fennel stills feels a bit responsible for slowing Touya down, the light brown hair woman would need to have a talk with her best friend once this experiment is done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDream Touya stops giving the massage and walks around so he stand in front of the Dram Fennel. The dream version of the young man bends his knees so he and Dream Fennel could be face to face. Juniper could see that Dream Fennel's face is quite surprise at Dream Touya's action and dream woman's face is getting redder from Dream Touya's stare and warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I didn't mind, besides who wouldn't want to be with a lovely woman like you,\" Dream Touya said as he moves his foward and gives Dream Fennel a quick kiss on the lips! Juniper is shock to see such a kiss like that happen even if it was a dream, the light brown hair woman quickly looks to see if Touya or Bianca had heard or saw what happen on the monitor. Luckily for the Pokemon Professor, Touya is still focus on the massage of the tiny Fennel and Bianca is staring at Touya not even hearing what was going on in the dream. Juniper sighs in relief once more and turns her head when she hears Dream Touya talk more from the screen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm done with the message,\" Dream Touya stands up and gets the the blanket and gives it back to Dream Fennel. \"I'll get dinner ready so lie down and relax.

Touya sees that mood did change is happy to see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright I'll give a massage now,\" Touya said with a smile as Bianca smiles as lies down on the table and the giant walks over and starts to use his index fingers to put some pressure on the tiny blonde's back. While Touya and Bianca are busy Juniper quickly walks over to the Fennel, who just finish waking up by standing up and stretching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Aurea, did everything go as plan?\" Fennel asks at seeing Juniper walking over to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but there's something I need to tell you about your dream,\" Juniper said as she reaches Fennel. The dark blue hair woman looks at her best friend and wonders what kind of dream she could have had. \"You an intimate dream with Touya,\" Juniper says to Fennel who is looks surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What! What do you mean?!?\" Fennell exclaims, Juniper quickly puts her right hand over Fennel's mouth and turns her head to see that Touya was too busy giving a Bianca a massage and Bianca is enjoying the message. Juniper relaxes as Fennel's out burst did not alert the two people in the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look I'll tell you, but you're going have to quite,\" Juniper whispers to Fennel, the dream researcher slowly nods and Juniper takes her hand off of Fennel's mouth. Juniper quickly tells Fennel what happen in dark blue hair woman's dream, Fennel has a faint blush on her face. \"I do wonder what you think of Touya,\" Juniper said at seeing Fennel's blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, maybe it's been awhile since I've been around a guy,\" Fennel replies back softly and adds. \"Besides he is little handsome as well and Amanita gets along with him.... Look it was just a silly dream,\" Fennel tries to get off topic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to sort this out with Touya and Bianca,\" Juniper whispers trying to keep on topic. \"Both of them were confuse about that dream,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, they'll understand if it was just a dream I was having because of a massage,\" Fennel whispers back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Professor Juniper what are doing over there?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuniper and Fennel both look and see that it's Bianca walking towards them. The blonde looks quite happy after getting massage from Touya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good timing Bianca. Fennel would like to explain something to you about that dream,\" Juniper said and turns around to Fennel. Fennel couldn't believe what her best friend was doing to her. Before Fennel could talk Bianca speaks first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine. Touya just gives a good massages,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, so let's just forget this and have a lesson why don't we,\" Fennel says happy that no one wants to talk about her dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay Professor Fennel, I think I'll just check up on my Pokemon,\" Bianca replies, Junipers could see that blonde still had some feelings about what happen and Bianca soon leaves the two goes to  Penelope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fennel you know what you have to do,\" Juniper said to dark blue hair woman, Fennel sweats a bit and then says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll go see what data I gather right now,\" Fennel quickly goes to her research machine, Juniper sighs as the giant young man walks behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Professor Juniper would you like a massage?\" Touya asks since he gave the other tiny ladies a massage he figure Juniper would like one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm okay Touya, I think you need to relax a bit,\" Juniper answers back, the light brown hair woman could see that Touya could use a bit of break from focusing the massages. Touya nods as he walks away and then lies down on a bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pokemon stop watching and soon go back to what they were doing. Kenki, Fia and Simon were about to go back to practice fighting until the Drilbur makes some whisper noises at the Dewott. Simon wondered who the three tiny beings were with his trainer and he just told Kenki that he figures that the three tiny females must be Touya mates. Kenki sighs and makes whisper noise to tell Simon not to go down that hole. </span></div></div>",

After a brake Touya went back to league and become champion. Now Touya just travels Unova trying to complete his poke'dex. Touya's current team was Maru, Dar (a Darmanitan), Brave (Braviary), Lily (Lilligant), Cho (Cubchoo) and Bish (Bisharp). Zekrom was at the Dragonspiral Tower waiting for the next that he will be needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouya was in Accumula Town when his Friend Bianca was calling him. Bianca was an eighteen year old and one of Touya's best friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Touya!\" Bianca yelled as Touya turn around and saw the blond hair girl. Touya had to admit that he had a crush on Bianca and felt his heart skip a beat when he saw her. Touya even knew what Pokemon that Bianca had. She had Emboar, Stoutland, Simisage, Musharna, Mienshao, and Chandelure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi. What's up Bianca?\" Touya asks as he saw that she was holding a strange poke ball. The ball was pink and had a M on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found this poke ball in the lab. It seems like Professor Juniper and Fennel were working on this. And they wanted me to try it out.\" Bianca explains as the two head out to the tall grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are Professor Juniper and Fennel at the lab together?\" Touya aks as Bianca shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Professor is in her lab in Nuvema Town and Fennel is in Striaton City,\" Bianca explain more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So your just going to catch a Pokemon right?

Suddenly a pink flash of light come out the ball. It blinds the two for a couple of minutes. Unkown to them the M ball is a Mini ball. Meant to shrink a Pokemon so it would be easier to catch.

I'm sure the three of can think of thing,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAurea smiles at the sight. Touya and Bianca sure did grow from their journey and it made her proud to see them have so much courage. But another part of Aurea was thinking of something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They look so cute and small. I just want to have fun with them,\" A voice in her head said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAurea shakes her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really. They are tiny and can have fun with them.

Bianca also become a beautiful sweet young lady the become your assistance. Come on, I know you want to.\" The voice in Aurea's head replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAurea blushes at what the voice said. It is true that she felt like she had power over the naked humans and she did think both of them grew up quite a bit and she couldn't help but fell attracted to Touya and Bianca<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there something wrong Professor?\" Bianca asks as she worried about the older women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you need anything, we can help,\" Touya adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAurea..... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Serena turns her head as well while blushing but stays calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I got shrunk from some stone I found,\" Calem explains as raises his arm up in the air and open palm with a small stone in his. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena and Shauna try to see what the stone Calem is talking about. So the two bend down to see if they can see the stone, both of them blush at seeing a better view at Calem in the buff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Now I see it,\" Shauna says even though the stone is very small, the brunet could still see it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's the stone fault, are sure it's okay for us being so close to it?\" Serena asks a little worry about shrinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.

Froakie joins him in watching, groaning. \"Was it like this with me too, Froakie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFroakie croaks and nods its head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, I hope they don't end up like me..\" Calem says. Froakie responds by croaking again. \"Hmm? They shouldn't be out too long? That's good, but for now, I better make sure they're okay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalem runs over to Shauna's clothes first, the young girl has already shrank into her clothes, becoming completely obscured by them. Calem worries that she might suffocate in there, so he rushes over and finds a small lump in the clothes, but as he gets nearer, he sees that the lump is actually about the same size as himself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please be okay!\" Calem worries. He pulls the large shirt over and sees that Shauna is there, looking rather peaceful as she sleeps. Relieved, Calem pulls the shirt down just enough to leave her head out, so as not to suffocate her in her own clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he turns to where Serena shrank and blushes as dirty thoughts enter his mind. Shauna was one thing, but now he had the chance to see Serena all naked! Calem could hardly contain himself as he ran over to the black and red mess of clothes that were covering Serena's shrunken, no doubt sleeping, body. Of course, keeping her safe was on his mind as well, but as a red-blooded young man, he couldn't help but take advantage of the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching Serena's top, he spotted an lump in it similar to the one that was Shauna before, although this one was more equal in size to himself.

Serena's long flowing hair <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it was you knew my shirt,\" Serene said somewhat coldly, somehow the blond knew that Calem seem to have dirty thoughts while helping her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you must have thought I was a wild Pokemon or something,\" Calem said trying to cover the fact that he wen a bit crazy waning to see the blond in her naked glory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Shauna?\" Serena asks worry about her friend, Calem could see depending on his answer he could possible get another punch from the angry trainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's fine. I made sure that she's fine and I didn't see anything,\" Calem replies, he knew that Shauna is cute but still young, maybe a few later he would think of the brunette in that way. Calem shakes his head, it was no time to think about that and he didn't want to get another punch from Serena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good,\" Serena said, thinking at least he could hold back from looking at Shauna in the nude. \"Well since you're out and about, go into my bag I have some cloth in there we can use as clothes,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright I'll go get the cloth,\" Calem said as he gets up and runs towards Serena's bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFroakie sighs watching the scene, even though he could sense that his trainer had a good heart it still embarrassed the frog Pokemon that his trainer could be this girl crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take Calem to find multiple black cloths, as mush he wished he could explore more in Serena's bag he knew he better make it quick.

Calem gets a goofy grin as Froakie sighs at the way his trainer is acing. Calem does not get long to think About Serena's body as he sees both now shrunken girls are now coming near by. Calem sees that Shauna has long hair going down, looking quite cute from the way she did her before and sees that Shauna is wearing the cloth like a big dress that covers her quite well. Serena is in a toga type clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for helping us out Calem,\" Shauna said, Serena told her what happen is glad that Calem is so helpful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no problem,\" Calem said and then asks.
