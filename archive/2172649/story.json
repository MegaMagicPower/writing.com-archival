Im willing to give writers a chance to write the stories or interactives they wanted to write but never got the chance. And I'll adjust the age rating based on what's posted. I'm not fussed what you post, but I expect you to put some effort into it. I have one condition:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) If you add a one line or two line chapter or a short bridge chapter in general. YOU MUST ADD TO IT. No one line \"Does she do this?\" \"What about this?\" \"What about this?\". That stuff adds NOTHING to the website and if you post it, i'll delete it. If you have an account that adds nothing but that garbage to interactives I'll delete it as soon as I see it, otherwise I'll give you sometime based on how much you contribute to the site (I'll wait an hour for new accounts). If people keep spamming that instead of real chapters I may just delete this interactive, so don't abuse my kindness. But if you're here to write then have at it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Put some effort into it. It doesn't need to be a masterpiece but make it obvious you put some thought into it and at least glanced at what you type. I won't enforce this one too harshly, as long as it's clear you're trying I'll likely leave you be<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There are 4 main characters (we just added a 5th but they haven\u2019t played enough for me to gauge their personality accurately)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemember these four are adventuring together and trust each other. They are a team.<br>\r\nCharacters -<br>\r\nChuck the half orc-half dwarf<br>\r\n6\u201906\u201d <br>\r\nTanned skin, black stringy hair, brown eyes<br>\r\nWears minimal clothing, usually just his loincloth. Muscular physique, wields a greataxe single handedly.<br>\r\nIs a bit of brute, loves showing his force and dominance over others. But deep down has a softer side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzura the human<br>\r\n5\u201903\u201d <br>\r\nPale complexion, pale blue hair, ice blue eyes<br>\r\nWears a light weight pale blue dress with white trim. Lean build, size B cup, is a caster and well versed in a wide array of magic.<br>\r\nA bit shy and meek, but protective of her friends (Chuck, Celica, Silver)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelica the human<br>\r\n5\u201905\u201d<br>\r\nLightly tanned complexion, lavender hair, gold eye (is missing her right eye)<br>\r\nWears a green long sleeve tunic, black longcoat (purple trim), gray pants, brown boots. Semi muscular, size A cup, is a Ranger, prefers her longbow but can use a longsword and short sword for close quarter combat and has knowledge of casting magic but not her specialty.<br>\r\nShe is cold and indifferent to people, has been seen with a sadistic side. Cares greatly for her lover (Azura) but may playfully tease her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelica-Alt the Storm Dragon<br>\r\n200\u201900\u201d<br>\r\nBipedal dragon <br>\r\nLavender scales, black underbelly/neck scales and wing membrane, silver mane that starts at her scalp and runs down to her shoulders. Crimson eye (still missing the right eye)<br>\r\nOnce she took on this form, Celica became more sadistic and enjoys toying with others to a dark level. She still retains her love/affection for Azura but has a bad habit of showing her love in not normal ways (might swallow Azura to protect her). Enjoys playing/toying with Chuck and Silver but would never actually hurt them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver the half elf-half human<br>\r\n6\u201909\u201d<br>\r\nNever seen out of his armor (you decide his skin tone), assumed he has silver hair, green eyes<br>\r\nWears full plate armor (silver in coloration), armor covers him head to toe. Is always seen with his greatsword (wielding one handed) and tower shield. <br>\r\nHe is proper and formal, acts as a morale compass. Will give his life for Celica in a heartbeat even if they don\u2019t always see eye to eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI included both variations of Celica (my character) due to the transformation that occurred during one of our campaigns. The Dragon Transformation did alter a lot about the group\u2019s dynamics and how we played, and altered Celica\u2019s personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeel free to add and go crazy. All I ask is that you try to stay true to the characters\u2019 personalities above. </span></div></div>",

Welcome to the Distortion World reboot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIntro - Time Eater, a powerful warlock, has begun crushing 4 worlds in on themselves thus creating a fifth world (Distortion World). 4 heroes are brought into the Distortion in order to save the realms. In order to do such, they\u2019ll need to collect the 4 Cardinal jewels and the 4 legendary weapons. They\u2019ll need to work as a team?

Camilla shook her head before hearing a groan. \u201cSomething to say, Warren?\u201d Azura asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarren, the group\u2019s main healer, rolled his eyes. \u201cLocked chests and nothing?

Chuck growled as he cleaved through a hidden door and signaled for the others to follow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamilla drew her short sword and took point with chuck beside her. There was nothing just an empty bedroom-like chamber. \u201cLooks all clear.\u201d The ranger said before working on getting the fire going. As she sat, she thought about the potion.

Hunkered down in a snow cave were three humanoids. The first was a half orc-half dwarf, his greataxe laying beside him. His bedroll and blanket were scuffed in many spots and his pack was barely holding together. The next was a half elf-half human, beside him was his silver armor, greatsword and tower shield. His gear looked in better shape than the other male\u2019s. Finally there was a human girl, her staff, rapier and spellbook all within easy reach. Her gear was very worn down and had seen better days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooming over the trio was a massive dragon, her lavender scales shimmering in the faint light. Her body was pressed against the entrance to the snow cave preventing any cold air from seeping and ensuring the warmth of the fire did not escape. Her crimson eye opened as she let out a massive yawn, she flicked her tongue a few times before looking to the humanoids. \u201cWakey, wakey guys.\u201d She said as she lumbered closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFive more minutes...\u201d the human replied as she rolled over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon smirked as she nuzzles the human. \u201cCome on Azura, you slept plenty.\u201d She cooes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe half orc yawns as he sits up. \u201cWhat Chuck do today?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe half elf groggily sits up and scratches his head. \u201cChuck why do you always talking like that?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChuck see Silver not mused. Chuck say Silver try.\u201d Chuck laughed as he gathered up his belongings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver rolled his eyes as he stood and began getting his armor on. \u201cDamn thing is heavy.\u201d He mumbles as he adjusts how the full plate armor rests on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat way Chuck no wear armor!\u201d Chuck belts loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon laughed watching the two men. Her attention returns to Azura, whom she nuzzles again. \u201cWakey Wakey.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFive more minutes, Celica.\u201d Azura responds as she pats the dragon\u2019s snout. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelica smirks slightly. \u201cAlright fine, you can sleep while we\u2019re on route.\u201d The dragon states as her long slinder tongue snakes out of her jaws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver and Chuck both shudder knowing what was next. They gathered up their supplies then sat back waiting. Azura felt something slimy wrap around her before being dragged around. \u201cCelica! Wait!\u201d She cries out as the dragon snaps her jaws shut around her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelica chuckles as she tilts her head back and swallows. She purrs somewhat sadisticly as Azura slides down her throat. She looks down as the caster\u2019s supplies and licks those up to, sending them to her stomach with their owner. Azura lands with a wet plop in the dragon\u2019s stomach and shakes off. \u201cGods dang it Celica! Why are you like this?!\u201d She calls up as she gathers her belongings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t want to get up.\u201d Celica chuckles as she stands. She looks to the guys. \u201cYou boys ready?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, Let\u2019s get going.\u201d Silver says. He pulls out the map and unfolds it. \u201cWe have a few choices for our route to the Instinctive Aether. We can go through Frostbite peak, desolate ridge or try our luck with the lost zone. What do you guys think?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Im willing to give writers a chance to write the stories or interactives they wanted to write but never got the chance. And I'll adjust the age rating based on what's posted. I'm not fussed what you post, but I expect you to put some effort into it. I have one condition:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) If you add a one line or two line chapter or a short bridge chapter in general. YOU MUST ADD TO IT. No one line \"Does she do this?\" \"What about this?\" \"What about this?\". That stuff adds NOTHING to the website and if you post it, i'll delete it. If you have an account that adds nothing but that garbage to interactives I'll delete it as soon as I see it, otherwise I'll give you sometime based on how much you contribute to the site (I'll wait an hour for new accounts). If people keep spamming that instead of real chapters I may just delete this interactive, so don't abuse my kindness. But if you're here to write then have at it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Put some effort into it. It doesn't need to be a masterpiece but make it obvious you put some thought into it and at least glanced at what you type. I won't enforce this one too harshly, as long as it's clear you're trying I'll likely leave you be<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd whoever gave me membership: thanks man</td>",
