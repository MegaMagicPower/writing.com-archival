And sadly Jim was the only human slave among all macro male slaves. The human wasn't sure why his macro lion master only had males slaves, but from what he was told was that the Baron had the macros do a lot of hard labor around his home. Speaking of the other slaves these included a muscle gut macro anthro grizzly bear named Thor, a well muscled  macro anthro fox named Niles, a lean muscled macro anthro raccoon named Peter, and finally a well muscled macro anthro skunk named Richard. And among the four macros Jim had bonded the most with Richard since he had the kindest to the human when he had been first taken to the slave house about five years ago. He was even nice enough to share what little food he had gotten with the human so he couldn't die from not eating. And during those five years the human learned the giant skunk was in his mid thirties and had been a slave for about ten years. However, when Jim was told about the tasks that he and others were made to do then it made sense to the human as to way all of the anthros were so fit. The other three macros however weren't that bad, but sometimes they did try to push the small human around as a way to get rid of their frustration of being slaves. Well, either that or they felt that Jim's tasks were far to easy compared to theirs. However, whenever they attempted to do this Jim was quickly picked up by Richard who warned the others to leave him alone. And quite honestly if it hadn't of been for the muscled skunk Jim knew that he would not have survived being a slave for those long five years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne night though while Jim was sitting up against the giant brick wall he saw.....</span></div></div>",
