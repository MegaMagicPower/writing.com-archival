It offended her, that she had to practically beg for the use of her own beast. Dearly she wanted to rip open the letter and find out the danger to the realm... to his realm. However, it was sealed with Fia's personal seal, and she wasn't sure she could even get into the kings chambers... damn it... her own chambers... -<i>fuck</i>- his own chambers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenee started to worry about mental changes, as she climbed into the saddle. It was more of a struggle than she wanted to admit. The stable master, stood back and just enjoyed the spectacle of a girl trying to mount a horse. She wasn't used to this more petite body, this weaker body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure, you know how to ride?\" the stable master asked. He licked his lip, as he said 'ride'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her legs straddling the horse, she put both feet comfortably in the stirrups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you prefer, I can get you a ladies' saddle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hand came up, stroking the hard leather of the pommel, sliding down towards Renee's crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swatted it away with a swipe of her riding crop. Digging her heels in, she bolted out of the stables, and headed out the castle gates. The reins were heavier, more work, than she wanted to admit. There was also the matter of pace, she didn't want the message to arrive late, whatever the danger. Frankly though, the horse seemed intent on reminding her of her new sex, as she jiggled and shook whatever pace she moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer bust felt particularly mobile, threatening to leap out of her low cut blouse, when the pace became too eager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also felt it rather more in her ass... her wide ass, and blushing as she thought of it.... her new pussy seemed to be responding to the impacts, and straining muscles as she used her powerful thighs to hold her in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she reached the harbour, her muscles aching for a change of pace, she slowed the horse as she headed along the harbour front itself. Looking down she saw the harlot touting for business, displaying their ample wares. The sight was less impressive as Renee looked past her own ample bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a simple maid riding a horse she drew her own share of attention and speculation. Her jiggling flesh distracting more than a few men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached 'The Whale Song', and tossed the reins down to a soldier standing guard at the base of the gang-plank. Instinctively he caught it, and did a double take, when a busty maid dismounted, flashing him her well rounded ass. The ground feels wobbly as you walk, now a little bandy legged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe intent way he keeps his eyes on your face, you realise you just showed him your arse. You just wish you knew whether or not you were wearing anything under this simple peasant skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenee had to show him the letter from her daughter... -<i>damn it</i>- his daughter to be allowed up the gang-plank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gasped, as the soldier, pulled her close, and planted a kiss on her startled face. He released her instantly, and she staggered up the gang-plank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A personal charge for all the pretty ladies.\" he said with roguish charm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sailors are busy with many tasks around the ship, as you look around for Captain Harris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spot an officer, as you head towards the wheel. \"Captain Harris.\" your voice doesn't carry the authority that you like, but you still get a quick answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's in his cabin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first mate, fits his trousers rather well, you notice absently, before blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sees your cheeks turn red, and smiles, you turn a deeper red. \"Through that door.\" he points. \"The walls are quite thin.\" he adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ponder what he means, as you knock on the door and enter. It's only polite to knock, but you don't want to wait either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you are half-way through the door, you work out that the first mate thinks you're a whore... and he's warning you not to be too vocal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stagger as the ship shifts, your mind otherwise occupied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a cough, \"A message from the Princess.\" you present him the letter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gestures you into the empty chair. There are charts open over his desk, and he examines the letter as he shuts the door. You don't see when he nods to the first mate, but the solid thunk of the wood as the door closes in the frame does remind you of the first mate's comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reads it, an unhappy look on his face. Sitting down opposite you, he lifts it up again, rereading it. He takes in every word, even now you can't read it. Captain Harris is obviously a cautious man, most maids... hell, most women can't read, but still he's holding it in such a way that you can't even get a glimpse of the message.</span></div></div>",

She hoped there would be a reply, and was eager to find out everything she could about any danger to the kingdom. With her hands clasped together in her lap, she tried to show the patience that would be expected from a maid awaiting her betters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she raised a hand to her mouth and gave a polite cough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a reply?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain Harris snorted, not raising his head from the charts. But with a tilt of his head he directed her gaze towards the window at the back of his cabin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she watched, one of the buildings drifted past. The ship was already moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare you?\" she started angrily getting to her feet. Her voice lacked the strength of his majesty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The message needs no reply.\" he said with a smile, as Renee got to her feet. She flung open the cabin door, and headed on the deck. In her haste, she climbed to the wheelhouse, as the ship passed beyond the breakwater. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spotted Marlin riding a grey speckled mare, with one hand he clutched the reins, and in the other. She couldn't quite see, but she had to assume it was the antidote... the potion to restore her regal body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she passed the First, she waved to the court mage, who was now dismounting. He'd ridden the horse as far as he could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenee gave a shriek, as she was drenched in some foul smelling waste. Turning angrily she shrieked at the startled cabin boy, an empty waste bucket in his hands. She was soaked from head to toe, her dress drenched and her hair now hanging limply, lankly around her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ... I was throwing it overboard... you came out of nowhere...\" he sobbed, not used to the glare of an intimidating woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snarled at him, like a feral cat. But then turned back towards the breakwater. She wasn't sure if Marlin would be able to throw the potion as far as the ship, and she was sure she didn't want rumours starting about Renee disappearing, and the King's magical reappearance at the same time. Such rumours were impossible to quench, once they began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlin's hand was raised high, as he watched for a signal. But with a curt angry shake, Renee declined the offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain startled her when he landed his hand on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you're along for the duration.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up at the man, a new appreciation for her petite size... well, height dawning on her. He nose wrinkling in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you'll need a change of clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And a wash...\" Renee added with a smile.</span></div></div>",

Renee's eyes instinctively darted around the room, as she felt a growing sense of entrapment. But the sigh, suggested the Captain wasn't planning anything indiscreet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am, you need to be careful what you say around my men. Seemingly innocent words can be misunderstood, and sailor feel the same frustrations, especially on longer voyages.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"long .. longer voyages...\" her voice cracked as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I didn't mean to distress you. This shall be a short sailing.\" He said reassuringly, his deep tones settling into her bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You also need to know that there aren't any womens clothes on board, and yours are no longer fit to wear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenee wanted to protest, but even now the cabin was starting to feel a little stuffy, and the hint of decaying food, a little nauseating was threatening to linger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom a wardrobe he tossed her some simple clothes, a rough cotton jerkin, and a pair of trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These were Tom's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe name meant nothing to her, and Captain Bill Harris didn't explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I trust you don't expect me to leave <b>my </b>cabin on your behalf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis gaze was on his charts as he spoke. Renee blushed at the idea of undressing in front of a man. But the sight of female flesh was not enough to trigger simple animal urges. She struggled to undo her bodice, as the laces resisted her long fingernails. But instantly she felt happier as they released their hold on her internal organs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing over to the Captain, he was still looking over his charts. His taut ripe ass, nicely exposed. She slid the dress off her shoulders, allowing it to fall as low as her waist. With her breasts on display, she did a little shimmy, and it fell the rest of the way to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaked apart from her rather tight leather panties, she took in her body for the first time. Her breasts were ripe and mature, a little lower than he/she preferred. But nothing embarrassing, throwing her shoulders back, she liked the reassuring weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenee was a little disappointed when the Captain didn't sneak a look, wasn't she an attractive woman?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as she pulled the trousers up, she discovered a problem. Tom didn't have her wide hips, nor the roundness of her ass. With an effort she pulled them into place. The fabric straining at the seams, while her waist hung baggy and loose, promising to drop at the first chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slid her arms into the sleeves of the jerkin, and pulled it down. As a cabin boy, she wouldn't pass even a cursory glance. But she wasn't on display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jerkin was cut rather low, and not tailored for a woman's curves either. The girls jostled, threatening to escape the confines of the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe needed a second opinion, and gave her thighs an idle slap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't twirl for him, but she gave a little turn in each direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis smile looked genuine, and Renee was happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer happiness was brief. \"Captain.\" she said respectfully, and even in trousers she gave a curtsey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trousers ripped loudly from front to back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing crimson, she futilely tried to cover her underwear. But managed only to draw more attention to her situation with her wild gestures, and beetroot red cheeks.</span></div></div>",

At least this way there was still a little time before the wedding in which she could slip away and get back to the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later Peter came back, both dresses wrapped in a beige cloth under one of his arms and in the other he was retying the little bag of coins back onto his belt. \u201cSorry I took so long my dear, you\u2019re going to look so sexy in these,\u201d leaving the shop Peter led Astrid through the street, his interest very much focused on talking about the wedding.  \u201cYou\u2019re going to love it you know; it\u2019s very likely that with the coming harvests I\u2019ll be getting so much more silver that you\u2019ll be the very embodiment of a princess\u201d, knowing how much the farmer had in his purse it was unlikely that even in 10 years could he produce something a princess lived on in one week. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe midday sun was quickly setting and if she didn\u2019t think of something soon she\u2019d married to this oaf, as Peter paused once more retelling how she\u2019d learn to make the tastiest meals with time she interrupted. \u201cMy dear, it is getting awful late, how could we have a wedding today if you\u2019ve spent all day caring for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPausing in his tracks Peter took a moment to contemplate it, \u201cYa\u2019know what, you\u2019re right. You\u2019re absolutely right. First thing in the morning we shall wed,\u201d he lent in close to Astrid giving her a quick peck on her cheek, \u201cand in the evening we\u2019ll be able to enjoy sharing a married bed as husband and wife\u201d. A warmness was growing through Astrid and hearing the last part of his proposal made her feel a flutter in her stomach, how did the dirty thoughts of this peasant drive her so wild. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing heavily she tried to avert his gaze, looking at the ground she saw his movement too late when his hand pushed her chin upwards and he locked his lips with hers. After what felt like hours the sun had only set a little more when they parted lips, her legs quivering and between her legs becoming moist. Part of her coming to her senses at what she had done realised the true extent of the power Peter had over her weak and easily manipulated body, if she wasn\u2019t careful she would be stuck as this forever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I should go, I have a room at the inn down the road\u201d, she said trying to contain her heavy breathing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll be there in the morning\u2026 something to remember me by my love,\u201d this time catching her off guard he went in for a greed kiss, his hands held on to her generous behind. While shorter than the last one it got her even hotter as it reapplied the curses secondary effects meaning that even by morning she would be affected by the submissive side of the spell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting her go he passed the dresses to Astrid before saying asking Astrid something, \u201cI love you, before I go could you say it, Say I love you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to tell him to go to hell and that her head wizard would turn her into a mouse but almost without dropping a beat her mouth began to move \u201cI\u2026 I love you\u201d.

The idea of not only becoming a peasant in body but also in mind was something to avoid at all cost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecondly the more time that she spent around Peter the more her body became that of a horny wench in heat, if he had pushed a little harder there was no doubt that Astrid would have fucked him here and then when they had been in this room earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally as she noticed when she tried to leave the store earlier whatever Peter told her to do something it was very difficult to resist his commands, almost as if he had a power over her very thoughts though looking back it was a little more obvious that the potion had somehow bent her will to be more agreeable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now there wasn\u2019t much more that she could do, part of her wanted to run back into the castle and at best case be saved by Marlin or be thrown into the jail so that she could cool down but at night it was nigh impossible to get into the main courtyard, instead she\u2019d have to go there in the morning and try and get Marlin\u2019s attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUndoing her belt she released her dress and dropped it on a chair beside the bed, crawling beneath the covers it was very clear it wasn\u2019t fit for a king but at this time she had to rest for tomorrow she\u2019d need it if she wanted to resist the magic of the potion. <br>\r\n--------------------------<br>\r\n<i>Astrid sat beside the fire of the small hovel, rocking backwards and forwards in a wooden rocking chair sewing away a patch into a pair of dark pants. The smell of meat and leak stew strongly filled every crack of the building as Astrid knew that her Peter was going to need a good meal when he came in from tending to the animals in a few minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe loved that man more than anything, his smile, his love, his lust. Everything about him made him the perfect husband as she raised a hand looking at misshapen metallic wedding band around her finger. With a warm smile she stood from the chair and looked at her handy work, a perfect patch for her perfect man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing the pants onto a table she knew there was something she was forgetting but Astrid knew it wasn\u2019t her place to think, Peter was the smart one, and he was the one bringing in all that silver while she was responsible for something different. With that thought she looked down at the large bulge below her generous cleavage and smile widely, he was going to make such a great father, feeling a kick she squealed.</i><br>\r\n--------------------------<br>\r\nWaking up in a cold sweet Astrid looked down at her smooth stomach in haste, what she\u2019d just dreamt about horrified her deeply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking outside the sun was on the horizon meaning that the castle\u2019s gates would be lifted any moment now. There was no time to waste, she had to get ready and get out of this place. </span></div></div>",

His dark hair thick and matted though yet to show any signs of aging. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes came down and inspected his body, tanned muscles that his ragged clothes clung to ripple from his neck to his legs.

Peter spoke softer than before but his thick working class accent allured every word \u201cshe even grabbed your wedding dress from the tavern for you this morning, I\u2019ll see you soon\u201d, before she had a chance to respond their lips locked once again, now she felt herself getting lost in exploring the new and improved muscled arms of Peter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlocking lips Peter smiled whispered \u201csee you soon\u201d and headed into the main entrance of the chapel leaving Astrid in the entrance, horny and conflicted. Looking towards the castle in the near distance she could get to the walls before any were the wiser but at the same time something deep down was making her want to stay and see this through, perhaps it would be safer to escape after the wedding when there would be less people who may look for her she rationalised.</span></div></div>",

She takes the dangling rein, and leads Athras to the end of the stable and secures her there. She runs her hands over the horse settling down the twitching nerves of the unsettled king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the mare is breathing more easily, and enjoying the attention of the stable girl. She brings out some brushes and soon the mare coat looks a lot more lustrous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There now, isn't that better?\" The king nods her head in agreement, but the girl isn't looking for signs of intelligence and ignores the gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I know what you need.\" she leaves the mare tethered and wanders away, when she returns she is accompanied by a massive coal black stallion. The clopping of the approaching hooves draws the kings attention. When he turns his head he sees the shockingly massive erection that the stallion, \"That'll never fit!!!\" runs through her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stallion rears up on his hind legs, and his cock waves hypnotically from side to side leaving the king entranced by its magnificence. He lands with a thump, on the mare's back. The king's breath huffs loudly from her body. Straight away the stallion starts thrusting away, not managing to enter his mare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil the girl reaches his side, gently she directs the massive cock until it is near the eager, sopping twat. \"You'll love this.\" she says gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king suddenly feels the full length of the stallion sink into her body, \"Wow the friction is incredible.\" she thinks. The stallion thrusts away silently for a minute driving the king to greater and greater ecstasy. Until finally he comes massively filling the mare to overflowing with his seed. She whinnies in pleasure, and lets the tired stallion slip from her twat and off her sweaty back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There girl, isn't that the best way of relaxing\" she leans in and kisses the horse on the nose.</span></div></div>",

Before deciding it is probably best to obey him just for the moment at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the stallion has the aroma of aroused mare in his nostrils. With his powerful muscles, he mounts the mare again. The rope to his bridle not offering the stable girl the least control. His equine needs over-riding his submission. The poor girl pulls on the rope, but her strength just isn't up to the task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rider dismounts and joins her in trying to dislodge the randy stallion from his perch.

Her legs shrinking, her body narrowing, her neck shortening until she looked more like a foal or a pony than a full-grown horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't used to magic, and from the stiffness of Marlin's posture, this was very important. So she kept her questions to herself, and just watched. A loud crack came from the pony, and she thought the potion had gone wrong. The animals' hind legs and back, started to twist awkwardly. Far beyond what a horse could bear, the poor animal was trying to rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfraid the creature was in pain she looked away. Marlin's face was smiling broadly, the cruel man enjoying the torture the creature was enduring. In fact, he stepped closer, and held out a hand grabbing a forehoof, he helped the beast stay upright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeering intently, she saw the hoof ripple and shift in Marlin's grasp, like a fist uncurling into a hand. The horse was becoming a human, that much was clear. Perhaps this was some palace game, she thought. The animal's tail twitched, swishing from side to side and drawing her gaze. As she watched it retreated upwards, to disappear at the base of her spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie was eager to know who this person was. One of Princess Fia's unfortunate maids, she had heard the princess was prone to a cruel streak, having Marlin punish the girls. And now, here was Marlin in the stable, it all seemed to fit together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncomfortable, at ogling a wide womanly ass, she raised her look. The face was still unrecognisable, looking more like a collapsed muzzle than a human face. The eyes were still equine, and filled with fear. The wide nostrils at the base of her nose flared as she breathed. Her lips blubbered and flapped, as air heaved in and out in time with her breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie looked more carefully, and also took in Marlin's concerned expression. She shook her head, just a little, as she reassessed her opinion. Other things were clearer too, While the furry coat had retreated over the person's skin, there was still a mat of hair on her chest, a still quite flat chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking downwards, she spotted, a manhood nestled in the thick mass of pubic hair. One that growing and developing. It looked rather unimpressive. But she shrugged, a look over to the stallion, revealing the dimensions she was more used to seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swallowed nervously, as it hit home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mare was a man, and rapidly becoming one again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man was someone that Marlin cared about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mare was a man that she'd had serviced by a massive stallion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe backed away, heading towards the deeper shadows, and a chance to escape.</span></div></div>",

There are ... four of us.\" she managed to get out. \"Me, and three stable boys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then they shall be your harem.\" The girl coloured, imagining servicing the three herself. Cheeks crimson, she could barely face the king. Her emotions yo-yo-ing wildly, she was still too terrified to challenge her ruler. The slightest shake of her head, as she looked to her feet, the only indication she wasn't on board with the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry.\" The king laughed, throwing back his head, \"You'll be no brood mare. Instead, the stallion such as you hold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill reeling, Julie felt herself wrapped in magic, her body warming in the cocoon spinning around her. The warmth intensified, and Julie felt herself grow taller, and stronger. With a degree of sadness, she watched her chest flatten, and her shoulders widen. Running a hand over her face, as it rippled, she discovered stubble, and a squarer chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They'll find you commanding and attractive.\" The king assured the newly minted stable-lad: Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new body was exciting, as Jack ran his hands over unfamiliar arms and legs, discovering hard muscle rather than soft, supple flesh. He felt awkward, as a growing stiffness welled within his trousers. Even the presence of the king couldn't stop the embarrassment from becoming obvious, as he shifted to hide the bulge in his trousers. Holding his hands to hide it, Jack couldn't help but feel a sense of pride. It felt bigger, than the ones she'd spied as Julie. Nothing to compare to her horses, but longer and thicker than she had seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsewhere in the castle, the magic was working on the three sleeping stable boys. As they slumbered, tossing and turning they gained curves, and lost muscle. Soft voices protesting in their sleep, little more than mumbles. The coarse blanket rubbing at the tender flesh, as their hair sprouted, and faces grew prettier. Finally, their memories altered, aligning with their bodies, and their appetites shifting too. Soon no-one remained in the castle remembered the original four stable hands. Instead memories of Jack and his three stable girls formed in the minds of everyone outside the stable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill, Daisy &amp; Rose, woke refreshed in the morning ready for another days work, and a chance to admire Jack's pert bum. The interplay of pecs beneath his shirt, and the gorgeously firm arms, that wielded the bales of hay as if they were nothing. Each of the girls imagining being tossed like those bales, onto a stack, and powerfully taken.</span></div></div>",

A sudden look of annoyance took over King Arthras' face as the meek voice of the chamberlain come from the other side of the door.  \"Prince Kelos of Grovan has arrived to speak with you my liege.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlin looked to Arthras and said, \"My King, there is still time for you to take the disguise potion and leave without having to meet with Kelos, I'm sure he's just here to see the Princess anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that my friend is why I can't leave yet.  I am will to leave the nation to run itself for a time without me, however my duties as a father are something I can not shirk.

We shall discuss his business then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlin gave a humble bow as Arthras and said, \"You are truly a loving father and king and hope you enjoy your well earned rest.\"   Arthras nodded and made his way to the dinning hall where Kelos was waiting for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two greeted each other with false smiles and sat to enjoy the lavish meal laid before them.  After the main entree was finished Arthras finally decided to stop beating around the bush.  \"I believe we both know why you are here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a wisdom befitting your great age King Arthras.\"  Kelos said, \"I am here to bring Fia back to Grovan with me and claim her as my bride.  This will unify our two great kingdoms under the Grovan flag and we shall sire the next generation of great leaders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what if I or my daughter don't approve of the match?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos laughed, \"Well, it would be foolish to deny such a perfect match between us, I had decided upon this years ago.  But if for some foolish reason you didn't approve...have you ever seen the Grovan army march?  It's really a magnificent sight to behold first hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthras couldn't believe the nerve of the headstong prince.  He wanted to teach the spoiled brat a lesson in humility, and a moment later Arthras realized he might have the tool to get Kelos out of his hair maybe for good.  Arthras did have the disguise potion and could slip it to Kelos who would be in for quite a shock.  No matter what form Kelos took under the potion Arthras was sure he could hand it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't the only option Arthras had, after the meal he could take the potion himself and he could put himself in a position to get close to Kelos and find a weakness or find further details of what his plans are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthras sighed to himself, he felt too old and tired to do all of this plotting.  He could just leave the decision up to Fia as for who she wanted to marry.  It was her right after all.  And he could just take the potion now and leave the castle and maybe never come back.

If you don't mind me saying, I think I see what she got her beautiful appearances.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You flatter me Kelos.  But don't use all your compliments on me.  I should get out of your hair and leave ruling over Traeven to you and Fia.  Now if you'll excuse me I must go pack something before I leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  No!  I don't want you to leave now!\"  Kelos said surprised at what Arthras had said, \"Just because you lost doesn't mean you must step down.  You could still stay and rule as Queen, just under Grovan rule.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose I could, but years and years of wearing the crown and making life altering decisions on behalf of the people has beaten me down.  You're too young to understand but being King isn't just a figurehead position, the King must carry the burden of the people with his every day.  And frankly I've been doing it since I was younger than you and to put it bluntly I'm tired.  I think that this body is...how should I put this...a retirement...gift?  I guess gift is the right word, after all it is nice to be 20 years younger even if it is as a woman.  Now, Kelos I really should be leaving before someone sees me like this, I'd rather sneak away.  Never been a fan of goodbyes.  Good luck with the kingdom and please take care of my daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Arthras turned to leave Kelos reached out and put his hand on the new woman's shoulder.  Arthras turned to listen to what Kelos had to say.</span></div></div>",

But because of the beauty of your daughter, and I must say your beauty even surpasses hers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough with the flattery, get to your point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I'm saying is that though I came to marry Fia.  We would be wed, I would take her to Groven and live happily ever after until either my parents or yourself Arthras passed away giving me the possession of King that I so desire.  However if I were to just marry the now beautiful Queen of Traeven then there is no need to wait.  I become my father's equal.  You stay in power without wearing the burden of the crown alone and also gain 20 youth.  Fia can marry whoever she wants for whatever silly reasons she wants.  And both of our kingdoms live in peace for now and ever more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I am a man Kelos!

Besides when we announce our royal wedding the people will rejoice.  The common people love nothing more than a grand celebration to break of the monotony of their otherwise boring and meaningless lives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthras had to admit Kelos's plan wasn't the worst he saw the reasoning behind it.  However there was still the matter of fact the he did not want to marry a man, let alone Kelos who he didn't trust at all.  This was all very overwhelming, 10 minutes ago he had been a man eater a feast with a potencial son in law and now he was a woman being proposed to by the same man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos chuckled to himself, \"Let us waste no time, let's make it official.\"  Kelos bent down on one knee and pulled out a ring that was no doubt originally intended for Fia.  \"Queen Arthras...no that's too crude a name for such beauty.  Queen Ariana, will you marry me?\"</span></div></div>",

The entire purpose of getting the disguise potion from Marlin in the first place was to leave the crown behind him and let Fia take his place on the throne, but now he had transformed into a beautiful woman and had his daughter's fiance proposing to him.  Every instinct told him to say no, but king's don't stay king's for years without considering other options.  If he turned down this offer he'd be lucky to survive the night, but even more important than that, it could be seen by Kelos and Grovan as a declaration of war and their might would crush his people and their lands.  Thousands would die, Arthras knew this and decided he needed to swallow his manhood and his pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I accept.\"  He simply said offering his hand to Kelos who greedily grabbed it and put the diamond ring on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent, we'll make preparations immediately.\"  Kelos went to the door where Arthras's guards were stationed and said, \"You there, by orders of you king gather all of the top officials in the castle.  Make it quick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos made his way to the thrown and on is way grabbed Arthras by the arm and lead his new fiance.  Kelos took a seat in the throne with an enormous grin on his face and motioned to his side.  Obediently Arthras stood beside the thrown and looked down feeling ashamed to himself.  He stood their like this for a minute before he felt Kelos caress his arm, \"Look up and smile my Queen Ariana, our people arrive.\"  Soon enough the room was filled with all of Arthras' top generals and inner circle members including Marlin and Fia.  Everyone looked confused to see Kelos sitting on the thrown along side a mystery woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeneral Dioral was the first to speak, \"What are you doing on the throne Grovan prince, where is King Arthras?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos smiled, \"King Arthras is no more,\"  A cry of shock and anger came from the crowd but before they could get too out of control Kelos shouted above them all, \"Thanks to a bit of magic of his own doing, King Arthras has become Queen Ariana.\"  He said motioning to Queen.  Everyone looked at Ariana waiting from some confirmation or some sign that it couldn't be true.  Ariana looked stoic and said, \"What Prince Kelos says is true.  I was once your King and stand before you Queen Ariana.  I hope you will quickly accept that this...is who I have to be now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's more!\"  Kelos said before questions could be asked, \"She has accepted my proposal of marriage.  We shall be married by the end of the week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence filled the room.  Ariana wished someone would say something, but he knew as his people's leader he knew it was his, no her, responsibility.  \"This is something that I have done by choice.  I have decided it is best for the people of Traeven and I know that you, my closest friends, confidants, and family,\"  Ariana made sure to look at Fia upon saying this whose face did not give much away, \"will accept this decision and will support our...union as it will make our nation stronger at a time it needs it most.\"  Ariana stepped back.  Her words seemed to calm everyone down, but their eyes did not show full support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well said my beauty.\"  Kelos said taking Ariana's hand and kissing it causing many in the crowd to shutter.  Although Ariana stayed strong and stoic.  Kelos continued, \"Well there is much work to be done, I will discuss the matters of the nation with the generals and other such figures while my Queen, you will plan for the wedding.  I expect it to be just as glorious and radiant as you are.  You are all dismissed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos stood from the throne and went to speak with some of the men.  Marlin ran up to Ariana quickly, \"My King, or Queen.  What do you want me to do?  I can return you to normal by sundown and can curse that Kelos so strongly he won't know what hit him.\"  Ariana just raised her hand to silence him, \"Don't do anything rash.  I will try to make time to speak with you later to talk further.  I have pressing matters.\"  Ariana made  a B-line to her daughter Fia.  Puller her off to be speak alone Ariana said almost pleadingly, \"My dear daughter.  I know this is sudden but it had to be done under the unfortunate circumstances.  Just think, now you won't have to marry the brute Kelos and can marry whomever you so desire.  For love like with your mother and I.\"  Fia said nothing, Ariana continued, \"Please Fia.

The former king slapped the rock out of Marlin's hand.  \"Get that away from me.  I am of my own sound mind.\"  Marlin picked up the stone and looked sadly at Fia, \"It seems your father is indeed mentally himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFia's look of confusion turned into anger, \"So you decided to take it upon yourself to just marry Kelos in my place 'for the good of the kingdom'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriana flushed slightly pink, \"And for your own happiness, now you can marry whomever...\"  But Fia cut her off, \"I wanted to marry Kelos.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Marlin and Ariana were stunned by this, Fia had never seemed particularly happy at the idea of an arranged marriage with the Grovan prince.  \"I wanted to marry Kelos not for love but for duty towards my nation and for the honor of my father who I thought was proud and honorable.  I was going to marry him with my head held high and unite our nations to make them strong.  I was going to marry him warts and all, and who knows, maybe love could bloom.  Maybe I could even change the heart of Kelos and help him be a King my father would have been proud of.  Instead I have had the duty and opportunity stolen to me not by some conniving foreign nation playing political games, but my own father.

Very well, if you will not respect me as a woman I will give you that same treatment.\"  Fia turned with disgust and began to walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese words were like knives into Ariana's heart, \"Fia, my daughter, wait!\"  Ariana tried to follow her but the head maid now stood before her.  She curtsied and said, \"My Queen, the future King has instructed me to help out with your new wardrobe.  With the wedding at the end of the week we have much work to do to make you as beautiful as a Queen must be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFia had stopped to look back at this and shook her head in disgust, \"Come Marlin, let's go work on 'saving the kingdom' in our own way.

The changes continued up his arms, slimming and softening Kelos' body. His broad, strong shoulders shrank, becoming dainty and feminine. His well muscled chest began to lose its rugged definition and breasts pushed outwards. His hips widened as his waist contracted, and his butt grew. He felt his boots loosen, indicating that his feet were undergoing the same change as his hands. Finally his penis retreated inside his body, forming a slit making Kelos fully female. The transformation had yet to fully run its course though. Kelos' face softened and her hair exploded from her head, reaching nearly to the floor in a blink of an eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do make a beautiful woman, Prince.

Features scrunched, and lips pursed, with the silence growing deafening, until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, <i>fiiiiine.</i>\u201d Her voice childishly whined: arms crossing with her tongue lolled, as if she wanted to hurl at the very thought of giving in. She almost added the quick caveat that she'd do it on the condition Kelos drank it by joining her in a fun tea party, but she figured, all things considered, she was on thin enough ice as is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this, the sniffling former prince beside her turned towards Arabella with a rising glimmer, though still tightly clutching to Fia's gown, like a deeply needed security blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnatching the potion from Marlin in a quick swipe, the blonde youth sighed. \u201cYes, yes. No need to <i>cry</i> Celina, your good friend Bella is going to fix <i>everything.</i>\u201d The haughty tone she took had a cute immaturity to it, so much so that the previously whimpering 'Celina' let out a soft giggle. A smile. A nice smile, that Bella tilted her nose up at to save face, and not show her blush. \u201cThat <i>is</i> so long as you drink the antidote! If you clinging to Fia like this is any sign of what's to come with your future 'relationship,' I might just change my mind!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raven-haired little girl's face flared up like a cherry at hearing this, and realizing what she was doing, hurriedly let go. \u201cUm, s- sorry...\u201d Kelos stuttered, glancing three ways between Fia, Bella, and the vial she was still holding onto. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFia's consternation thankfully began to deflate upon hearing Arabella's capitulation. \u201cI... <i>appreciate</i> it, Father. You're acting very 'adult' right now.\u201d She couldn't help but add that jab. This was certainly better than the alternative of taking her parent over her knee and disciplining her until she came to her senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike I said!\u201d Marlin swiftly interjected: finger raised. \u201cI can turn you right back, if this is your preferred appearance, my King!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh let's just get this over with!\u201d Arabella huffed: popping the cap off the drink and glugging it down, just like before. Celina actually gasped in response: not quite so prepared, and did her best to fumble open the concoction, and sip it equally as fast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then they played the waiting game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiting game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaiting...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaiting, and waiting, until very <i>clearly</i> there was something not right going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my. How strange.\u201d Marlin pondered, hand going to his chin. \u201cPerhaps there's more here than meets the eye!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean it's not going to work?\u201d Kelos asked in a wavy, right of the edge of tears, tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean it's not going to work!\u201d In contrast Arabella was much more excited. <i>Elated</i> even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat earned the former ruler a scornful glare from her daughter, as she placed a comforting, maternal hand on Kelos' shoulder. \u201cWhat seems to be the problem?\u201d She asked the wizard, trying to keep a level head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour highness, I am truly not sure.\u201d The magician was eyeing the empty antidote containers with intense curiosity. \u201cIt seems my original hypothesis wasn't entirely correct, however. I <i>do</i> apologize!\u201d He then swiftly turned to begin analyzing matters at his table. \u201cThis may take some time to sort out, but my oh my, I <i>do</i> love a challenge!\u201d He seemed almost as giddy as Arabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos, though, was far from pleased, as the reality of the situation settled in. A chill swept up through her, as she hugged herself in growing hear. \u201cI... I can't stay like this... What about my parents?... My big sister?...\u201d The color in her eyes began to fade, as she imagined how ashamed they'd naturally be. How much of an embarrassment she'd make her royal family look. Whether or not this was truthful, or an innately childish fear, it didn't matter. What mattered right now was that Celina was scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShh, shh.\u201d Fia whispered a soothing hush, as the hand on the young girl's should doubled into a full, comforting hug. A hug that was very much needed at the moment. \u201cWe're not going to let <i>anything</i> bad happen to you, okay?\u201d The princess (or potentially queen?) spoke in very precise, very deliberate words. \u201cAs of this moment, you are under the full, <i>uncompromising</i> protection of the sovereign kingdom of Traeven, and anyone who'd <i>dare</i> attempt to harm you would have to face the full might of her armies.\u201d A pause, as she reached up to boop the child's nose. \u201cAnd worse, if they get through them, they'll have to face me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis would've been a tender moment, had Arabella not chimed in. \u201cIt won't be so bad, Celina! We both get to be really pretty princesses together!\u201d She punctuated this by giving a happy, playful twirl of her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinishing School. I'm serious.\u201d Fia countered in a deadpan growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella just offered an animated gasp. \u201cWe both get to be really pretty princesses together <i>in Finishing School!</i>\u201d </span></div></div>",

Then some welling at the edge of her face. The part of her that was Kelos urged her to keep strong. That blithering emotions like these were useless, and what her father was condemning. But the very thought of her <i>father</i> brought the Celina part of herself out in full fold, and Celina was very, very sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bawled. She bawled her eyes out. Sitting in front of the plate of big floofy pancakes, it painted an almost macabre picture, but she couldn't help it. \u201cM- M- MY DADDY HAAAAATES MEEEEE!\u201d The way she said 'Daddy.' The pure emotional cry. Doing any of this would've absolutely <i>humiliated</i> Kelos, but Celina was past humiliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all Fia needed to swoop in. She lifted Celina into her arms, and clutched at her like a wounded animal. Whatever relationship they might've had when Kelos was a grown man was washed away clean at that moment, and became replaced with a maternal care and need to support this child. \u201cShh, shh,\u201d and other comforts cooed from the queen's lips, telling Celina that someone was there for her, and that she was loved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArabella, meanwhile, seeing the closest thing she currently had to a sister so broken, felt her bluster deflate. \u201cI- it'll be alright, Celina.\u201d She stuttered in assurance. \u201cI- it's like Fia said at the start! You're under the protection of Traeven! And unlike stinky Grovan, we know princesses are the best! And since you're a princess now, you're the best!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, there wasn't much anyone could say at this time which would improve the situation. In reality, Celina simply needed a good cry. Her only hope at this time would be if Orianna could somehow come through as the best big sister in the world, and fix things.</span></div></div>",

Before long she was ready for breakfast, wearing a violet dress, with her hair up in pig tails. Arabella practically dragged her through the halls of the castle, until they reached the royal dining chamber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I brought her!\" Arabella called out as the two young girls entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, Cally! You're soooo cuute!\" Orianna exclaimed as she saw her former brother's new appearance.  She leapt up from her seat. \"You look just like you did back when we were little!

That dress is so cute, and your hair, it's just incredible!\" She knelt down and hugged Celina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cally?\" Arabella asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Kelos' name when he would wear dresses,\" Orianna said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You dressed me up like that!\" Celina exclaimed. \"Mother and father stopped it when I was eight!\" She tried to pull away from her older sister, but was unable to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now you're eight again and a real girl,\" Orianna said. \"Mother and father won't stop you from wearing all the cute dresses you want this time, Cally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celina,\" she corrected. \"As long as I'm a girl I'm going to be Celina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not as cute as Cally, but still a cute name,\" Orianna replied. \"My sweet little sister Celina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess Orianna,\" Fia interrupted. \"Perhaps now would be the time to reveal the official response from Grovan to this development?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Queen Fia,\" Orianna said.

At first, I had wholeheartedly decided to banish you! No ifs, ands, or buts. <b>But</b> thanks to the efforts of your older sister and mother, I have cooled on the notion. For now.</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelina gulped as she heard this, though it wasn't anything new. Ori's original letter said as much, but it looked like her sibling was continuing on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Instead, I present three choices to you. Nothing more, nothing less. The first is simple: You are banished. Maybe you'll end up on the streets. Maybe Traeven will take you in. Either way, you will be stripped of any title to this family, but at the same time, will not have to face the humiliation of returning to Grovan in your current... 'state.</i>'\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young royal clenched her fists. She had been bracing herself for this. Bracing herself as much as possible. But it still hurt. Hurt enough to cause a small sniffle of a cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>I present you though a second option. If you can stand the embarrassment of your actions, you may take your place back in this family. But in the only place left suitable: our young daughter. You will be raised as such. You will be treated as such. Anything and everything that was 'Prince' Kelos will be wiped forever from our historical records.</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoodness...\u201d Fia couldn't help but let out a small exhale of shock at just how <i>brutal</i> Celina's father was being. Her thoughts easily began to wander in contemplative ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>But at last, I give you the ultimate means of salvation: a way to return back.</i>\u201d This caused the entire room's attention to be fully drawn in. \u201c<i>Our wizard Xarlat has been making good progress on a reversal spell. Apparently, anyway. And I would be willing to offer it to you, only if you face the challenge I am presenting: <b>prove</b> to me you aren't the weak little girl I envision you to be. When you return to Grovan, for 30 days, I expect you to undergo every challenge, every predicament, every <b>hurdle</b> Prince Kelos would face as a grown man. From diplomatic meetings, to daily warrior training. There won't be a single stone left unturned.</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT?!\u201d Arabella bellowed in absolute shock. \u201cTHAT'S RIDICULOUS! RIDICULOUS! HE CAN'T MAKE CELINA DO THAT!\u201d Already the blonde was stomping around, back and forth. \u201cI SHOULD'VE WENT TO WAR WITH HIM YEARS AGO! THAT IS <i>NOT</i> HOW YOU TREAT CUTE LITTLE GIRLS LIKE US!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>If you choose this option however, be warned; it comes at a risk. Being unable to uphold your identity as a prince will be your second failing, and a failing of this caliber will not stand. You will be banished. Totally, and utterly. That is my ultimatum.</i>\u201d Ori promptly broke her 'Father' tone and wrapped things up. \u201cAfter that, it just says 'Signed King Reginald.'\u201d Her hands were already beginning to roll up the scroll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor once I think I might agree with my Father...\u201d Queen Fia's eyes were far away as she mumbled this. \u201cThis must be a lot to take in.\u201d She noted, turning to Celina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm sure, but I think the proper direction is obvious.\u201d Orianna curtly said: standing up. \u201cFather's last proposal is an utter farce. I don't believe it's within a fragment of reason to even consider it. We shouldn't encourage him. I'm sure he'll cool, and not be such a grouch once he sees how tremendously <i>cute</i> Celina is!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCELINA SHOULDN'T EVEN BE AROUND THAT OLD WINDBAG! FIA! <i>FIA!</i> TELL THAT GROVAN GIRL THAT CELINA IS STAYING WITH US! SHE'S A <i>TRAEVEN</i> PRINCESS NOW!\u201d Arabella face was as red as a tomato: her old rival Reginald's words dancing around her head. This was unacceptable!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe funny thing was, Fia was quickly beginning to believe that might not be the worst option. \u201cIf Celina wants to stay here, she very much can. We put her into this mess, and it's the least we can do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll eyes pointed to the little girl, as she made her decision.</span></div></div>",

Now that I've proven I was right and Father wrong, it can be disposed of.\" She turned to Fia. \"I trust your wizard is capable in that task.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, he should be,\" Fia said. She stepped forward to talk the potion from Orianna, who gave it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This potion erases all of a person's memory?\" Arabella asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not all of it,\" the Grovan princess replied. \"Merely memory of who they are. The person will retain other memories, so they won't forget how to speak or walk or anything like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So let's say Celina did drink it, she'd forget about being Kelos completely?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, she'd just know she's a well educated girl with no memory of who she was,\" Orianna explained. \"Though in a situation like this, it almost seems like it would be killing Kelos.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelina looked at her sister, completely shocked at the revelation.\"F-Father was going to do that to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He didn't want to, but as twisted as it seems, he thought it was doing you a favor.\" Orianna said. \"It would give you a completely new start and you'd be happier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see some logic to that,\" Arabella said. \"I mean you've been pretty sad because of this.\" She looked at the bottle in Fia's hand. \"A fresh start does have a certain appeal to it...\" </span></div></div>",

And stuff.\u201d She said this, while crossing her arms, and turning her head away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a <i>lot</i>Celina could say here. This girl stripped her of her manhood. Her title as a prince. And turned anything and everything upside down! But only one thought coursing through her managed to escape her lips. \u201cYou <i>really</i> like being a princess, don't you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat perked Bella's face right up. \u201cAnd I'm sure you will too, if you just embrace it! If that meanie king  of yours tries to ruin all the fun you could be having, then just come live here with us! You can be a princess of Traeven! We'll be sisters!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, Celina couldn't help but blush at that. There was something just real earnest and friendly about the offer, despite all that had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could respond, Ori was right behind her, with a hand on her shoulder. \u201cWe should probably get going now, Little Celina! Father grumbled about sending troops if there's trouble, and if we 'took too long.'\u201d She finished that statement with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSEND THOSE TROOPS! THAT OLD WIND BAG SHOULD KNOW TRAEVEN'S THE TOUGHEST KINGDOM IN THE LAND!\u201d It was rather impressive how on a dime Arabella could switch from snooty, to utterly ready for a brawl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFia though had already plucked her up by the nape of her dress, as the youth's arms and legs went flailing. \u201cPrincess Orianna, you and Celina are free to visit here whenever you like. I'm sure my father would appreciate the extra company.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA twinkle couldn't help but appear in Orianna's eye. \u201cOh, you and I should definitely stay in touch, <i>Queen</i> Fia! We have two rambunctious girls we'll be taking care of, and I'm sure we can exchange notes and tips. Plus, maybe have tea together!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the specifics of what next was being said began to filter out of Celina's mind. Configured into 'grownup stuff.'

Near instantly the jovial mood began to dissipate, as his highness seemed none too pleased. \u201cI take it you've accepted your failure, and are staying like this?\u201d He asked, while crossing his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDear...\u201d Latissa had a disappointed tone, as the child in her arms began to take on a much more worried face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I had just <i>hoped</i> that perhaps you'd try and hold up your title as a prince, but I suppose taking the easy way out makes the most sense.\u201d The sting in the king's voice was absolutely <i>palpable.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFather, the stipulations you set were absurd! No girl her age could possibly carry out living those conditions!\u201d Orianna hissed: genuine anger starting to boil up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, no no! I get it. <i>Quite.</i> No girl her age could... But a <i>prince?</i> Challenges like the ones I proposed are what build strong leaders! And evidently... Celina is <i>not.</i>\u201d His eyes zeroed in on the raven-haired youth with a sneer. \u201cI'll be sure to have the servants arrange a quarters appropriate for <i>Celina.</i> Kelos is no longer with us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt those words, the king stormed off, almost certainly to fulfill his latest statement, and leaving the women there utterly speechless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelina herself tried to be brave, but she was only a little girl, and the sniffles couldn't help but escape after the heated talking down to she received. This was practically her worst fears come to light, and she didn't know what to do!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLatissa however made sure to wrap her arms around the child tight, and hug her even more than she previously was. \u201cDon't worry, Sweetheart. We'll deal with your father... One way or another.\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was apparent that Fia was not inclined to believe that she was actually Kelos. She sighed and took Fia's right hand. Surely Arthras didn't intend to remain like this, so there must be a potion to reverse the effects. She just needed to get Arthras to reveal it. To that end, she might as well just play along in front of Fia.

I'm being incredibly mislead by my own thoughts.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fia...?\" Arthras cautiously said, slightly narrowing her eyes. Did... did Princess Fia figure her out?

They are a bit... plain, should I say. Princesses in Traevan must be more fashionably dressed if they must maintain their prestige. Follow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two follow to Princess Fia to her room, holding her hands once more. Kelos was red in her cheeks. She expected to be holding hands quite a lot with Princess Fia when she came here, but this was just humiliation upon humiliation. To be treated like a child was just... embarrassing! She could even see Arthras glancing at her, smirking briefly before beaming at being close to her lovely daughter once more. As king, Arthras did not have much of an opportunity to see Fia because of his duties, so the relationship between them had become strenuous.

Although now 'Princess Ariella' has shown up not alone but with her sister 'Princess Kellia' I'm sure Marlin will connect the dots and arrange for a second murderer's transformed body to be found.  Both of our nations will unite in mourning against the bandits and barbarians of the region.  Traeven and Grovan will be united against the evils of the land and my daughter won't have to marry you for that to happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos was stunned, Arthras actually had this planned out, but it was still madness.  \"This is insane!

You have to have some sort of way to go back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthras chuckled, \"True, but things have gone smoothly so far, so I don't think I will use this.\"  Arthras pulled out a small green vial from his dress, \"I have accepted my new fate and life.

I doubt it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos took a few steps back and raised his tiny arms into the air to show he was willing to negotiate, after all if he tried to steal the recovery vial now he might accidentally break it sealing his fate.  \"Great King, please, I will prove to you I am not only worthy of being a man again, but a man worthy of your glorious, beautiful, capable daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop sucking up Kelos, I know you just want the potion.\"  Arthras looks between the potion and Kelos.  Arthras wanted nothing more than to smash the potion now and crush Kelos' last hopes of returning to normal, but there was a part of Arthras that wanted to believe the best in people.  Arthras wants to believe that Kelos could change and become a worthy husband for his daughter, even if he has to be a young princess to do so.</span></div></div>",

Inside the room were piles of elegantly folded and hanging dresses all seemingly made for a child.  \"I had the servants find all of my old clothes from when I was your age.  I am ashamed to admit that I was a bit of a stubborn child and insisted on a new dress every day.  Father didn't really know what to do with a screaming child so he just relented and had Marlin the wizard the court semesters work together so they were able to make a new dress in just a few minutes.  And since I've outgrown that bad habit and all these clothes, I want to give them to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos was momentarily stunned but quickly recovered and spoke to the woman who held his manhood in her hands, \"Oh my, they are all so beautiful.  I bet they'd still look great on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthras gave Kelos a dirty look while Fia giggled, \"Oh Kellia, that's a cute thought but I assure you I wouldn't fit in any of these anymore, but I know that they would look fantastic on you.\"  Arthras grabbed Fia and started to drag her away from Kelos, \"Princess!  How do you think I'd look in this one!\"  \"You will look great Ariella,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos let Arthras have Fia to himself for a moment as he gathered his thoughts and walked up to a group of dresses and that drew him over there.  For some reason a green dress actually spoke to him, \"This one is my favorite,\"  he said quietly gently rubbing a tiny arm against it.  Fia heard this and walked to the little girl.  \"I actually remember this one.  I wore this one on a diplomatic trip to Grovan.  I actually danced with Prince Kellos while wearing it, although he was so shy at the time he about had a heart attack when he asked me to dance.  Although if our spies reports about him are true, he is no longer shy about 'dancing' with women anymore.\"  Kelos noted a disapproving tone in Fia's voice before Fia smiled down to him again and said, \"Would you like to try it on?  It would go great with your eyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes please.\"  Kelos said.  \"Raise your arms then.\"  Fia said and helped Kelos get dressed right there.  Kelos felt embarrassed at this whole situation, but knew that if he didn't get over it and socialize with Fia now, he'd be wearing dresses like this the rest of his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, you look like the princess you are.\"  Fia smiled, and before she could turn her attention back to Arthras, Kelos softly coughed and extended her hand.  \"May I have this dance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFia actually seemed a bit taken aback but quickly smiled and curtsied, \"I'd be honored.\"  And the two had a bit of a slow dance with no music, just the two of them alone with Arthras looked on as he wore a puffy purple dress.  Arthras actually got a strong sense of nostalgia as he watched Kelos dancing with his daughter, it reminded him of that day in Grovan all those years ago.  \"Happier times\"  Arthras muttered as he watched on from afar choosing not to interrupt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthras wasn't the only one experiencing deja vu.  Fia actually felt like she was dancing with Kelos like she had years ago.  She even got the entertaining picture in her head of Kelos wearing the same dress the princess Kellia was wearing with her now.  After the imaginary song they were dancing to was over Fia and Kelos curtsied to each other.  \"That's was a wonderful dance.  I'd love to do it again sometime.\"  Kelos said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How charming, I look forward to our next dance, but for now I must be off, I've got...things to do.\"  And so Fia left the two 'girls' with thoughts of her father and Kelos running through her head for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthras approached Kelos and said, \"Okay, you've proven you have a romantic bone in your body.  That's more than I can say I thought of you earlier, but to prove yourself worthy of my daughters love you'll have to do a lot more than have a nice dance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry former King, the more time I spend with Fia the more she will love me...and dare I say the more I will love her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthras smiled, he couldn't believe it, but he was actually kind of hoping Kelos would continue to prove him wrong, but Kelos still had a long way to go before proving he was a changed man whom Fia could love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later the servants took Kelos and Arthras to a room that had been prepared for them.  Before they went to bed Fia came to visit them, \"Well little sisters, I still haven't found our father, but don't worry about that.  I've got a special day planned for you two tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you have in mind?\"  Kelos asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Kellia, Ariella, tomorrow...\"</span></div></div>",

Just remember, the important thing is that you all have a good time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will!\" Kelos replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For now though, you two little ones need a good night's sleep,\" Fia said. \"I'll tuck you in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" the two replied in unison. They hopped into bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFia came up to Arthras' bed, and tucked her in. \"There we go, are you all comfy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup,\" Arthras replied. \"The bed's nice and soft.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, a princess needs the finest bed in the kingdom,\" Fia replied. She then bent over and kissed Arthras on the forehead. \"Goodnight, Ariella.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight,\" Arthras replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFia got up and headed over to Kelos' bed, and tucked her in as well. \"Are you all comfy too?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, thank you, Fia.\" Kelos replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFia bent over and kissed Kelos on the forehead as well, \"Goodnight, Kellia,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight,\" Kelos replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFia got up and walked towards the door, then turned. \"Oh and my room is just down the hall to the left. If you need anything let me know. Or if you ring that bell on your night stand a maid will come. Don't stay up all night, remember your big day tomorrow.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We won't\" Arthras said. With that Fia blew out the lantern, and left, closing the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, this is the life,\" Arthras said. \"We just need to relax and play. No long meetings with pompous windbags that end no closer to a deal than when you began. Just embrace it, sis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Until you get married off to some fat, bald man to secure an alliance,\" Kelos replied. \"But hey, if you want to spend your life like that, it's your call. I certainly do not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Fia wouldn't do that to her cute little sisters,\" Arthras said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, I'm going to sleep,\" Kelos replied. She turned over away from Arthras and shut her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthras also closed her eyes and attempted to sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kelos lay in bed with thoughts of himself and Fia being wed and having some children, two girls.  The two little girls looked oddly familiar to Kelos but before he could place them he felt a weight fall across his chest a loud voice.  \"Time to wake up sister Kellia.\"  Kelos opened his eyes and saw that Arthras had actually belly flopped on top of him to wake him up.  \"Get off of me you little...\"  Kelos said as he used his little girl muscles to push Arthras off of him.  Kelos was disappointed to see that it took every ounce of strength to push a 10 year old girl off of him, before he remembered all of the events that happened yesterday leading to him too being a 10 year old girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthras rolled off of Kelos' bed and sprung back up to his feet, \"Sorry about that, it's just been about 40 years since I've woken up with this much energy and thought I'd share the joy.  Now stop moping around and pick out a dress, we've got a long day ahead of us as Princess' of Traeven.\"  Arthras sprinted over to a wall of clothing that must have been moved in during the night.  \"Let's see, we have to entertain children about our new age, a mix of boys and girls.  It'll probably be easier to keep them entertained outside so I'll go with this.\"  Arthras picked out a tan dress that while not as extravagant as the dress he'd worn yesterday was still quite pretty.  It also seemed to be made of a tougher material that looked like it could stand up to the elements.  Arthras spoke, \"I remember that Fia wore this dress the one and only time I tried to take her hunting.  She absolutely hated it, wouldn't stop crying.  She scared off all of the wildlife for miles around.  It was a good day with her.\"  Arthras said nostalgically as he began to put it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos didn't put in any thought in his choice of outfit, he too took dress since that seemed to be all there was.  He just went with a simple blue dress because it was probably one of the least feminine dresses Kelos could find.  After they got dressed the pair of princesses were taken to breakfast where they had a miniature feast of all the pancakes they could eat.  Although Kelos only got through about half of his second plate because Arthras began to chastise 'her' for ruining her figure.  After breakfast Princess Fia entered the room and greeted her little 'sisters'.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad to see you two up and about already Ariella and Kellia.  Because our guests have arrived early.  So let's put on our best faces.  Kellia, it looks like you've got a pit of syrup on your chin.\"  Kelos blushed and Fia bent down, licked her thumb, and rubbed the mess off of Kelos' face.  \"Thank you.\"  Kelos said meekly.  \"Anything for you.\"  Fia said radiating charm.  If she was worried about the whereabouts of her father, she was not letting it show.  Although Arthras did notice Fia's eyes were a bit red, perhaps from crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Fia stood up the doors to great hall opened and the guests entered.  There were 7 guests.  Two adults who were here for the negotiation and 5 children.  They were all obviously forign because of their clothing.  They must come from one of the desert nations to the south Kelos figured because even though it was only mildly chilly outside, they were all dressed as though it were a blizzard.  The man who was dressed the finest stepped forward, \"I am Walch, diplomat of Nubario, these are my children,\"  Walch clapped his hands and the three most well dressed children stepped forward.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe youngest boy who seemed about 7 bowed, \"Sebastian.\"  Next was the middle child of about 11, the girl who curtsied and said in a voice that said she didn't want to be there, \"Tae.\"  And the oldest boy who was maybe 12 stepped right up to Arthras and Kelos and extended his hand palm up as though waiting for something, \"And I am Richard.  Charmed I'm sure.\"  Kelos looked at the boy unsure of what he was doing but Arthras didn't miss a beat, \"And I am Princess Ariella.\"  And much to Kelos' surprise Arthras put his hand in Richard's and let Richard kiss it.\"  Kelos still could not believe how fully Arthras seemed to have embraced this role he had chosen for himself.  Kelos looked back to Richard to see that once again he had extended his hand before him now.  If Fia was not watching Kelos would slug the brat right there on the spot, but he still had to win Fia's love and affection and punching a diplomat's child would certainly hinder that, so he reluctantly gave the boy his hand and let it be kissed.  \"Kellia.\"  Kelos said bluntly.  Kelos looked back to Fia who smiled and nodded subtly towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext the other adult stepped forward, she was dressed nice, but not as nicely as the diplomat, \"And I am Sir Walch's associate, Shanoa and these are my girls.  Lora and Korra.\"  Two twin girls about age 9 stepped forward and curtsied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the introductions ended Walch looked at Arthras and Kelos, \"I was under the impression that you were the only child of King Arthras, where is he by the way, I was told he was not here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthras and Kelos looked at Fia, both curious as to what Fia would say, \"My father is negotiating a very important treaty with Grovan at the moment and it's unfortunately taken much longer than initially estimated.  He sends his apologies for missing this meeting but I assure you that I am more than capable to negotiating with you as I have studied under my father my whole life.  As for my little sisters,\"  Fia gave them a loving smile, \"My father did not wish to make their existence known.  You know how some nations are, the oldest child is the heir and the younger children are pawns.  My father did not want that life for them and kept their existence unknown until they were ready to face society.  He wanted them to just be little girls for as long as he could.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthras was stunned at these words, he had expected and wouldn't have blamed Fia if she had thrown him under the bus, but even if she was furious with him, she still stood up for him.  Arthras was beaming with pride in his daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatch seemed satisfied with this answer so he and Shanoa left with Fia leaving Arthras and Kelos with the children.  Kelos felt the eyes of all the children shifting over to him and looking him up and down, specifically the slightly sleazy Richard.  An awkward silence hung in the air for a minute before Arthras took charge.  \"Well you must be tired from your long journey, how about I escort you all to the castle grounds and relax under the trees.  One of the twins, Korra Kelos thought, yawned and without speaking walked up to Arthras.  \"And while we sit we can watch the Royal heard of horses graze on the planes.  The other twin Lora squeezed and joined her sister beside Arthras.  Tae seemed to think she was too old and cool to simply be bought off at the idea of watching horses so Arthras added, \"Tae, since you're older I'm sure we can talk to a stable hand to see if you can ride one.\"  Tae tried to hide her smile but failed as she joined Arthras.  Arthras looked at the little boy Sebastian and smiled, \"And it's not just horses, you can see the soldiers practicing their fighting moves, does't that sound neat.\"  Sebastian obviously thought it did as he too joined the Arthras' little gang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthras looked at Kelos and smiled, \"I think I can handle this lot, think you can handle Richard on your own?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I can, after all I am Princ...ess...Kelia.  Of Traeven.\"  Kelos said a bit sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right you are, okay guys, lets go have fun.\"  With that Arthras and his group left for the grounds leaving Kelos with Richard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard got awkwardly close to Kelos and said, \"The outdoors is nice and all but there are much more interesting things in here aren't their.  We both seem to be the most mature of our group, I say we should join our elders at the meeting.  After all we deserve to be there.  Kelos thought to himself, 'Well I most certainly do, but you are still a child, I should try to keep him away from the meeting if I want to stay on Fia's good side.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't think we should, but there are other places in the castle worth exploring like...\"  Kelos couldn't think of anything, after all he wasn't entirely familiar with the interior of Castle Traeven yet.  Richard got a glint in his eye, \"Doesn't your castle have a magician?  You should take me to him, I'd love to see real magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat actually wasn't a terrible idea, if Kelos could find Marlin he could probably order him to show the boy some simple tricks to satisfy his curiosity...then again with magic things do not always go as intended.</span></div></div>",

Please, lead the way, m'lady.\" He motioned for Kelos to walk ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos began to walk when it dawned on her, she had never actually been to Marlin's lab, and had no idea where it was. Xarlot's lab was deep within the bowels of Castle Grovan, beneath even the dungeon, where he would often get subjects for his experiments. But Marlin? His lab could be anywhere. She stopped. \"I just realized, I've never actually been to Marlin's lab.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not even once?\" Richard asked skeptically. \"Weren't you curious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My sister and I weren't raised in the castle, and I didn't visit as often as she did,\" Kelos said. \"I'll ask someone.\" She led Richard through the halls, until she found a maid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, good morning Princess Arialla,\" the maid said, seeing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kellia,\" Kelos corrected. \"And good morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm terribly sorry Princess Kellia!\" the maid exclaimed. \"Kellia has the dark hair, Arialla the blonde, Kellia has dark hair, Arialla the blonde,\" she repeated a few times to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need some directions,\" Kelos said, interrupting the maid. \"Richard here is the son of the diplomat from Nubario. He'd like to meet Marlin, but I don't know where his lab is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Princess\" the maid replied. \"It's right this way.\" She led Kelos and Richard through the maze like halls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't we pass that bust before?\" Richard asked as they continued on for what seemed to be a rather long time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-king Arthras likes art so the castle has more than one like that,\" the maid said unconvincingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do know where Marlin's lab is, right?\" Kelos asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do!\" the maid insisted. \"It's just that I'm not sure where we are now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Women,\" Richard said with a sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last time we went left after that bust, so this time, let's go right,\" Kelos said. She led the group down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This looks familiar,\" the maid said. \"Marlin's lab should be this way.\" Before long the group arrived in front of an indistinct wooden door. \"This is it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Kelos said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a pleasure Princess,\" the maid said with a curtsy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the door opened and an old man with a long white beard stepped out. \"Oh, it seems I have some visitors. And what good timing\"</span></div></div>",

I was hoping some willing subjects would come to volunteer for an experiment I'm about to perform.\"  The old man said with a friendly smile looking down at the two children in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe son of the Nubarian diplomat went from cocky to squeamish in a matter of seconds, \"Experiment?  But but what are you going to do to us?\" Richard said as he inched behind Kelos.  Kelos scoffed at the boy, this was no way for a dignitary from a foreign land should act before his hosts.  Kelos had that lesson drilled into him harshly as a young man by his instructors.  Marlin saw the boy's fear and chuckled, \"Well, normally when a child comes to my door it's because they want to see a little magic, and what a better way to see it than to experience it first hand.  I've got a number of potions that need refining, all safe I assure you, I tested them all on the cleaning staff myself.  Oh hello there Ivory, good to see you again.  You aren't experiencing any side effects after being a goldfish last week are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maid who (kind of) escorted Richard and Kelos to Marlin looked surprised to be addressed, \"Oh yes, I'm Ivory.  Nope, no issues here, now I need go back to...clean...I think.  Goodbye.\"  Ivory turned to leave but a few seconds later accidentally entered the room again before finally successfully leaving.  Marlin squinted with curiosity and said aloud, \"Note to self, give Ivory an elephant potion to try and counter the memory loss from the goldfish potion.\"  Richard gasped as he saw a quill begin to write down Marlin's notes on it's own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos looked at the old wizard with a look of disbelieving, \"Can't you just simply enhance her memory?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I already know that would work, I don't know if my elephant solution will.  You see kids, magic can not advance without testing it's limits.  We can't just settle for the simple solution, we must explore and learn and better ourselves along the way young...I'm so sorry I didn't catch your names.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard nervously stepped forward, \"I am Richard of Nubario, and this is as you well should know is Princess Kellia of Traeven.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Marlin said looking at Kelos confused before his eyes widened, \"Oh,\"  and then Marlin's jaw dropped a little as realization fully hit him, \"Oh! Oh oh my yes.  Of course I know you <i>Princess Kellia</i>.  A fine Princess of this land who will grow to...you will certainly grow into something one day if you...well, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell if there was any doubt Kelos had, that just confirmed it.  It seemed Arthras wasn't lying and Marlin already knew about this situation and was probably working on disguising those criminal corpses into 'Arthras' and 'Kelos' as ordered by the former King.  But that meant that somewhere in this lab was some sort of magic that could turn Kelos back into himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Marlin, I believe you know what I want.  I want to experience some magic first hand, and you know what I'm talking about.  If you give it to me now I won't be mad, in fact you will be rewarded beyond your dreams and my...sister will be the only one who will face my wrath.  However if you do not...well I may be small now but I still know how to hurt a man even if he is a wizard.\"  Kelos didn't even realize what he was doing.  Even though he was a cute 10 year old girl in a dress he had backed Marlin up against a wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlin nervously twist his beard, \"I can't give you...that.  It's not ready at the moment, and if I give it to you,\"  Kelos shot daggers at Marlin with his eyes, \"When, I mean when I give it to you, it will be after you have...as my King, I mean your sister Ariella has given his approval which I'm certain he he, no SHE will.  Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos didn't move and his face did not fully approve of this news, \"But I do have a potion ready that you can take and it will make things much easier for you I'm sure and you'll be out and...having fun in no time.\"  Marlin said frantically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to have fun.\"  A voice called out, Marlin and Kelos looked at Richard who they had both forgotten was there.  \"Whatever potion you're going to give her, I want it to.  I'm not afraid.\"  The clearly afraid boy said his voice trying not to shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos sighed, \"Very well, if this indeed does help me, your kindness will not be forgotten wizard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlin quickly went to a cauldron and quickly mixed something together and gave a small purple vial to both of the children.  \"Drink up and enjoy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard downed it quickly and Kelos soon followed wondering how Marlin thought a potion would help him out in his effort to make Princess Fia love him.</span></div></div>",

But for now it is laying dormant inside of you.  It will release into another through your lips when you make contact with them.  A kiss is probably the most logical way for this to happen.  So the first person that you kiss will instantly love you, and having someone love you is not only a nice feeling, it will also help you get what you want if you know how to do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos nodded appreciatively, he would have preferred a potion that would just turn him from 'Princess Kellia' to his Prince Kelos true form, but this love potion could still help him.  Arthras had said he's help Kelos turn back if Kelos could get the princess to truly love him even in this little girl form.  And while Kelos had no doubt he could charm Princess Fia even with this body, he only had a limited amount of time before his fake dead body was to be found making it nearly impossible for him to return.  Kelos smiled to himself thinking the when Fia tucked in her precious 'little sister' tonight he would give her a good night kiss and seal his fate to guarantee his return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos was a bit lost in his thoughts when he was returned to reality upon hearing a voice beside him say, \"But what if I don't know who I want to kiss?  I mean I have so many options.\"  Kelos had almost forgotten the annoying boy Richard was still with him, and what's more had taken the love potion too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlin laughed, \"Well you should have thought about before you drank it shouldn't you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I didn't know what I was drinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again, not my fault, now while this has been a fun distraction, I really must get back to work.  Now you two go back to your parents or guardians or whatever.\"  With that Marlin pushed the two youths from his lab.  As the two made their way back to the other group of children Richard would not shut up about who he should make fall in love with him.  He kept listing off every young female of status in his homeland of Nubario.  Kelos could care less about the love life of a 12 year old annoying child when a delightfully wicked thought occurred to him.  \"What if you didn't wait to use your love potion kiss for when you go back home?  I didn't want to embarrass her, but I think my sister Ariella has a crush on you and if you kissed her that would make her go crazy for you.  And don't you like the idea of having a foreign princess pining over you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess that is a good idea.\"  Richard said now lost in thought.  Kelos laughed diabolically internally.  This felt like the perfect payback for that Arthras for getting him stuck in this situation.  If he wanted to be a little girl so back he could live like one, including being in love with and courting foreign dignitaries.  As Kelos and Richard made entered the great hall they saw that Arthras and the others were already finished with their outdoor adventure.  The youngest boy Sebastion was jumping up and down as he bounded to his older brother.  \"Richard, you should have been there!  I saw the soldiers practicing their moves, and Ariella even made one of them let me touch their bow and arrow!  It was so cool, and then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes that's nice.\"  Richard said brushing off his little brother.  \"Before you go on, there's something I want to do and I want everyone here to see me do it.\"  Richard looked at the two young 'princesses' of Traeven.  \"Thank you both for opening up your palace to me and my family and friends.  And I'd love to come back again and hopefully see you again to spend more time with you.\"  With this the girls from Nubario gasped as Richard stepped forward and surprised one of the princesses with a love potion influenced kiss.</span></div></div>",

Kelos thought that, but he was wrong.  And they were the last things Kelos thought of because the second Richard's lips touched his, Kelos' mind went blank and nothing else mattered except the cute 12 year old boy in front of him.  Kelos felt ashamed that such a cute boy could care so much about him, but Kelos knew that it must be meant to be, because he was no longer Prince Kelos of Ostia.  She was now Princess Kellia of Traeven and she was a little girl in love.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll her anger at Arthras turned into gratitude, because if Arthras hadn't tricked her into taking this form she would never have met the love of her life.  Kellia was also so very grateful to Marlin who's love potion now assured that Richard felt just as head of heels in love as she did.  The two cutely kissed in the middle of the room, their childish lips barely touching each other, after all Richard didn't really have much experience in the kissing department and Kellia wanted to be lady like and let Richard take the lead.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthras on the other hand was very amused by what was happening.  As soon as Richard kissed his 'sister' Arthras burst out laughing and didn't stop laughing for a while.  But when Arthras finally did stop he was surprised to see that Richard and Kellia were still kissing very happily.  Sensing something was very wrong he asked, \"Kellia, is everything all right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKellia and Richard broke the kiss but didn't break eye contact, \"Everything is more than all right Princess Ariella, I've found the love of my life in your sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've...what?\"  Arthras stuttered while the other children in the room all began to ooh and ah thinking it was just like a fairy tale.  Arthras was not as enchanted with this love story, \"What exactly happened while the rest of us were outside?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard answered, \"We went to see your court wizard and the rest of it doesn't matter, all that matters is that today I promise when we are of age, I will return to marry you Princess Kellia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That day can't come soon enough.\"  Kellia smiled with a slightly vacant expression behind her eyes.  Arthras knew what must have happened next, Richard and Kelos must have gotten put under a spell by Marlin somehow.  He'd have to go see him soon to figure out the details so that he could fix it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr should he?  A mischievous thought crossed Arthras' mind, what if he didn't fix Kelos and the boy.  What if he just let whatever love spell they were under run it's course and leave Kelos as happy little Kellia forever.  Sure it was a bit of an underhanded way for Arthras to keep Kelos from marrying Fia, but nobody was going to be hurt.  In fact who knows, maybe Kellia would be happier this way than Kelos ever could be.  As Arthras looked at Kellia and Richard, he knew what he wanted to do.</span></div></div>",

Just face it, you both love each other more than anything in the world.  It's been that way for 8 years and it will be that way for 800 more I bet.\"  Arthras said smiling at his sister of the last 8 years as she was going through last minute doubts of her dress choice mere hours before the wedding ceremony.  As Arthras looked at the nervous teenage girl before him, it was hard to believe that 8 years ago this love sick girl was once the fierce and aggressive Prince Kelos, but thanks to the love potion from Marlin, Kellia left that life behind without a second thought and dedicated herself to making herself the perfect bride for her beloved Richard.  Arthras occasionally felt a little guilty about what became of Kelos, but then he saw how happy Kellia was and what's more how happy his daughter Fia was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a mere week after Kellia and Richard fell in love, Arthras made the final arrangements with Marlin for 'King Arthras' and 'Prince Kelos' to be found, killed by bandits on the way to negations at his country estate.  Fia had been heartbroken at the news of the death of her 'father' and the young man who she did have some feelings towards.  But having two new little sisters and a nation to take care of helped Fia to quickly cope.  She was a very capable ruler as Arthras knew she would, but she had become colder.  But slowly that coldness thawed the more time she spent with her little sisters.  Especially the younger more love sick one.  Seeing how much Kellia was head over heels in love with Richard of Nubario seemed to bring a joy to her life that she wouldn't have otherwise had.  Although Fia did find it odd that whenever she asked Kellia about her life before coming to Traeven, she seemed to honestly not remember anything before meeting Richard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they continued to grow into young women, Kellia continued to fall further in love, and 'Ariella' became a capable advisor to the now Queen Fia even at a young age.  They grew along this path until the day arrived when Kellia came of age and Richard gave her the gift of a wedding ring.  It is said Kellia's cries of joy were heard from even Grovan.  </span></div></div>",

However, that was before I was even born. Perhaps it's time I introduce myself. I am Princess Orianna of Grovan, and I have come to end this charade and bring Kelos home.

It wasn't some big evil conspiracy by me or Marlin but your former brother miscalculation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrianna paused for the briefest of moments before letting out a harsh laugh, \"My this is quite an amusing and appropriate fate for my dear precious brother, sorry, sister.  But I still must insist on taking her back to Grovan.  Nobody gets to mess with her but me, not even his own stupidity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can respect that.  I must say I admire your...passion towards your brother.  For the first time in years I actually regret not being Arthras at this moment.

Now you are just a silly young girl in the way of me bringing the former Prince Kelos back home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her name is Kellia.\"  With that Ariella and Orianna made their moves.  Ariella grabbed a dagger she kept on her thigh at all times and charged at Orianna.  Orianna was ready as well, she opened her cloak and two small glass orbs full of liquid at the charging princess.  But Ariella had the advantage of having the mind of a fighter and the body of a young woman near her prime and easily dodged the projectiles.  Orianna threw a small pocket of a glowing dust in Ariella's direction but Ariella's reflexes were quick enough.  The former king closed her eyes and held her breath and got through the dust and just before she opened her eyes she leaped forward and tackled the princess of Grovan to the ground and held the dagger to her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will kill anyone who gets in the way of my sister's happiness.\"  Ariella said with a venom in her voice that hadn't been their since he was a king making tough negotiations.

Clearly Marlin has done something, but what could it be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fascinating, fascinating!\" Marlin exclaimed as he made notes about the potion's results. \"Kellia doesn't suspect a thing, while Richard is clearly in distress. Clearly the subjects are aware of their current physical state...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you know he's in distress help!\" Kellia yelled as she hugged Richard, interrupting the wizard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Marlin said, not realizing he had been speaking out loud. \"I'd like to, but I must observe the reactions you two have to the potion more! This is truly fascinating!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to be a boy,\" Richard sobbed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might find this fascinating, but Richard is crying because of what you did!\" Kellia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not my name, that's a boys name. My name is Wilhelmina,\" Richard said through tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Wilhelmina, Can I call you Mina?\" Kellia asked. Richard didn't speak but nodded yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Information created ex nihilo!\" Marlin exclaimed as he continued to jot down notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mina, I promise, on my honor as a princess, that I will get the wizard to restore you to normal,\" Kellia said. \"So, don't cry, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll try,\" she replied weakly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Kellia got up, marched right up to Marlin and snatched the notes from his hand. \"Wizard, you have made Mina there cry for your little experiment. I demand you stop this and fix it immediately!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlin was a bit taken back by Kellia's brash actions. Even altering her memories to think she had always been a girl, this former prince was still tiresome. But this still presented a good chance to see how clever Kellia was. \"Very well, Princess,\" Marlin replied. \"I will fix it, but first I will need two things. I can't fix it without my notes, so I'll need those back. Also, I'll need you to remind me exactly what my potion was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remind you?\" Kellia asked skeptically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it's a pity, but at my age the memory starts to go, and I just can't seem to recall what potion it was,\" Marlin lied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't tell us,\" Kellia replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, how careless of me,\" Marlin said. \"But perhaps you could figure it out from the effects?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKellia glanced at Marlin's notes, but found the writing largely illegible. Was it some sort of secret wizard language or was Marlin's handwriting just that bad? Either way, it would be of no help, so she handed the notes back to the wizard. She then looked back at Richard, or Mina, it's possible he was originally a girl, and the potion just made her think Mina was a boy. But the wizard said the potions were the same, so why was Mina Richard but she was still Kellia? Something didn't add up here, but she wasn't quite sure what. Still, Mina was relying on her to get Marlin to fix things. Maybe the potions altered their memory? Made Richard think he was Mina, but then shouldn't it have done the same thing to her, and made her think she was a boy? Of course it was also possible Marlin was mistaken or lying about the potions being the same. Mina could have had a potion that turned her into a boy, and the other potion made her believe Mina was always Richard? Kellia took a deep breath. \"I have the answer!\"</span></div></div>",

There is a blinding flash and in Fia place is a very handsome guard in armour. \"Oh, thank you Marlin\" she throws her arms around him.<br>\r\n\"Er... Princess you might want to act a bit more manly\".<br>\r\n\"Oh right\" she moves away and quickly runs out leaving Marlin to just shake this head and get back to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later and Fia has not been able to find much out, Kelos's guard are very protective of him and won't allow her to get close. Fia is in the stables thinking about changing back when she gets the urge to pee, she about to head to her rooms when she reaslise she can't. She could change back but she really needs to go now. So does what she has seen other men do, she goes between the wall and the stables, there is a small alleyway where no one goes much and pulls out her dick. It is a big dick, Fia has only seen a few, mostly quick looks when men have been peeing in the woods on long rides but she can tells it's bigger than most. She begins to wonder why Marlin has a transformations potion of a well hung man and maid on hand, when she is interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! I not sure if I'm looking at a stallion or a man\" Fia quickly turns to see Queen Esmeralda (Kelos's mother) standing there. Fia tries to say something but har mouth just moves with no sound coming out. \"Don't worry I've come here to do the same thing you have\" she stands next to you and lifts up her expansive dress, showing she hasn't got any underwear. \"What? You never seen a queen take a piss before\" you shake your head \"well there is a first time for everything\". The queen spreads her pussy lips and starts to pee standing up. \"I'm not like that prissy bitch Fia, I like being dirty. Of course once I get my hands on her she'll change real quick\" she winks at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just about finishes, and catches the last bit of pee and rubs it back in to her pussy \"I also like a dirty cunt. Now looks like you enjoyed the show\" she says looking at your rock hard 12 inch cock \"and I want to get a lot dirtier\".<br>\r\nFia is in shock, she's not sure what the hell is going on but she definitely needs to get out of there. She shakes her head, not sure what to say \"Uh...er...no thanks I'm fine\".<br>\r\n\"I'm horny now and I want you\" she rushes forwards and pushes Fia over. Esmeralda climbs on top of Fia's hard shaft and only manages to get in a few inchs inside of her. \"Oh this is going to be differcult but I think I'm up to the task.\" Fia is panicking she is enjoying it but at the same time she does want her first time at sex to be her being in a male body with her future mother-in-law rapeing her. Esmeralda is beauitful for a women in her later years and her body is tight in all the right places, she slips a little bit more inside herself \"oh so closes\". Fia is running out of time, what does she do?            </span></div></div>",

She reaches in to her pocket and pulls out the potion to change her back but Esmeralda sees her about to drink and quickly grabs the bottle and throws it away. Fia groans in despair but also in pleasure as the Queen manages to grind herself all the way down Fia's shaft. \"That looked like a transformation potion, so you clearly aren't a guard. That bottle looked like in came from Marlin's lab, also you were snooping around asking about Kelos. So I think Marlin turned you in to a guard to spy on us, but the question is who are you? A serving girl, a stable boy, a lady in-waiting, not that it matters after this I'll make sure you won't be able to report back\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis should have paniced Fia but she wasn't not listening, she was focusing completely on her dick. Everyone she ever knew had always said sex was sinful her wet nurse, her priest, Marlin but as Esmeralda slide up and down her cock all Fia could think about was having as much sex as possible from now on, she just wasn't sure if she wanted sex in her Princess body or her new well hung body.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I-I'm close, you need to get off, I don't want to get you pregnant\" Esmeralda sped up. <br>\r\n\"Good, I love the feeling of cum inside me. Later on when I meet Princess Fia I'm going to have cum running down my leg and I'm going to be the only one who knows.\" Fia would normally be disgusted by this but now it was a big turn on, Fia started thrusting back into Esmeralda. With out warning the Queen came, setting off Fia's own orgasm, it was so intense that Fia passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Fia woke up a few minutes later she a immediately felt ashamed of what she had done. She tried to stand but realised she couldn't move. \"I put a bracelet of immobility on you, so you can't run away\" Esmeralda appeared in Fia's view, she was holding the transformation potion in her hand, she places her muddy boot on Fia's chest \"now lets find out who you are.\" </span></div></div>",

I best take this bracelet off you\". As soon as the bracelet is off Fia tries to get up but her dress and mud pull her down. Esmeralda offers a hand but Fia refuses and struggles to get up for another minute before standing up, her whole body now covered in mud and god knows what else. \"Things are moving quicker than thought they would but I always say that's a good thing. I best start by telling you who I am.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe queen flicks her hand, there is a puff of smoke and standing in her place is the one of the oldest ugliest women Fia has ever seen. Fia's mouth drops open, then the smell coming off the woman hits and instead gagged. It was difficult to describe the women that stood in front of Fia. She was dressed in rags, with a hunched back, most of her teeth were gone, her face was very pointed to sum it up she looked exactly like what Fia had always pictured a witch to look like. Fia passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she came round the witch was sat very close to her, Fia tried to get up and flee up but again her dress stop her. The witch laughed at her \"they told me you a right princess but I didn't believe them\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFia just about got up again and said in a very small voice \"who are you and what to you want?\" The witch smiled which just made her look more frightening. She started to explain and had to repeat herself a number of times before Fia understood. Twenty years ago Arthras and the queen were struggling to have a child, no matter what they tried nothing worked even the great Marlin could do nothing so he began looking for people who were rumoured to be able to help create life. This lead him to the witch's door, she had help a few local rich people in the area conceive for a small amount of money. She convinced Marlin and the queen was sent to her, nine months later Fia was born.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough that wasn't the end of it, the queen had acted very strange throughout her pregnancy the king and Marlin had put this up to her hormones but after giving birth she continued to get worse. Many of the things she did shouldn't be said in polite society but some of the things she did in bed Arthras definitely wasn't complaining about, it was part way in to her second pregnancy that Marlin travelled the long journey back to the witch's hut in the Vorst forest. The hut was empty and look like no one had been there in a few years but Marlin felt a magic source near by so he followed a small path deeper in to the woods and found a small cave. The magic barriers protecting the cave were no match for Marlin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep in the cave Marlin found a person a sleep on a bed moss, that person was the queen. It was far out of the power of the witch to create out life using magic but like most women she could make life using her own body. So when ever a rich couple came to her wanting help she put the woman in to a deep sleep and replaced her for nine months. Once she gave birth she would wake the woman up implant a few vague memories, the couple got a kid and she got to have as much sex and pampering she could take, everyone won. When she gave birth to Fia things changed she had always give birth to boys, as soon as she found out she had a girl, she knew she had to stay to train her as a witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course as soon as Marlin found out he came rushing back all fire and brimstone, the witch just escaped with her life before he got back carrying her unborn second child with her. \"And that brave witch was.....ME! Fia, I am your mother\" the witch finished. Fia was speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-But why are you back?\" Fia said as tears appeared in her eyes.<br>\r\n\"I already said, to train you and stop this damn marriage\".<br>\r\n\"But why did you look like Esmeralda?\"<br>\r\n\"I needed a disguise and I've been one queen why not another but don't worry I've learned my lesson about leaving queens in caves\" she showed Fia a diamond necklace hidden under her rags \"I changed her in to this\".<br>\r\n\"NO you're lying\" Fia ran off crying.<br>\r\n\"Well, that could have gone better\". Then in the mud the witch saw a potion, she picked it up and saw on the mud caked label MAID. Does she drink it or change back in to Queen Esmeralda.              </span></div></div>",

Marlin smiles as it progresses as expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a bright flash, the princess is suddenly standing in a loose top displaying a lot of cleavage. Her breasts growing from their rather subtle B-cup, steadily filling the top of the blouse. It is counterbalanced by her ass pushing the skirt further and further out. The changes continue apace as her hair decorations vanish, and the elegant coiffured style collapses on her head. She shrinks down a couple of inches, and her hair is ties itself in a ponytail out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer form finishes changing, as her breasts reach a rather magnificent EE-cup. \"Isn't this a bit much, Marlin?\" she asks slightly annoyed, jiggling her new 'enhancements'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabs her throat when she realises that her voice has changed too, losing the delicate and refined palace tones, and leaves her sounding like a country bumpkin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlin smiles to himself, he modelled that form on one of his favourite prostitutes, although she had come to him for a little help in reducing her breasts. He felt that Fia would be more distracting to Prince Kelos with her current form, also nobody would ever consider her threatening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed her ass, and wobbled it with a large hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oyy, no touching.\" she turns on him suddenly preparing to slap his face, her breasts continue and overturn her leaving her face down on the bed, until he spanks her ass until it stings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember that you are a maid SERVANT now girl.\" he warns in a harsh tone. \"You are meant to be subservient and obedient.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA servant bursts into the room, \"Oh enjoying the maid service again Marlin.\" he jokes. \"I don't think the princess would appreciate you enjoying yourself in her chamber or with her ladies in waiting.\" His rebuke carries less weight as his eyes practically never leave the magnficent new ass, until she turns, more slowly this time. His eyes practically pop out of his head when he sees her massive breasts heaving, as she gets her breathe back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I was leaving, and this is not lady in waiting... not even really a lady. However she was chosen to serve Prince Kelos during his visit.

The ancient robes, passed down from high wizard to high wizard for centuries, drenched in history and significance, began to shrink against his body and turn a light shade of pink.

She looked like she'd been crying. The simple maidservant skirt that had once been her favourite dress was hiked up over he waist, exposing the jiggling ass picked straight out of Marlin's favourite brothel. Somewhere the Prince had found a long leather riding crop, and punctuate each word with a slap to her rear. \"Harder!

He was a handsome man to be sure, with his deep-set, brown eyes just beneath the protruding brow ridge stretching across his forehead and just above his aquiline nose.  Fia's ladies-in-waiting would praise the marvel of his flawless countenance, and the debonair smiles he often flashed secretly at the princess of Traeven were devilishly alluring, but she tried her best to ignore the scoundrel.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Grovan was Traeven's enemy for longer than the princess could remember, but now she had to entertain the idea of the two being allies.  The scariest part of that pact Daddy had made with Kelos's father was that Fia may very well have to marry Kelos.  It hadn't seemed such an awful idea at first, because she was fourteen when she met Kelos, then seventeen, and thought him the most handsome, desirable man in Traeven and Grovan.  Then she learned of his true nature.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Good e'en, Princess Fia,\" Kelos murmured, stepping forward towards the slightly ajar door.  Fia felt anxiously insecure that the two were conversing alone in her apartments.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Good evening,\" she replied cooly, setting the mirror back down to rest on the smooth wood of her vanity table.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"If I may be so bold to say, my lady, but you look simply...ravishing today.\"  A dark, curved eyebrow rose in what any other woman would call a handsomely suggestive fashion.  Kelos flashed one of his smiles, twisting his thin lips up and showing his white, even teeth; to Fia, though, this grin seemed more like the menacing baring of teeth to show her he had dominance.  \"Are you prepared for dinner?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Fia stared at him a few moments, restraining the impulse to shout at the visiting noble.  <i>'If only his father recalled him to Grovan,'</i> she thought as he sidled his way into her room, bowing his head to passionately kiss her hand.  <i>'Or if he sailed one of his racing ships off the face of the earth.'</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Have I offended you, lady?\" he murmured once more, staring upwards with his intense, brown eyes.  Kelos rose to his feet and put one hand just behind Fia's elbow, overlaying her fingers with those of his other hand.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not in the least,\" she spat, trying to rise of her own accord.  Kelos lifted her from her chair nonetheless.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Then, please, allow me to escort you to dinner.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Fia sighed, but laid her arm on the one he proffered.  \"Very well, then.\"  A chilling wave of fear rippled down her back at the close contact, but she tried to ignore the desire in his eyes while he, as if in a tender, loving way, touched his shoulder to hers and leaned towards her as they walked.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This isn't the way,\" she pointed out softly after a few moments in silence.  He was going in the opposite direction of the dining hall; instead, he seemed to be going farther and farther into the bowels of the castle.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I know, lady.\"  His smile was less genuine than usual.  \"I would rather take a more private, scenic route.  We can't let <i>them</i> know.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Know what?\"  Fia felt another chill run through her body.

Her mind flooded with thoughts of her imminent demise. Then all of a sudden she felt Kelos pull her towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get down, you foolish woman!\" Kelos shouted, as he pulled Princess Fia down to the ground and leapt past her as she fell. He trust the dagger into a shadow on the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KYREEEEEEEE!\" A blood curdling, inhuman scream filled the air as the shadow began to move becoming a shapeless, twisting patch of floating darkness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFia looked up and saw the thing Prince Kelos was facing off against. \"Wha... What is that?\" she asked, her voice filled with terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a wraith,\" Kelos said. \"If you had just listened and come with me I could have gotten you to safety in Marlin's laboratory.\" There was a tinge of anger in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you just tell me?\" Fia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because they'd have cut us off if I had,\" Kelos said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The... princess... will... be... ours...\" the wraith said in a ghostly voice. It reached out to Kelos with surprisingly quick speed. Kelos was unable to dodge, but managed to shrug off the affects of contact with the shadowy form. He stabbed the wraith again, causing it to scream again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you knew these things were here, why did you only bring that little dagger?!\" Fia asked now that the terror was subsiding. \"You have a sword! And guards with swords!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All useless,\" Kelos said, as he again struck at the wraith. \"This dagger is enchanted, but normal weapons would just pass through them!\" The wraith dodged Kelos' strike and again touched him. This time Kelos was unable to shrug off the effect and nearly lost his balance as he felt a bit of life being drained away. However, he slashed at the wraith with the dagger, defeating the ghostly creature with a lucky hit causing its shadowy form to fade away. He then reached out to Fia. \"Are you okay Princess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, but what about you?\" Fia asked, now concerned about the man whom a few moments ago she thought was about to kill her. She took his hand and he helped her to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, it'll take more than a wraith or two to beat me,\" Kelos said with pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did it come from?\" Fia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the servant of an ancient necromancer,\" Kelos said. \"Rather than becoming a lich, she takes the body of a beautiful woman when her current one becomes too old.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this time she picked me,\" Fia said. \"Well I must compliment her on her standards, I suppose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't find fault there either,\" Kelos replied, \"but we need to get moving, more wraiths are coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's not waste any more time then\" Fia said.</span></div></div>",

Why haven't they attacked us since their first time though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They wanted to ambush us, weaken you and kill me,\" Kelos explained. \"Now the plan's changed. They're trying to herd us. If it wasn't for you, we'd have already been cornered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How lovely,\" Fia said sarcastically. The two of them left the stairwell and emerged into the kitchen. The bodies of several cooks were on the floor, the meals they were working on left unfinished, with a pot bubbling over on the stove. \"Let me guess, they became wraiths.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, probably,\" Kelos replied. \"It's a shame, but we need to keep moving. Which way now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you'll find that your little flight is already at an end,\" a creepy woman's voice said, as a figure dressed in a black cloak entered the room from a doorway on the right. more wraiths blocked all the exits, trapping the pair. Kelos stepped in between Fia and this new threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally showing yourself, witch?\" Kelos asked defiantly. He held his dagger ready to strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I had heard you were a fool, Kelos, but I had no idea you were this much of one,\" the necromancer said. \"Stand aside and give the princess to me, and I'll let you live. If you prove entertaining enough, I might even let you marry me. You'll get your princess' body that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never!\" Kelos shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Foolish to the last I see,\" the Necromancer replied. \"But it's not really your choice, now is it?\" She looked at Fia. \"Well, Princess? Will you give yourself to me? I'll spare the life of this fool and everyone left in this castle.\"</span></div></div>",

Dispose of him!\" On her command all the remaining wraiths rushed towards Marlin. Marlin stroked his beard then suddenly 8 more Marlins appeared in the room. Confused, the wraiths paused momentarily before splitting up to attack all of the Marlins. Marlin used this to his advantage and fired bolts of magic at the wraiths still coming towards him as opposed to his duplicates, defeating the group instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so, madam?\" he asked. The rest of the wraiths were focused on his doubles, leaving him free to focus on the necromancer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is!\" the Necromancer shouted. She waved her arm and a wall of fire flew towards Marlin. She quickly turned to Fia and Kelos and rushed towards them. \"Your body is mine, Princess!\" Her hand glowed with a black light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get away from me!\" Fia shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop!\" Kelos said, using the last of his strength to get between Fia and the Necromancer.

She reached up to hold it, and noticed her hair felt really short. \"My hair!\" she exclaimed, at which point she noticed her voice was far deeper than it should be. Her headache started to fade as she sat up in bed and looked around the room. Marlin was on the other side of the room talking to her father and several guards, but she couldn't make out what they were saying. On a bed to her left was an old woman, presumably the necromancer. On a bed to her right there was another woman, young with long blonde hair. \"She kind of looks like me,\" Fia thought, then she had a realization, and quickly looked around for a mirror, spotting one on the wall across from her bed. Upon looking at it, the situation was confirmed. Instead of her usual reflection, Fia saw the image of Prince Kelos staring back at her.</span></div></div>",

Though Fia realized that made sense, for Kelos was not simply a man, but also a prince and a strong warrior. It made sense there'd be such a difference. Fia began to rub a hand over this new male body, smiling at its hard, muscular chest, finely sculpted abs, and powerful arms. Fia made and relaxed a fist a few times, taking in the sensation of the arms muscles moving within. Then, a naughty thought crossed Fia's mind, and \"he\" reached down and felt \"his\" new crotch. Fia was surprised when Kelos' penis reacted to being touched and began to grow. Fia found the sensation a bit too much for right now, and jerked his hand away. \"I have just got to try that out later, Fia thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Prince Kelos is awake,\" Marlin said from across the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So he is,\" King Authras said and he came walking across the room. \"Well done, boy,\" he said, slapping Fia's back. \"You saved my daughter from that necromancer, and as such you have proven your worth to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's a bit too early to say that,\" Fia said. \"I'm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's right, your highness,\" Marlin said, interrupting as Fia narrowed her eyes in annoyance. \"We should wait for the princess to wake up.

Is my body so terrible?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not terrible, but I think everyone is better off in their own body,\" Kelos said, choosing words carefully to both not insult Fia, and not consent to remaining like this for longer than necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Worry not, my dear,\" Marlin said, as he lifted the Necromancer's still unconscious body and threw her over his shoulder. \"I'll unravel this spell, and give this woman some richly deserved punishment in the process.\" With that he headed out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's rather spry for a man of his years,\" Kelos said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the magic,\" Arthras said. \"It keeps him young inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't the same apply to the Necromancer though?\" Kelos asked. \"If so, why would she steal new bodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just don't understand a woman's heart,\" Fia said. \"A girl needs her beauty too. Speaking of which, this is a good time for you to get some lessons in that, personally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd rather not,\" Kelos said. \"Though I don't want to cause you any embarrassment when we return to your body, and I'd like you to keep up my body's conditioning too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Fia replied. \"As I said earlier, it will be a good way to get to know each other. You will keep up my body's beauty regimen and I will keep up your body's training regimen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed,\" Kelos said. </span></div></div>",

The reflection staring back at her was an almost perfect approximation of her as a man. This mirror apparition had six inches of height on her, short blonde hair, a chiseled jaw, and was adorned in royal blue cloth. He looked like he could be the king's male heir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Fia sighed. Seeing this version of her that could have been but never was unleashed a sense of longing in her she never knew she had. It would have to settle for being a fantasy however. Marlins' magic was powerful, but even he could not reconstitute physical bodies into another form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My god\" Marlin said with deep seated dread. \"Prince Kelos thought he was playing a trick on you, but he has found something very real.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n:\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is no ordinary amulet. What you are looking at is an amulet made by dark elves from Dripstone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark elves were a long forgotten race, once revered for their breathtaking cities and feared for their powerful and mysterious magic, Marlin explained. Their magic was based upon the principle that there could be no such thing as a violation of natural law and that no vice was too gluttonous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They did unspeakable things to anyone unfortunate enough to encounter them. Eventually, the community splintered over their increased reliance on the magic, and it became their undoing. They're might be 200 dark elves left in all of civilization.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Princess Fia was taking in Marlin's speech, something clicked in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could...\" Princess Fia hesitated. \"Could...that amulet be used to change someone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlin was getting a bad feeling about this. \"Look, Fia, I don't know if-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can it change me?\" Princess Fia asked desperately. \"Could it make me a boy, a man?:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlin hesitated, but then just nodded his head. He could never lie to the princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elderly magician tried to reason with Princess Fia, but she was stubborn to a fault,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've known me since I was a child! I've never asked you for anything ever! If you've ever cared about me, you'll help me do this!\" Princess Fia pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlin realized he was not going to win this argument, so he asked the only thing he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you not happy as you are, Fia?\" the magician whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Fia was taken aback by that question. She was happy with the way she looked and with her life, but the possibility of becoming someone new had overwhelmed her. Becoming a man would open so many choices, so many freedoms she never could have dreamed of having. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marlin, I am quite happy as i am, but I need to do this for myself. Not doing it will haunt me for the rest of my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her response, Marlin decided his only choice was to help her see this through. The process was simple enough; the dark elves were a species that relied on rhymes and limericks for their incantations and Princess Fia had found the right one for her transformation<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Fia pulled the amulet of her head and kissed Marlin on the cheek. \"Thank you, dear friend, for giving me this opportunity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFia stood silent for a moment, only slightly hesitating before reciting the incantation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>From the Filjaar showers<br>\r\n   To the caves of Delkvoth<br>\r\n    Unleash the hidden power<br>\r\n    Release me from the blanket of feminity<br>\r\n    Show me a new visage<br>\r\n    Gift me with the splendor of masculinity</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the words left her lips, the amulet started to glow. Pink smoke started to envelope the princess. <br>\r\nFia became lost in a sensual experience she had never felt in her entire life. Sweat started to pour down her entire body as she felt her body starting to grow. Her tiny hands and feet nearly doubled in size. Fia felt her body begin to elongate. Her once petite frame started to expand out. She felt herself growing muscles, becoming stronger every second. Her long, blonde hair began to fall out piece by piece. Fia felt her breasts start to contract in and her chest become broader. She became very confused when she felt her nether regions start to change, developing a long appendage and two bulbs. Fia felt her entire face shift, becoming more rigid and defined. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, the clouds dissipated. Marlin had to hold his mouth before he could let out a scream. Standing in Princess Fia's was a young man, about 19 years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Fia rose to his feet, the first words that came out of his mouth were \"woah\". Fia was taken aback by his much, much deeper voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFia ran to Marlin's mirror and gasped. He was a stud; He ran his hand through his new short cut. He touched his face and his muscles. It was everything he could have dreamed of. A new life for himself defined entirely on his terms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new prince went over to Marlin and hugged him. \"I love you, Marlin. Thank you for this gift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlin smiled. \"I liked Princess Fia...but I love the new Prince Fio. There is just one question...how will you explain this to your father?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap\" Prince Fio responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Daddy would start saying something, and he would say or do something and pause, giving her a strangely distant stare.  Then he would get a rueful smile on his face as he was lost in his memories, somewhere a long time ago.  It was probably old age; Daddy's blonde hair was streaked silver-gray and white, and there were wrinkles at the corners of his eyes and mouth and across his forehead.<br>\r\nDaddy came up behind her and put his hand on her shoulder.  \"You look just like your mother,\" he said and kissed the top of her head.  \"Just as pretty as she was when she was nineteen.\"<br>\r\nFia put down the mirror and smiled at Daddy.  Both of them missed her mother terribly; she had died of a plague-like illness when Fia was young.  Fia was even named after Mother; Fia was short for Fidelia, her mother's middle name.<br>\r\n\"Nineteen,\" he murmured again, petting her hair fondly.  \"It's time you married, you know.\"<br>\r\n\"I know, Daddy.\"  Fia straightened her necklace so that it hung right over her sternum.<br>\r\n\"Good,\" he said.  Daddy smiled again.  \"I'm holding a banquet and ball tonight, hosting a slew of elligible suitors.\"<br>\r\n\"Are you, Daddy?\"  Smiling, Princess Fia stood up and smoothed the wrinkles and folds of her gown.  \"I love dances!\"<br>\r\n\"I know you do, dear.  Now, hurry; you'll be helping me welcome our guests of honor.\"<br>\r\nPrincess Fia picked up the mirror again, fixing her appearance.  If there were more suitors tonight, she had to be presentable.  \"I'll be down in a few minutes, Daddy.\"  She turned, but Daddy's long shadow was already going down the hallway.<br>\r\nFia hurriedly left, keeping her high cheekbones rosy by pinching them.  She walked down the corridor, but, to her surprise, saw a door ajar.<br>\r\nIt was Marlin's door, she realized.  But that secretive old coot never, under any circumstance whatsoever, left his chamber door open.  Curiosity nagged at the princess, but she halted, torn.</span></div></div>",

Soon the anger began to subside.Calming herself using a breathing technique, Fia cleared her head. She still had four more days until the prince came. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hooh. I'll just have to find another way to grab the prince's attention.\" Fia proclaimed.Pushing that thought aside, the princess began to go about her day. \"Servants! Your princess demands your attention!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, four handmaidens came rushing in. It was almost like clockwork as they began to undress her and put on her clothes. Somewhere inside of Fia's mind caused the girl to not check her ring finger. If she did, she'd probably would've seen her ruby ring gone from the digit.<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">===</div><br>\r\n\"You're looking lovely today princess.\" A guard spoke aloud. Princess Fia waved in response to the man, but immediately felt a slight tightness inside of her bodice. Shaking her head, she went back to walking through her garden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing features today my lady.\" A random servant girl stuttered out. Fia smiled, then grimaced as she felt that same tight feeling in her bodice. In fact, it felt a little worse. She moved with purpose, while also discreetly adjusting her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pray to the <font class=\"size3\" style=\"\">LORD'S</font> for this beautiful day! And I pray for your shining youth princess!\" One of the brothers from the church spoke aloud. Princess Fia bowed, but she felt the back of her dress groping her rear. Upon straightening herself, she could also feel her bodice clutching her ribs. Internally yelping, Fia shot off towards a secluded alcove in her garden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking sure nobody was looking, the royal girl opened up her shirt's collar to relieve some of the tightness. Looking down, the princess yelled in shock at what she saw. She had womanly assets, larger than what she had before! Stumbling backward, she could feel her rump touch the back wall. Turning her head at this she could feel the wetness of her lips dry up, Fia licked her chap lips to fix the problem.But in doing so, finally noticed that her lips felt a little more plump as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\" Princess Fia exclaimed. Doing a second scan of the area, Fia planned her next action.</span></div></div>",

Fear rushed through her as she almost fell out of her chair. Once she had regained her balance however the figure had vanished...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was it just my imagination?\" She asked looking around seeing nothing but the usual trappings in her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you say something my lady?\" Her handmaiden said walking by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...I'm fine. Thank you.\" The Princess replied. She couldn't help shake the dark ominous feeling that something was watching her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay my lady you you should hurry your farther expects you for the birthday toast.\" The handmaiden replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking off the feeling the Princess gathered herself and went downstairs heading for the ballroom. All the lords of the kingdom had arrived for her 19 birthday and she was expected to meet several Princes' today. Now that she was finally of age royalty from many other lands were expected to try and win her affection so they may win her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in the ballroom the orchestra played up the music as the Princess entered. Everyone nodded and bowed as she took her place by her father's side. Her farther King Arthras stood up as everyone sat down to show their respect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today we celebrate a grand occasion. My beautiful daughter Fia finally comes of age today. My dear you have blossomed into a wonderful young woman. Your mother would be so proud of you. I thought this day might not come. When you were born you very ill and sickly. The healers and mages told me there was little they could do. However you proved them all wrong. You fought off that illness and blossomed into the strong and beautiful woman you are today. I am truly honored to be your father.\" The king said in his opening speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ballroom was filled with applause after the speech as the Princess wiped away a tear from her eye. Raising her glass in the air the entire ballroom shared in a toast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TO PRINCESS FIA!\" They all shouted. However this celebration was not to last...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the toast ended a chill ran through the air as a strange wind began flowing through the ballroom. All the windows were closed however as some of the guests began looking around for the cause of it. The wind began to blow out some of the torches dimming the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daddy? What's going on?\" Fia asked her farther who had a frozen look on his face. He seemed almost paralyzed by fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the lights dimmed a strange figure cloaked in a black robe appeared in the center of the ballroom. He seemed to have just appeared out of thin air as everywhere gasped and backed away from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes....to Princess Fia....You truly have blossomed into a beautiful girl my day. I made a wise choice in sparing you that night.\" The figure said in a rough and grizzly voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stranger reveal yourself!\" One of the guards said as the royal gaurd knights began to surround him swords drawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh there is no need for that. I am invited here. By none other than the king himself. Don't you remember Arthras our little deal you made 19 years ago?\" The figure said with a cold laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father is this true?\" Fia asked looking up at the King who was clenching his fists so tight his knuckles were white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How....how do you live demon? My sorcerer swore they defeated you a decade ago? Our deal is void!\" The king suddenly yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...they did defeat me. Fortunately for me they didn't destroy my soul. That is bound outside my body. It may have taken years to rebuild my form but now I am back and more powerful then every before.\" The hooded figure said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silence Monster!\" One of the guards yelled before charging him wth his sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hooded figure simply held out his hand as the metal blade shattered across his skin like glass on stone. Not a mark was left on the hooded man as he grabbed the knight by the neck and tossed him out of a window over 50 yards away like he weighed nothing. The other knights saw this display as their knees started to shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have not coke to fight king....I have come to collect my payment.\" The figure said as he pointed to the Princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You cannot have her!\" The king yelled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daddy what is going on?\" The princess asked now terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you were born my dear the sickness was going to claim your life. Nothing could be done to save you, it claimed your mother in labor and passed it on to you. I feared the worst until this hooded figure appeared before me. He swore he could save you and in return he said he wanted to claim you as his own once you came of age. I knew what this man was....A demon a spawn from the pits of hell itself but I had no choice. I agreed and with one drop of his blood he cured you. I sent my best warriors and mages to find his domain and end him before the deal was done. I was told they had succeeded but....\" the king said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But they failed....now the time has come due. Now my princess come you shall make a fine demoness and queen.\" The cloaked demon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would never go with you monster! I would rather die!\" Princess Fia cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You act as if you have a choice my dear. My power and blood still courses through your veins just waiting to be awoken....perhaps these fine humans would like a taste of that power?\" The hooded figure said as dark waves of magical energy began to swirl around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds the cloak melted away as darkness swirled the demon. Sudden two huge black wings and a black tail sprung forth from the man as the demon revealed himself to everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/a3/ca/dc/a3cadc91b6e2850ebb3962c7b86a45b9.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/ori...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd gasped as the Princess looked the demon both terrified and strangely intriguingly. He had the form of a man yet also that of a monster....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now than....my princess how about we awaken some of that demonic energy inside you?\" The demon said as he clasped his hands together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the Princess began to feel a bit strange. A heat was starting to build within her like she had never felt before. Suddenly a massive pain hit her body as she fell to her hands and knees crying out in agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please make it stop! It hurts!\" The princess cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't stop! I will do anything!\" The king called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too late!\" The demon said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling over the Princess felt the pain start to center at her feet. Pulling up her dress she saw her nice pretty heels her father had bought her start to fee really tight. She tried to reach down to take them off but before she could a loud ripping noise came from the fronts of her shoes as she saw long claw like red toenails poking through the shoes....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Princess stared in horror as she tore off her shoes and stared down at her feet. Her toenails had grown into long red claws. She wanted to cry but it seemed this wasn't he only change....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer feet began to suddenly bend and snap as she cried out in pain. Her feet bent themselves upright as her heels began to grow and extend form a new kind of twisted high heel of its own. When they were done changing it was clear her feet were no longer human as they looked very demonic...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The change has begun my dear. It will spread all over until you eventually turn into the beautiful demonic bride I desire.\" Pulling out a parchment from his pocket he tossed it on the ground. It had an image of a beautiful yet terrifying demon woman on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://orig13.deviantart.net/03a6/f/2014/336/a/d/5___succubus_watermark_by_jocarra-d88hyoq.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://orig13.deviantart.net/03a6/f/2014...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can chose to embrace it and find me yourself or resist in which case I will claim you again when the time is right.\" The demon said before he turned around as darkness enveloped his body before he vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Princess stared down at her feet in tears as the guests began to flee in terror calling her a monster and blaming the king for making a deal with a demon.</span></div></div>",

Xarlat extends his hands towards the cowering man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's muttering a litany of mumbled apologies, begging for mercy. As the magic strikes his body he shrieks in pain. His body contorts twitch and growing beneath the onslaught of the magic. As it grows he bursts through his outfit, swelling rapidly.

The flickering fire light reveals in uncertain light the hooves that now replace his hands and feet. He also has more weight to his body... the flames hint at broad hips, and perhaps a tail. Xarlat's magic crackles over his body confirming the tail, the whole equine shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shape now clear, Xarlat is smiling triumphantly. The servant is now in the shape of a foal.

When she had met her as Prince Kelos years before, Princess Fia had been polite and cheerful, a far cry from the woman standing before her today. Was that merely an act at a formal reception and this her true self. Or perhaps she is simply dismissive of servants, not uncommon for nobility, and something the prince himself had been guilty of on occasion. \"One of my kind?\" Kela asked, hoping the reply would provide illumination on this unexpected side to the princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think me a naive and sheltered girl? You look upon me as a man would. Do not think I am unaware of such things,\" The princess' previously haughty expression turned to anger. \"Perhaps that is why you were sent to me, to test if I am easily tempted to sin?

However, the scribe who was responsible for this situation decided to humiliate me by proclaiming me a servant. Perhaps there was little choice, as your father seemed quite dismissive of a woman speaking to him. Still, I shall make sure he pays for this treachery upon our return to Grovan. I do believe my sister is in need of another maid.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Fia giggled at this thought. \"My, that would be a most fitting punishment. I do so apologize for my earlier behavior. I had believed your presence implied certain rumors about me had left the court and traveled as far as your kingdom. I was, after all expecting a prince to ask for my hand in marriage, yet instead I was presented with a handmaiden with a rather obvious attraction to me. It pleases me to know I was mistaken in this assumption. You are not that sort of woman, but simply a man who has become a woman. Though I am curious if Prince Kelos was as handsome a man as Princess Kela is a beautiful woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKela blushed at Princess Fia's compliment. \"I would like to think so,\" she replied. \"Though I am somewhat disappointed you do not remember me. We met several years ago, at the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Eliswick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must again apologize it seems,\" Princess Fia said. \"I'm afraid I was still but a young girl at the time and not terribly interested in potential suitors. Speaking of which, will you be remaining Princess Kela, or will Prince Kelos make a return?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have been told the spell will wear off in one week.\" Kela answered. \"But could you please not call me princess? It's embarrassing and if one of your servants should overhear...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but I appear to only have a short time to do so, <i>Princess Kela</i>.

If she's looking forward to it this much, what could be done? \"Fine, you may call me princess as long as I am in this form.\" She looked slightly to the side, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How wonderful!\" Princess Fia exclaimed, grasping Princess Kela's hand with her own, grinning widely. \"Oh but I am being rude, please do come sit, Princess Kela.\" She led the transformed guest over to the window. Underneath was a small, round table made wood. It was painted white and had matching chairs with pink cushions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Kela looked down at her dress. \"I'm not quite sure how to sit in this thing,\" she said frankly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose you would not,\" Princess Fia replied. \"Very well, I shall demonstrate.\" She walked over to a chair. \"First, you must smooth out your dress.\" She reached behind her rear and did as she was instructing. \"Then simply sit straight down, but be graceful. Remember, a proper lady such as ourselves must keep her legs crossed, preferable at the ankle.\" She sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I can manage that.\" Princess Kela replied.

I know you intended it as a compliment, but I'm not sure how I feel about being a 'proper lady.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why you should feel flattered, naturally,\" Princess Fai replied. She leaned forward and grasped Princess Kela's hand. \"After all you are quite a lovely and graceful woman, Princess Kela. I'm positive you shall make the entire court envious of your beauty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Kela's heart raced, causing her to blush profusely at Princess Fia's words. \"T-Thank you,\" she stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Though I must confess, apart from the transformation of the spell, you are not at all what I expected,\" Princess Fia commented. \"I was picturing Grovan's royal family to be far more brutish. I wonder if the spell has not transformed more than your body.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It didn't stop me from punching that scribe for failing to warn me,\" Princess Kela stated, her heart claiming somewhat. \"I suppose it can not be ruled out, but even if I had not been transformed, I would be on my best behavior. After all, I did come here to make you my bride, Princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. A most satisfactory reason I would say,} Princess Fia agreed. \"Though I wonder, might it be preferable if I made you my bride? Beauty such as yours can only be fully realized in a bridal gown.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlush returned to Princess Kela's cheeks as her heart once again raced and she felt an unfamiliar moistness in her crotch. \"I-I'm sure my b-beauty doesn't begin to compare to yours! Everyone must have been looking forward to seeing you in a bridal gown. I have been ever since I first saw you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are too modest, Princess Kela,\" Princess Fia replied. \"Though perhaps you do have a point. I would not wish to deprive you of something you have been desiring for so long. We shall be each other's brides then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I thought you were opposed to that sort of thing,\" Princess Kela said cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was when I believed you to be servant girl sent to test me,\" Princess Fia explained. \"Now I am aware that despite your current form, you were born a prince. But I do go on. If you will excuse me for a moment, Princess Kela, I shall arrange for some tea to be served.\" the princess got up and walked out of her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe I see the reason behind those rumors she alluded to,\" Princess Kela thought to herself. \"Still, I can't help but feel I'm being caught up in her pace. At this rate even when I do change back I'll be more like her bride. I'll have to be more proactive when she returns. Still, 'Princess Kela?' Princess Fia does seem to enjoy calling me that. If my sister knew, she'd never let me hear the end of this though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, Princess Fia returned. \"I do apologize for my delay, Princess Kela.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKela gracefully rose as she had seen Princess Fia do. \"Not at all, Princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA maid rushed in behind Princess Fia, carrying a tray of macarons which she placed on the table. She then turned to their guest. \"I-I'm terribly sorry for the way we've treated you, Princess Kela!\" the maid said, bowing deeply. \"We had no idea who your were. Please accept this apology on behalf of the entire castle staff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKela looked over to Princess Fia, shocked. \"Wha...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe it best that the servants not be left under the impression you're a mere handmaiden, Princess Kela.\" Princess Fia said, explaining herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKela turned back to the maid, blushing from embarrassment. \"You're forgiven,\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much!' The maid replied. \"I'll be back shortly with your tea.\" The maid backed out of the room, keeping her head down the entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Kela turned to her hostess. \"What did you tell them?!\" she asked in near panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why merely the truth, Prince Kelos met with an incident on his trip over, as was claimed upon your arrival, so Princess Kela came in his place. This way we may move about the palace without pretense of your status.\" Princess Fia smiled warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't tell them about my condition?\" Princess Kela asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you have wished me to?\" Princess Fia replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely not!\" Princess Kela responded.She stomped her foot and pouted in a rather feminine matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Fia raised her finger hand to her mouth and giggled. \"I must confess I have not been so amused in quite awhile.

She took a sip of tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, how surprising,\" Princess Fia said. \"I must confess, I expected you to decline. After all, it would result in a painting of you in your present condition.\" She gracefully nibbled on a pink macaron. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I hadn't considered that,\" Kela replied. \"All I could think of was spending more time with you. It must be the spell!\" A feeling of dread came over her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not believe so,\" Princess Fia stated. She paused to take a tip of tea. \"I would venture that you are in fact afflicted with a second spell, Princess Kela.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another spell?! When could it have happened?\" Kela asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Fia giggled softly. \"I would say it has been since you attended the wedding of a certain duke and duchess several years ago.\" She stood up and approached Kela, bending forward slightly. \"Is your heart rate not increasing?\" She placed her right hand on Kela's chest, causing both of them to blush. \"I'm afraid this is one of the symptoms. I appear to have been afflicted by it as well.\" Her left hand guided Kela's right hand to her chest. \"See my heart rate has also increased. The name of this spell is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love?\" Princess Kela interrupted, blushing even harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct.\" Princess Fia said softly. She leaned in and kissed Kela, who reciprocated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-Is this ok?\" Kela asked. \"After all, I'm not a man now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By law in this kingdom, you are as you were born, Princess Kela\" Princess Fia replied. \"It is why my father had not transformed me when I was but a child. As I was born female, I cannot inherit the throne even if he did so. Thus, you are by law male even if your form has been changed. Though I do not expect my father to recognize you as such. The royal magistrate, however, will. Provided you are able to supply evidence of your transformation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not believe that will be a problem,\" Princess Kela said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Fia leaned in for another kiss. However, they were interrupted by a knock on the door. \"It this late already? I suppose we shall need finish this later,\" she said standing up. \"This is a good chance to introduce yourself properly, Princess Kela.\" Fia turned to the door and called out. \"You may enter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tut, tut, such delay, your grace,\" an older bald man wearing a paint smeared smock said as he entered the room. His remaining hair was graying, and her was slightly overweight. He followed by two maids, one carrying an easel and some canvases, the other carrying a large tarp. The two of them began to set up the equipment. \"Oh!\" he said with a start. \"It appears you have a visitor.\" He walked over to Kela. \"I am Raefardo, court artisan,\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Princess Kela of Grovan,\" Kela said. She held out her right hand in a feminine manner as she had observed her sister do in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaefardo kissed the back of Kela's hand. \"Always a pleasure to meet such a charming rose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess Kela shall be sitting as my model while she is in Traeven,\" Princess Fia said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it not merely tonight?\" Kela asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not at all. Tonight I shall merely sketch you,\" Princess Fia replied. \"Then shall be the details over the next few sessions. Once the sketch is complete, I shall begin the actual painting. I regret I may be unable to complete this before your return. However, your visage shall remain with me, enabling me to complete this work even if you must depart, Princess Kela.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had no idea painting was so involved,\" Kela said in amazement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, your grace,\" Raefardo said. \"Princess Fia takes it very seriously and puts in the effort of a master artisan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am but an amateur,\" Princess Fia insisted. \"Now then, Princess Kela, would you be so good as to disrobe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of cou... Wait, I certainly did not agree to that!\" Kela stated emphatically, blushing intensely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am joking, naturally,\" Princess Fia replied with a giggle. \"I do have a pose in mind, however. Would you stand for a moment, Princess Kela?\" She reached out her arm to Kela as Kela herself had done to many a lady as Kelos. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Kela said, as she took Princess Fai's hand. She thought for a moment how strange it was to be on the receiving end of such a gesture as Fia helped her stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now please sit on my bed,\" Princess Fia instructed, which Kela obeyed. Fia then picked up a book and handed it to Kela. \"Open this about half way and hold it as if you're reading.\" Kela once again obeyed. Fia then guided Kela into exactly the position she had in mind. \"There. Will you be able to hold this pose while I sketch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so,\" Kela replied. \"I am curious why you decided on this though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believed reading would suit you, Princess Kela,\" Princess Fia explained. \"Now then, I shall be sketching. I apologize, but please don't talk if you can avoid it, and above all, do not move without first notifying me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next hour Kela held the pose as best she could, while Princess Fia used charcoal pencil to put her image on canvas, with Raefardo giving her tips and pointing out mistakes. With little else to do except sit there as time passed, Kela read the pages she had opened too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe I have finished for the evening,\" Princess Fia stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, your grace,\" Raefardo said. \"An excellent beginning to your work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKela stretched, a bit stiff after posing for so long. \"May I see it?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is but an unfinished sketch. I would think you prefer to see the finished work, but if you insist, you may, Princess Kela,\" Princess Fia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKela stood up and walked over to the canvas and the sketch of her gracefully sitting with a book in hand. The bed and walls were just quickly drawn lines, but Kela herself was well outlined, her already face highly detailed. \"This is very good,\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would say it's shaping up to be her grace's best work yet,\" Raefardo added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, it is merely a child's scribbles compared to your own masterpieces,\" Princess Fia said. \"I would propose this is more the beauty of the model than the talent of the artist.\" She looked over to Kela, who blushed in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That may also play a role,\" Raefardo said. \"Though do not sell your talent short, your grace. You're my prize pupil. Anyway, I bid you farewell until tomorrow.\" The maids began to clean up after the art session as he left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do apologize, but I must freshen up I would advise you to do the same, Princess Kela,\" Princess Fia said. \"Afterwards, would you care to dine with me tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Princess,\" Kela replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, a maid will show you to your room,\" Princess Fia said. \"But first I have something I wish to give you.\" She grasped Kela's hands, then waited until the maids were gone. She then leaned forward and kissed Kela deeply. After a few moments, the two of them separated. \"Until dinner then, Princess Kela?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Until then,\" Kela replied. She then left the room.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She signed as the clicking of her heels on the marble floors provided a constant reminder of her situation. Trapped in this painfully feminine body for a week was certainly not part of the plan. Still, things could be worse. After all, though it was a failure on her part to maintain her hasty cover, she was at least recognized as royalty now. To think she could have been forced to serve as a maid or worse. At least the marry Princess Fia part seemed to be going well. Perhaps too well. Kela stopped in front of a mirror and looked at her reflection. A beautiful woman looked back at her. \"She's right, I would look lovely in a bridal gown,\" Kela said out loud and she placed her hand on the mirror. That was perhaps the worst part. Despite all the humiliation she should be feeling, she didn't even mind. The sound of hurried footsteps coming towards her broke her thoughts. She turned and say the maid who had served the tea and macarons earlier rushing towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry, princess!\" the maid called out as she approached. \"I should have come sooner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's quite alright,\" Kela replied. \"I was taking the chance to collect my thoughts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Princess,\" the maid said.. \"Shall I show you to your room so you may freshen up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, please. Though first I would like to visit the scribe who had accompanied me,\" Kela said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly. Right this way,\" The maid gestured for Kela to follow her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What might your name be?\" Kela asked as she followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elista, Princess,\" she replied. \"But you don't have to trouble yourself to remember it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is hardly any trouble to remember a single name, Elista,\" Kela said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am honored, Princess,\" Elista said. The two of them continued to make small talk as they navigated the corridors of the castle. Before long they reached the scribe's room. \"Here we are, Princess,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Elista. Would you mind waiting outside? I shall not be long\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKela knocked on the door. \"I'm coming in,\" she stated, opening the door and barging through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, perfect timing, your highness. I have just finished sending a message to your mother, updating our progress. I must say, you certainly look beautiful in that dress. I'm sure Queen Esmeralda and Princess Orianna would be delighted to see you finally dressing as a proper lady,\" he said with a subtly mocking tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKela clenched her fist ready to strike the scribe. How dare he inform them! No doubt the court was already talking about this. However, in her haste, she had forgotten to close the door. She turned her head slightly, and saw Elista peaking her head through. She breathed deeply and relaxed her fist. This was not the time to strike. His punishment would wait. \"I'm sure they would, however, I plan to return home wearing my usual attire,\" Kela said, glaring at the scribe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh of course. Though shall I have it tailored to better show off your figure?\" The scribe asked, smirking. </span></div></div>",

Your impudence will have consequences.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were able to meet Princess Fia that way, so it all worked out,\" The scribe insisted. \"Besides, you're the one who made it necessary, <i>Princess</i>.

This was not a conversation she wished to have in front of others. \"That is what I have come to talk to you about. Princess Fia is a far more stimulating and capable woman than I expected. She and I have taken to each other surprisingly quickly. I believe she would be open to the prospects of marriage between our kingdoms. You will relay that to mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, seriously?\" the scribe replied in astonishment. \"And here I thought this entire thing was a waste of time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were incorrect,\" Kela said. \"As expected of you. Now would you send that message home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would, but I'm afraid my messenger spell can only be used 5 times a day,\" the scribe said. \"You'll have to wait until tomorrow. Or dispatch a courier. Or see if Traeven has someone who could send it for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, so you used one to send your previous report, you should have four remaining uses,\" Kela responded.

And...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough!\" Kela interrupted, furious. \"You used your messenger spell for personal letters while on a diplomatic assignment?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kind of,\" the scribe admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not sure if you're simply an idiot, or deliberately trying to undermine me,\" Kela replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was important,\" the scribe insisted. \"I had to tell them I arrived safely.

Further you will refrain from any unauthorized personal messages.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, your highness,\" the scribe said. \"Oh!\" A scroll popped into the scribe's hands. He looked down at it. \"A message from your sister.\" The scribe handed it to Kela.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just a message, correct? It will not be a repeat of earlier, will it?\" Kela asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it was sent by spell, so it should be safe,\" the scribe said. \"Master Xarlet could probably send a magical scroll, but I doubt he'd bother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKela looked at the scroll in her hand.</span></div></div>",

Word of your accident is all over the palace. Mother was rather amused. I think perhaps she would have preferred another daughter over a son. Father was livid, however. Really, I had thought you would be more careful around magical artifacts. Did you forget that time you feed my prized dressage horse magical chicken feed? I certainly have not. Suddenly finding a giant chicken in your stable on the morning of the kingdom's largest equestrian competition is not an experience I wish to repeat. There are still some who impudent fools who dare call me the featherbrained princess behind my back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I digress. Mother and Father wished to recall you immediately, but I convinced them to give you a chance. I wanted to spare you the humiliation of returning home both a failure in your mission and a woman. Despite of what you have done in the past, I'm still looking out for you. Though it is a sight I am unwilling to miss. Which brings me to the reason for this message. I am leaving for Traeven in the morning. I expect to arrive in 4 days time. I have handled all the arrangements via message so you don't have a thing to worry about beyond looking your prettiest for my arrival. I am so looking forward to seeing my dear sister in attire fitting for a princess. It may be a selfish request, but I have always been found of lavender and would love it if you were wearing such a gown when I arrive. Perhaps with white lace?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI should not need to remind you after the events of the day, but do be careful around magic. After all, I would hate to think what would happen if your transformation were permanent. Though I am told under Traeven law it will not effect your status, our own may lead to some issues regarding succession to the throne. Still, I doubt Princess Fia will be eager to marry another woman, even if you were considered a man by law. Perhaps she would allow you to serve as her maid. I was told that almost happened. If you were unable to change back, I suppose I would have no option but to do my duty and take the throne for myself. Father would be displeased, but I think mother would be happy. I think my first act will be to change the rules of succession. I see no reason why an elder sister should be second in line behind her younger brother.

Even now her plans were the same, add Traeven to Grovan's growing empire. Marriage to Princess Fia was the easiest way, but conquest would be fine too. Already the guards that had accompanied her were likely transformed and probing the castle for weaknesses to be exploited. Yet here was this maid calling her nice. \"Well, if she already sees me this way, I might as well go with it. She may prove a valuable informant,\" Kela thought to herself. \"Think nothing of it. There was no privileged information discussed. Though it may be unwise for you to continue to eavesdrop on private conversations. One day you may overhear something that will get you in trouble.\" Kela patted Elista on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Right!\" the maid replied, slightly flustered. \"If you don't mind, princess, can I ask one thing? Dressage chicken?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKela giggled then immediately stopped herself. \"You know of dressage horses, do you not?\" The maid nodded. \"My sister is quite renowned in Grovan for her dressage skills. The royal stables also breed the finest competition horses. Naturally, she was favored to win. I may have quite accidentally given my sister's prized horse Anne magical feed which turned her into a horse sized chicken.\" Kela held back laughing. \"Still it is a testament to my sister's skills and the quality of Anne's breeding and training that my sister was still able to claim victory. It was quite a sight to behold. An actual dressage chicken event using similarly transformed horses was organized, but it did not go well. It seems chickens do not make disciplined mounts regardless of their stature.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElista broke out laughing. \"Ahahaha I'm sorry princess, but that's too much! Ahahaha\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My sister was not quite as amused,\" Kela replied. \"I don't believe she has ever lived that down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about your sister's horse though? Is she still a chicken?\" Elista asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The very next day,\" Kela explained. \"She has since been breed. Two of her foals have become prized dressage horses as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maid gave a sigh of relief. \"That's good. I was afraid she'd have become a meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would never have happened, even if her horse couldn't change back,\" Kela said. \"Grovan has long prided itself on its fine horses and calvary. To do such would be considered an insult to the kingdom's honor. In fact all nobles are expected to be accomplished riders of some sort. I was quite an avid fox hunter until my sister transformed my hounds. After that, I could not help but think the fox being hunted was one of the three I couldn't find to change back. After those incidents we were forbidden to as much as speak to Xarlet, Grovan's magician, without permission. Our parents feared escala....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKela stopped as she heard heavy footsteps approaching the two of them. The sound of clanging metal reverberated with each step. The sound drew closer, until a man in full plate armor, trimmed with gold accents and polished to near mirror shine. He carried a helmet under his arm. Long, flowing locks of blond hair reached down to his shoulders, framing his rugged face. \"What luck, I had heard there was a lovely new flower in the castle. I am Captain Dioral, quite pleased to make your acquaintance.\" He bowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I am Princess Kela of Grovan,\" Kela replied. She gave a quick curtsy, as best as she could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"To think such a dense thicket of thorns could produce a rose of such beauty,\" Dioral said, while looking at Kela's chest. He took her hand, leaned down and kissed it. \"Though I had thought Grovan had but Princess Orianna and Prince Kelos.\" His eyes darted right for a moment, then came right back to center. He then flashed a knowing grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I am Prince Kelos' twin sister,\" Kela stated. She attempted to pull her hand back, but Dioral held firm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let go of her!\" Elista shouted as she intervened, quickly prying Kela's hand out of the captain's grip. The two looked at the maid in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Insolent servant, what is the meaning of this!\" Dioral shouted after recovering from his shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- uhh I was... I mean\" Elista stammered, more shocked by her actions than anyone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will see to it that you will spend the rest of your days cleaning the stables for this!\" Dioral fumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough!\" Kela yelled stepping in front of the maid. \"You are the insolent one here! She saw you were clearly hurting me and moved to protect me. You will apologize to the both of us!\" She glared at the towering man in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDioral smirked and grabbed Kela's shoulder, pushing her against the wall. \"A feisty one, aren't you? I like that in a woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unhand me, brute! I am a Prince of Grovan and a guest of Princess Fia!\" Kela screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let go of Princess Kela!\" Elista shouted, grabbing the knight's arm. Dioral shoved her with his shoulder, sending the maid flying to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You animal!\" Kela shouted. She punched Dioral with her free hand square in the jaw, knocking his head to the side. He quickly recovered and grabbed her arm to prevent another blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You pack quite a punch for a dainty bud,\" Dioral said, moving his jaw from side to side. \"It seems you have thorns after all. But I suppose my suspicions about you have been proved correct, Prince Kelos. I must say though, I do prefer your current form.\" He grinned menacingly. \"How does it feel, Prince? To be in that weak, frail body, unable to fight back. Unable to protect that girl. Unable to protect yourself.\" A chill ran through Kela as Dioral leaned in and kissed her. \"Tell me, shall I show you how it really feels to be a woman?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKela said nothing and spit in his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose I shall leave it here for today,\" Dioral said. \"Do not worry that pretty little head of yours, I'll forgive your little maid friend too.\" He shoved Kela aside, though she managed to stay on her feet. The armored figure turned and walked away chuckling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKela rushed to the fallen maid's side. \"Elista! Elistia!\" she called out, trying to rouse her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmnnn... Princess Kela...\" the maid said clutching her head. \"Why am I... OH!\" Elista immediately sat up. \"Princess! Are you alright? Did he hurt you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, nothing serious,\" Kela said. She looked to the side. \"That overgrown ape! How dare he! I'll make him pay for this outrage!\" she thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my fault, princess. If I hadn't jumped in like that...\" the maid said apologetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you did nothing wrong. He's the one who decided to act like a savage,\" Kela said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose, but... OH!\" Elista stood up suddenly. \"Your dinner with the princess! You need to get ready!\" She quickly led Kela to her room and helped her prepare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, I was beginning to wonder if I had been stood up as the commoners call it,\" Princess Fia said, as Kela arrived slightly late. She looked at the silk emerald green gown Kela was wearing. \"But I suppose you had trouble picking out your gown. I must say you chose well, Princess Kela. It compliments your hair nicely. You look very beautiful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, but I let Elista pick it out,\" Kela replied. \"Gown selection was not the reason I'm late.\" She recounted the events since their parting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That brute!\" Princess Fia exclaimed. This was the first time Kela had actually seen her angry. \"To think he wold assault my bride knowing full well who she is!\" Fia breathed in and then exhaled. \"I should have him in irons! However, he has my father's ear, so it is not possible to punish him unless my father permits it. I do not intend to let him get away with this transgression!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nor will I!\" Kela replied. \"I will never forgive him for this humiliation! If I were still a man I would challenge him to a dual!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A dual of honor? I'm sure my father would approve,\" Princess Fia stated. \"Perhaps you could simply wait until you return to your normal form, princess Kela?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If there are no other options, but I'd rather not wait,\" Kela said. \"He may try something else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dislike suggesting this, but would it not be possible to return to a man sooner? I'm positive our court magician, Marlin could make you a potion,\" Princess Fia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been told mixing magic can have unpredictable effects,\" Kela said. \"I would rather not risk it. Although you may be on to something...\"</span></div></div>",

Surely by now he would have informed the king of your identity. She shuddered at the humiliation this would bring. But like many things, it had its benefits. While Dioral would surely scoff at a challenge from a woman, that she was still a man under law would give it weight. Even if he turned it down, it would cause him shame. Surely he could not refuse in front of the King, and if by chance he did, it would be victory in itself. She breathed deeply and clutched the vial in her hand. It had surprised Kela how easy it was to convince Marlin. Surely Xarlat would have demanded a favor, but Marlin simply made the potion. Now is the time to use it. She burst through the door and shouted \"I have come to challenge Captain Dioral, knight of Traeven to a duel of honor!\" The entire room turned to Kela. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDioral smiled smugly, \"What an honor it is to see you again, Princess of Grovan. Though this is hardly the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impudent woman! How dare you interrupt this meeting with your foolishness!\" one of the advisors, a middle aged, thin man with a bushy mustache yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is alright,\" King Arthras said. He looked over to Kela. \"Captain Dioral has told me of your identity, Prince Kelos.\" He said in a gruff voice. \"I have yet to reach a decision on your status. By our own laws you would have all the rights and privileges of a man. Still, your transformation took place outside of the castle. You presented yourself as a woman, and my advisors have told me under your own laws you would be considered one. An argument has been raised you should be held to that. Either way, I did not offer you the hospitality fitting for visiting royalty. For that I am willing to overlook this intrusion. Your reason for it, however, leads me towards the latter conclusion, if only for your own protection. Surely you understand that with your current body if this duel were to occur it would be with your defeat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed,\" Dioral added. \"Our encounter last night should serve as ample proof.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am aware I am not a match for him physically. It is why I have procured this!\" Kela held up the potion, grinning. \"This potion shall transform Dioral into a woman as well, denying him a physical advantage of simply having a male body. It will ensure a fair contest to be decided by our skills.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany of the adviser chuckled at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I drink a potion given to me by a Grovanian?\" Dioral replied, waving his hand dismissively. \"It is likely just poison.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can assure you it is not,\" an old man with a long white beard and a deeply wrinkled face said. \"You see it was I who made that potion. It will indeed transform you into a woman to ensure a fair contest. I can assure you it has not been tampered with either. I can tell when my potions have been opened on sight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I ask why you would assist our guest in this?\" King Arthras said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seemed amusing,\" the wizard replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am under no obligation to accept a duel from a woman,\" Dioral said smugly. \"Do go have tea and discuss dresses with Princess Fia and leave the men to their business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, to think the famed Dioral is a coward,\" Kela replied with a faked sigh. \"I suppose I cannot blame you. You are quite right to be fearful of facing me in an even match. I am, after all quite accomplished in martial skill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is not fear,\" Dioral replied. \"You ask quite a bit from me, to become a woman for the sake of a duel? I need stakes to make it worth my while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will return to a man, provided you win. Or at least survive,\" Kela said. \"Your own court magician will surely see to that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is not quite sufficient. You get honor if you win, but what do I get? Return to a man? That is only necessary if I accept,\" Dioral grinned smugly. \"I do have a proposal though. If I win, you shall renounce your claim to manhood and become my wife!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your wife?!\" Kela asked in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surely your honor is worth such a wager,\" Dioral said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose it is,\" Kela replied. This was unexpected. While she thought it unlikely, there was a chance she could lose. To live her life as a woman, to be mounted by this brute, to bare his children? The thought made her sick. However, to back down now would be his victory. There was still one more card she could play though... \"Indeed, but it was not solely my honor you tarnished last night. You struck a maid who was merely trying to defend a guest. The terms should reflect that as well. I agree to your terms, but in exchange you must agree to atone for that and live as a woman, serving as a maid!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, I shall accept your terms, if it is ok with the king. His Majesty might object to his finest warrior being reduced to a mere servant,\" Dioral said with confidence. He was either sure of victory or sure Arthras would not allow this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is interesting, so I will allow it,\" King Arthras said. Dioral looked disappointed for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well then, give me the potion,\" the knight said. Kela walked towards him and handed it to him. Dioral popped the cork and drank it. Immediately his already long hair began to grow even more. Within moments it was down to his knees. His skin began to soften and his rugged face began to take on feminine proportions. His armor turned to cloth, as his body shrank down to a mere 5'2\", His bulk decreased as his body began to reshape itself. His formerly muscular arms and legs were now thin and girlish. Two mounds appeared on his chest, forming modest B cup breasts. His waist narrowed and his hips widened. His penis contracted into his body and her new vagina formed. Finally his clothes reshaped themselves, forming a flowing pink gown. She seemed to get slightly taller as high heels formed on her feet.  A matching bow appeared in her hair which arranged itself into a long braid. Dioral looked herself over. \"This is different,\" she said in an alluring voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My clothes didn't change when I was transformed,\" Kela commented. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not wish to cause unnecessary humiliation in my vict... clients,\" Marlin replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have accepted your terms!\" Dioral said in her new, feminine voice. \"Now as is customary, I, the challenged shall decide the form of the duel! I have decided on...\"</span></div></div>",

How is that even a duel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was you who wished to duel in these bodies, Princess,\" Dioral said tracing her figure with her hands. \"If we are to duel as women, let us do so as women would. Plus, I would not wish to leave an unsightly scar on my soon to be wife.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your concern is noted, but most unnecessary. I assure you I would not be blemished by the likes of you,\" Kela said smugly. \"Though if you insist on this farce, I can think of no better judge than Princess Fia. Who would know more about beauty than her?\" Surely the princess would decide in your favor, and Dioral could not refuse her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no objections,\" Dioral said. \"However, I believe King Arthras would also be a fine judge. We should include him as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh but of course,\" Kela agreed. The king was a wildcard. He might be a fair judge, but then he might be biased towards Dioral. After all he did have the king's favor. Even if he did, that would likely result in a tie. Likely an acceptable outcome, but not a desirable one. Something must be done to tilt the situation in your favor. \"Though two judges raises a possibility of a tie. I think it unlikely, as I shall surely win, but it would be troublesome. I propose a third and final judge.\" The problem is who to suggest. Your sister comes to mind, but she might decide against you to get you out of the way so she can inherit the throne. Still, it's likely you could work out a deal with her. Plus, you're sure Dioral intends this to be over soon. He'd be stuck as a girl for a few days until Orianna arrives at least. There's also Marlin. He'd almost certainly be fair, and it would be likely Dioral would agree. The trouble is he would almost certainly be fair. This means giving Dioral a chance of victory.</span></div></div>",

Then it is settled, at the setting of the sun three days from now there shall be contest between Princess Kela and Sir...pardon me, Lady Dioral with honor, duty, servitude, and manhood on the line.  There shall be three judges and therefore there shall be three categories fitting of a duel between women.  These challenges will be in Grace, Beauty, and Judgement.

If I suspect any fowl play between the two of you, a judgment shall be rendered immediately by myself and you do not want to try my patience on this matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos cursed to under his breath, and he could have sworn he heard Dioral do the same.  Neither former men seemed very favorable of fair play and had both seemed to consider underhand tactics to get the advantage.  The King continued on, \"Now the two of you are dismissed, Lady Dioral, until this matter is settled I have no need for your council, go steed yourself for the coming trials.\"  Dioral stopped himself from bowing and curtsied and quickly rushed off.  Kelos could tell the Dioral seemed in a rush to examine his new situation.  The King did not acknowledge Kela, so you simply curtsied yourself and left with a smile on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe your luck, you'd practically already won!  You have the two votes in the form of Fia and Orianna.  Sure there was a slight risk of Orianna betraying you for personal gain, but if she did surely she knew mother and father would never forgive her for turning on their only son and heir to the throne.  But winning 2-1 would be nice, but winning 3-0 and utterly humiliating Dioral in the process would be better.  You'd hoped to maybe sever a tendon or two in her sleep but the King made it quite clear that wouldn't be tolerated.

Kelos went back to Princess Fia's quarters to discuss the situation.  She greeted him quite exuberantly as immediately hugged him.  \"I can't believe you convinced my father to let your own sister be the third judge.  That guarantees that you'll turn back and that dastard Dioral will be put in his place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos was just as excited as Fia but chase to overly compose himself and said, \"Yes, quite.  It is indeed a boon for us, but that doesn't mean I can just slack off.  I should still train to best present myself so that my victory will not seem to be rigged.  The challenges are Grace, Beauty, and Judgement correct?  Do you know exactly what these will consist of so that I may better prepare?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have already discussed the contest with my father.  Beauty is obvious, you just have to stand there and be beautiful.  Physically you have the leg up on Dioral, but your physical beauty won't be enough.  You have to exude feminine beauty, if you wear a the most beautiful gown in the world and you go stomping around like a solder to war you will lose.  Grace will be much like beauty, but instead of just standing about being judged you will have to perform a task, display a talent of sorts.  And finally the judgement portion will be a question and answer session where the 3 judges will ask you and Dioral a question each and depending on how you answer, so may go the competition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well my future bride, for you I will become the most beautiful and elegant woman in the kingdom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe after me.\"  Fia approached Kelos and kissed him on the cheek, \"For luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My love, luck is one thing that I will not need.\"  Kelos said as he left to begin training.</span></div></div>",

When she had last seen Dioral, the former captain was still having trouble walking in heels without falling on her face. Kelos smiled at the thought of her impending victory as she exited the castle, then elegantly walked down the flight of stairs leading to the courtyard as her sister's carriage pulled up. King Arthras wasn't there, but Fia was, serving to officially greet Orianna. One of the maids directed Kelos to Fia's side. Kelos smiled at Fia, who returned it, and gave her hand a gentle squeeze. Orianna's carriage came to a stop, and the guard riding next to the driver dismounted and opened the door for the princess, who stepped out and immediately focused on Kelos, a wicked grin on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFia stepped forward. \"Princess, Orianna, it's my honor to welcome you to castle Traeven on behalf of my father, King Arthras.\" She then gave a polite curtsy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Princess, Fia,\" Orianna replied curtsying. \"As First Princess and heir to the throne of Grovan,\" She paused and looked over at Kelos with a smirk, \"I humbly accept your welcome, and I look forward to an eventful stay here in Traeven.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos breathed deeply and tried to not let Orianna's statement get to her. After all, it was technically true while she was in the form. Orianna then turned to Kelos, and stood there, waiting. Kelos also stood looking at her older sister for a moment, before it occurred to her, she was second princess right now. As the younger, it was her place to curtsy first. She did so. \"Thank you for coming and agreeing to be a judge, Orianna,\" Kelos said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd do anything for my dear <i>little sister</i>,\" Orianna said bitingly, returning the curtsy. \"You've become such a fine, elegant <i>lady</i>.

He was merely Orianna's 'little sister' now and if he wanted her vote, Kelos would have to tolerate her verbal jabs.  \"Oh my dear loving sister you do tease so mercilessly.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a few final hours of preparation with Fia including Kelos finalizing his makeup, hair, dress choices, and jewelry selection, it was time for the challenge.  Fia gave Kelos a quick kiss for luck and left to meet with fellow judges King Arthur's and Kelos' sister Princess Orianna.  Kelos spent his last minutes of solitude working on his flowing movements and making sure he looked just as beautiful and elegant as the girl of his dreams.  Kelos smiled as she saw herself in the mirror.  With his ego Kelos had to admit he found himself even more attractive than Fia, although he would never say that aloud for his own safety and embarrassment.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos was broken from his admiration of his own form by a knock on the door, Kelos put on a large elegant robe over her body to hide her dress for the Beauty part of the contest.  Once she felt covered Kelos called \"Come in,\" and in came the maid who had been so kind to him when he was still hiding his identity, Elista.  \"Princess Kela, I mean, Prince Kelos, I mean...oh dear.  They are ready for you.\"  Elists said with a nervous curtsy.  Kelos put her arm upon the maid's shoulder, \"Thank you, lead the way.\"  It felt like a long walk even though it was just going down to the Great Hall.  Elista opened the door and Kelos saw the arena.  There was a long elevated walkway and at the end at the end were the three judges in their own thrones with the wizard Marlin standing to the side.  Kelos walked up some stairs onto the walkway where Dioral was already waiting in a body covering robe of her own.  King Arthur's waved to the contestants, \"Approach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos and Dioral began the walk down the long walkway, as they walked Dioral spoke under her breath, \"I look forward to seeing what you've put on for me my future wife.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can look at it all you want as you clean it when you're a lowly maid.\"  Kelos reply moving her lips as little as possible.  With false smiles the two competitors made it to the judges.  Marlin took a step forward and unraveled a scroll as he cleared his throat to speak.  \"This contest of beauty between Princess Kela of Grovan and Captain Dior...ella of Traeven will take place in three rounds.  The first round will be Beauty, which if you ask me you both excel at.\"  King Arthras gave a glare and made a fake cough noise.  Marlin went back to reading, \"Oh yes right, the second round will be Grace where you will both compete in a mini obstacle coarse of my creation.  The final round will be Judgement.  You will both be asked one question and your response will be judged by the uh, judges.  Each judge will give one point to a competitor each round.  The first to 5 points wins.  If there are no questions, then let the first challenge begin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the cue Kelos proudly stepped forward and removed his coat.  There was an almost magical glow that radiated from Kelos when she dropped the coat.  The flowing satin gown was a bright gold and showed off the slender shoulders of Kelos.  Kelos also wore white silk gloves that went all the way up her arms.  Kelos radiated such beauty that all of the judges and even Dioral had their jaws open.  With a smile and a flourish Kelos politely curtsied and went back by Dioral.  Kelos whispered, \"Good luck following that up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDioral seemed to take a few seconds to regain composure but smiled back, \"Oh I will.\"  Dioral walked up to the judges and dropped his robe.  And this time it was Kelos who's jaw dropped.  There before the judges was Dioral wearing absolutely nothing.  With a strange confidence that Kelos would never have thought someone would have to gall to even attempt Dioral stood before the judges in all her beautful nude glory with breasts bouncing freely, a butt so bare it was practically reflecting Kelos' gold dress.  It seemed the only effort Diroal had put into the beauty section was minor grooming.  With a smile Dioral picked up her robe and without even putting it back on walked confidently back to Kelos.  \"Have you no shame.\"  Kelos spat, \"No but I will have a pretty little wife by sundown.\"  Dioral sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlin stumbled forward, \"Um, if the judges could please give their first round scoring.\"  Fia of course voted for you, Arthras to no one's surprise voted for Dioral.  And then came Orianna's vote, \"It's a very difficult decision but I have to vote for Dioral.  She is obviously much more confident in her natural beauty then my little sister who must compensate with fancy trinkets.  It's a little sad really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took every bit of poise in Kelos to not just shout out that this was a joke of a contest, but he held back.  There were still 2 rounds, even down 2-1 Kelos knew he could still win.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next round began immediately.  Marlin snapped his fingers and the walkway Kelos and Dioral were on began to shift.  Where there had once been a long straight pathway was a winding path with pits of water, swinging blades, and rotating sections.  This was nothing that both combat trained men hadn't seen before, but as women it could prove to be tricky to get through the course gracefully.  Marlin spoke, \"You must get through the course as quickly and as elegantly as possible, the judges will reward your performance.  And to prevent an unfair advantage Dioral, I'm going to have to insist that you wear high heels for this.\"  Both Dioral and Arthras looked angry to hear this news but Dioral didn't complain aloud.  As Dioral put on her heels Kelos went ahead and glided through the corse.  Even will wearing the elegant golden gown Kelos did not stutter for even a moment and had circled around before Diroal could even begin.  But begin he did and it did not look pretty.  Apparently Diroal's nudity choices was coming back to bite her, because without something to contain her massive chest she was knocking herself off balance and even fell of the platform once.  When Dioral finished they were met with their scores.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe King still stubornly gave the point to Diroal meekly saying he thought Dioral looked better.  Fia did what she needed to and voted for Kelos.  And then came Orianna's vote, \"Oh sister you have proven to be more graceful and feminine then even me and Princess Fia here, you've rightfully earned the point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos beemed, the score was tied 3-3.  And what's more it looked like Orianna was really playing fairly by her own twisted standards.  Kelos knew that he would have to answer the final question very carefully in order to win her favor so that he could win.<br>\r\nMarlin once again took the stage, \"For the final challenge the judges with ask a single question to both competitors.  Dioral, you will go first.  Dioral stepped forward and King Arthras asked, \"What do you feel is a woman's place in society in this age?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDioral bowed to her King and said, \"A woman's place is to obey her husband and be at his beck and call.  It is her duty to birth his children and raise them.\"  Dioral and the King seemed satisfied with the answer and Kelos felt a chill down her spine.  <i>So that is my fate if I lose.  No, it won't, I can not lose.  Dioral will eat those words when he is a maid for life.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos stepped forward for the question that would define his life as a prince or as a captain's wife.  To his surprise it was Orianna who asked the question, \"My dear loving sister.  I have come up with a very important question about what you find important in life.  My question is, should you turn back into a man, would you be willing to abdicate the throne of Grovan to me if that was the only way to marry Princess Fia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos cursed his sister in his mind.  So this was her game, she may be willing to help him turn back into a man, but she will either try to get his birthright or drive a wedge in between himself and Fia.  Orianna smiled and Fia looked very curious as Kelos stood silent, \"Well little sister, what is your answer?\"</span></div></div>",

Now since we have calmed down, princess fia it is your turn to ask our competitors your question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then\" said fia, clearly still a little shanken up from the previous events. \"If you are stuck as a women for the rest of your life what do you plan on doing with your life?\" And you already knew what dioral's answer was going to be as per the rules. Dioral stepped up and spoke, voice still shaking from being yelled at by her king. \"If I am to remain female then I will follow the stipulation that was set and spend the rest of my days as a maid.\" Dioral said, biting his lip on the way back. It was kelos' turn to go up. \"A lot like lady dioral I will be fulling the my portion of the completion and become the wife of the head captain and fulfill his every need.\" Kelos spoke with confidence and walked back feeling confident in his words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright to make our decisions princess orianna you may go first since you are our guest.\" Said king athras cordially, having calmed down from earlier. \"Thank you king athras, now I am proud to say that, sister, you get my point for that amazing show of love.\" Orianna says with pride. \"I also give my point to princess kela, how about you father.\" Said fia looking towards her father. \"I give my vote to,\" the king stopped and took a large gulp, \"princess kela.\" The king almost choked on his own words. \"I announce princess kela the winner and lady dioral to remain female for the rest of her days and that she also remain a maid no matter what.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over at dioral and see anger and fear start to well up in her soon to be permanent face almost a little sad for her, but then you see her start something.</span></div></div>",

She looked her sister in the eyes, and saw the smug grin on her face. There must be a way to knock her down a peg, but that question seemed perfectly designed, forcing her to pick one of two damaging answers. Still, she remembered something her mother had told her once, how you say something can be more important than what you say. With little other way out, this seemed like a good time to try it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos inhaled and began to speak. \"A wise man once said, 'The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, or the one.'\" She looked at Fai then continued. \"I love Fia, and can't imagine what life would be without her at my side. If this were just about the two of us, the answer is obvious, I would pick Fia over 1000 thrones. However, the throne itself is not what's at stake. In the end, it's just a fancy chair. Sitting on the throne, however, brings with it the responsibility for all the people of the lands, and it is those people who are important. So while I might never be complete without Fia at my side, my duty is clear, to take the throne.\" Kelos turned to Orianna. \"I believe I would be a better ruler than you, Orianna, and the people deserve the best ruler available, even if the price is losing Fia's heart. As long as I believe that, I will not abdicate the throne for you. Even if I were to remain a woman, I will still challenge your claim to the throne. There is only one thing that will make me abdicate, convince me that you would be the better ruler.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't sound like your future husband will let you, my dear little sister,\" Orianna said bitterly. \"The people are what's important? Please, spare me from your wild fantasies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's exactly why I'd be a better ruler,\" Kelos replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this last round has certainly been more exhilarating than any of us had expected,\" Marlin said, retaking the stage, interrupting the sisterly squabble before if could get out of hand. \"It's now time for the judges to render their final decision and determine the winner of this contest!\"</span></div></div>",

Fia spoke first.  \"Kelos, you have shown me that you have a stronger and more admirable heart than even I thought going into this contest.  I vote for you to win, but no matter what happens I will always believe you are more of a man than Dioal ever will me.\"  Fia turned her attention to the still nude and proud Dioral, \"And as for you.  If you lose and I had my vote you wouldn't deserve to even be human anymore you vile pig.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos smiled at Fia's words, but neither him nor Dioral flinched, her vote after all was guaranteed to be his.  Next to stand came Orianna, Kelos held his breath as a deciding vote took place.  \"Oh those are very admirable words little sister.  But they are words of a naive little girl who lives in her own dream world.  It's time to come back to the world dear little sister.  I'm sure you will make a good wife, I cast my vote for Dioral.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was odd, Kelos felt that Orianna had sealed his...no, her fate with that vote.  He'd never be a man again and he was now going to be bound for life to this bastard Dioral.  Kelos felt that he should kick and scream and cry at the results, but maybe the last week as a woman and with Fia's mentoring had actually changed him.  Kelos was going to face this horrific fate with her head held high and she didn't know how but she would fight back against this and somehow turn this bad situation on it's head.  Kelos felt herself being snapped back to reality by a slap on the butt by her competitor.  \"It was only a matter of time my bride.  Marlin, turn me back this instant.  I'd like to get married as soon as possible so we can celebrate my victor in my chambers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlin sighed and reached for a potion in on his belt when there was a commanding voice stopping him, \"I believe I still haven't cast my vote yet Marlin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe King had stood up.  In all of this everyone had seemed to forget that Arthras still hadn't cast his official vote for Dioral yet.  Dioral laughed and half heartedly bowed, \"Forgive me my King I got a bit ahead of myself.  If you would please make my victory official.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe King of Traeven surveyed the room and began to speak, \"Over her lifetime I have tried my best to protect my daughter from the evils of the world.  And up until now, seeing the amazing woman she has become I feel like I've done a good job.  But there is something I fear I have not realized until today.  She is not just my little girl, she is a woman.  And what's more a wise woman, like her mother.  Fia, you understood this absurd situation much better than I did and saw goodness in a man whom I judged based on his homeland.  For that I apologize to both you and Prince Kelos and hope you can forgive me.  But Kelos your words today have shown the light and shown me how wrong I was.  Therefore I do what I should have done the first two rounds and cast my vote for Kelos.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the room was stunned.  Fia actually screamed in surprise, Orianna actually was so stunned her jaw was open, Marlin almost dropped the potion (but thankfully for Kelos' gender he did not, Kelos actually went to her knees and relief, and Dioral...did not take it well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiroal went to her knees and begged, \"But no, my King.  This wasn't the plan, we were going to show that Grovan brat what we think of scum.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthuras looked at Dioral with pure contempt, \"I can't believe I ever let a brutish fool like you be one of my elite men.  You make me ashamed to be a man, maybe you'll make a better woman.  Although you're not off to a good start.  Put on your maids uniform <i>Deloris</i>, you look like a tart and I will not have you embarrassing Castle Traeven any further.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe newly named Deloris, seemingly aware for the first time how he was currently a naked, beautiful, and vulnerable woman in the middle of a small crowd for the first time tried tried to cover herself with a little squeel of embarrassment.  She ran away out of the room, pushing past Fia who was running towards Kelos.  Fia helped her love her his feet and said, \"I knew you'd win.\"  And kissed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kiss went on for what felt like minutes to Kelos even though it was only a few seconds before being interrupted by a tap on the shoulder.  It was Marlin waving a thick red potion in his hand, \"As wonderful a sight as your current form is I thought you might prefer...\"  Kelos didn't hesitate as he grabbed the potion before Marlin could finish his thought and drank it.  The effects were immediate, Kelos felt a churning in his stomach and his whole body began to vibrate.  He felt his breasts ripple and sink back into his chest.  His long hair fell out and his former short locks were regrown in an instant.  And most importantly for Kelos, he could feel his manhood return and still off the high of Fia's kiss it was at full attention as anyone who looked could tell from the dress he still wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos looked to the wizard with a little bit of annoyance, \"You couldn't have changed my clothes as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Marlin could answer Fia pulled Kelos' attention back to her, \"I think it makes you glow.\"  And she kissed her love once again.</span></div></div>",

She wasn't doing a particularly good job of cleaning leaving dust and smudges everywhere, but whenever she came across the King, Kelos, Fia, or Marlin all he would do was beg to transform back.  But his begging would fall on deaf ears as they would always brush her off and tell her to get back to work.  Deloris realized that begging wouldn't work so she tried to use her cunning to ruffle up some feathers.  She tried to use her body to her advantage and actually tried to seduce Kelos in order so that Kelos would fall out of favor with he King and Fia in an attempt to win favor to transform back.  And while the happy to be male again Kelos was tempted by the desperate beauty, Fia was not as she interrupted this attempted seduction and kicked Deloris out of the castle for good.  While on the street Deloris eventually found work as a barmaid at a local tavern.  A few years later while drunk she had a very special night with a local hunter and ended up pregnant.  But the hunter had honor and took Deloris for his bride.  She spent the rest of her days barefoot and pregnant raising the hunters children.  Just like a woman should, at least according to what Dioral once said what seemed a lifetime ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Arthras of Traeven saw the happiness of Kelos and Fia and was happy to welcome Kelos to the family.  He would rule for a few more years before deciding it was time to leave the kingdom to their rule.  One dark night Arthras went to Marlin and after he whipped up a little disguise potion Arthras left the castle under a magical disguise and spent the rest of his life among the his people.  He lived many different lives for weeks at a time before settling down as a hunter with some bar wench he had a magical night with.  They lived a modest and dare I say happy life.  Although Arthras could never quite shake this feeling that he had met this girl before in some previous life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon the marriage of Fia and Kelos the kingdoms of Grovan and Traeven seemed ready to unite under one flag, but because the union was so amiable, it was decided the two nations would continue to stand on their own with Kelos and Fia ruling over Traeven leaving Grovan to eventually be led by Orianna.  Within a year of Orianna's assent to the throne, Grovan experienced it's worst economic turn in the nations history.  Drought and disease spread throughout Grovan, even if maybe she wasn't directly to blame, she was unable to quell the storm.  Grovan only survived by the generosity of it's former prince Kelos and the power of Traeven.  Generations later Orianna would be remembered as the Queen who almost doomed the nation and Kelos and Fia were remembered as it's saviors.  A thought that drove Orianna mad for the rest of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Fia and Kelos, the two of them helped bring about a golden age of prosperity to Traeven.  They would have three children (2 girls and 1 boy) and under their leadership darkness fell, bandit attacks plummeted, and the happiness of the people was at an all time high.  The two's love and respect for each other provided different insights on any problems that came to them and together they would always find the best solution.  They were the picturesque couple in the light.  Although with an assist from Marlin the two's night life was very very interesting indeed and those tales themselves would become legends in their own right.</span></div></div>",

I want to be a pretty princess and marry a prince when I grow up too.</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos looked at the drawing, obviously done by a young child. \"I'll write back to her.\" Kelos said. He put that letter aside and reached in, pulling out a scroll. He examined it in his hand. It was white with a red trim, but otherwise completely unmarked. The prince looked at it suspiciously. \"Is this one of your scrolls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, your highness,\" Sean said. \"I've never seen it before.\"</span></div></div>",

He put it down and reached to his desk drawer, pulling out clear stone. He held it over his right eye, and again picked up the scroll, examining it through the stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that, your highness?\" the scribe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a stone that can be used to detect magic,\" Kelos replied. \"I had Xarlat make it for me after I returned from Traeven.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A wise precaution,\" Sean replied. \"Is the scroll safe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It appears to be,\" Kelos replied with a hint of caution in his voice. He put the stone down, and again stared at the scroll. \"If I hesitate anytime I see a scroll, I can hardly consider myself ready to be king.\" With that he opened the scroll. He blinked, half expecting a flash of light transforming him, however, nothing happened. He looked at the now partly open scroll, only to find it blank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would someone send you a blank scroll?\" Sean wondered aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it was a mistake?\" Kelos replied. He opened the scroll all the way. As soon as he did, writing began to appear on the it. \"This can't be good...\" As the writing fully appeared, a bright flash filled the room. As it cleared, Kelos once again was transformed into a woman. \"Seriously?\" she said with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you just examined the scroll for magic!\" Sean exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoever sent this must have taken great care to hide the magic,\" Kelos concluded. She stood up and examined herself. Unlike the previous scroll, this one changed Kelos' clothing as well. She found she was wearing a pure white wedding dress with intricate lace embroidery that looked like some sort of flower. Her hair was once again red and curly, but done up in a bun beneath a white veil. While there was no mirror in the room, she felt her body and face, finding the proportions familiar. \"I look the same as last time, don't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I believe so,\" Sean replied. \"I must say you're taking this far better than before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have come to realize being angry won't undo the spell. Anyway, this was most likely done by someone who saw me back in Traeven,\" Kelos said. She looked at the scroll again. Now the writing was clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0My lovely Princess Kelos,<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">The world was robbed the day you became a man.

Please accept my twin gifts of it and your renewed femininity.

She placed the veil down, then opened a drawer and began rummaging through a stack of papers. After a few moments she found one, pulled it out and handed it to the scribe. \"This is the formula for the potion Marlin used to cure me in Traeven. Have one of Xarlat's assistants make it. Do not tell Xarlat himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right he'd probably refuse to make a potion Marlin created,\" Sean reasoned as he took the note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly,\" Kelos replied. \"He'd insist on making his own cure, and who knows how long that would take.

What about your other assignment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The guards have intercepted a number of letters containing some sort of magical spell.

The vibration from last time returned as Kelos' body returned to its manly form. Unlike last time, the wedding dress transformed back into Kelos' normal clothing. \"Huh, last time I was still in a dress,\" the prince said, as he examined his body to make sure he was back to normal and was fully satisfied with the results. .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The clothing was not magically transformed before,\" Sean said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose that makes sense,\" Kelos said. \"Now that I'm back to normal...\" Kelos stopped as a weird feeling overcame his body. All of a sudden a flash of light emanated from the prince. Once it passed, Kelos was once again transformed back into a woman, wearing the same bridal gown, complete with the veil and her hair done up in a bun. \"This is getting old...\" She removed her veil and placed it on her desk on top of the first one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps it would be best to consult Xarlat after all,\" Sean said.</span></div></div>",

I'm Kelos' sister! I should be in the front row!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd imagine it's due to your part in attempting to keep Kelos a woman,\" Sean said.

She then noticed what had fallen. \"Why does Kelos have all these hairpins?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... They were in a letter,\" Sean said thinking quickly. \"Prince Kelos has come across quite a few strange ones while looking through the congratulations letters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Orianna replied. \"Tell Kelos to save the odd ones for me to read too.\" She picked up a hairpin and examined it. \"These are pretty nice. I'm going to take a few to use for the wedding.\" she grabbed a few of them and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments after Orianna left, Kelos stepped out of the closet. \"I've been thinking,\" she said. \"Why are there two bridal veils? The potion turned my clothing back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You weren't wearing it at the time,\" Sean said. \"The potion might not be able to affect things that aren't on your person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reasonable, but I wonder if there's more to it,\" Kelos said.</span></div></div>",

Drops of water adorned the bottom of the parchment, moist to the touch. Kelos bit his leap. <i>Tears?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, Kelos would discard this kind of nonsense. But there was something about the scroll... something that intrigued him. The letter talked about Leucina Forest. Leucina Forest was known to be a vast forest that spanned hundreds of kilometers, where many beasts of wild resided. It was located on the edge of the Kingdom of Grovan. An uncharted territory. An unconquered territory. Normally, no one would go there, and Kelos had no memory of ever visiting that place. Yet something stirred deep within him. Something familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on to these for now,\" Kelos briefly stated to Sean as he marched to the throne room. There was something he had to inquire from his father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father!\" Prince Kelos announced as he marched into the throne room. His father was a stern looking man with a military posture, short black, though graying, hair and a trimmed beard hanging from his chin. But underneath that appearance he was quite a jolly old man who loved his wife and his children, as well as the people of his kingdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My boy!\" King Reginald announced as he stood from the throne, his wife Queen Latissa promptly following his movements. He briskly walked up to Kelos and enveloped him in a bear hug. \"How are you doing? Are you preparing for the wedding?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, father,\" Kelos replied. \"Though it has been quite expensive thus far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All the best for my son! All the best!\" He exclaimed, patting Kelos on the shoulder. \"So why have you come to visit this old man today? Want to gaze at the throne you'll be sitting on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's not that,\" Kelos responded. \"I just wanted to ask you a question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead, my boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leucina Forest,\" was all Kelos said, gauging their reactions. Reginald's military training had served him quite well, eliciting just a flinch, yet the gasp that came from Latissa's mouth told Kelos everything he needed to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what about it?\" His father hesitantly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What connection does it have to me?\" Kelos quickly inquired, hoping for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know-\" Reginald began before being cut off by his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's tell him, dear,\" Latissa said, gracefully touching his shoulder. \"I... I think he has the right to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReginald looked at his wife, then at Kelos, then back at his wife again. He sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose now is better than ever,\" Reginald said, steeling himself. \"Son, you may not remember this, but when you were... 7 years of age, I believe, you and Orianna went to Marquis Lodoneusque for a party. Afterwards, when you were returning to the castle, you suddenly disappeared when we were passing near Leucina Forest. Everybody frantically searched for you for three days and three nights, and it was only on the fourth day that you had suddenly appeared at the edge of the forest out of nowhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At the edge? Nothing about the Twin Salas?\" Kelos asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twin Salas? Hmm, I haven't heard of such a name before. But yes, you appeared at the edge of the forest.

How glad am I to see you once more! Listen, we've got quite a problem. You see, someone has threatened to kidnap my boy Kelos\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this not a job for your royal guards?\" Xarlat said, raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have reason to believe that it is a Fairy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing that Kelos could hear was the sound of the air being sucked in through Xarlat's teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A fairy, eh? This is a toughie. A normal fairy is hard enough to stop already. They contain vast reserves of magic energy within themselves. Dragons pride themselves in their magic strength, but truth be told, fairies have a larger mana density than they do. A swarm of faeries can overwhelm a dragon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So a single fairy doesn't present much of a problem?\" Kelos asked inquisitively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was talking about dragons, you ignorant buffoon! Even their small bodies can present a problem to a high wizard such as myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So when the letter stated that his family wants to get revenge, then\u2014\" Kelos began before he was interrupted by Xarlat sucking in his teeth once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Young lad,\" Xarlat smiled bitterly. \"Faeries don't have families. High faeries do. They are nothing alike. High faeries grow to the size of humans, are typically male, though rare cases of females exist, and their magic power dwarfs that of faeries by thousands of times. I'm afraid to say that we're dealing with one right here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it's not good,\" Xarlat added after a brief pause as he noticed the trio of royalties looking at each other. \"Honestly, channeling a barrier is useless at this point. He'll just shatter it like a porcelain vase. And attacking him is useless as well. May as well kill ourselves by bouncing our attacks off his reflection shield. The most we can do is try to mask Kelos' mana signature and hope that it intermingles with that of the city folk and pray that the high fairy gives up and goes back instead of exterminating all of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there nothing we can do?\" Latissa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We would have to call for a high dragon. Two preferably. Or maybe try to find a hero and channel a lesser god into him.\" Xarlat replied, shrugging his shoulders. \"Other than that, there's nothing much that can face a high fairy. They're usually perceived as playful and unintelligible creatures, but make no mistake. According to ancient manuscripts I've searched, they've waged wars with ancient deities before the latter ascended to the heavens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we should do that!\" Reginald yelled, about to lunge for the exit. Xarlat stopped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid both tasks are almost nigh impossible at this point. High dragons are quite self-centered, even if they're intelligent, and do not desire to partake in events related to man, even if they are not on the best terms with the Fae. Even if we teleport to them right now, I very much doubt that one would help, let alone two. And a hero? I have no idea where to find one. Certainly not in Grovan or Traevan, there isn't one there. Perhaps you could seek in other places, but even so... channeling a god, even a lesser one, requires a ritual that only I might know. And I do not have the resources to perform it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReginald raised his eyebrow. \"You mean to say that you want more sources of energy apart from the ones given to you? Does your greed for power know no bounds?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXarlat cackled. \"Well, it's the only choice you have if you want to prevent the death of your young prince right here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would not quite say death. The letter stated that he would take me away.\" Kelos retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Xarlat's turn to raise an eyebrow. \"Take... away...? Ah... I see, I see! So you're talking about that incident all those years ago! No wonder my magic couldn't shatter that spell by itself. It wasn't a fairy's magic, it was a young high fairy's magic. I see, I see. So it was magic that hasn't been quite matured yet back then. Still, this is quite peculiar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's so peculiar about it?\" Reginald scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... how about the fact that high faeries haven't married a human in over 3000 years!\" Xarlat cackled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know?\" Kelos asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, young lad. High faeries might be rare, but they also contain vast amounts of magic power that rival that of high dragons. How do you think those little bodies maintain such vast reserves that equal to that of gargantuan creatures such as high dragons? It's simple, they marry beings with magic signatures that are very similar to theirs to preserve the mana and pass it onto the child. Usually it's among their kin, but sometimes they venture out to marry dryads, nymphs, elfs, and other beings with considerable amounts of magic. But humans? That is simply unheard of! Your prince right here is such a lucky man... or should I say \"bride\" to meet such a gentleman.\" Xarlat said, his cackle resounding louder than ever before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough talk from you!\" Reginald exclaimed. \"My boy Kelos is scheduled to marry our dear neighbor's Princess Fia, not some far flung maggot infested fairy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Reginald stopped to think. <i>What should he do?</i> On one hand, it was much safer to ask for the high dragons to intervene than to allow Xarlat to obtain more magical artifacts that he needed for his ceremony. On the other hand, it was very unlikely that any of the very few high dragons would help him, and he was more likelier to find a hero in the end. Reginald mulled before making his decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guards!\" Reginald exclaimed loudly so that they could hear him from behind the door.</span></div></div>",

After all, he's a high fairy, another decade or two is nothing to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if that works, and I see no reason to think it will,\" Kelos replied. \"It still only puts this off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps, but then you'll have had time to seek out high dragons, or heroes, or whatever,\" Orianna said. \"Or maybe by then you'll actually want to be his bride.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never,\" Kelos stated emphatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you don't have a lot of options here,\" Orianna said. \"The guards might find a hero, and Xarlat might get the ingredients for his little spell, this spell might actually do what it's supposed to, and that might be enough to defeat this high fairy. But that's a lot of mights. My plan leaves much less to chance. Plus, he's acting now because of your impending marriage to Fia. If you assure him that your heart still belongs to him, he might forget about it until you're on your deathbed. Time just doesn't mean the same thing to fae as it does to humans. At least consider it as a backup. Let's say this hero plan succeeds. Then all we need to do is change you back into a man. If it fails, this will give you another chance. You said it yourself, you don't like your future riding on some hero. Plus, even if nothing works, and we can't stop this fairy from taking you, we can rescue you and turn you back into a man. Just a reminder, if this high fairy turns you into a woman, it will likely prove impossible to break.\"</span></div></div>",

I have plenty of others too. I've become quite good at it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos took a deep breath, closed his eyes, and chugged down the potion. He then stood there for a moment. \"Nothing's happening,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not, the potion needs a command to activate,\" Orianna replied with a smug grin. \"It's a pretty impressive piece of work, You can take a potion, then activate it at your convenience. I did tell you what you needed to say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos glared at Orianna. \"Seriously?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup,\" Orianna said. \"Go on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos' glare intensified. \"My beloved elder sister, please make me a pretty girl so I can be your adorable little sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The whole thing,\" Orianna said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I was meant to be,\" Kelos finished. As soon as he did, a mild burning sensation spread throughout his body. His body hair fell out, and his arms and legs slimmed down, losing muscle tone. His hair grew out, longer and longer until it reached his butt, which was reshaping itself to be more feminine. His hips expanded while his waist narrowed, giving him an hourglass shape. Then his breasts began to grow, and grow, larger than the ones he had last time. Kelos looked down as his hands shrank and his fingers slimmed, leaving him with dainty hands fit for a princess. Likewise, his feet shrank more than a third. Finally, he felt his penis and balls retreat into his body, as his, now once again her, ovaries and womb formed inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, I thought she'd be shorter,\" Orianna said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Kelos had been fully transformed, the potion had more work to do. Her male clothes began to reshape themselves. In an instant Kelos found herself wearing a pure white wedding dress. She looked down at her attire. \"Was this really necessary?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. We need to prepare the blushing bride to meet her groom,\" Orianna said. \"Say, if we get past this high elf thing, why don't you stay like this for your wedding to Fia? I'm sure she'll love it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Kelos said coldly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps we should restore Kelos' memory too,\" Latissa suggested. \"It would be more convincing if she actually knew what happened. I mean we don't even know this elf's name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but remember how Kelos acted after coming home,\" Reginald added. \"We do not know what the fairy did. The memories could prove overwhelming. Perhaps with them Kelos might even choose to go with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, too risky,\" Orianna said hastily. \"It's better Kelos not remember what happened to her then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos thought about the situation. On one hand knowing this elf's name would prove most useful in convincing him she actually loved him. On the other hand, who could say how these memories would affect her. It was certainly risky. But why was Orianna so quick in saying it's better to not remember. It seemed suspicious.</span></div></div>",

His visage doesn\u2019t seem to give off\u2026 the aura I\u2019ve heard of in legends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlus he\u2019s in tatters,\u201d Kelos noted, examining him from head to toe. He couldn\u2019t believe that this was the type of man she used to admire in stories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlus he stinks,\u201d Orianna added, which was the truth. He emitted the stench of sweat and grime from his body. Xarlat frowned, disappointed that the nobility would mock the effort of his search in such a way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeroes typically spend their time fighting in forests and mountains,\u201d Xarlat rebutted in a hurtful tone. Even he had some pride. \u201cThey have no need for baths. Or fancy clothing. A sword and a shield is all they need to survive. Or a spear, depending on the hero.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLatissa, who was silent in this conversation, nodded. \u201cThat makes sense. Don\u2019t you think so, darling?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmph,\u201d Reginald turned his gaze away from the unsightly man. \u201cThat\u2019s why I didn\u2019t want to rely on those damn murder-hobos. They lack the tact and grace needed in society.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut dear,\u201d Latissa interjected, scolding him gently. \u201cWe need his help if we are to defeat the high fairy. Will you not please be considerate towards him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right, all right!\u201d Reginald exclaimed, throwing his hands upwards. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what this hero can do about this problem. What is your name, hero?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFlynn,\u201d the man replied, as he picked his nose and flung a booger aside. \u201cPleasure to meet ya, sire.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 suppose,\u201d Reginald hesitantly replied as the stranger scratched his crotch. Kelos was appalled by this action. To think that heroes were such savages, completely different from how they were described in sagas and epics! Looking aside, she noticed that Orianna was also scrunching her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo those problems with those damn high fae arose, eh?\u201d Flynn said, spitting on the castle floor as he said \u2018fae\u2019. \u201cHate those bastards myself, right, but those buggers are damn strong. I want a hefty reward for cleaning out the house of them, sire.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf\u2026 of course,\u201d Reginald had almost violently flung himself from the seat at the stranger when he saw the (probably disease-ridden) saliva hit his beautiful marble floor! It was only thanks to the kind touch of his wife that he restrained himself from doing so. \u201cMoney, jewelry\u2026 we will provide you with ample rewards.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat stuff\u2019s garbage, you hear me,\u201d Flynn responded, waving of his hand as the other reached to scratch his crotch again. \u201cI have no need for that fancy-schmancy stuff. I\u2019m a warrior, sire.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen weapons?\u201d Kelos took over for her father, wanting to take matters into her own hands. \u201cOur coffers are filled with mystical swords, spears, shields, daggers\u2026 you may pick any one you like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah,\u201d Flynn shoved a pinky in his ear and began to scratch it. \u201cMagic is a damn crutch for the weak. A real warrior wouldn\u2019t need no magic, a cold steel blade does just damn fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen what exactly do you wish?\u201d Latissa softly inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wanna have a kid, sires. My sperm has been blessed by them gods to plant a baby in any woman\u2019s belly, even an infertile one, but I had no time in between those damn mountain training sessions.\u201d Flynn blew on the pinky that had just been in his ear, scattering the wax everywhere. Reginald had to stop himself from killing him then and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf\u2026 of course,\u201d Reginald nodded in reply, feeling sorry for the poor girl who would have to bear this abomination\u2019s child. \u201cI am sure that we will find a maiden willing to conceive your... ehem... child somewhere in this kingdom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlynn wrinkled his nose. \"I want my brat to be a hero, not some good-for-nothing sore loser. And hero's kids result from popping the brat into a noble's stomach! Besides, I've already decided on who I want...\" He said, as he pointed at...</span></div></div>",

You agree to have a child with him, after he defeats the fairy, get him to drink the potion, then you take the antidote to return to a man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then our would be father becomes the mother,\" Kelos whispered back. \"I like the concept, but male or female, I don't think I could survive the stench.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure a bath or two...\" Orianna paused. \"or ten, would fix that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm less convinced,\" Kelos said.

Finally she stepped forward and spoke. \"Father, if I may, this is pointless. It's my decision to accept the hero's terms, as it affects me.\" She looked directly at Flynn. \"I understand that fighting a High Fairy is no simple task and deserves a reward commensurate to its scale.

Even now before the royal family of Groven this slob had no qualms with putting his hand down his sorry excuse for pants and scratching himself.  But Kelos gritted his teeth, he felt he had no choice.  Without a hero to protect him from the high fae, he'd surly be taken never to return.  \"Very well Flynn, if having a child with you is the only way to ensure my safety then...that is what must be done.\"  Kelos said this, but in his head he was only hoping that Flynn would say he was just kidding, or perhaps he could go with Orianna's traitorous double crossing plan and have Flynn be the one bearing the child.  But these thoughts would have to wait for later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kelos agreed to having a child with Flynn the room reacted accordingly.Reginald groan in disapproval, his mother Latissa could be seen with a tear running down her face, Orianna seemed to actually be trying to stop herself from vomiting at the thought of Flynn deflowering her 'precious little sister', and Xarlat was laughing with a twisted smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlynn seemed very happy to hear the news of this agreement.  \"That fae is as good taken care of most royal one.  Now I normally ask for half of my payment up front, but in this case, how about we just seal the deal with a kiss.  All in good faith you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took an entire lifetimes worth of training in royal demeanor to not display the disgust he felt at this moment, very reluctantly Kelos curtly nodded and said, \"Very well, if you must.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent.\"  Flynn said as he began to lick his lips, not being afraid to let his loose saliva fly about the room much to Reginald's disgust.  As Flynn stepped closer and closer to Kelos the smell emanated from Flynn somehow got worse and worse.  His mouth seemed to emanate a putrid smell as though he had just eaten his meatl raw just minutes earlier.  Closing his eyes and holding his breath Kelos prepared for the worst as Flynn's face was up against his.  \"To us.\"  Flynn said as Kelos reluctantly offered his lovely lips to the hero who's weirdly warm and almost tingly mouth made contact with Kelos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kiss lasted much longer than Kelos would ever have liked, finally the hero had his fill and backed off finally allowing Kelos to breath.  Kelos was actually feeling light headed after the experience.  In fact he had almost passed out from the stench.  Kelos finally snapped back to the real world when she heard the voice of Flynn whisper something in her ear.</span></div></div>",

A guard saluted, then gestured for the hero to follow him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to be sick,\" Kelos said, as she tried desperately to hold on.

You do understand this deal will mean you must spend at the very least nine months as a woman? That you may lose yourself and become a woman in your heart?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never,\" Kelos replied as she tried to steal herself. The nausea remained, as the foul stench of the hero lingered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kelos, dear,\" Latissa said. \"Your father is only considering the time you will be pregnant. There is still nursing the child once born.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ori...\" Kelos again suppressed vomit, \"Ori and I have a plan.\" He looked at Orianna hoping she would explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right,\" Orianna said. \"If you'll notice, Kelos did not agree to bare or have the child. She promised <u>they</u> would have a child. The wording is important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXarlat chuckled. \"A bold plan of the princesses. But as usual it is incumbent on me to carry it out.

You will not be practicing here?\" Fia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like to do it in private,\" Kela said. \"I do not wish you to hear me until I am fully prepared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well then, I shall have to wait to hear your lovely voice then,\" Princess Fia replied. \"You may use the secondary ballroom for your practice. It should not be in use. Although I am curious, do you wish to cancel your modeling session for more time practicing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It won't be necessary,\" Kela said. \"It will give me an opportunity to rest my voice, so it shouldn't be an issue. Until, then, Princess Fia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Until then, Princess Kela,\" Fia replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKela walked out of the room and started to walk down the hallway, when a voice called out from behind her. \"Princess Kela! Princess!\" Kela turned and saw Elista rushing towards her. She stopped in front of Kela struggling to catch her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elista? What's wrong?\" Kela asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard... the duel,\"' the maid said between breaths. \"For me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not following you,\" Kela replied. \"Catch your breath first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElista spent a few moments following Kela's advice then spoke. \"You challenged Dioral to a duel. You agreed to become his wife if he wins if he'd agree to become a maid if he loses. All for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's she now,\" Kela said smugly. \"But you need not thank me. It was not just for you. My honor had been tainted by that ruffian. But regardless, would you show me to the secondary ballroom? I must practice before the duel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Princess,\" Elista said. \"This way.\" She lead Kela thought he halls of the castle silently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something the matter?\" Kela asked after some time had passed. \"You are not usually this quiet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well... I'm sorry!\" Elista said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What for?\" Kela asked. \"I didn't see you do anything wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.. Yes I did!\" Elista said. \"You're putting everything on the line and I'm thinking such terrible things...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Terrible things?\" Kela asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I should want you to win, but there's a part of me...\" Elista explained nervously as they walked along. \"Well if you win, I'll probably never see you after your visit is over. So part of me was hoping you'd lose. Because if you become Dioral's wife, you'll stay in Traeven.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Kela replied. \"I guess I can't be mad at your reasons. Though I'm sorry to disappoint you. I will win without a doubt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Elista said. \"I want you to win, I really do. But there's that one part of me... Oh!\" She looked up. We're hear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about that,\" Kela replied. \"Look at it this way, you will soon have a new blonde maid to assist you. Anyway, would you get me some water? I'd like to begin practice as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Princess,\" Elista said. She left to fulfill the request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKela entered the room and looked around. \"I suppose I shall start with basic scales,\" she thought to herself.</span></div></div>",

She looked down at the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, did you perhaps lose your voice?\" Fia asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKela nodded sheepishly, then looked Fia in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Fia got up and walked over to Kela. She hugged her tightly. \"Do not worry, Princess Kela. Perhaps if you rest your throat, your voice shall return in time for the contest.\" Fia stroked Kela's fluffy red hair. \"Everything shall be fine.\" Kela rested her head on Fia's shoulder. \"Even if you were to lose the contest, I have no intention of giving you up.\" She held Kela tighter and placed her head on Kela's, causing Kela to blush. \"But for now, you need rest.\" Fia turned and led Kela over to her bed, then sat down gracefully. \"Come, Princess Kela,\" Fia said, patting her lap. \"Here, lay down.\" Kela complied, resting her head in Fia's lap. \"That's good girl. Just relax.\" She looked down and smiled gently at Kela, again stroking her hair. \"Oh, I know, chamomile tea with lemon is perfect for soothing your throat. I shall have a maid bring it.\" Fia tried getting up, but Kela grabbed Fia's sleeve and refused to move her head. \"My, what a spoiled princess you are. Very well, we can stay like this a bit longer.\" Kela smiled and closed her eyes as Fia continued stroking her hair. She soon dozed off. Fia giggled softly at this. \"That's right, just sleep, my lovely Princess Kela.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess?\" Kela said in a raspy whisper as she awoke from her nap. \"My voice is a bit better,\" she thought to herself. Her head was still resting on Fia's lap, but the princess had fallen asleep herself, leaning over to the side, propped up by large pink satin covered pillow. She looked over towards the window and saw that the shadows had not moved much meaning not very much time had passed. On the table was a tea kettle and two cups that had not been there before. \"That must be the chamomile tea,\" Kela thought. \"I wonder if it will really help.\"</span></div></div>",

She raised the fine china to her lips, breathing softly over the cup, as she inhaled the aroma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't the scent that she was used to, however, there were probably other herbs added to help heal her sore throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock at the door stopped her from taking the first sip. Quietly, but quickly she put the cup down. A moan escaped from Fia's lovely plump scarlet lips as she struggled to stay asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKela answered the door, with a finger across her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maid instantly got the message, silently nodding her understanding. She presented Kela a small wooden box, and quietly added that she was here to help Kela with her feminine decorum and bearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKela silently mouthed back 'Thank You', and waved the young girl in. Her love for the princess was strong, but even now she felt tempted by this young girl. It was a prince's prerogative to have a mistress. She dismissed such thoughts, as inappropriate at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down she patted the empty seat beside her, and the maid sat beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your name?\" Kela asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maggie Mae.\" she answered with a smile. She appeared over-awed by the new princess, or perhaps she was imagining her as a manly prince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKela turned her attention back to the box. It was inlaid with intricate patterns and clearly of high quality. It slid open smoothly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck!!\" the words spat from her lips before she could stop herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie Mae shot her a surprised and disappointed look, fortunately she wasn't loud enough to wake Fia. Maggie nodded towards the box, a question clear on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a look of horror on her face, Kela pulled out the item pinched between thumb and forefinger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her hand was a pair of delicate silken panties. Kela's other hand holding a small note folded in four. The creases still visible on the unfolded page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, to hear about your singing practice. Thought you might like to practice wearing these, in preparation.\" At the bottom was Dioral's signature, and three kisses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKela was almost as scarlet as her lips with rage colouring her cheeks.</span></div></div>",

It doesn't take long for the arrogant former Prince to realize that walking was much different between the sexes.  She was used to a walk designed for efficiency, used to cover as much ground as possible quickly, without breaking into a run.  The only variation of walking the Prince understood was a military march, something both Princess and maid vetoed instantly amid fits of giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a humiliating experience for Kela.  Taking the corrections and suggestions from her intended wife and her handmaiden was excruciating.  Learning just how much to sway her new hips, how far to swing her arms, and where and how to place her feet was almost as embarrassing as feeling her new breasts bounce and wobble, and being the one swinging her behind, tracing attractive patterns in the air behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKela spent the morning concentrating on learning this most unwanted skill, diving into her lessons as she had swordsmanship and archery as a youth.  As a precaution and at Maggie Mae's suggestion, she remained silent herself, allowing her voice to rest.  Throughout the morning she continued to sip tea whenever she was thirsty.  She allowed all distractions to slip away, entering what her sword master called a learning trance, quietly concentrating on learning to walk in a new way.  Slowly the worrying aspects of her femininity, the dangerous nature of the contest, and even the humiliation of Dioral's 'gift' fade into the background.  She even manages to ignore the warming sensation in her throat, which she briefly hopes is the tea healing her abused voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie Mae excused herself after a while, and Fia helped to put the finishing touches on Kela's new strut.  The morning wanes and finally Princess Fia pronounces  Kela 'adequate'.  Kela merely grins, having watched herself in the mirror all morning she knows that her walk is now much more than adequate.  As she opens her mouth to thank Fia though, no sound comes out.</span></div></div>",

A very familiar small box. Her eyes flash back to the one which delivered the silken panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorming over, all pretense of lady-like restraint gone. She snatched the box off the cushion. She felt like slapping this stupid girl for taunting her so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lady is very popular.\" the maid sounded genuine if a little afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKela hears the sound of a beautiful voice singing an enchanting song.

A brief apology and thanks were exchanged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Embrace your fate.\" was written on a small card atop the box.

Her hand on top of your own. \"Perhaps, you could come to a compromise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe box opens smoothly, and a small lipstick is revealed along with another small folded note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shouldn't read that...

It horrifies and entrances her, the idea of being on her knees, dominated... controlled... a toy for another's amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe feels a shiver race down her spine, again it is hard to tell arousal from fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe note looks very elegantly written, even to having the letter 'i' topped with a little heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKela allows herself a small smile, at the idea that Dioral is unaware of these soft, feminine touches are already affecting his mind.</span></div></div>",

The thought of what she'd have to do filled her with disgust. However, she certainly needed her voice back. Besides, her objective was to marry Princess Fia from the start. This wasn't quite the way she had pictured things going, but it's still mission accomplished. Plus, it's certainly a lot better than having to pleasure that bastard Dioral. There was really no choice in the matter. Kela looked up at Fia with a determined look, then nodded in agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We shall have you fitted for your wedding gown immediately, Princess Kela,\" Fia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKela's expression turned to surprise as she mouthed the words \"wedding gown?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, after all, a beautiful bride like yourself needs a gown to match,\" Fia replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKela urgently attempted to mouth something else, however, neither Princess Fia nor the magician understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, use this, dear,\" Marlin said, as he retrieved some paper, ink, and a quill from his desk, handing them to Kela.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKela took them, and wrote a note, handing it to Fia. \"But the duel is tonight, we need to get married first so I can get my voice back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That does not leave much time,\" Fia replied. \"I do not believe we can prepare a proper ceremony in time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't we just have a quick marriage?\" Kela asked in another note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That might not work,\" Marlin said. \"The wedding ceremony is necessary to break the curse. Most likely to make it difficult for you to exploit the loophole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKela looked down at the floor, disheartened. Salvation was so close, yet still so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can talk to the king,\" Marlin said. \"Dioral has acted quite dishonorably, so this duel would certainly be postponed, if not called off entirely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not believe it necessary, Princess Kela,\" Fia replied. \"I'm confident you shall still win. Is there not something you can do besides sing?\"</span></div></div>",

He put the scroll down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. My business with you is concluded for now.

The two of them walked in silence for some time before Elista spoke nervously. \"Umm... Perhaps it's not my place to ask this, but is it okay? It was from your sister, shouldn't you have read it? It might have been something official.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was probably just writing to make fun of me,\" Kela explained. \"If it had been official, it would have come from my mother.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that makes sense,\" Elista said. \"But why were both you and the scribe so nervous about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose it won't hurt to tell you,\" Kela replied. \"After all, I'm sure that scribe has already told the king most of it. On the trip from Grovan, Prince Kelos opened a transformation scroll. It is why I have come instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see why you would be worried,\" Elista said. \"But I think Princess Fia is happy to have you here instead. \"She usually dismisses suitors within a few minutes, while she spent all day with you. Though I suppose this will just feed that rumor about her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That she favors... female companionship, so to speak?\" Kela asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I hope it isn't true. As the sole child of his majesty, it is up to her to preserve the royal line,\" Elista explained. \"So no matter what, she will be marrying a man. It's better if the rumor isn't true. I don't want to see Princess Fia unhappy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would hate to think her unhappy as well,\" Kela replied. \"I have become quite...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKela stopped as she heard heavy footsteps approaching the two of them. The sound of clanging metal reverberated with each step. The sound drew closer, until a man in full plate armor, trimmed with gold accents and polished to near mirror shine. He carried a helmet under his arm. Long, flowing locks of blond hair reached down to his shoulders, framing his rugged face. \"What luck, I had heard there was a lovely new flower in the castle. I am Captain Dioral, quite pleased to make your acquaintance.\" He bowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Princess Kela of Grovan,\" Kela replied. She gave a quick curtsy, as best as she could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To think such a dense thicket of thorns could produce a rose of such beauty,\" Dioral said, while looking at Kela's chest. He took her hand, leaned down and kissed it. \"Though I had thought Grovan had but Princess Orianna and Prince Kelos.\" His eyes darted right for a moment, then came right back to center. He then flashed a knowing grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Prince Kelos' twin sister,\" Kela stated. She attempted to pull her hand back, but Dioral held firm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strange that I have not heard of you. I believed we had complete dossiers on your kingdom's nobility,\" the armored knight said. \"Tell me, how is your brother? I heard he had an accident. Truly, such a journey can be quite difficult.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He shall be fine,\" Kela said. She struggled to pull her hand free, yet she lacked the strength to break Dioral's grip. For the first time Kela felt extremely vulnerable in her current form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do hope so,\" Dioral said. \"It would be a shame to see something happen to a man of his stature. I had wished to one day meet him on the battlefield. Though I suppose if he marries the good princess Fia, that will no longer be an option regardless of an accident. I was also hoping to take her hand in marriage myself one day. Perhaps he would be willing to give me yours instead?\" He let go of Kela's hand. \"Until next time, my dear.\" He began to walk away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKela held her hand, sore from Dioral's firm grasp. Elista rushed to Kela's side to look at her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes, there was one more thing,\" Dioral said, turning to face Kela again. \"Would you care to join me for lunch tomorrow, Princess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kelos had never felt so demeaned towards in his life.  This oaf of a captain Dioral had just used his stature and strength to slyly dominate over him and now he dared to ask him to dine.  Kelos knew this because he had done the same thing many times to many young ladies over the years and despised that he was on this end of the exchange.  Every fiber of Kelos' being wanted to simply punch the captain out and be done with it.  However his current form of Princess Kela did not make that an option.  Kelos then thought of just saying no to him, after all it would take wild horses for him to willingly spend more time with Dioral.  But Kelos' male pride wouldn't let him say no.  If he just says no then Dioral just walks away after humiliating the now princess.  What Kalos really wanted to do was to not only defeat, but humiliate this man on the field of battle.  When suddenly a bolt of inspiration hit Kelos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I accept but...\"  Kela said.  And Dioral immediately said, \"Wonderful, I knew that a rose such as yourself would enjoy spending time with...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time the voice of Kela interrupted and stopped the captain mid sentence.  \"You did not let me finish.  I have one condition.\"  Dioral looked confused that there could possibly be another thought in a woman's head after accepting his proposal.  \"My condition is that after we dine, we shall meet on the battlefield.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDioral scoffed, \"I must say I appreciate the fight from the royalty of Grovan, but I could never allow myself to harm you on the field of battle, why I doubt you can even wield a proper blade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for your concern sir captain,\"  Kela said as sweetly as he could through gritted teeth.  \"But I had another field in mind.  The field of the chess board.  Surely the people of your kingdom are not merely all brute force.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of coarse not, we at castle Traeven have the greatest intelligence in all the lands.\"  Dioral said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it's settled, we shall dine then duel.  I am sorry that you never got the chance to battle with the great Prince Kelos, but I hope you will be more than satisfied with a battle of wits with myself.\"  Kela said with as sarcastic a curtsey as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well then, I will make sure there is a chess set ready and waiting for us.\"  Dioral said as he finally walked away.  A smile crept across Kela's lips.  Just a minute ago Dioral had all the power and with the addition of a simple game, Kela had thrown him for a loop and when she crushed him at chess she would have power over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElista meanwhile was frantically was excitedly bandaging Kela's hand that was still sore after Dioral's over aggressive handling.  \"I've never seen anyone speak to the captain like that.  Not even Princess Fia.  She would simply ignore his advances, but you accept them and turn it around.  How exciting, wait til Princess Fia hears of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cocky smile that had been on Kela's face went away imediatly, \"Damn, I fear the princess may not be pleased by accepting that fool's lunch proposal.  But, what is done is done.  Come Elista, help me prepare for my meal with the princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElista took Kela to the room he'd be staying in.  It was much smaller than Kelos was used to, but was pleased to see a large bed in the middle with many feather pillows on it just like he liked it he went over to lie down, but instead of quilts and sheets on the bed the first thing Kelos saw were dress after dress set across it.  \"The princess wanted you to have a wide array of choices for your dinner wear Princess Kela.\"  Kelos curiously took a good look at them all, picturing each on his beautiful body before deciding on a blue gown that showed his cleavage and showed off his feminine arms.  Elista helped him into the dress and led him to the dining area where Princess Fia was already waiting in a blue gown of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A perfect match.\"  Fia said comparing the two princess's dresses from top to bottom, when she came across the wrappings around Kela's hand.  \"Oh my, what has happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos then recounted the tale of his experience with Diorel and after he finished he awaited Fia's response.</span></div></div>",

Think I was born yesterday, do you? The king might not see a girl as a threat, but I know better. Just be glad you're not out in the stables. Now get dressed, girl, you've got a lot of work to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos couldn't argue with that. She didn't mean Princess Fia any harm, after all she was to become Kelos' bride, but a girl turning up instead of the prince must look suspicious. She simply got dressed as ordered. Surprisingly, she didn't have any trouble, Even though it was the first time she had worn a garter belt, stockings, or a bra, it was as if she instinctively understood how to wear them. Though it was a disguise scroll that transformed the unfortunate prince, so perhaps the appropriate knowledge came with the transformation. Kelos made a mental note to ask the scribe at the first opportunity. Fully dressed, she swished her skirt from side to side, finding herself enjoying the feeling of the fabric brushing against her stocking clad legs. Strangely, the maid uniform fit perfectly, as though it were custom tailored for her. She turned to the head maid. \"I'm ready, ma'am, but one question, how did you get my size so perfect?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The good wizard Marlin enchants the uniforms for servants and guards to ensure they always fit just right,\" the matronly woman replied. \"Among other things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Other things?\" Kelos asked worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing to worry your pretty little head over,\" the head maid replied. \"Just some basic enchantments like always staying clean, not tearing, that sort of thing. Trust me, you'll find them a life saver. But enough chit chat, it's time for you to get to work. First, what's your name, girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K...Cally,\" the prince turned maid replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Cally, I want you to dust all the rooms in the west tower,\" the head maid instructed. \"If you see anything that needs polishing take care of that too. There is a supply closet on the landing for each floor in the servant's stairs. If you can't find something, ask another maid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" Kelos replied.

As a noble prince he wasn't unfamiliar with hard work, he'd spend many hours a day studying history and battle strategy with the finest minds of the land and now he found himself scrubbing dirt off of the stone floor in a skirt on his hands and knees.  \"I am better than this, I am better than all of this!\"  Kelos said to himself in the empty tower.  But as not to arise too much suspicion he kept muttering and cursing to himself more and more as he half-assed his way through all the cleaning.  At least he tried to, every time he tried to move onto the next room he would notice a thing out of place, or a smudge on a window and he'd feel compelled to go back and take care of it until every room was spotless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must be some damned magic,\"  Kelos said as he tugged at the magically fitted maid outfit, the head maid had said it contained more enchantments besides fitting his body perfectly, now Kelos was starting to fully grasp what she'd meant.  \"Damn that maid, damn that wizard for making this outfit, and damn that king for making me do this!\"  Kelos said as he polished a rather handsome golden statue of the king.  \"I will show him, and I will get back at him, I don't know how but I will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos finished polishing the statue rather violently and the satisfied with the room, moved onto the last room.  It seemed a bit different than the rest, it's door was rather large and was made of a much finer wood than the rest with a golden outline on the moldings around it.  Curious, Kelos reached out to open the door.  Kelos was surprised by how difficult it was to open, but then he realized 'Cally' must be weaker than he'd realized.  He finally managed to pry it open and once he got a look inside he knew immediately what room he'd come across.</span></div></div>",

Treaven's most closely guarded secrets could very well be documented within. Secrets she could use to help secure Grovan's rule here. All the indignity suffered would be more than worth it for this opportunity. Kelos stepped into the room and looked around. A portrait of Princess Fia when she was a little girl, and a blonde woman, presumably her mother, the late Queen, adorned the wall over the king's huge, and unmade, Kelos noted, bed. Crumpled night clothes were hanging off one of it's ornately carved dark wood posts. A slight layer of dust covered the dresser, and the ornate, golden mirror on the wall had a few streaks in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thrice damned magic,\" Kelos said, realizing she had been noticing things that needed to be cleaned, not important documents. She ignored the mess as best she could and made her way over to the king's desk, large dark wood, well polished, except for some smudges, but lacking the intricate designs of the rest of the furniture. \"I guess the king likes his workspace simple,\" Kelos thought. Her attention drifted to the mountain of scrolls piled atop the desk. \"All too easy,\" Kelos thought. \"Maybe a little too easy...\" Something occurred to Kelos. Perhaps this was a trap. Sending a servant from Grovan to clean a tower alone, that so happens to have King Authras' quarters in it, which happens to have a pile of scrolls sitting on a desk. Still, it could be a simple oversight, the potential secrets were certainly worth some risk, and an opportunity like this might not happen again. Kelos debated what to do.</span></div></div>",

Maps of patrols, charts that lead to supplies, and vital trade routes were in Kelos' hands and he couldn't believe it.  He'd been planning on leaving Traeven with a bride, but leaving with a battleplan was just as good if not better.  <i>I won't even have to keep up this charade and just leave back for Grovan tonight and be back with an army in a week.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Kelos lay in his itchy low grade bed in his magical maid outfit (it was either that or naked and Kelos would not suffer that indignity) he began to formulate his plan.  He knew that he could rely on nobody but himself to make sure he made it out of Traeven and back to Grovan, but as he could not travel alone in this female form he would have to time his escape perfectly.  His plan was simple, time it so that when he transformed back into his princely form he could escape as quickly as possible.  The first step to his brilliant plan was making sure that Cally could be near the stables.  That was simple enough, Alimah, though strict, seemed to have taken a soft spot to the hard working maid from Grovan who had been abandoned and had given the 'poor girl' her choice of the daily chores and Kelos made sure he was working in the stables where he could be alone and could grab a horse when he turned back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next step, simply lay low.  Kelos knew this was important but as a (former) man of action he hated that he was in enemy territory and he wasn't conquering Traeven but was instead cleaning it inch by inch.  It felt so beneath Kelos but 'Cally' had to keep face.  Apparently his excellent (and mostly involuntary) work ether had made it's way to the king.  The day before his planned escape Alimah said, \"Pretty soon the King will want you cleaning his royal court after the good work you did in his chambers.\"  Apparently this was some sort of honor or praise for Traeven servants but Kelos didn't care, he simply smiled and went back to scrubbing the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the long awaited evening of his escape plan had come.  Kelos got up early and made his way to the stable and hid there until he could turn back.  At least he tried to hide.  The stable was after all a very dirty place and since he was still wearing the magical maid uniform (since it was the only clothing 'Cally' owned now) he was compelled to scrub, organize, and sanitize every inch of the place.  As Kelos finished cleaning a window he looked at the sun and was pleased to see it was in the proper position, it had now been a week since he'd been transformed into his feminine form and begun this humiliation.  But any second now, he would be backt o normal and would escape and with Traeven vital information gained he would return to conquer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately the best laid plans still have things go wrong.</span></div></div>",

Kelos kicked over a bucket of oats and then immediately got down on his knees to clean up the mess he'd made.  He he cleaned he went over the possibilities of why he wasn't turning back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither the scribe was wrong about the length of the spell.  Very possible considering Kelos generally found the scribe to be annoying and bumbling.  The scribe lied which was also possible coming from that little weasel.  Or some magic was preventing him from turning back.  Kelos looked down at his maid outfit and knew what was causing it if that last one was the case.  But in the end Kelos doesn't know why he isn't changing back and must think carefully about his next move.  But he didn't get much time to himself as the second he finished cleaning up the oats, Alimah entered the stables looking for Cally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cally, wondderful news, the King wishes for you to be present in the court for a special arrival.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh must you keep asking questions girl, just do as the King says and go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos couldn't make himself go against Alimah's wishes, he was too distressed at his own situation to do so.  Kelos made his way to the royal court resenting the swaying and feel of the magical fabric conformed against his body even more than before.  Knowing it may be what was keeping him from turning back it felt more like a prison than an outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Kelos entered the court the King actually acknowledged him with a smile, \"Ah the Grovan girl.  I've heard good things about you.  I'm glad you've joined us, I'm sure you'll in particular enjoy and appreciate our newest guests to Traeven.\"  King Arthras turned to his guards and gestured to them as he said, \"Please let out new guests of Grovan in.\"  Kelos' ears perked up at this, had the scribe and his guards finally returned to bring him back to Grovan?  Or had someone else from Grovan made it a point to visit Traeven for their own reasons?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A Traeven guard opened the door and loudly projected, \"I present the honorable scribe of Grovan and his...companions.\"  Kelos felt his thin eyebrows raise in surprise when he saw the damned fool of a scribe nervously enter the room along with three beautiful women, a blonde, a brunet, and one with black hair.  But there was something odd about these girl.  The way they looked and carried themselves was not very ladylike at all.  They were all wearing ill fit dresses that looked very roughly made.  But despite these odd quirks the three women were some of the most beautiful Kelos had ever seen, almost as if they had been crafted by magic.  Kelos couldn't help it, he let out a small groan and thought to himself, \"<i>Please tell me those foolish guards didn't do what I think they did.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the scribe and the women approached the King they all bowed, when they stood back up the most beautiful and imposing woman with the raven colored hair gave the scribe a sharp elbow.  The scribe coughed and began to speak, \"Oh, um yes.  Great and powerful and regal King Arthras of Traeven.\"  He once again bowed ridiculously low to the ground.  \"I fear I must apologize for the great and powerful and handsome Prince Kelos of Grovan has again been delayed from coming to see you and the great and powerful and beautiful Princess Fia of Traeven.  But to show how deeply sorry he is, he has sent not one, not two, but three of his finest personal servants to serve your court to go along with the one from last time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Arthras looked at the scribe with a blank stare that was making the scribe visibly quaking in his boots.  Kelos was getting a bit nervous as well, for if Arthras took this as an insult he could easily execute the scribe and make Kelos turning back to normal all the more difficult, or worse he could take this act as an insult and invade Grovan before Kelos could get them his intel.  The court waited with bated breath.  Finally the King responded with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If the Prince is going to keep insulting me by sending more beautiful women into my castle I hope he continues to not show his face.\"  The people of Traeven laughed a little too long and loudly at the Kings quip.  Once the laughter had died down the King actually turned to Kelos.  \"You girl, I've been told your name is Cally correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos put on a false smile and curtsied, \"Yes King Arthras.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, well Cally I'd like to put these girls to work but they've been on a long journey and the day is soon over.  So I would like you to escort them to their new homes and get them their new uniforms so they can get towork bright and early tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos quickly said, \"Yes King Arthras.\"  And quickly gestured to the women from Grovan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about me great King?\"  The scribe whined.  The King turned to him seeming a bit surprised that he was still there.  \"Ah, well you've done your job, I'll have a traveling merchant drop you off back in Groven now that you've lost your traveling companions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there was more to the exchange Kelos didn't hear it, he lead the 3 women to his servant's chambers where there were three beds and three new maid uniforms already waiting there.  Kelos crossed his arms across his ample chest, \"Well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three women bowed, the black haired woman spoke first, \"Prince, I know this may come as a shock to you, but the three of us are not actually women, we are your personal guard from your journey.  I am in fact Captain Jex and this over here is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already figured out who you three are you idiots, but we are in enemy territory as you would do best to remember.  If you are going to speak to me, you should call me...'Cally' as much as it disgusts me.  But you will still treat me with the respect I deserve.  From now on you are Jess,\"  Kelos pointed to the brunette, \"You will be Sandra and you,\"  Kelos lastly pointed at the blonde, \"are now named Hilda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda seemed to pout, \"Actually I was hoping I could be Melody.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos gave the blonde a dirty look, \"I am still your prince and if I say your name is Big Titted Slut it's Big Titted Slut, but luckily for you I'm going with Hilda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda looked like she was near tear, the newly named Sandra went to comfort her but Kelos didn't care.  Kelos turned to the captain, \"Well Jess, you've gotten the stupid scribe to turn you and my men into women in order to I assume get me out of here.  I assume you have a very good reason for doing so, so let's hear the plan.\"</span></div></div>",

She held the red one out. \"This scroll has the same spell as the one you used in the carriage. We use it on a cat or something and get a replacement Cally.\" She held out the other golden scroll. \"This one is a teleport scroll. Once we have the replacement, you use this to go back to Grovan, change back to normal, then return here so we can leave and you can marry the Princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not a bad plan,\" Kelos said. \"It's got some issues, like assuming you can find a cat instead of providing one, and it doesn't address how this cat Cally will act while I'm gone.

But overall, I'm impressed you idiots came up with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's actually your sister's plan,\" Jess corrected Kelos. \"I did mention the first problem, but Princess Orianna just said 'surely my little sister can find one measly cat,' stressing the sister part.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Figures,\" Kelos replied. She then looked at the gold scroll. \"Are you sure that's safe? Knowing my sister, it might be boobytrapped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Positive,\" Jess said. \"I watched the scribe make it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, than give it here,\" Kelos said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but Princess Orianna specifically ordered me not to give it to you until the replacement was ready,\" Jess replied. \"If I do, she said she'd keep me like this permanently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, just get changed then,\" Kelos said annoyed, waving her hand towards the uniforms. \"Once you're changed we can look for a suitable replacement under the cover of me showing you around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm already changed!\" Hilda said excitedly, posing in her new maid uniform. \"I make a cute maid, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do,\" Sandra said. \"It uh goes well with your hair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" Hilda replied. She then looked towards Kelos, as if seeking her approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, very cute,\" Kelos said. She grabbed Jess and pulled her close to whisper in her ear. \"What's with that?\" she asked, nodding towards Hilda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she was rather reluctant to become a girl, so Princess Orianna had Xarlet give her a... new outlook on things,\" Jess explained. \"Sandra's her friend, so she's trying to help play along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Kelos replied. \"There is one more issue though. The scribe said this scroll would wear off in a week. I should have already changed back by now. Did he mention anything about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He did mention something about that,\" Jess replied. \"He said he might have gotten the length wrong a bit, but not to worry, because he already figured out a way to reverse it once you get back to Grovan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much is a bit?\" Kelos asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it was supposed to last a week and before I tell you this, I'm going to remind you that he already knows how to reverse it, so it's just a matter of getting you home,\" jess said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long?\" Kelos asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A year,\" Jess said. \"But again, he can fix it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I should be furious,\" Kelos said. \"But either I've come to expect incompetence of this magnitude, or I'm so angry it's broken my ability to become enraged. I can deal with him once I'm back to normal though. For now, get changed so we can go catch a kitty.\"</span></div></div>",

After being compelled by the magic of the uniforms to make their beds and clean their room the four took to the castle the 4 magically made ladies took to the castle grounds.  They saw a few strays here and their but the cats were far too quick for them in their heels.  Although a few of the stable boys seemed to notice the chase and were enjoying the spectical of beautiful maids chasing cats.  Especially when Captain Jess fell and to the ground revealing a bit more than the captain would like and gave the stable boys a real show.  Hilda noticing the attention Jess was getting went a step further and bent over very slowly and deliberately.  But before she could go too far Kelos pulled the blonde away and scolded her a bit.  \"You can do whatever you want with whoever you want after we catch me a damned cat and get me out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda was disappointed but Sandra once again comforted her friend and looked to her prince to say, \"We'll never catch a cat at this rate, we'll need to lure them to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's exactly what we'll do, to the kitchens.\"  Kelos said and marched to the kitchens with a zeal he had when leading his men into battle.  Fortunately for them, the kitchen was going to be serving fish for dinner.  Unfortunately for them they were asked to and thus were compelled to assist the kitchen staff.  For hours on end the four gutted, deboned, cooked, garnished, and served the meals along side the mostly male kitchen staff who were very happy to have the company of beautiful women.  But Kelos hated it, he got through the playful small talk of the kitchen staff by just counting down the minutes until he was out of Traeven and back in Groven and the finally back in his glorious male form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sun set and the dinner was complete, Kelos and the others snuck some fish away and took it outside to use as bait.  Hilda had even managed to get a wooden box to hold the cat from a very helpful kitchen staff member.  The four captured a black cat with golden eyes and took it back to their sleeping quarters.  Kelos not wanting to get anything wrong went over the plan one more time.  \"So I'll use the red scroll on the cat, it will turn into a copy of 'Cally', then I use the gold scroll to get back to Groven, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain Jess nodded, \"Exactly my Prince, but it must be you who holds and opens the red scoll and you must be facing the cat when you do so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now I'll take that,\"  the captain flushed red for a moment as Kelos callously reached into Jess' dress and grabbed the hidden red scoll and looked at the cat in the box, \"You were a pain to catch but you will prove your worth to me,\"  Kelos said as he opened the red scroll.  There was a flash of light and before Kelos' vision came back to him he could here Jess say, \"Good, all according to plan so far.\"  As Kelos' vision returned he could see how the red scroll had worked.</span></div></div>",

She stretched and crawled around the room on all fours, before hopping up on Kelos' bed and licked herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But she's still acting like a cat,\" Sandra observed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, mentally, she's still a cat, but she should be as intelligent as a human,\" Jess said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no way she can stand in for me like that,\" Kelos said, blushing from a combination of embarrassment of seeing her body acting like a cat, and from being turned on by the sight of a beautiful woman licking herself like that.

I borrowed an extra uniform for this.\" The four of them went to work on the former cat. While she put up a struggle, eventually they succeeded and dressed \"Cally\" in the uniform.

Oh Princess Cally, I mean, Prince Kelos, I'm going to miss you!\"  And with that Hilda couldn't hold it back and gave Kelos a hug.  Kelos blushed as he was taken aback by the genuine warm reaction.

As Kelos took the golden teleportation scroll from Jess he gave one last look at his men.  His men who were sacrificing not only their pride and masculinity, but potentially their lives if they are found out all for him.  As cold as Kelos could be this gesture did not go unnoticed.  With as much dignity and gravitas as he could muster while wearing a maid's uniform, Kelos looked to his men and said, \"Men, I thank you for what you have done for me and your country.  I swear to you on my honor, I shall return not only to take Princess Fia for my bride, but to bring you back to your homeland where you belong.\"  Kelos gave the men a Grovan salute that was returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as Hilda pampered the cat Cally, Kelos opened up the golden scroll and vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he could see again he was relieved to see that on the walls of the stone castle he was in were Grovan banners signaling he was home where he belonged.

A quick witted and intelligent young woman who continuously showed her drive and capabilities; known for dominating courtly negotiations and politics around the kingdom. It was an often held belief that she scorned the fact that the crown was taken away from her due to the birth of the first male in the family, but that didn't stop the fact that, between themselves, Orianna had a particular soft spot for her little brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr 'little sister', as she aptly put just moments ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsed to being around stiff nobles and other royalty, the two had taken solace in each other while growing up, with Kelos often ruminating how if he ever wanted an honest reaction to a problem or a situation, turning to her was one of his only options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor better or worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n A fan of the theatrics, she'd often tease and play games with him, and Kelos could just <i>imagine</i> how much of a field day she must have been having knowing he had been stuck as a servant girl for the neighboring kingdom. He was sure he'd never live it down.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill though, one thing at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kelos was released from the other woman's grip, he took a moment to compose himself in a princely manner (in as much that a current female prince dressed as a maid could look composed), and coughed once. \u201cYes, well, hello Ori, <i>dear sister</i>. I take it you're doing well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well, Kelos, or should I said <i>Cally</i>, as the reports I've been getting seem to indicate?\u201d The princess leaned forward a bit towards her sibling, a rather sly smile forming on her face. \u201cDid you come up with that one yourself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying not to seem flustered, as he knew a million little jabs like this were probably still to come, Kelos held a poker face. \u201cIt was a rather spur of the moment thing. A prince has to work on his feet, you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, but a <i>princess</i> is to be pampered! Come along now, you must be <i>exhausted</i>! You're safe at home in Grovan now. Let's get you <i>off</i> those feet.\u201d  Orianna was high energy as ever, as she grabbed Kelos' hand to drag him off to who knows where. \u201cWe'll get you a nice change of clothes, and afterward I want to hear every last juicy tidbit of your little adventure. Over tea, of course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little overwhelmed, Kelos...</span></div></div>",

Now that I'm home, it's time to change back into my normal, manly self.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Already?\" Orianna asked. Still holding Kelos' hand. \"But you just got back. Why not relax a bit first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty sure I can relax better once I'm a man again,\" Kelos replied. \"I've been a woman for a week already, and it hasn't exactly been relaxing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correction, you've been a <i>maid</i> for a week,\" Orianna replied. \"Working like a commoner! It must have been so terrible for you! Now you have a chance to experience being a <i>princess</i>. Trust me, if you want to relax, nothing can beat a full spa treatment.\" She rubbed Kelos' hand. \"Oh! Poor thing, your skin is so rough and dry! Come now, let's get you some moisturizer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think my skin can manage,\" Kelos replied. \"Plus, I'd really rather Mother and Father not see me like this.\" She looked down at her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you're in luck! They are attending a dinner party at some Count's manor,\" Orianna replied. \"You know the one, he's been trying to arrange a marriage between me and his son. Of course, I was invited too, but I wouldn't pass up spending some time bonding with my little sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not your little sister,\" Kelos replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really? Have you looked in the mirror lately, <i>Cally</i>?\" Orianna jabbed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been trying not to,\" Kelos said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?!\" Orianna asked in shock. \"You're such a beautiful girl! You should take the time to appreciate it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a man!\" Kelos insisted. She stomped her foot and pouted in a girlish fashion, making her statement rather unconvincing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I won't force you to stay like that and spend some time with me,\" Orianna said with a straight face, successfully repressing a giggle. \"I just thought it could help us get a little closer to spend some girl time together.

After all he were exhausted after a week of hard work as a maid and didn't mind taking a small break.  Besides, he wouldn't be able to rally some men in order to make a trip back to Traeven until tomorrow so he might as well spend the rest of the day with his sister.  \"Very well Ori, I will...relax with you like this.  However I do plan on being a man again by sundown.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're still up for it, then sure.\"  Orianna said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean it, I must be myself by tomorrow so I can go back to Traeven and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrianna rolled her eyes, \"Yes yes I know, 'and claim Princess Fia as my bride'.  I've not heard you stop talking about this plan of yours for years.  But really I don't see why she stands out over any other duke, dutchess, countess, or anyone.  Just because she's the princess of some small kingdom doesn't make her anything special.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos just shook his head and actually smiled himself, \"You never did have a romantic side did you Ori?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, romantic enough to know you turn into a fool whenever it comes to that girl, I'm sure your mind in the clouds and on her whenever you screwed up and made yourself like you are now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos knew arguing with Orianna about Fia would go nowhere, they'd had the argument 1000 times over.  She just believed he should marry whoever would give the family the best political position even if it meant him marrying a troll, a hag, a baby, or hell even another man.  \"Well Ori, even if I did have such a skeptical view of love, I would have to go back anyway.  I must return and save my men.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your ladies you mean,\"  Orianna corrected, \"And I don't see why you should, they're just soldiers.  Easily replaceable.  And did you ever think they might be better off as maids?  I mean it's hard work but they were doing hard work anyways.  And I'm sure they would rather be scrubbing floors than getting stabbed or shot at every other day.  They might even find a nice cook or hunter to settle down with and they would...\"  Orianna seemed very happy with the little story she was creating but Kelos didn't like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say or feel about them doesn't matter.  They are my men and I swore I'd go back for them.  If they want to give up the honor of their positions I shall let them if they wish but I will save them and bring them back here to make that choice.  And I assure you they will want to turn back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so.\"  Orianna shrugged, \"But enough arguing, let's get you out of that silly uniform and relax.\"  Orianna began dragging Kelos inter her closet as Kelos said, \"I would if I could.  It's enchanted and I can't remove it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrianna's eyebrows raised, \"Really?\"  And before Kelos could say 'yes', she was already looking up close at the uniform and feeling it and...smelling it?  \"Orianna what in the world are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm testing to see what enchantment is on it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could you tell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well while you've been studying for wars and battles, I've been learning other important magical traits.  Nothing major, but useful nevertheless.  You didn't think I just sat in my room sipping tea all day did you?\" Orianna said and silently went back to work.  A minute later she let out a small cry of victory.  \"It is a nice piece of enchanting done by the Traeven wizard I'll give him credit, but it's magic is only in effect within the castle Traeven grounds so you could easily remove it now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can?\"  Kelos said happily, and not bothering to figure out how to get it off properly, just ripped and tugged at the uniform until after a minute he successfully ripped the whole thing off.  Kelos couldn't believe how happy he was that he could see the female undergarments he was wearing.  He actually touched his bare stomach for the first time in a week simply because he finally could.  Kelos was taken out of his post maid uniform euphoria by the laughter of his sister.  Kelos, realizing he was just wearing a bra and panties in front of his sister turned redder than his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she finally stopped, Orianna wiped some tears of laughter from her eyes and said, \"Come on <i>Cally</i>, let's find you a nice dress to wear, that'll make you feel better.\"  After searching for  a while, Orianna seemed to find what she was looking for, a blue elegant dress which showed more shoulder and chest than was the norm, \"Ah ha, this one will be perfect for you.  It was custom made for me by a suitor of mine, but it was a bit small for me, but it should fit you perfectly.  And it will go much better with your eyes!  Oh I can't wait!  Put it on!\"  Orianna practically squealed at Kelos as she almost without Kelos' help at all put the dress on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos still felt humiliated, but he took solace in that it made his sister happy and the dress was a bit more dignified than the maid uniform.  \"Yes yes, you've had your fun, now I think it's time I turn back...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not until you've relaxed more.  Now come here and lay on my bed.\"  Kelos obliged his sister as she went to a counter and returned with a series of creams.  \"These are of my own special creation.  Now <i>Cally</i>, I'm going to put this on your skin and you will feel so much better.  All that nasty rough skin you've gotten the last week with just wash away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say.\"  Kelos said just wanting to get this over with.  Orianna rubbed some lotions on his hands and feet, they were now as soft and feminine as they were when he'd first been transformed.  \"I'm impressed Ori.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You haven't seen anything yet,\" Orianna said with her grin, \"This one will really help you out,\"  she said as she dabbed a new bottle of cream on Kelos' eyelids.</span></div></div>",

Even better than the stuff Orianna had put on the rest of her. She assumed this was another one of those silly moisturizers, or some other kind of beauty product that she'd paid little attention to as a man, but regardless of what it was, its scent, which was a faint flowery smell that she couldn't rightly place, was intoxicating, and made her feel at ease in a way that she hadn't felt since before getting transformed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust <i>relax</i>...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words of her sister rang through Kelos' mind, as deft hands continued with the gentle facial massage. It came to no surprise that, after the ordeals of the past week, she was mentally exhausted. In fact, as much as she didn't want to admit Ori being right, this was first time in a long time that she'd had a chance to 'unwind', so all this, plus the fact that she was already lying down on the bed, caused the young prince turned princess to start to doze off a bit, and while normally she'd have the fortitude to stay awake regardless, something extra must have pushed to draw her into dreamland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos didn't particularly have time to think what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXxXxXxXxX<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were sitting under a tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrianna up against the hardened bark, while Kelos, female of course, rested her smaller form comfortably in her sister's lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an almost picturesque scene, with a beautiful meadow surrounding them; monopolized almost entirely by a vast and seemingly endless array of pristine white flowers. The affect of it was dazzling, as the high noon sun mixed with hues of the flora to create a practically blinding brightness to the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis didn't bother the two girls, though, as they were safely shaded beneath the single tree in the area. In fact, the younger amongst them seemed quite pleased, with an almost glazed over look in her eyes and a goofy smile upon her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the flowers. Their smell, specifically. It was the same smell as the cream, but somehow ten times as lovely. She felt like she was in a trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeemingly much less affected was Orianna though, as she gently glided her fingers through her little sister's hair; a doting look on her face as she stared at the girl resting with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, little sister, I love you <i>dearly</i>, right?\u201d She said, leaning in to whisper into the other girl's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe received only a faint \u201cmm\u201d in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore than <i>anything</i>, in fact. Big sister Orianna just wants to protect her little sister Cally.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother light hum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLittle sister Cally should really listen more to big sister Orianna, as she knows what's best for her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dazed girl seemed to be mildly thrown off by that statement, as the next thing to come out of her mouth was a slurred and meek \u201cHmm?\u201d It was about as coherent as she could act in her current mindset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's right. Big sister Orianna knows little sister Cally suffered through the <i>terrible</i> trauma of having to work as a lowly maid! Big sister Orianna just wants little sister Cally to ease her mind from such troubles.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Little sister Cally' seemed to relax when she heard this response, resting further up against Ori.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Orianna began petting her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo worries of being a maid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worries of being captured.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worries of being executed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused for a moment before continuing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo worries of being a prince.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo worries of politics.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr the throne.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach of the last three were thrown out in quicker succession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust let big sister Orianna help you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the smooth and even voice of the older girl shifted up higher and became sweeter. \u201cI promise we're gonna have a lot of fun!~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned in close to kiss the back of her sister's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWake up, <i>princess.~</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXxXxXxXxX<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos blinked her eyes open. She must have been more tired than she thought. She'd have scorned herself for falling asleep while amongst company, but the pleasantness of the rest, and the dream she had, made her not really hold any regrets. She couldn't exactly remember <i>what</i> she dreamed about, but she knew it was one of the better ones she'd had in a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, it's not like she fell asleep while negotiating with some stuffy noble. If there was one person she could show weakness to, it was big sister Orianna!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, where was she?</span></div></div>",

She gently stroked her little sister's hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Ori,\" Kelos said, blushing a bit. Being complimented by her dear sister made smile. A part of her mind found this strange, but she shrugged it off. \"I'm sure I don't compare to you though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to be so modest,\" Orianna said. \"You're a perfect little sister. More importantly, how do you feel after your little nap?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos closed her eyes and took a deep breath. \"I feel great!\" she said. In truth she couldn't remember the last time she felt so relaxed, as if all her stress and worries had simply faded away. Also gone was the sensation of something wrong with her body. For the first time since she had been transformed things felt right. Well mostly, there was still a tiny feeling that something strange was happening in the back of her mind. \"What's in this cream?\" she asked as she reached up to touch her face, finding it had been absorbed into her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It contains an extract from a rare flower,\" Orianna replied, grinning a bit. \"It's fragrance is said to be the most relaxing thing in the world, and helps bring out a lady's natural charm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's wonderful, thank you,\" Kelos replied. \"But isn't it expensive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite, but we're princesses!,\" Orianna said. \"Only the finest for my little sister!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose,\" Kelos replied. \"But it does seem to be a lavish indulgence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just your time as a maid talking,\" Orianna said dismissively. \"Remember, a princess is to be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pampered.\" Kelos finished the sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct,\" Orianna said, patting Kelos on the head. \"Now then, how about we have that cup of tea?

Kelos had lost count of how much tea he and Orianna had gone through, it reminded him of when he would relax with some of his lieutenants at the bar and would drink find liquors until dawn.  Only somehow he actually felt more lightheaded drinking Orianna's tea, but Kelos pushed that thought out of his head.  After all his sister wanted to drink tea with him and wanted to hear his story's and he wanted to do whatever made her happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That must have been so horrible for you,\"  Orianna said after she finally caught her breath after the laughing fit.  \"But that's over and done with and you're here with me now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you haven't heard one of my favorite moments, after my men arrived and...and...\"  For a moment it felt like a fog lifted from Kelos' mind and he was suddenly filled with a shame as he thought about what was going on in Traeven.  \"And I must go.\"  Kelos said as he stood up, \"I've been frolicking about too long, and as much as I want to make you happy Ori, I must return to being a man and leave at dawn to claim my bride and rescue my men.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrianna's eyes betrayed her for a moment and showed great annoyance at hearing what Kelos said, but quickly her sweetly sly smile resumed it's place as she said, \"Oh please my sister, please before you go join me for one last cup of tea, I assure you it will be a very special blend of my own making.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small part of Kelos wanted to say no, but that part was stomped out by the desire to make his sister happy that had grown greatly over the little tea party.  After the briefest moment's hesitation Kelos ultimately said, \"Of course my sister.\"  And carefully sat back down.  Orianna took very special care in this last cup of tea and only poured one cup and pushed it before Kelos.  The tea had an intoxicating aroma and even the steam that rose from it was a beautiful lilac color.  Something still felt wrong but the time to turn down tea had long passed and Kelos quickly drank the cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately Kelos knew something was wrong, everything around him was fading.  He tried to stand but only fell from the chair.  He saw Orianna's feet walk over to him.  As though muffled he heard Orianna's voice say, \"Don't worry, I'll do what's best for the kingdom.\"  And Kelos passed out.<br>\r\n_________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt could have been hours, days, or weeks.  Kelos had no idea how long he had been passed out.  At times he felt presences around him but he couldn't move or say anything so he just brushed it off and forgot it like a dream.  But eventually he heard a loud snap and he awoke in an instant feeling very week in his own bed.  He noticed he was still Cally and was even still in the dress Orianna had him wear although through some sort of magic it still looked pristine even after being slept in.  Kelos heard another snap and turned to see Orianna at the end of his bed, before Kelos could speak to her Orianna held up her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you are so bound and determined to go back to being a man and going back to Traeven no matter what I say, however I have some news that might make you change your mind, little sister.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cMother and father have returned?\u201d Kelos inquires, blinking her eyes in confusion. This was turning out to just not be her day. Dozing off twice in front of her big sister? It was extremely unbecoming of her, and while it certainly wasn't something taboo considering it was with Orianna, it still brought a great deal of embarrassment to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOri nodded. \u201cYes, and I even believe they're bringing some special company.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen... then I must be returned to my true form at once! I can't let them see me like this!\u201d Falling asleep was one thing, but it'd be a whole different kind of slight to have her parents and whoever else they bring find her as a girl prancing around in dresses. That could outright bring into question her ability to handle the throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrianna though seemed to look quizzically at the younger girl before her. \u201c'See you like this?' Whatever do you mean, Cally? I know mother likes to dote on you, but surely you've come to terms with that by now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn eyebrow arched upward on Kelos' head. \u201cOri, sister, how long have I been out?\u201d She asked, forcefully sitting herself up at the side of the bed, but worryingly, feeling a woozy sensation after doing so. She almost fell back down into the cushiony surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older princess just blinked, seemingly sensing that something was a tad off. \u201cJust a few minutes, dear. You told me you wanted to take a quick nap before they arrived, and requested I come wake you when they were soon to return.\u201d She smiled sweetly at her sibling. \u201cI don't blame you for feeling tired. I would be exhausted too after the fiftieth conversation we've had about returning to Traeven.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos' features grew more dire. \u201cNo... no, that's not right. I remember... I remember <i>tea</i>, and then I felt tired, and then- then nothing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sister's brow furrowed at that statement, looking a bit unsure how to take it. \u201cCally, dear, that was <i>ages</i> ago! Are you feeling alright?\u201d Ori's hand reached up to feel her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos felt a sharp falling sensation in the pit of her stomach. Was this some kind of sick joke? \u201cSister, I know you love to tease, but I am far and away not in the mood at the moment. Your tea was lovely and your company exceptional, but don't sully my triumphant return with games and trickery.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrianna appeared dead serious. \u201cCally, there are no tricks here. I promise you. That 'tea incident', the day you arrived back from Traeven, that was nearly six months ago.\u201d She was looking Kelos straight in the eye. \u201cYou had passed out from fatigue due to all the events of the day, and when you woke up, mother and father were watching over you, having returned from their banquet with the Count.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI... I don't remember any of that.\u201d Kelos had an exasperation in her voice that didn't suit the standard dulcet tones of her female form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe're taking you to the wizard.\u201d Orianna matter of factly stated, grabbing Kelos' hand without hesitation, and began to try and drag her off the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no wait!\u201d Kelos pleaded. \u201cI mean of course we'll go, sister. It's a fine suggestion, but I need to hear it from you. What's been going on since that day?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a dramatic pause as Ori took a moment to stare her sister down, before ever so slightly nodding. \u201cWell, if we're going back to the beginning, you should know that thankfully mother and father took your situation far better than you had probably expected. Mother thought you were absolutely <i>adorable</i>, just as I did, and father seemed more amused than anything, especially after hearing from your own mouth the meticulous details of your trials as a maid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos' eyes widened. \u201cWhat did I tell them?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrianna laughed lightly. \u201cYou told them <i>everything</i>! Even I was surprised! Mother thought it was 'precious', while I never heard father laugh as hard as he did. It was quite possibly the most joyous I'd seen him since your own birth!\u201d She paused briefly. \u201cThough maybe for slightly different reasons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos felt sick. She couldn't imagine telling the humiliating details of her employment as a maid to anyone other than her beloved sister!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrianna though kept on going. \u201cWhile in no way angry- he couldn't get angry past the tears of laughter, father felt there was a bit of a learning experience to be had from the incident, and forbade you from returning to your 'proper' male form for half a year.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat explained why she was still a she, but it didn't explain the loss of memory or anything else. Kelos urged her sister to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs further 'punishment', he ordered that you be taught in the 'womanly' arts, as any princess would. He said that a few months seeing things from the opposite side of the coin would make for a more well rounded king in the future.\u201d A rather sardonic look appeared on Orianna face. \u201cThough sometimes I think he forgets a bit about the 'future king' stuff. He's even started to refer to you as Cally!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was too much to take in for Kelos. What the hell had been going on around her? \u201cDid- did I just accept this?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit of pride showed up in Orianna's features. \u201cYou took it with royal dignity.\u201d She said, placing her arm upon Kelos' shoulder. \u201cYou dived into your studies. From knowledge in the arts, to clothing, information in flora and botany, anything that was thrown at you you took with exuberant drive. Little sister, in such a short time, I think you may even have surpassed me in a few subjects!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile it was true that Kelos always aimed for perfection, it was never in her plans to study flower arranging and the like, but still, she needed to be one hundred percent caught up. \u201c...Anything else I should know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlenty!\u201d Ori stated boldly. \u201cWhile you took to your duties as any strong future ruler would, you nevertheless kept remarking about how eventually you needed to return to being a man and getting your 'men' back from Traeven. It's one of the few things you and your mother have spats about now and again, and, unfortunately, it's been getting a little more tense as your time to turn back approaches.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was good. That sounded like her. That sounded like <i>Prince Kelos</i>, but the fact that she hadn't urged to get her men back sooner, or the fact that she didn't at least try and send someone else to handle the matter, didn't make complete sense. This wasn't all fitting together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrianna snapped her fingers, and Kelos stiffened to attention. \u201cThat's an additional matter. If there's been one real upside to your 'trials in womanhood', it's that I don't believe you, mother, and I have ever been closer. Mother especially seems giddy about you. She loves to dress you up in just about anything she can find!\u201d She let out a loud chortle. \u201cI think it's a backlash from how I was always against it as a child. With you though? You're her doll.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos' mind felt like it was about to sputter out for a moment. \u201cHer... doll?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrianna sighed slightly. \u201cI'll admit it's a <i>teensy</i> bit of a problem. You just can't seem to say no to her on most things. Not when it's a chance to see her without her queenly demeanor for once.\u201d She paused again briefly in her monologue. \u201cEven I thought it was a bit much when, after wanting to hear the maid story for the fourth time, you asked if she would like you to dress up as a maid.\u201d Orianna did her best to not stop as an aghast look formed on her sister's face. \u201cI don't think that alone was the tipping point, but when she asked you to be her personal maid for a day, and you accepted, that to me didn't seem properly befitting of a princess, let alone a prince!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos was silently staring at her sister, her mouth wide open in an unladylike fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't mean to pry, but you... you don't like being a maid, do you, sister?\u201d This question seemed to come out of the blue, but at the same time, like it had been on her mind for a good while. \u201cI'm just asking because I hear tell that mother might end up requesting it again soon. I <i>certainly</i> know she enjoyed it. She found it 'delightful', and if you were to turn back, she'd want at least one more day to have of the experience.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos was just rapidly shaking her head. \u201cThis... this isn't real. <i>Not at all!</i>\u201d She yelled pointing her finger at her sister. \u201cOrianna, this is the foulest joke you've ever played upon me, and I'm not sure I can rightly forgive you for it, even if you're my dear sister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrianna sighed. \u201cWe need to go to the wizard. Or a physician, maybe you bumped your head on the frame of the bed.\u201d She attempted to grab Kelos' hand.</span></div></div>",

She stepped out into the hall and watched Kelos flee. She smiled as she saw her little sister still acting the part despite the protest. \"Though it can't be too much longer. I'm afraid you're going to remain my dear Princess Cally for quite some time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos through the halls of the castle, not knowing where exactly to go. \"I've got to stop crying, my makeup will run,\" she thought, willing herself to repress her tears. She looked behind her and saw no sign of being followed, so she stopped to collect her thoughts. \"I can't believe Orianna would play such a cruel joke on me.\" Then a thought occurred to her. \"What if she was telling the truth?\" Kelos didn't want to consider the possibility that she left her men trapped as maids in Traeven for nearly half a year, that would be a massive betrayal of their trust. Still, it should be easy enough to confirm. Kelos resolved herself and made her way towards the exterior of the castle. If it had in fact been months, it should be winter right now. The castle might be kept at a constant temperature, but a single glance outside would reveal the truth. Finally, she reached a storeroom with a window. She entered, and saw the window sealed by shutters. She struggled with it, and threw it open which revealed...</span></div></div>",

The ground around the castle had a layer of white snow over it, the moat was frozen solid, and the snowflakes were now falling and melting against Kelos' face melting and mixing with the now flowing tears.  His men, he had betrayed them and let them down.  Fia was now nearly 20 and surely would not have waited that long for him to come for her.  His life as Prince Kelos felt like it was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.  I can't think like that...it's what <i>she</i> wants.\"  Kelos thought wiping away the tears and grinding his perfect teeth as he thought of his sister.  All of the enchantments and mind tricks in all of the world could not hold back the anger and pure hatred Kelos felt at this moment.  He saw everything clearly for the first time in ages.  His sister had done everything she could to get the throne from him.  She'd manipulated his mind, his love of his family, and the compassion he had for his people and turned them into something he was not.  Hell he wouldn't be surprised if she was the one who packed the Cally scroll on his original trip anticipating his curious nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what could he do now?  He'd lost everything.  And it seemed Orianna had even manipulated their own parents into just accepting the current situation.  How could he fight back against her?  It seems like Orianna holds all the cards.  If things didn't change soon he would have to soon just give up and accept being Cally forever and do whatever Orianna said like a 'good little princess'.  Suddenly Kelos' blood ran colder than the frozen moat as he heard from behind him the cutting voice of his sister saying, \"Now my dear sweet Cally, why don't you calm down.  I've got a strong batch of your favorite tea waiting for you, that will make you feel all better.  I'm sure it will put an end to this...panic attacks or whatever you're going through for good.  Trust your big sister, I know that this is best for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos turned and looked into the heartless eyes of his sister and knew that he had no choice.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Princess Cally sipped on her tea, the lilac tinged steam tickling her nose and eliciting a small giggle from her petite lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking back to the 'incident' from a few months ago made her feel so silly! Bumping her head like that and causing a brief spat of amnesia! Thankfully her beloved sister was there to calm her down and allow her mind to collect things. And just in time, too! Mother and father had just returned from another meeting with the count, and they'd brought his son with them for a visit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had been hoping that, if Orianna didn't want to come to see him, they'd bring him to her, but as fate would have it, things didn't go as smoothly as one would expect, and the young viscount ended up bumping into Cally instead! The transformed princess was left rather befuddled by his rugged looks, but it was his charming and surprisingly witty demeanor that had helped most to hit it off between the two. By the time Ori popped in looking for her, she was just as quick to leave, speaking of not wanting to 'disturb them'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis left the king and queen rather bemused, the king more so. Cally's mother thought the fact that her and the viscount were exchanging pleasantries was just the 'sweetest thing', and outright encouraged it; giving tips towards the young princess like she was a teenage girl starting to date her first boyfriend. These events snowballed, and the viscount made several return trips in the days and weeks to follow, and all of them to just visit Cally, who seemed to hold little to no hesitation towards his growing advancements. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused a bit of a change in the mindset of the king. Ultimately he was getting what he wanted; one of his daughters was being ushered into another well to do and powerful family. It was just not the daughter he had expected. And while the count was a good friend of his, and in a high position, he needed the future ruler of Grovan to be wed into something even higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, deep down, he was a sentimental man, and he didn't want to tear apart two clear lovebirds like that, especially considering the special circumstances regarding his Cally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat led to a few very serious conversations with Orianna. He knew she was a strong, capable woman, who, if given the chance, would be sure to bring about a whole new era to the kingdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just a matter of the fact that Kelos was born, and that Kelos was a man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat though... that didn't seem to be the entire case anymore. He waited until the six month deadline had passed regarding her punishment, but she didn't say anything about turning back. It was like it had just slipped from her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was this that ultimately settled matters for the king, and two weeks past the end of Kelos' 'trial', he made the official announcement that the right to the throne was to be passed on to Orianna, and that Princess 'Cally' was to be demoted to second in line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had braced himself for bad blood to come about between the two, especially considering the new queen to be had been in talks with him for sometime about the arrangement, but to his surprise, Cally had simply embraced her sister, and cheered about how proud she was, and about how her rule over Grovan would be fair and just.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all brought a smile to the old king's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat led to now, where Cally continued to sip on her tea in her much more feminine looking bedroom. Enjoying her sister's special blend and basking in the warm afternoon weather had practically become a daily ritual to her, and with each passing cycle, she could swear that she felt more pleasant and at ease with herself than the last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick knocking at the door interrupted her musings of all this, though. \u201cWho is it?\u201d Her sweet voice asked, conveniently just after finishing the last drop of her drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout directly answering, Orianna stepped in, a wide smile upon her face. \u201cSister! Sister! I have a magnificent surprise for you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCally blinked, putting her tea cup down. \u201cOh? Has my husband to be returned for another visit?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBetter!\u201d Ori clapped, an excited tone in her voice as she walked out of the room for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as quickly, three young girls, a blonde, a brunette, and one with raven locks, all dressed in frilly maid attire, entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCally let out a gasp. \u201cJess? Sandra? Hilda?\u201d She asked in a shocked tone, incidentally using the female names she had given them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda squealed, and leapt towards Cally; enrapturing her in a big hug. \u201cOh my goodness, Princess! You look so pretty!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra moved forward to try and get her off her superior, but stopped when she saw Cally just as quick to return the gesture. \u201cBut, but how?\u201d The princess asked, a look of truly surprised joy on a features. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrianna was quick to interject. \u201cFor the past little while I've personally been working a deal with Traeven for a return of a selection of maids to the kingdom. It wasn't a particularly strenuous matter, given they were just simple servants, but they did request keeping one personally; a certain sprightly maid named 'Cally.'\u201d A small laugh was uttered from the future queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWe uh, spent a fair bit of time doing our best to train that cat.\u201d Sandra stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe've spent a fair bit of time training in general, your highness.\u201d 'Captain' Jess spoke. \u201cThe last nine months we've done our most to try and be the best maids and servants Castle Traeven has ever seen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love cleaning!\u201d Hilda said, releasing Cally from her grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrianna nodded. \u201cYes, I must say, from the reports, these three are better maids than they ever were guards.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Jess and Sandra blushed at the matter of fact tone the princess spoke in, but the raven haired of them took that as a cue to continue. \u201cIt kept our morale up during the wait.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCally held her head down, ashamed of the fact that she never had an opportunity to return and rescue them. \u201cI-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess held her hand up. \u201cYou don't have to say a word, your highness. Princess Orianna has informed us of everything. You've been an extremely busy woman, especially what with your recent engagement.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh! Ooh! Can I help pick out the wedding dress?\u201d Hilda asked, stars practically in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's scary is she'd probably be good at it.\u201d Sandra said, twitching a tad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI... I appreciate the enthusiasm, girls, but- but do you girls still wish to be girls?\u201d Cally was feeling quite overwhelmed, but that matter jumped right to the forefront of her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three soldiers turned maids looked between each other, before Hilda spoke up. \u201cI like being a girl!\u201d She said with a large oomph of 'pep' in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEying the room cautiously a bit, Sandra spoke up. \u201cI'll admit I found being a maid somewhat... relaxing.\u201d She said, a bit of a blush forming on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess slowly nodded. \u201cI did enjoy sweeping floors over getting stabbed or shot at with arrows.\u201d Her features shifted over towards Cally, though. \u201cBut no matter what, our lives are sworn to you, princess. It's our duty to serve you in whatever way we can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrianna clapped her hands once. \u201cExcellent! Then you would serve her best as her new handmaidens.\u201d The group looked on towards the other princess. \u201cI can assure you it would be a much more luxurious position than anything you three had in Traeven. Wouldn't you like it, Cally?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young princess stared deep into her sister's eyes, before openly starting to gush. \u201cYes! Yes! I would love to have the three of you by my side always!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess!\u201d Hilda rushed in for another hug, and soon afterward, with only the slightest of hesitation, Sandra and Jess joined her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff to the side, Orianna smiled- genuinely. Truly pleased that her little sister had found happiness. Sure it might have taken a bit of magical wheel greasing to get it all together, but she knew ultimately it had all worked out for the best. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to interrupt the scene before her, the future queen edged out of the room. She had some paperwork to file anyway for the trio of new employees. Plus plenty of other matter to deal with. It was to be expected of someone who'd inherit Grovan in just a scant few years time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrianna held her head high as she walked through the halls, knowing that the future of her kingdom was secure in her hands.</span></div></div>",

This whole situation is proof enough of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father never would have gone along with that!\" Kelos exclaimed. \"He wanted me to be queen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrianna smirked. \"I believe you meant king, Cally dear. And you're right, he did. Until he saw how easy it was for me to make you my little sister and how readily you accepted it, that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos had enough of Orianna's boosting, stepped forward and slapped her. \"I'll never forgive you for this, Orianna!\" she stated coldly. \"I'm through being your plaything. I vow that I'll retake my life, and when I'm queen or king or whatever, I'll make sure you're banished from Grovald!\" She started to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure you will, little sister,\" Orianna said mockingly. \"Oh right, I have something you might be interested in, as part of your adorable little 'retake your life' thing,\" she said, producing a letter from between her breasts. \"It's from Princess Fia addressed to 'Prince Kelos.' Whoever that is? Do you know, Princess Cally?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos grabbed the letter from Orianna's hands and ripped open the envelope. She looked shocked at the contents. \"Princess Fia! She's...\"</span></div></div>",

Since we first met years ago I had always felt tied to you and that we could have a chance to do great things for each other and our kingdoms.  I daresay I care for you.  Even though you humiliated me by sending more and more beautiful women as though you were taunting me I hoped.  Even through your broken promises of coming to see me I still hoped, but I can not hold onto that hope forever.  So I write this letter to tell you that I shall be marrying the captain of the Traeven Royal Guard.  He is of good linage and he will help strength Traeven from within.  And more important he does not break his word to me without so much as a written apology.  I will provide the courtesy and grace that you lack to tell you that the hope between us is gone and I will be married by the time of the first spring shower.  I wish you happiness even if I don't know if you deserve it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Fia.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kelos stared at the letter some more he heard the laughter of Orianna from over his shoulder.  \"Oh this is rich.  You have succeeded in breaking the poor girl's heart.  You once again have proven that you are not worthy of her nor of even being male.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears of sadness and anger ran down Kelos' cheeks.  \"It was not I who betrayed Fia.  It was you!  You and all of your witchcraft you vile woman!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrianna continued to laugh, \"Well I won't be so crass as to not take some of the credit, but you deserve credit to, after all if you weren't such a weak willed idiot my plans might have actually had a chance to fail, but instead little Princess Cally will live the rest of her life with some backwater count raising the next generation of inferior children and you will know that I was the one who put you there and...what are you doing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos had finally had it, blood could only save Orianna from his wrath for so long.  Kelos had reached for an ornate Grovan dagger and with lighting quick reflexes honed from a lifetime of training, Kelos had the dagger at Orianna's throat.  \"I will show you weak willed.  Let's see how your tea and dresses and witchcraft can do for you here.\"  Kelos backed his sister against a well and pressed the dagger drawing a little bit of royal blood, \"What?  No witty retort?  No taunts about how superior you are?  Or would you like to emasculate me more?  Go on, talk about how feminine your little sisters is.  Go on!  I dare you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrianna knew that she'd have difficulty talking her way out of this one, she had intended to finish off Kelos for good by showing Fia's letter but it had only strengthened his resolve.  \"Not talking?  Good.  Now let's go Ori, get moving.  We're going to the stables.\"  Kelos moved the dagger from Orianna throat to her back and practically pushed Orianna to the stables where Kelos put on a sweet smile and told the stable boys, \"Would you please arrange a carriage for my sister and I, we'd love to go out and go to...\"  Kelos whispered the last part to the carriage driver.  Orianna tried to signal silently to not do so, but Cally's womanly charms were too much and won the day.  Kelos pushed Orianna into the carriage and soon the two were on the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrianna's eyes never left the dagger now that it was back in her view, after an hour Orianna finally spoke.  \"So.  Where are you taking me now.\"  With a determined fire in his eyes Kelos told her. </span></div></div>",

After opening the golden scroll Kelos had been transported to the laboratory of Xarlat, the twisted court wizard of Grovan.  Kelos went out of his way to avoid the powerful wizard.  He understood and appreciated why the wizard was held in such high regards by his family, but Kelos being a cunning man himself knew a trickster when he saw one and knew that Xarlat could never be trusted with something truly important.  Keeping this in mind Kelos made his way to the door.  \"It was good to see you once again Xarlat, but I must go find my scribe.  He's the one who got me into this mess and I intent to make him get me out of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXarlat practically floated in front of the only door out of his lair, \"Why my princess, there is no need to rely on that amateur.  His brand of magic is but a cheap parlor trick compared to mine.  Forget that fool and...<i>sit.</i>\"  Kelos felt his knees buckle under the maid outfit he still wore.  Xarlat chuckled, \"My princess you are practically trembling from exhaustion.  I repeat, you should <i>sit!</i>\"  Xarlat said repeated with more force in his voice and this time Kelos was unable to fight back as he sat back in a rickety old chair in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now my princess, I will be the one to...cure you of your issues.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just make me a man again and let me go.\"  Kelos said doing his best to remained composed and not strike Xarlat for his abuse of magic against a member of the royal family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my dear, I don't think that's going to happen.\"  Xarlat grabbed a small box and opened it as he began to laugh.  Kelos strained to see what was in the box and was confused when he saw that it consisted of two rings.  \"You see my dear, when you were transformed into a woman and magically forced into servitude.  Your brain was unreperably addled.  The only way you could regain you sanity was to be bonded to a very magical being who will be able to control you mind and keep you from just cleaning the castle all day like a good maid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You lie, I have my mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I was just practicing what I was going to tell you family.  You see, I am going to bond us with these ancient rings.  The ancient ceremony has been bastardized over the years into what is now called 'marriage'.  What this ceremony will do is bond you with me for life.  You will be under my control as...well the simplest way to say it, as my wife.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelso looked at Xarlat with disgust, \"That will never happen, I won't accept this and my family will see through your pathetic ruse.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if they do choose to see through it, then I will simply destroy them.  They've been too trusting of me for too long and have let my power grow beyond their grasp.  Then with the king, queen, and your annoying sister out of the way you will finally assend to the thrown with me as your king, my princess.  Now <i>don't fight back and let me put on this bonding ring.</i>\"  Kelos tried to fight back but could not, the old brass ring was put around his ring finger.  Kelos had to stop this, he could not let his family, his kingdom, and his pride fall now.  Not after working so hard to get back to Grovan.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now my bride, I will seal our union.\"  Xarlat said as he savored the moment slowly putting the bonding ring on his own finger.</span></div></div>",

Xarlat savored the look on Kelos' face, the terror, the helplessness, the powerlessness. It was like a fine wine, perfectly aged. His plan to seize control of the kingdom was fine, but it was moments like this that he was really seeking. Even being king was not the goal, but merely the means to inflicting more exquisite suffering. Perhaps he should create a magical plague... Unwittingly he let his mind wander from the task at hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MOVE MOVE MOVE!!!\" Kelos thought desperately as she struggled against Xarlat's magic command preventing her from resisting. Suddenly she felt Xarlat's control wane. She didn't know the reason, and didn't care, this was her chance. Before the old wizard could react, she sprang to her feet and delivered a swift punch with her right arm directly to his jaw. Before he could recover, she stepped in and dealt a second strike with her left with as much of her weight behind it as she could deliver. If she had been in her male body, this would have at the very least broken the wizard's jaw, likely have knocked him out cold, or possibly even killed him. With her current body though, she did little more than stagger him. Still, this was more than enough, as it caused Xarlat to drop the ring which skipped across the floor, luckily towards the door. Wasting no time, Kelos rushed towards the exit, reaching down to grab the ring on her way out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nXarlat recovered and rubbed his jaw. \"Yes, my dear, run while you can. You can delay the inevitable, but it will only make this that much sweeter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos ran through the halls of castle Grovan's lower floors, with not a soul in sight. Not that this was surprising, as few ventured down to Xarlat's lair without a very good reason. She pulled at the ring the wizard placed on her finger, but found it wouldn't budge. \"Of course it won't come off,\" she sighed as she continued on, heading for the stairs leading up to the castle proper. She raced around a corner as fast as her body could take her, her breasts bouncing uncomfortably as she ran. \"I just need to take another right,\" she reminded herself.</span></div></div>",

After minutes of running Kelos finally found musty staircase to the main floor.  Dusting away cobwebs as he ascended, Kelos finally emerged to one of the main hallways of the Grovan castle.  \"I've made it.\"  Kelso said giving himself a second to breath, but that moment didn't last long as Kelos soon heard a loud bang from the dark depths below.  Kelso lets out a girlish squeal, slammed the door, and ran for her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't keep running forever.  I've got to do something to stop him.\"  And with an embarrassing addition to himself Kelos thought, \"I need to find someone to protect me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos' first thought was his elite soldiers, the best of the best.  But then Kelos remembered that his best 'men' were currently maids in castle Traeven covering for his absence.  The next best thing Kelos could think of was raise the Groven army, but that would take some time and time he did not have.  The only way to get a small group ready to fight would be to distract or depower Xarlat.  But the only way to do that was with magic and despite being exposed to a lot of it recently, Kelos didn't know a thing about magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Kelos realized he'd have to find someone who could.  Kelos only knew of two other people in castle Groven who knew magical arts besides Xarlat, and those were the sometimes incompetent Scribe of his, and his sister Orianna who was a bit of an expert at manipulation magic although Kelos wasn't sure she would help him even in the most dire of circumstances.  As Kelos sprinted towards a fork in the hallway and with a dark presence looming behind her, Kelos decided who to go to for help.</span></div></div>",

Kelos sprinted with his skirt flapping wildly towards the Grovan library where Kelos had caught his scribe reading and studying when he should have been at his beck and call like a good servant.  Kelos made it to the library before the dark presence that was Xarlat could catch her.  Kelso scanned the library and breathed a tremendous sigh of relief when he saw the Scribe was at his usual table with his nose stuck in a book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scribe!\"  Kelos cried out to her servant, the scribe (who at this point could barely remember his name was actually Sean) leap from the table in surprise and instinctively threw his books and scrolls to the ground and saluted, \"Yes my lord I am at your service my...Prince Kelos?  You're back already?!  And you're still a maid?  What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos pulled the scribe behind one of the hundreds of giant bookshelves in the massive library and put his perfectly magically manicured finger to his luscious pink lips.  As soon as the scribe shut up the door to the library was blown open by a magical wind.  All of the sudden the library's temperture dropped to freezing tempertures.  The only thing colder than the room was a sinister voice, \"It's so silly of you to run my bride.  You are already marked as mine, now give me back my ring and I may be lenient towards you for striking my precious face.  Now <i>come out like a good little girl.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos felt a shiver down her spine as she stood up against her will and began to make her way out in the open.  But Sean the scribe grabbed Kelos by her narrow waist and whispered, \"I won't let him take you.\"  Kelos greatly appreciated the scribe's sentiment but simply holding her body wasn't going to stop Xarlat from taking over.  Kelos looked to the scribe with fear in her eyes, but with a still commanding voice said, \"You have to do something, if he takes me the kingdom will fall.  Save my kingdom scribe!\"  And with his last remaining will power before Xarlat brought her into the open, dropped Xarlat's brass bonding ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he watched his Prince forced to walk to the evil sorcerer Xarlat, Sean the scribe knew that he had to do something drastic.  The scribe picked something up off the ground and knew that maybe with that iteam he could save the beautiful Kelos.</span></div></div>",

It stood out only for its indistinctness. \"I've been saving this one for a dire circumstance, but surely this counts.\" He then broke the seal and opened the scroll. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bright flash filled the room, followed by an angry roar. Kelos couldn't turn to see what had happend due to Xarlet's control, but heard a heavy footstep, then another. The transformed scribe then rushed forward, moving past Kelos in a blur, and crashed through a book case and the stone wall behind it, scattering several scrolls among the rubble. This new threat caused Xarlet's control over Kelos to cease, allowing her free movement again. She looked through the new hole to see what the scribe had transformed himself into. He now stood nearly 9 feet tall, a body rippling with muscle that would put any man to shame. However, the scribe's new form was anything but human. On top of the body was a bull's head, with massive horns, The scribe had turned himself into a Minotaur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An interesting little trick,\" Xarlat said with a chuckle. \"But surely you realize brute force is useless against my magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUndeterred, the scribe lunged forward with inhuman speed, swiping at the dark wizard with his powerful new arms. It was far too fast for Xarlat to dodge, and appeared to connect, but the blow simply passed through Xarlat's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose I can play a bit before I claim my bride,\" the wizard waived his hand and a powerful yet unseen force threw the Minotaur scribe back past the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scribe!\" Kelos called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXarlat approached Sean, \"Is that all you have? I'm disappointed. The up and coming scribe, who likely had aspirations of usurping me, and all he can do is make himself bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scribe let out another roar and leapt to his feet. In his hand was another scroll. He broke the seal, and suddenly grew even bigger. He then charged Xarlat again, even faster this time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A physical enhancement scroll? Because when something doesn't work, do the same thing but more is really the answer,\" Xarlat quipped. Again the scribe's strike passed harmlessly through Xarlat's body, followed by an unseen force slamming Sean through a wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos looked on as the scribe attempted to defend her. Something was wrong. This whole fight was off. Magic is well and good, but many a wizard had met an unfortunate end to a physical blow they couldn't react too. Yet they were passing through Xarlat like he wasn't even there. But it couldn't be just an illusion, after all, she could now move, so clearly Xarlat was focusing on Sean.</span></div></div>",

Even a distracted and drained Xarlat is to dangerous for me to face without a weapon with this weak body.\"  Kelos stomped his heeled foot in anger causing his chest to bounce further rubbing in his situation.  \"I need something that can give me the upper hand.\"  Kelos looked around desperate as though hoping for a sword or lance to appear out of nowhere, but while he didn't see those he saw something the could be even better.  Sean had left a scroll behind before he transformed himself to fight Xarlat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos reached for the red scroll and hesitated for a moment when he saw his feminine hand that still had the magical Bonding Ring stuck to it thanks to Xarlat.  \"I've got to stop him now or I'll be forced to marry him and Groven, no, the entire continent will be doomed to his darkness.\"  With renewed determination Kelos grabbed the red scroll and began his search.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos' didn't even both sneaking around the book cases, after all who could hear the sound of his heels against the floor when a minotaur and wizard were fighting mere feet away.  Kelos scanned the hundreds of bookshelves hoping to find Xarlat cowering away concentrating on his projecting.  Finally Kelos hit the jackpot.  In an aisle dedicated to, of course, dark magic, Kelos saw the body of Xarlat sitting down cross legged concentrating on trying to defeat Sean.  And judging by the beastal roar of pain Kelos just heard, he may be getting close to it.  Wasting no time Kelos got within feet of Xarlat just to make sure he didn't miss.  Using his long nails Kelos broke the seal on the scroll and opening it up facing Xarlat as he shrieked, \"Let's see how you like being a slave to magic!\"  And in a flash of red light, Kelos lowered the scroll to see that Xarlat had indeed transformed.</span></div></div>",

She held the former wizard at arms length. \"Not so mighty now, are you Xarlat?\" she asked mockingly. \"I don't know how long this scroll will last, but if it were permanent, it would be a fitting punishment for your treachery.\" This just made Xarlat struggle more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad he been more familiar with his new body, he could likely have twisted free of Kelos' grip, but as it was he was only succeeding in causing pain as the skin Kelos was grabbing him by stretched. After a few moments, he calmed down and took stock of his situation. He was now a cat, and unable to cast magic or speak. It could only be for a day, or it could be forever, though the latter was unlikely. It was possible he could still mix a potion, but this feline body would make it difficult at best. Being held by the stupid prince turned princess made it impossible. Clearly the only option would be to convince her to release him, and then run away. To that end further struggle was pointless. He stopped and just hung there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it looks like you've stopped making a fuss,\" Kelos commented. \"First, can you understand me? Two meows for yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrrow Mrrow,\" Xarlat replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Sean burst in to Xarlat's lab, still in Minotaur form, breaking the door off its hinges. While he had been expecting a fight, he saw a girl holding a grumpy looking cat. He let out a confused snort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say hello to our mighty wizard,\" Kelos said with a smirk, as she held Xarlat up. \"He makes a cute little kitty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean, unable to speak in this form let out a deep grunting noise that sounded almost like laughter. He motioned for Kelos to follow him and headed out towards his own study. Kelos complied, following the giant beast while carrying the transformed wizard. Upon arriving Sean took a scroll and used it to transform himself back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew, that's much better,\" the once more human scribe said. \"So, this cat is Xarlat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and he's going to be a good little kitty, right?\" Kelos replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrrow Mrrow,\" Xarlat answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He can't cast any magic in that form?\" Sean asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looked like he tried casting a spell and nothing happened, but I can't be sure,\" Kelos said. \"How long will this scroll last, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No clue, I have several that transform someone into a cat, and I'm not sure which one you took,\" Sean replied. \"For the meantime anyway, what should we do with him?\"</span></div></div>",

This was intolerable.\" He resumed his struggles to free himself from Kelos' grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no you don't,\" Kelos said, as she managed to keep her grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found one!\" Sean called out. He rushed back to the prince turned princess holding a silver cage that looked just large enough for a cat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In you go,\" Kelos said. Xarlat's twisting and turning made it difficult, but working together Sean and Kelos managed to secure the transformed wizard inside, and shut the door, locking it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nXarlat hissed and tried to swipe at Kelos and Sean through the bars, but it was futile. \"Why did I even have this stupid cage around?\" he thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, one problem taken care of,\" Kelos said. She tried to pull the ring off, but it was still fixed firmly to her finger. \"Two more to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should tell the King and Queen,\" Sean suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are right, but I'd rather they not see me like this,\" Kelos said, gesturing down to her current feminine body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are already aware of your transformation,\" Sean said. \"I believe they are eager to know you're safe, regardless of your form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I safe though?\" Kelos asked. \"Apparently all anyone has to do is put the other ring on, and I'm bonded to them and forced to do their bidding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The ring you are in possession of,\" Sean pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes, but in this form I could conceivably be overpowered,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXarlat watched the conversation in his cage. A purr escaped his now feline throat. It was now obvious neither of the fools had any idea of how to remove the ring. Surely his magical genius would find a solution to his kitty issues long before these simpletons came up with a solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All the more reason to tell your parents,\" Sean said. \"We need to tell them of Xarlat's treachery above all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Kelos replied. \"I'd just prefer to do it as my handsome, manly self.\" She thought for a moment.</span></div></div>",

As the two of them approached the doorway to it, they were stopped by the castle guards, who raised their halberds at Kelos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Halt!\" One of the guards ordered. \"State your name and your business here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Prince Kelos, and I have returned to Grovan to see my parents and inform them of a traitor!\" She glared with a menace that would would think impossible for a girl in a maid outfit, and held up the cage containing the former wizard. \"This cat was once Xarlat, who betrayed our kingdom. Get out of my way or I will see you suffer a worse fate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How preposterous,\" the guard said. He began to approach Kelos. \"A stay in the dungeon will get the truth out of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It might sound unbelievable,\" Sean said. \"However, I can assure you, this maid is in fact Prince Kelos, accidentally transformed by one of my own magic scrolls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or she's a witch who has you charmed!\" the other guard said. \"She already said she turned Xarlat into a cat!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All the more reason to step aside,\" Kelos said. \"Either I am your Prince, as the scribe attests to, or I'm a witch powerful enough to overcome Xarlat in battle and charm this scribe into my servant.

She then just stepped past the guards who were distracted by their discussion on how to test for witches. Sean followed. They entered the throne room, which was not very busy. There were a few petitioners, but for now the king and queen were looking over some scrolls with the finance minister, likely confirming the kingdom's budget for the year. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They won't recognize you,\" Sean reminded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mother's necklace will,\" Kelos said. \"Its gems will glow in the presence of her children, even if they've been transformed.

He failed, though I cannot remove the magic ring he used either. All things said, I would really like some assistance in disposing of this traitor, and undoing the various spells on me. I also have information on Treavan's defenses which will allow us to claim a final victory in this war.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReginald looked over to his wife, Latissa. She checked her necklace, and indeed, the gems on it were glowing faintly. \"She's really Kelos, dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did know about your transformation. I must say, my son makes a fine daughter as well,\" Reginald said. \"However, we must get you into something more becoming a princess while we figure out how to turn you back into a man. But first,\" He then looked at the cat Kelos was carrying. \"You say this cat is Xarlat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, father,\" Kelos replied. \"He tried to use magic to addle my mind, but together with Sean and his magic scrolls, I was able to defeat him, and turn him into this cat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As expected of my child,\" Reginald said. He stood up, walked over to Kelos, and took the cage from her. \"Though I suspect Xarlat needs to be taught a lesson. I shall see to it personally.\" He turned and walked back towards the throne. \"While I'm handling that, go see your sister.

Xarlat quickly hopped out. \"I would expect one of the scribe's silly little scrolls would be no match for your magic, old friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXarlat extended and retracted his claws a few times in practice. He then looked around the room. Next to the throne was a silver tray. He quickly bounded up to it, and jumped, knocking it onto the floor. Xarlat then dragged it over to the king, and began to etch a message into it with his claws. \"It is not the scroll.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Reginald talked to Xarlat, Kelos made her way through the halls. Rumors of what had just transpired was already making its way through the castle, so the servants and guards stood aside as Kelos passed. Before long, Kelos had reached Orianna's room, and knocked on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do enter, dear sister,\" Orianna called out with a sly, knowing tone in her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos opened the door and entered the room. She saw her elder sister sitting at a table, with a pot of tea. \"Ori, father said you might be able to help with one of my problems.\" Kelos said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In due time,\" Orianna said. She stood up. \"Come, let me take a good look at you, sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos sighed and entered the room, approaching her sister.

It cannot be removed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps I should wait outside?\" Sean asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that would be most accommodating,\" Orianna said. \"I'll have our little princess here dressed appropriate to her title soon enough.\" With that she walked over to the door and closed it on the scribe, then turned. \"So the uniform is enchanted, I take it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it has enchantments that make it fit anyone who wears it, always stay clean and neat, make it unable to be removed, and it encourages cleaning a room.\" Kelos explained. \"It has been hinted that there are more enchantments as well. Father said you had experience with enchanted clothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed I do!\" Orianna said proudly. She walked over to the corner of the room and pulled out something covered by a piece of cloth. She pulled it off, revealing an elaborate bridal gown on a dressmaker's dummy. \"This dress will make anyone the perfect bride. Anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why would you make a dress like that?\" Kelos asked, a skeptical look in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The original plan was to trick you into wearing it and marry you off in my place,\" Orianna said. \"But mother and father never really pushed my marriage, and now that you're a woman, it's completely unnecessary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll turn down any offers of clothing from you,\" Kelos said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but I'd never do anything to harm my dear little sister,\" Orianna replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't instill confidence,\" Kelos replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrianna took a pair of scissors. \"Hold still.\" She then attempted to cut the maid outfit, but with no success. \"Also resistant to damage I see.\" She pulled and tugged at Kelos' outfit. \"This is really well made. I can't imagine it can't be removed. What if a maid quits?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if it's that simple,\" Kelos said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" Orianna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I quit as a maid!\" Kelos called out.</span></div></div>",

Just some clothing for now would be lovely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pity,\" Orianna replied. \"Promise me you'll let me do a makeover on you later. After all, a princess is to be pampered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Kelos said. \"If I must remain a princess for a time, I'll let you make me look the part.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a deal then, sis,\" Orianna said. She changed direction to her closet. \"I'll make you the second prettiest princess in the castle in time for dinner tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not the prettiest?\" Kelos asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hardly,\" Orianna said. \"After all, I'm here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't have your little sister being prettier, I suppose,\" Kelos said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly,\" Orianna replied. She smiled at Kelos, noting that she referred to herself as a little sister. She was also being surprisingly cooperative. Perhaps it was to be expected. As Kelos herself said, she had spent some time as a woman already. She may have simply gotten used to it. However, it was worth testing further. She let go of Kelos' hand, and flung open the closet door. A massive walk in closet stretched before the two. Just past the door were two large dressers, one on either side. A full length mirror stood next to the one on the right.  Just beyond that were clothing rods, lined with dozens of dresses, There were gowns fit for a royal gala, simpler dresses for traveling, and everything in between, in a myriad of styles and colors. Towards the back was a rack with shoes. Pumps, flats, slippers, riding boots, seemingly anything a princess could want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos looked in amazement as the sheer size of Orianna's wardrobe. \"I had no idea your had so many dresses, and such a huge closet.\" As she walked in, her reflection caught her eye, and she turned to face the mirror. Looking back at her was a pretty young woman, with long, wavy red hair the same shade as her mother and sister. Kelos took a step forward and put her hand on the mirror. The reflection did the same. She stood there, staring into her own reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong, sis?\" Orianna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I just never really got a good look at myself in the mirror,\" Kelos said. \"I hate to admit it, but I'm beautiful.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You take after your big sister,\" Orianna replied playfully as she pushed up next to Kelos, her reflection joining the former prince's. \"Don't let it go to your head though, sis.\" She pointed to her own reflection. \"See, I'm still prettier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos smiled, and a feminine giggle escaped. \"Maybe a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we can't have you standing here admiring your reflection all day,\" Orianna said. \"Let's get you dressed. Would you like to pick out your own dress, or shall I find one that suits you?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kelos hesitated for a moment, but Ori was waiting expectantly, and despite all the changes, she knew it wouldn't do for a princess to show hesitation. \u201cI've an interest in picking a dress out for myself, if you don't mind, big sister. I spent so long prancing in that maid uniform, that having a little,\u201d a pause, as she scanned the closet. \u201cOr a <i>lot</i> of choice, would feel good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older girl clapped in approval: both at Kelos' willingness, and the absolutely <i>heart-fluttering</i> way she called her 'big sister.' \u201cWhat's mine is yours, <i>little</i> sister! At least when it comes to clothes. It's one of the perks you'll have from now on!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>For now.</i>\u201d Kelos corrected. \u201cNot 'from now on.' I'll be fixed before you know it! This is just a...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFun diversion?\u201d Orianna teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Temporary solution.</i>\u201d The younger sibling pouted through pert lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grumbling Kelos felt soon dissipated, however, as she found herself awash in choosing from a wardrobe so vast, she risked getting lost in there for a week! Colors, frills, and textures of all varying degrees of soft comfort tickled and touched at her in a way her life as a male never got to experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRed <i>is</i> the signature color of the women in our family.\u201d Ori commented, as she whisked her hair back. The two were debating over a fiery gown that Kelos knew had been worn out to many a gala.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don't think it's a bit much?\u201d The new girl questioned: fingering at her own locks just like Ori did, but in a less confident manner. It'd make her so red...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing it in front herself as she examined how it'd look in the mirror, a smile of genuine giddiness sparked on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt'd make her <i>so</i> red!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelection after selection was fawned over, with that outfit being merely one of many. The only options which were outright off the table were anything shaded in black and white. For... reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeels, little sister?\u201d Ori questioned, with a modicum of surprise, as she saw her counterpart pull a pair off the shelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI... got used to them as a maid.\u201d Kelos defended with a blush. Besides, these stuck out to her for some reason, and she really wanted to try them on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the past, Kelos often wondered how women could so <i>eagerly</i> dedicate their time to primping themselves. Being of the aristocracy, it's understandable that a level of appearance needed to be kept up, but surely there was a limit to how well you invest yourself? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end however, thanks to the helpful, <i>guiding</i> hand of her sister, she completely lost track of things! Immersed in the moment, with a tingly warmth inside telling her that that was all <i>a-okay.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a *click* *clack* on the ground, as well as a bit of a *swish* in the air, as the final touches were applied, but with only an echo of bashfulness, Kelos looked on to her companion.\u201cHow do I look?\u201d She asked, seeking approval. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrianna stayed <i>dreadfully</i> quiet, as she circled around the girl: face contemplative. At one point she lifted up a tuft of fabric on Kelos' sleeve, before letting just as quick. \u201cBig sister?...\u201d Kelos timidly hummed, worried she didn't like it. That was, until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy <i>goodness!</i> You are utterly <i>precious!</i>\u201d Ori swiftly shifted into a brightly beaming grin, as she lifted up the new noblewoman into a tight hug: Kelos' face conveniently landing right in her 'big' sister's bosom. \u201cOooh, little sister! I <i>knew</i> there was a real princess hiding under those servant's clothes! Just wait until mother sees!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos struggled and flailed for a good minute, but she simply no longer carried the strength she did as a man: fully at Ori's mercy, and fully red as a tomato. From her hair, to her attire, she was practically a glowing ember!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally released, but no less embarrassed, Kelos tried to shrug it off as nothing. \u201cYes- ah, well, thank you, big sister! But I think you're right. It might be best if we go rendezvous with Mother and Father. I worry we've kept them waiting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMm, you've <i>definitely</i> 'kept them waiting,' little sister. You're like a babe making her first trip out shopping! I couldn't pull you away if I wanted!\u201d She took a <i>devious</i> amount of pleasure in seeing the 'babe's' face burn up again. \u201cBut since you've held them so long already, what's a tad longer? We really <i>ought</i> to do something about that face of yours. No makeup at all! Still the look of a maid!\u201d </span></div></div>",

Pretty little things, but more air between their ears than brains. They'd only been in Traeven a few days and <i>already</i> they were causing trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raven-haired one, Jess, she believed, stepped up to elaborate. \u201cAhem, well, yes... See, Cally was having us clean your wizard's storage room, when a vial of something fell, and...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd now she's acting like a kitty!\u201d Hilda cheerfully piped in, as she leaned over the transformed feline: dangling a piece of string for it to try and claw at.

The castle is now down a maid, and I intend to get that fixed! Otherwise I'll have <i>each</i> of you turned just like Cally here. If you don't intend to do your duty as assigned, then Traeven will be better off having you chasing mice!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stickler for authority in Jess instantly responded to the browbeating. \u201cYa Ma'am!\u201d She said with a salute. \u201cWe won't let you down!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer boss simply gave a laugh. \u201cNow <i>that's</i> the enthusiasm I like to hear! Talking more like a knight!\u201d Before a response could be given,  Alimah was already beginning to walk off. \u201cSee to it that Cally gets sorted out, though. I've grown quite fond of her. She's a natural maid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment of silenced reigned, as the three women, and one cat-woman, were left unsure what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can't just take this thing to the magician, can we? Surely he'll be able to tell it's not the Kel- <i>Cally.</i>\u201d Sandra pondered, as Cally-Cat rolled on its back, and stretched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Worse,</i> he'll undoubtedly be able to tell we've been transformed too.\u201d Jess scowled, as she rubbed her chin. \u201cI hate to say it, but behind enemy lines like this, we might just have to hope our princess can save us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a bubbly smile, Hilda began to absently wonder what she'd look like with a cute kitty tail.</span></div></div>",

Apparently events were quickly spiraling outside of control. The old wizard would surely see through everything and expose them. In a few minutes they'd all be in jail and their whole scheme would collapse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, no need to be so formal. Just Marlin will do,\" the wizard said.

Cally-cat saw and rolled over, then crawled over to the wizard. He then began to pet her head, causing Cally-cat to purr softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is it, Jess thought to herself. Marlin knows something is up, he'll see that Cally is just a transformed cat, and then he'll expose them all. She thought briefly about just bashing the old man over the head, but surely such a powerful wizard would have a defense spell prepared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must be getting forgetful in my old age,\" Marlin said. \"Leaving such a dangerous potion laying around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wave of relief overcame both Jess and Sandra, as apparently Marlin, despite all odds, didn't realize anything was wrong here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry, it happens,\" Hilda chirped, having finally snapped out of her daydream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe I can,\" Marlin replied. \"However, restoring her mind may be tricky. This potion seems to have been quite thorough. If I didn't know what happened, I would assume your friend here was a cat her whole life.\" He stroked his beard, as he thought how to solve the issue, not noticing two of the women there tense up, wondering if they had been seen through after all. \"I have it!

I'll use you memories of her to make a potion to cure her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you can help her,\" Jess said. She still wasn't sure if the old wizard knew what was going on and was leading them into a trap, but really there wasn't much else they could do here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then lets go,\" Marlin said.</span></div></div>",

He looked down at his hands, large and manly. He clenched and released a fist a few times, then looked down at the rest of his body. Sure enough, he had returned to his male form. However, he also noticed a problem, he was still wearing the maid uniform. The magic in it had caused it to stretch with his body, and tugging on it revealed it was every bit as stuck in place as it had been before. Now Kelos stood alone in the stable, a grown man wearing a maid uniform. At this point he heard a bucket fall behind him, and he realized he wasn't as alone as he thought. The prince spun around to see a shocked Princess Fia standing there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-Kelos?!!\" Fia called out in shock as she recognized the Prince. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fia! I know this looks strange, but I can explain!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess took a moment to compose herself. \"Perhaps, but I do not believe this is the proper time or place to do so. After all, I'm sure you would not wish anyone else to witness the Prince of Grovan wearing a maid uniform. Least of all my father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely not,\" Kelos said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFia looked around, and saw a dirty horse blanket. She picked it up, shook it out, then threw it over Kelos' head. \"This should help somewhat.\" She then grabbed Kelos' hand and started pulling him. \"Let's go up to my room and have a nice long chat about this in private.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith little other in way of options, Kelos allowed Fia to guide him. He was fairly sure people would still be able to tell he was a man wearing a maid uniform even under the blanket, but at least no one could identify him like this. Unable to see forward because of the blanket, Kelos looked down. He watched his skirt swish with each step as the two betrothed royals moved through the halls, the shiny, black, heeled shoes clicking on the tile, his hairless legs still clad in the white stockings. Wait, hairless? The hair on his arms had returned as he transformed back, so why didn't his leg hair... Before he could ponder too deeply, a door opened, and the tile of the halls gave way to a plush carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here,\" Fia announced. She pulled the blanket off of Kelos, and tossed it out into the hall before she closed and locked the door. She then directed Kelos over to a small table with a pair of chairs. \"Now then, I think this is the proper time for that explanation.\" She sat down and invited Kelos to do the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a bit of a tale,\" Kelos said as she sat down, carefully smoothing out his skirt. He then began to explain the past week of his life, the disguise scroll, his time as a maid, as Fia hung on every word.</span></div></div>",

Her solitary foot steps echoed through the empty corridors with not a soul in sight. Fortunately the castle had plenty of markers to indicate the right direction, but she still felt a bit uneasy being alone in this weak female body. At last she reached the door leading to the west tower and attempted to open it, finding the door quite stuck. Not being one to accept defeat, she leaned against the door and pushed with all the force she could muster with her current petite form. The door creaked and shuttered, but did not budge. Cally stopped momentarily then redoubled her efforts. Slowly but surely the door began to give way until suddenly it swung open. With the sudden lose of resistance, Cally fell forward into the entrance to the west tower, kicking up a cloud of dust, which caused her to cough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rose to her knees and looked around, the tower was dark, the only illumination coming from the hall. There was just enough light for her to see that the tower hadn't been cleaned in quite some time. A thick coat of dust covered everything, with plenty of cobwebs for good measure. As her eyes adjusted to the darkness, she noticed what looked like windows on the wall, shut tightly. She stood up and looked herself over. As the head maid had aid, her uniform remained clean.  She covered her nose and mouth with her apron and walked over to the closest window.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thick wooden shutters were held in place by a wooden bar, which Cally removed, then threw the shutters open. Light from outside poured into the room, and for the first time she appreciated the magnitude of what she was up against. Furniture was strewn about, also coated with the same thick dust as the floor. Quite some time was an understatement, this tower clearly hadn't been cleaned for years, maybe decades. It would probably take the better part of the day just to clean this one room. \"This is just hazing,\" she said to herself. \"Surely I can't be expected to actually clean this my myself.\"</span></div></div>",

As long as she was here cleaning, no one would see her like this, and since she was told to do it and it was a huge job, no one could blame her for taking so long. Eventually the head maid would probably send someone to look for \"Cally,\" but for now, there was no need for her to let anyone see her like this. She just had to play an obedient little maid and clean this place. She Opened the other two windows to allow more light into the room. While it was hard to tell int he dark, now that there was light, this room obviously occupied the entire first floor. Next she set about properly arranging the furniture. Once that was accomplished, it was time to tackle those cobwebs. Then came the dusting, and finally the floors. Though she had lost track of time along the way, Kelos was sure it had to have been several hours at least, while it was a big job, the entrance to the tower was now clean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One down, who knows how many more to go,\" Kelos said to herself. She headed over to the stairs but found them to be pitch dark. \"Of course, how silly of me. I need a lantern.\" Fortunately there was one in the supply closet just outside the tower. She quickly went to retrieve it, half expecting to find someone looking for her, but this portion of the castle remained deserted. She got the lantern, lit it and headed back to the tower, proceeding up the stairs to the second floor. Here there was a central hall circling the stairs, with three doors leading to exterior rooms.. Like the first floor, the hall was covered in dust and cobwebs. Unlike the first floor, there was a heaviness to the atmosphere. A strange noise sounding almost like whispering filled the air. Kelos hated to admit it, but she was feeling a bit creeped out.</span></div></div>",

Now it was time to clean the rooms in this floor. She tried the one closest to the stairs. The door slowly creeked open, revealing a bedroom that looked like it had been completely wrecked. Furniture wasn't just strewn about, some of it looked like it had been smashed. It looked as if there had been a fight in here. Kelos examined the bed and found several slashes in it, and what looked to be an old blood stain. As she looked around the room she saw more evidence of a struggle, slashes in the walls, torn curtains, more stains that looked like blood splatter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA scenario was forming in her head. This room was being used by someone, a guest perhaps, or a member of the royal family not in close line of succession. Probably a man, but not necessarily so. He was sleeping when an assassin struck. However, the intended victim noticed the intruder and fought back. Their struggle wrecked the room, and left one of them on the bed bleeding out. After this tragedy, the King at the time, Arthras? His father? Perhaps even his grandfather? Ordered the room sealed. The tower was locked, untouched, except to send new maids to \"clean\" until they give up as a form of hazing. Though that last part didn't make much sense. Why would they just leave this room untouched all this time? Kelos made a mental note to ask someone about this, then left the room and moved on to see how bad the other rooms were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reentered the hallway and moved on to the next room. This one she found empty, save dust and cobwebs. She got right to work on this room, opening the window, giving it a good dusting, then finishing up with a quick mopping. In a short time, this room looked good enough to house guests again. It just needed some furniture of course, but she was sent to clean, not redecorate. Satisfied with her work here, Kelos left and moved on to the final room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kelos approached the third door, she noticed the eerie noises became louder. Clearly they were emanating from here. She swallowed and opened the door. To her shock the room was lit by some lanterns on the wall. The furniture looked clean and in good repair. It seemed as if this room had someone living in it. Though Kelos has seen no trace of anyone coming to this tower in a long time. Still, it was impossible for those lanterns to have been burning all this time. The noise was louder still, and Kelos thought it sounded like a woman's voice. She felt a chill down her spine. Still she had a job to do, and only this room and the murder room were left to clean.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kelos steeled herself, as she stepped into the strangely lived in room; figuring it'd be better to tackle the other for last. This one barely needed more than a quick froofing, and besides, leaving those lanterns on risked a fire hazard. Of course, those even <i>being there</i> was a <i>tad</i> ominous, but something that wasn't going to scare her away. She was a man of action! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Woman of action? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaid of action, really. But whatever the form, turning back now offered few benefits. More alone time meant less a chance of getting caught, and it was all under the guise of 'doing her job.' Who knew? Maybe she could actually shake up the pecking order around there if it turned out she was the only person to actually sweep through the entire tower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she started to do just as she did for every other corner of the keep; clean, with feather duster in tow. The insides seemed fairly innocuous, honestly. Had she no prior knowledge, it could have been a simple guest bedroom found anywhere, sans the slightly peculiar sight of open books lying around, and the heavily filled shelf which lined the corner adjacent to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Maybe this is used by one of Traevan's court magicians? A secret \u201chome away from home?\u201d Only types I could think of that'd be interested in texts like <b>these</b>...'</i> Truthfully, the redhead had no clue what she was looking at, as she peered into one of the tomes. Very complicated, and in a language she wasn't familiar with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Though I'm not sure how long they could last, with insulation this bad...'</i> The minute she stepped in to the abode, things, for some reason, began to get chillier. Thumbing the hem of her skirt, Kelos suddenly found a new respect for the profession she was (temporarily) adopting. <i>'I should have a talk with father when I get back about the current uniform situation for the castle help. If it's anything to the degree of the servants here, then those girls deserve an upgrade.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the more reason though to finish up sooner rather than later. That bloodied murder room was looking a <i>teensy</i> more appealing at the moment. Clearly there was something wrong structurally in this part of the tower. It'd certainly explain that curious, high pitched echoing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more minutes passed, and the maid-princess (princess-maid?) was putting on the last few touches to her task. It had to be said, that at least <i>that</i> part of the 'job' wasn't so bad. There was a strange sense of pride in knowing that getting everything tidied up to a mirror sheen was something <i>she</i> was responsible for. With any luck, it'd garner some kudos from her fellow 'employees.' Proof that the 'new girl' wasn't some clumsy, bumbling ditz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight as this thought came through, a strange gust wisped past behind Kelos, and a sweet, but oddly ethereal voice, offered one token of commentary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoo~!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos echoed an intelligent retort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEep~!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, the girl twisted around; eyes shut, as she waved her duster around in a wild, reactive attempt, to smack away whatever snuck up to assail her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer balance though was soon caught undone, as all she smacked into was seemingly thin air; leading her to unfortunately lean a <i>tad</i> too hard back, and stumble toward the bookshelf she'd so diligently de-cluttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe aftermath was her falling flatly on her fanny, and feeling the harsh sting of several thick layers of leather-bound paper bonk against her noggin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*thud*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*thud*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*thud*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh dear...\u201d came the response of the yet unknown figure. The only thing Kelos could tell at that time was that she was a she, and that she appeared to be something that should, theoretically only exist in storybooks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn apparition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA specter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A ghost!</i></span></div></div>",

The book naturally passed through, landing harmlessly on the floor with a thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, I'm not going to hurt you,\" the ghost said. \"My name is...\" she paused and thought for a bit. \"Oh dear, I can't seem to remember.

Fia had no brothers, at least none born from Arthras' now deceased wife. That meant at a minimum she had been here since Arthras was born?!! Perhaps longer, it could easily be Arthras' father she was talking about. \"Was the child named Arthras?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That name does sound familiar,\" the ghost replied. \"Perhaps it was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how did you become a ghost?\" Kelos asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ghost paused in thought. \"I was visiting. To celebrate the birth of the royal baby. I heard noise in the room next door. I opened the door to see what it was, then I saw myself in the floor covered in blood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must have been killed as a potential witness,\" Kelos said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Witness?\" the ghost asked, with a clueless look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The room next door looked like someone was murdered in it,\" Kelos said. \"You probably heard the victim fighting for their life. But I don't understand why it hasn't been cleaned. That happened ages ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that might be my fault,\" the ghost said. \"Every time someone came up here I tried to talk to them then they got scared and ran off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And after a while, they just locked off this part of the castle,\" Kelos observed as she got up and dusted herself off. She then began to pick up the old books and put them back on the shelf. \"Do you remember anything else about that night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so,\" the ghost replied. \"Nothing's very clear except that moment I'm looking down at my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I can at least try to find out your name,\" Kelos said as she finished putting the books away. \"There's got to be a record someplace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" the ghost asked. \"Thank you Miss Kelos.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to thank me,\" Kelos replied. \"Solving this little mystery will give me something to do besides cleaning rooms.\"</span></div></div>",

Despite her embarrassing panic attack, she was able to sort out the damage done to the bookshelf relatively quickly. There <i>was</i> the murder room across the hall, but should she really tamper with it? There could be clues- evidence towards her planned 'investigation.' Maybe it'd be best to come back later to search around with better tools? On the other hand, this might be the only chance-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo!

Black dresses and pinafores didn't exactly scream 'noble prince and military general.' \u201cTemporarily?... It's complicated.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ghost giggled. \u201cIsn't it always? I take it you're new, though?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNew at a lot of things...\u201d Kelos offered, as her skirt swished a tad.

I <i>think</i> I remember the castle maids all being very pretty, and you're cute as a button!\u201d She took the liberty of approaching the other girl, and tap her nose <i>right</i> with her ethereal finger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCold!\u201d Kelos mewled; hands going up instinctively to soothe the spot, in a 'button-cute' gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! I'm so sorry! I'm still not used to interacting with people!\u201d The specter cried; hovering close with concern, but not laying a finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe servant sniffled as she tried to shake off the strange feeling; like dipping her face into an ice box. \u201cIt's- it's fine,\u201d She said, before pausing. \u201cYou really think I'm cute?\u201d Kelos didn't mean to sound so girlish asking that, but how she really looked was a question she'd been pondering ever since opening that scroll. The scribe and the guards certainly wouldn't risk calling her ghoulish, lest they wanted to swiftly find themselves in the royal unemployment line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAdorable!\u201d The cryptid happily chirped. \u201cWhy, I'm sure you'll find a knight soon enough who'll sweep you off your feet! I don't know if things have changed much since I was alive, but what man <i>doesn't</i> love a domestic? And a pretty one at that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos began blushing as red as her mane. There were <i>so</i> many things wrong with that statement, but she wasn't exactly 100% confident about unveiling her true gender, as well as social status, to an unliving poltergeist. At least at <i>this</i> time. Surely waiting for the second rendezvous wasn't <i>too much</i> to ask, right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr, w- well, thank you! Miss Ghost. You seem very kind.\u201d The princess-maid's hands went to the front of her apron. \u201cI'm not sure why someone would do something as to hurt you like that, but I want to help you out as much as I can!\u201d She was being sincere. Maid or prince(ss), Kelos still had a good heart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr at least tried to have one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shade smiled at the young thing in front of her. \u201cAnd I can see <i>you're</i> very sweet, Miss Kelos! It's a pleasure being given your aid!\u201d She stopped, as she glanced over at the adjacent door. \u201cThough I don't want to keep any of your mistresses waiting...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe helper nodded.

When she first saw this girl, the older, slightly more jaded woman, instantly figured there was something fishy about her. A personal handmaiden gifted from Grovan to Princess Fia? She could be an assassin! Or a spy! Or a plain layabout the rival kingdom wanted to do away with!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's why she took matters into her own hands. Fia already had plenty of attendants, but the castle, ever busy, was sorely in need of some extra help. And what better way to test this creature's mettle than to see how long she'd last in the west tower? 'Haunted,' as it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHa!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, yes Ma'am? Up to the top, at least.\u201d For Kelos, it was strangely intimidating talking to this lady. She was so serious... Plus it didn't help how small that scroll made her! A dwarf she wasn't, but it felt like everyone she came across was taller!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI climbed a flight or two earlier, it seems pretty thorough, Mistress.\u201d Chimed in another maid was near her superior's side. The name 'Buffy' rang through Kelos' mind. She remembered her because they both shared a similar red hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI almost went to the top, but was too scared!\u201d A blonde one yelped; Kelos hearing the name 'Mandy' shuffled around her a lot. \u201cVery clean, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh.\u201d The supervisor mused; standing there quietly for a moment. She stared <i>right</i> into Kelos' aqua eyes for an <i>uncomfortably</i> long time, until she did something that caught Kelos completely off guard: Patting her gently, right on the head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, good work then! Maybe you'll be of help to us after all!\u201d She turned. \u201cGirls! I want you to treat Cally here as a fellow sister! We may not have her for long, but a good work ethic like that is hard to come by!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like that, the newly minted maid had the two of them on her; poking and prodding as they saw fit. \u201cI love your hair!\u201d Hummed Buffy. \u201cYou're so tiny! How did you move everything?\u201d Praised Mandy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all causing Kelos to blush. Strange how friendly everyone was able to start acting. \u201cYou must be exhausted!\u201d The redhead began. \u201cWe'll show you to the Maid's Quarters!\u201d The blonde finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, that's right. Your shift is over with for tonight. I think, out of anyone, you've earned some supper and time to relax.\u201d Cynthia remarked, before becoming more stern at her assistants. \u201cI <i>expect</i> you two to ensure she knows the schedule for the rest of the upcoming week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Mistress!\u201d Buffy and Mandy's exuberance wasn't toned down an ounce; both likely used to the commanding voice of their overseer. Instead, they locked arms around Cally, and started to rather quickly drag her down the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFace cherry as a tomato, and more confused than she would like to be, Kelos nevertheless still had questions on her mind about 'Miss Ghost.' As much as she was glad things were going smoothly on this end, maybe it'd be for the best to use some of her 'leisure time' to ask questions? Buffy and Mandy, for all she knew, had their ears plenty well to the ground. Plus, it'd be at least <i>one</i> topic to gossip about that didn't involve dresses, cosmetics, or other subject matter she unfortunately was uneducated in regards to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, this was probably going to turn out to be a <i>very</i> interesting week... </span></div></div>",

So it's not a suitor for a princess?\" Buffy asked with a hint of disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There could be other ghosts,\" Mandy said. She then turned to Kelos. \"Cally, you must tell us everything you saw.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos then regaled her new friends with her tale, the eerie sounds as she was cleaning, the room that seemed to have had a murder in it, the encounter with Miss Ghost herself. The two maids hung on her every word. It seemed incredible, a room in the tower that hadn't been touched in decades with evidence of a murder, a ghost that seemed to be friendly but with no memories of how she died. There was only one thing on the two maids' minds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanna meet the ghost!\" Buffy exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to meet her too,\" Mandy said. \"We can be the ones to finally solve the mystery of the haunted tower\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're off duty for today, so we could go up now,\" Kelos replied. With that the three of them changed destinations and returned to the tower.</span></div></div>",

He was deep in thought coming up with the appropriate punishment for his scribes when Jack the stable boy held a shovel in front of him.  \"Break time is over.  Back to the old dung pile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Kelos said unbelieving, \"I just finished scraping up all of that less than an hour ago!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And since then a few of the horses have given you some more work to do.  Horses crap multiple times a day, just because a pretty girl scrapes it up doesn't mean they stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why bother dedicating yourself to such a minor and disgusting chore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stable boy looked at the attractive assistant with confused eyes and matter of factually said, \"It's my life, it's what I do.  And for the next week it's your life too.  We take care of the stables, we make this place look pristine on a daily basis, and as disgusting as it seems, that includes taking care seemingly never ending pile the horse crap.\"  Jack noticed that his words seemed to have depressed his assistant.  Knowing that he wanted to keep the girl in a good mood decides to make his move.  \"But it is a good life.  I get to take care of these majestic creatures and in my own little way I'm holding this kingdom together.\" Jack added with a cocky grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos looked at the stable boy with pity.  <i>Is that really what this delusional boy tells himself to get through the day?</i>  \"What do you mean by that?\"  Kelos asked genuinely interested in what Jack's crazy reasoning would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack simply gave the girl a wide grin, \"Let's just say horse dung isn't the only ugly thing I keep away from the public eye.\"  Knowing he had the girl on a hook, Jack made his way back into the stables, and as if write on cue Kelos ran up to him and curiously asked, \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...it's nothing.  I've said too much.\"  Jack said coyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No please, tell me what you are implying.\"  Kelos said with bated breath.  If this stable boy had any information that could give him even the slightest advantage over the kingdom of Traeven he had to take it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you know what it's like with your Prince Kelos, Cally.  All servants have a little bit of dirt on their lords, it's just that the things I know happen to be of much significance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that would be?\" Kelos asked anxiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you what.  We'll see how the evening progresses.\"  Jack said starting to lean into his buxom assistant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right.\" Kelos said, and assuming the Jack was just talking about working in the stables started to shovel with a new vigor.  Jack shook his head and walked up behind Kelos and put himself against 'her' and said rather breathily in 'her' ear.  \"Let me help you out there Cally, your technique is all wrong.\"  So Jack put his hands on top of 'Cally's' and began to make a fluid motion that even Kelos couldn't help but notice were very sensual.  Kelos was ready to protest but silences himself when he remembers that this perverted boy might just have the key to helping him take over this kingdom.  As if reading his thoughts Jack began getting more and more aggressive in his motions, which included smelling 'Cally's' hair and then began to kiss 'her' neck.</span></div></div>",

With an authority she lacked, she stared him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling ruefully to herself, sure her own secret was far more potent. The stable boy with delusions of grandeur. If she's blurted out her true identity would it have sounded any more convincing. Hoping to get more from disinterest, outwardly Cally shrugged. A rather more distracting gesture now, with her new body. Instantly, Jack's gaze snapping to her cleavage, and the deliciously rippling flesh there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you what... You shovel shit... and I'll shovel the hay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d3/81/ea/d381eab340e8320ce0d14d7a8efde180.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d3/81/ea/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStraightening up, and pulling her shoulders back, Cally liked how easily men are to manipulate and distract. He blushed, as his eyes drifted up from the view to her face. It was hard for Cally to put a stern look of disapproval on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do a good job, and I might fake some interest.\" She projected as much authority and conviction as possible into her empty words. She'd been assigned her as HIS assistant, but a jiggly cleavage reduced him to an imbecile. Cally had caught more than a few glances to her juicy and overstuffed rump too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You promise.\" He blurted, before blushing crimson, and going to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, Cally smiled, a twinkle in her eye. He should be busy the rest of the day now. Alas, it didn't free her from the job either. As a prince, his father had set Kelos to do most of the jobs in the castle for a brief experience to better understand everyone's role, so Kelos was familiar with hard work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Cally's body wasn't enchanted to these labours. The work was a grind, and her arms weak, her tits heavy, and awkward. The girls made her curse, as they'd throw her off balance, or just get in the way. For the first time in Kelos' life, he wished a woman had less to display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was time to take a break, she was ready to collapse. Only dislike of showing weakness in front of a stable boy kept her on her feet. Certain instincts survived from her former life. Only when Jack nodded towards the straw as a seat did Cally allow herself to sit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe straw was softer than she thought, and Cally sank further and faster than she meant. A girlish squeal of surprise bursting from her lips. The bounce, and the pain in her rump were humiliating. She felt like she was about to spill from her top. Hands leaping to her bust, she checked she hadn't slipped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/9a/75/29/9a75294047d898669cd2e634c9fe85c9.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/9a/75/29/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack just goggled, as Cally smirked. Despite everything her dignity was intact. That illusion shattered, as she looked to Jack's leering face. Her cradling hands seeming to offer up the most spectacular cleavage for his approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if shocked her hands recoiled from her top. Backing away, from the predatory Jack, Cally's legs struggled for purchase in the loose straw, and as she scrambled away, in an ungainly backwards scuttle, she lost her balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/7f/a5/ab/7fa5ab40794203502e5accc6aa2a7d31.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/7f/a5/ab/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack strode slowly, but deliberately towards her.</span></div></div>",

So when Jack jerked his assistant around and probed his tongue into her mouth, Kelos managed to not bite it off like he wanted to.  And he really wanted to.  Even though Kelos was allowing this to happen he certainly wasn't enjoying it.  At one point he tried to just imagine Jack was the princess.  It even worked for a little while and Kelos was starting to get into it, but the Jack's facial stubble rubbing against him put a stop to that fantasy instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Jack seemed to be finished with the foreplay and much to Kelos's surprise, lifted 'Cally' up onto a workbench in the back to the stable.

GUARDS!\"  Jack said as he sprinted to the stable door.  Eyes wide in shock Kelos realized he'd said to much to the stupid stable boy, and if he got to the guards he was done for.  So Kelos started after Jack to hopefully take him out before he got to a guard, but he only got one step before he tripped over his own dress he'd dropped to the floor and fell face first into the pile of horse dung he'd been scooping for the last hour.  Kelos got out of the mess trying not to vomit and was greeted by a pair of large armored Traeven guards.  Kelos again tried to run away but even if he had his normal body he stood no chance against the well trained guards.  In less than an hour he was put in chains and tossed into the castle dungeon still covered in royal horse manure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos shouted out threats and pleas for help but it was no use.  One by one his escorting guards were also thrown in different cells.  Last of all the scribe who Kelos blamed for all of this happening as thrown into the cell next to his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look what you've done now scribe.  Thanks to you we will have to spend our days in these cells until mother and father send the armies to rescue me.  And let me assure you that when they do I will leave you here to rot with your stupid scrolls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt that will happen,\"  The scribe snapped, it seemed he actually might have grown a little bit of a spine with a cell wall between him and the abusive Prince.  \"For you see as I told you the enchantment on you will wear off, and when the king sees that Prince Kelos was the one who was spying on the kingdom he will declare on your kingdom and will probably execute you as a prisoner of war.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos gulped, he hadn't thought of this.  \"But, they can't do that!  I'm the prince!  Nothing like that could happen to me!  Please!  Scribe!  I-I order you to do something!  Get me out of this!  I don't want to be executed!\"  Kelos was now crying like a baby in his cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scribe seemed to enjoy the moment of realization for the prince, but alas he was still loyal to his kingdom and had to do what needed to be done.  \"Don't worry my prince, I can help you.  I managed to some scrolls past the guards when I was thrown in here, and I have the perfect on for you that will stop you from being executed and perhaps save the kingdom from war.\"  He held out a yellow scroll through the bars that Kelos grabbed immediately.  As he ripped the scroll open, the prince (a few seconds too late) asked the scribe, \"What will this do?\"  Kelos heard the scribe answer him just before he was engulfed in light.</span></div></div>",

The past day or so had to have been the most embarrassing and humiliating she'd ever experienced!

She let her sister lead her down the hall, and past the royal bath chambers. \"Ori the bath...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not using the royal bath,\" Orianna replied. That this girl knew where it was led credence to her claim of being Kelos. \"You'll get it covered in dung. We shall use the servant's bath instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But people will see me like this!\" Kelos protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Consider it punishment for ruining my dress,\" Orianna replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry,\" Kelos said as she saw the dung clinging to her sister's clothes. \"Can we at least take the back way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Orianna said. She led Kelos to a door that led to the servant's stairs. A maid coming up the stairs spotted them, staring at Kelos for a moment before noticing Orianna and curtsying. Kelos turned bright red at being seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess, are you okay?\" the maid asked. Her eyes again turned to Kelos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfectly,\" Orianna said. \"Could you be so kind as to bring a change of clothes for both of us to the servant's bath and tell no one about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Princess,\" the maid replied. She then scurried off to find clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos and Orianna continued down the stairs to the servant's quarters. Kelos hid behind Orianna as they passed a few more castle staff on the way down, but they eventually arrived at the servant's bath. The two entered and looked around. The room was empty, with only some grooming supplies and a few wooden tubs barely large enough for a person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These tubs are a bit small,\" Kelos said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why they're perfect,\" Orianna replied as she slipped off her dress. \"They can be emptied and cleaned out easily. Unlike the royal baths that will need to be drained and scrubbed. Now get in and I'll make sure you're nice and clean while you tell me everything that happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos began her tale of misfortune as Orianna took some soap, lathered up a sponge and began scrubbing. She went in detail about the scroll, being told to be the assistant to the stable boy, the way the stable boy treated her, getting arrested, then finally teleported back home, and what their parents told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww my poor little sister had a tough day,\" Orianna said, hugging Kelos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you believe me?\" Kelos asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, no one could make up a tale like that,\" Orianna replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that they heard a knock.

There wasn't anything special about her uniform- it was the one all workers wore around the keep, but never before did she pay so much attention to the bare valley of skin between the hem of her dress, and her stockings... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fit of giggles brought the redhead out of her musings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, <i>sister</i>, you're making this <i>very</i> difficult to not find amusing.\u201d Orianna's voice held a playful lilt to it, even as they continued to the king's quarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOrrrriiii~!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwice now Kelos' voice reverted to a whine like that. It honestly reminded Orianna of back when they were kids, with her little 'brother' always running to her for help. With the higher pitch even, she could almost imagine she traveled right back there...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, the more things change, the more they stay the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, yes. I understand, dear. You had an <i>awful</i> day.\u201d She said, turning to her kin, and placing her hands around her shoulder. \u201cYou might want to watch your tone though, especially with what father has you wearing. Royalty can get away with saying much, but the help...\u201d Seeing the 'maid's' face scrunch with worry almost caused Ori to turn a simple condolence into a bear-hug. An inch or two shorter, and Kelos could easily be mistaken for an oversized doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...That said, if you keep making a face like you are, I'm sure he'll be a tad bit more lenient~.\u201d Orianna gave a dramatic sigh. \u201c<i>Dear oh dear!</i> my little sister, <i>already</i> learning the womanly arts!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos responded by doing what she was wont to do that day- complain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Orrrriiii~!</i>\u201d</span></div></div>",

His soldiers watched as the captain's developing body ripped the shirt to shreds. Even her arms expanded  until she was naked, and shaking the remnants of her clothes away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were no longer providing any cover, protecting any decency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe changes accelerated, with the Captain's hand curling up into a fist. She held it in front of her face, and glowered at it. The fist refused to be intimidated, the fingers merging together as it hardened into a black lump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kicked off her boots, and saw that her feet were taking on similar changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm ...

Even as she kept her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... as in female horse.\" the scribe watched as the filly's eyes widened. Her hand darted about, as it glanced beneath the four carriage horses. Each picked for their strength, and speed, consequently each was a powerful stallion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe changes ascended her neck, and her nostrils flared, as she scented the musky aroma of the stallions. Her nose and mouth stretching forward, as her eyes pulled wider. Perky ears flicked up onto her top of her head, dancing nervously as she signalled her fear, and listened for any approaching danger.</span></div></div>",

YOU, insist that an ordinary trooper takes my place.\" Her voice almost an ear-bleeding screech as she finishes her objection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalming her, he puts a soothing hand on her shoulder, \"These are merely disguise scrolls.\" he explains patiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quiet sigh, and a sad look to the filly, \"This only gives you the appearance, temporarily of a particular form, whether as a wench or a filly.\" Breathing hissing awkwardly between his teeth he continues, \"If you take a second disguise form. So, if you were to use a scroll to restore your body, then this....\" he gestures to Kelos' body and abundant curves, \"then this would become your real body when the scroll wore off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to underline it, he turns sadly towards the filly, \"You, Captain have doomed yourself to a female life with your impetuousness, once you're restored from being a filly, you'll become that beautiful blonde girl once more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe filly's eyes shoot wide, and her breath curls from her nose in the night air, as it sinks in. Not merely her current predicament, but also what she has to look forward to, on regaining her humanity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, that's why Trooper Deth needs to become the Prince, with you acting as... sorry, sir. But, you'll have to pretend to be his concubine. It's the only way you can stay by his side.... and, you'll have to play the part to be convincing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos' cheeks turn redder and redder, as protests head towards her mouth, as protests, as insults, as denials battle to be spoken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer shoulders collapse, and she nods slowly, resigned to what is necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer father isn't cruel, but he does punish failure, and doesn't spare family. If he were to return without a deal, he'd probably keep that womanly body, and be sold off as a simple bride to ensure an alliance. Kelos thought of his sister, and how she'd react to this opportunity, perhaps teasing her new big sister. Or worse insisting on become a Prince to replace her failed brother. He knew that the filly would never become human, instead life as a broodmare would be her destiny. Doomed to serve beneath a mindless sweating stallion through pregnancy again and again, until her humanity was only a painful, tortured memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sire.\" the scribe interrupted the prince's humiliating, and terrified thoughts. \"The King trusted me with these scrolls. I'm sorry, but he considered you too impetuous.\" with the least of shrugs, and the lightest of gestures he indicated the princes' body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He also wanted the secret kept as ... <i>well</i>, secret as possible.\" He gave the filly a sad shrug as an apology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This means I'll be in charge until, we return with a deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDigging into his bag, he pulled out a purple scroll wrapped around an oak spindle. Thrusting it into Trooper Deth's hands, he saw the terrified trooper look at it like a poisonous snake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suggest you get over your nervousness, you have the rest of the journey to make a convincing Prince, bred with years of arrogance to authority.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kelos' cheeks burn once more, eager to protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you my prince, you have the hardest role. You need to play his doxy, a woman who lives for the teasing caresses, and tickling touch of her man. If you can't convince them your presence is wanted, even essential to Kelos' good mood, you find yourself outside the key meetings, and unable to help your 'Prince'...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another deep sigh, the scribe continued, \"Our treaty is more necessary than ever before, both for the King, the Kingdom, and the restoration of your bodies, you need to be completely convincing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the corner of his eye, Kelos saw a blue flash, and a starled Prince Kelos looking uncomfortable in a rather plain slightly tatty Trooper uniform. With as much dignity and distance as they could manage, the pair put on their new outfits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former prince tugging the neckline of her peasant dress, desperate to cover as much of her supple flesh as possible. Giving them as much time, as much privacy as possible. The scribe secured the filly with a long rein to the back of the carriage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRapping softly on the carriage door, he spoke through it, reminding them of the need to practice, as much as they could for the remains of the journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA high startled, offended shriek, was followed by the sound of flesh slapping. Muttering a silent prayer to the Gods, the scribe got the party moving towards Traeven.</span></div></div>",

Clearly unaware of how this is displaying her bust like a display of fine watermelons at a market stall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sire.\" he doesn't try to hide his exasperation as he address the busty beauty. \"You cannot act like this. You lack the... body.\" he gestured to her abundant curves and how she filled them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to the chastened guard, \"Trooper Deth. You need to act like the Prince.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, knowing the barrage of objections that were about to erupt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think, a Prince would do with a beauty, who resisted his advances.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising a hand, he silenced, the Prince her lips already parted to object. \"Sire, you never allowed this to happen.\" With a tilt of his head, he indicated the slapped cheek of 'the Prince'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaping like a landed fish, no words came out. But Kelos dreaded where this conversation was leading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to the overwhelmed guard, \"A strike for a strike, your majesty. Though, I think a member of the nobility would allow the woman to keep her shame private.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeth just looked confused, \"No marks on her face. You can't slap her back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a loud groan, he continued, \"Have you never seen his majesty spanking a flighty maid...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Deth's turn to gasp, and gape like the landed fish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you don't find the burden too much.\" he added, \"All our lives hang on your ability to convince the castle, that <b>you </b>are the Prince, and <b>you </b>are his willing doxy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe allowed that nugget of information to sink in. \"If you don't think you can do that.... or rather if <i><b>I,</b></i> don't think you'll convince then I'll turn this party around, and you'll have to face your father, the King, and plead to be restored as his son, and not serve as his daughter, to be wed to a stranger, like Princess Fia. You'd better learn to smile, and laugh when needed. Oh, and learn to be fucked like a princess and bear the royal line.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doxy's angry face, lost all it's angry redness, as she became paler and paler, already knowing her... (No, not yet), his father's reaction to failure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you understand?\" he pointed to 'the Prince', and received a nod of agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you understand?\", Kelos unfolded her arms from her bust, her plush lower lip bitten by her perfect white teeth. But she too nodded her assent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, a little exercise, to ensure you learn your new places.\" The Scribe prepared his suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to be comfortable being fondled, admired and ignored. Treated like a pretty ornament.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning towards 'the Prince'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you, need to learn to make her giggle and laugh at your touch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing, \"Do you recall Sally?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxy the Doxy, sat back in her chair, shaking her head, not in confusion, but denial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Majesty, your indiscretions are known, and covered at court.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to trooper Deth, \"You need to get that information from her before we reach the castle, otherwise I'll have to turn our little party around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxy was tight lipped and clearly not wanting to reveal his past misdeeds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suggest, that switching between spanking and tickling can unbalance the most resistant of women, confusing and confounding their expectations, mixing the pain and the pleasure, until she breaks and confesses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the two figures, he returned to the top of the carriage, and with a flick of the reins the party set off once again.</span></div></div>",

Perhaps it would be best to assume a new identity. After all, the goal was to marry Princess Fia, which would be most difficult with her current form. An emissary sent ahead? It would certainly be better than the damage to Prince Kelos' reputation appearing as a woman in front of his bride. But perhaps there was a way to turn even this into an advantage. A magical trap set by a faction of the court opposed to the marriage? The prince, even changed into a woman continued onward to seek Princess Fia's hand, thwarting the conspirator's thirst for blood. Kelos smirked at this thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your highness?\" Jex asked, picking those words as to not anger Kelos regardless of what he... she decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am considering it,\" Kelos snapped, agitating the captain.

Likewise, being called princess could be seen as adaptability to sudden changes, or being weak willed and unsuited as a husband.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that overthinking things?\" Jex asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps, but sometimes even the smallest thing can be the difference between success and failure in politics,\" Kelos replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sounds like it would be safer to pretend to be someone else,\" Jex said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was considering that as well.

The carriage made its way through the main gate, into the castle's courtyard. Kelos looked out the window and saw a man in a robe standing at the top of a flight of stairs leading to the door to the castle itself. Standing in rows on either side were guards in what appeared to be ceremonial armor. A trumpet blared a a voice cried out, \"NOW ARRIVING, PRINCE KELOS OF GROVALD!\" The carriage came to a stop in front of the stairs.\"Here goes nothing,\" Kelos thought. She got out of the carriage and started walking up the stairs, a task complicated by her currently ill fitting clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the meaning of this?!\" The man wearing the rode asked angrily. \"Who are you, girl, and where is Prince Kelos!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Kelos!\" Kelos replied. \"Though at the moment I suppose princess would be more fitting. There was an incident on my journey here. I would like to consult with the castle magician as soon as possible. Someone planted some spell scrolls among my diplomatic materials. I was not the only one affected.\" She turned and gestured towards the scribe and the captain. \"Nor the worst. That filly is the captain of my guards. I hope this was merely an accident and not an attempt by certain factions of my court to sabotage my mission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man looked at Kelos and the filly for a moment. \"Why should I believe you? Surely a Prince would not alloy himself to be seen as a weak woman if so transformed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I came because I wish to take the hand of the fair Princess Fia,\" Kelos replied. \"It shall require more than a curse such as this to stop me, both for love of Princess Fia, and a desire for peace. I will not let those who would go so far as to transform me to prevent it and restart the war succeed! My dignity as a prince may be damaged as a result, but what is my dignity compared to my duty? A duty that I have whether I am a prince or princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man paused for a moment to consider Kelos' words. \"Very well. I shall accept your story. I am Tromil, advisor to King Arthras.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allow me to formally introduce myself, I am Kelos of Grovan, normally first prince, but at the moment second princess.

Of someone, some guard being on the other side makes you wave away the gesture. Even the idea of them seeing the clothes laid out for you, makes you squirm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can guess, that the palace corridors, aren't made for beasts, of her dimensions. I'm sure, that Marlin will head over to the stables as soon as he is able.\" Cynthia guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the truth of her answer, you wonder why you didn't think of it yourself. But looking down at your body, you find ample reason for your own distraction and lack of focus.</span></div></div>",

The sheer feminine aura of the dress was a bit off putting. \"I don't like pink,\" she said flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about this one, my lady?\" Mandy asked, as she held up a deep burgundy dress, there was no lace, but the dress seemed to shimmer in the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos was reminded of a glass of red wine as she looked at the dress. \"Better,\" she replied, \"but I'm not sure I really want to wear it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really want to wear any of them?\" Buffy called out from behind the partition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not particularly,\" Kelos said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then don't think of it as which you'd like best, but which one you'd dislike the least,\" Buffy said in a cheerful voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos paused to consider Buffy's words.

You decided to call yourself princess. Embrace the roll while you can. Be Princess Kelos, not Prince Kelos in a dress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was something Kelos had not considered.

She instinctively started to bow, but realized doing so would allow the king a view of her breasts. She quickly transitioned into a curtsy, hoping it didn't come off awkwardly. \"I apologize for my tardiness, but my trip here had some complications, which I'm sure you're aware of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Complications?\" King Arthras questioned. \"I was expecting a suitor for my daughter, and instead I find a competitor. Why did you come here like that? I hardly think we need another bride to be. Did the magic make your mind that of a feeble woman as it did your body?\" He glared at Kelos, attempting to intimidate her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My purpose remains unchanged!\" Kelos retorted confidently, unfazed by the King's harsh tone. Indeed, she had expected to be confronted like this, even had she still been Prince Kelos. After all, her goal was the King's daughter. \"I have come to take Princess Fia's hand in marriage and unite our kingdoms in peace! This body is merely temporary. Soon enough I shall be back to normal with a body befitting my manliness!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You speak of manliness, yet I am told it was you who decided to be called princess,\" Athras said sternly. \"You did not seek to consult the wizard Marlin about your form when told I wished to see you immediately, yet you thought nothing of making me wait while you picked out a dress and had your hair and makeup done. How feminine of you. Perhaps that form reflects your true self, <i>girl</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Touch\u00e9,\" Kelos thought to herself. Clearly the king hoped this would strike a blow at Kelos' confidence. However, Kelos was not about to let that happen. \"Necessary trappings that come with this form, it seems,\" she replied. \"The one I was sent to, Cynthia, insisted. I have no experience being a woman, so I followed her council. Is it not wise to take heed from those with expertise in a subject.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed it is wise to consider the words of experts,\" Athras admitted. \"However, what purpose does following advice on how to be a better woman serve for you and your claim to wish to return to being a man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None,\" Kelos admitted. \"However, appearing presentable in front of the father of the woman I wish to make my bride does further my goal of marrying Princess Fia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well then,\" Athras said, appearing to be satisfied by Kelos' responses. \"Though it is a pity you are so insistent on my daughter and returning to a man. You make a fine woman. Would you not consider remaining one and becoming my new mistress?\"</span></div></div>",

This would be a most flattery proposal to any pretty girl in the kingdom that would come with it's own political powers and advantages but Kelos viewed himself as being far above those games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs offended as he was Kelos did something he very rarely did and kept himself in check, after Arthras was still the king and Kelos still needed to convince him to let him marry his daughter Fia.  Kelos simply curtsied again and with a very pretty false smile said, \"It is a flattering offer that I had never considered, but alas I do wish to regain my masculinity so that I might properly court your daughter, great king.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthras' face gave away as little as Kelos' did.  He had expected the brash prince to react so that he could have an excuse to reject him outright and keep the blame solely on Kelos so that he would go home in shame making Traeven all the more powerful from a bargaining standpoint, but the former boy did not bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, you have my permission to meet with Marlin tomorrow morning if he is not busy with other matters, but with all the great work he does for Traeven he may have to leave your...mistake for later.  But no matter what your form I expect to see you in the ball tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ball you say?  I was unaware of a celebration, might I ask the occasion?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are celebrating my daughter Fia's 19th year.  We have invited dignitaries from all the neighboring lands, many of whom I assume will try to court her like yourself.  Did you not receive your invitation?  Ah well, it must have passed you on your trip here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos was outraged but once again managed to not show it, his mind was racing with rage.  How dare the king not just give Fia to him now and be done with it, he was the best suitor for Fia by far in both looks and power.  He had thought he had time to pursue Fia when he was back to himself, but if other courters are on their way now he had to act quickly and use his time wisely.  As his mind raced, Kelos willed his body to not betray himself as he forced himself to once again curtsy and said, \"I thank you for the invitation King Arthras.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Kelos made his leave followed closely by Cynthia who seemed please, \"You did well back there Princess Kelos.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And yet I have so much more to do, even more than I'd feared.\"  Kelos said fiercly as he prepared a plan to best attack the situation.  The king had told Kelos to meet with Marlin in the morning, but by his tone and attitude Kelos had a feeling that Marlin would not be able to address his needs if he waited til morning.  And he would most like to try to be himself as soon as possible to make things easier, even if he had to go through Marlin's magic spells himself.  Or if he could swollow his pride he could go see Fia now, tonight and get a head start on the competition for her hand.

However, her fingers fidgeted nervously interrupting wizards was always perilous, usually drawing out their cantankerous side. Xarlat was known to hate visitors, and as a visitor, Kelos didn't expect to be treated too kindly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClasping and relaxing a tiny fist she worked up her courage and knocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was answered almost instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in... come in...\" he called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, she entered.

It's surface covered with phials, and potions in a huge variety of colours. To the old man's right was a book case filled with a variety of scrolls, parchments, books, and assorted magical paraphernalia. On the floor were a couple of cages with rats. A tank, held some creature, although the water was rather too murky to reveal the animals itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take a seat....\" He gestured vaguely, still not looking at his new arrival. Kelos was used to more respect on entering a room, but this wizard's tone was lighter than Xarlat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning an ink stained finger down the page, he muttered and nodded to himself, apparently satisfied for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wishing to disturb the old man, she settled down on the little three-legged stool. It was in front of a full length mirror. She gritted her teeth as she adjusted herself, the chair scrapping loudly on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw his shoulders tense up at the noise, and gave a quiet, but sincere apology. Slowly they lowered, with an accompanying sigh.

Kelos was glad when she felt the calloused old hands let go. But that was brief, as the old man stared intently at her amply displayed cleavage. Her cheeks turning crimson, she huffed. This worked against her, as her bust shifted in the tight embrace of her clothes rippling in a more distracting... more eye-catching manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, girl. Purely professional... Just, purely professional.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbsently, he patted the princess on the head like a favourite pet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a busy man, you know.\" he muttered, \"No time.... No time... No time for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shuffled over to the bench. This time his hands floated over a selection of test tubes in a rack. The test tubes were a wide variety of colours and degrees of thickness. A couple bubbled, while glittered in the light. Finally Marlin plucked one from the rack, and offered it to Kelos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell assaulted her, making her nose crinkle in disgust.

A thought crossed her mind about how she should be getting angry, but the feeling of contentment was as of yet unshaken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Immortality elixirs are difficult and expensive to make, but I suppose I could make two of them for a price,\" Marlin said. \"Yes, that will do nicely, then you and Princess Fia could get married.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was hoping to be changed back into a man and not wait a millennium,\" Kelos replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right, that would be a more practical solution,\" Marlin replied. \"So how did this happen to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I opened a scroll, and it turned me into a woman,\" Kelos explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... sounds like a disguise scroll. If so, it should be a simple fix,\" the wizard said. \"Depending on a few things.\" Marlin reached over and pulled a hair out of Kelos' head. He then walked over to a worktable, picked an empty vial off a rack, and placed the hair inside. He then picked a bottle off the shelf above the worktable, and added a few drops to the vial with hair. An acrid smoke spilled up out of the vial, falling towards the floor, forming a cloud that covered the bottom of the room nearly to Marlin's knees. \"Oh my,\" Marlin commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it supposed to do that?\" Kelos asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is, but it isn't,\" the old wizard responded. He waved his hand and a wind swept the room clear of smoke, yet somehow didn't so much as rustle even a single document on any of the tables. \"The smoke is the magic of the disguise spell given physical form. The more there is, the longer it lasts.\" Marlin held up the still smoking vial. \"As you can see, there's no sign of this stopping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it's going to last a really long time?\" Kelos asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes but no,\" Marlin replied. \"You see, girl, the potion I added should have forced all the magic out of a hair sample almost instantaneously. There might be a lot from a long lasting spell, but it should still stop. For it to still be smoking means magic is actively being fed into the spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic? From where?\" Kelos asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that, my dear, is the mystery,\" Marlin said. \"Don't worry your pretty little head though, I'll figure this out. I'd like to do a more thorough examination on you though.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As the air heaved in and out of her lungs she watched, as the skin on the back of her hand took on a rosier, healthier pink. From nowhere, her nails started to also darken from pink to a deeper red, and finally a glossy crimson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let her hand fall limply into her lap, and as she felt her heart beat slowing, her gaze lowered. The sprinkle of freckles that decorated her bosom, was fading, and her skin tone again becoming more even and pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Princess Kelos glimpsed the direction of her changes, she snatched for a lock of hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as she open her clenched fist, it faded losing it's delicate coppery colour, becoming more golden. It also lost it's natural curl, spilling between her fingers as it stretched out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fired an angry look at the wizard, and snorted angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't say who you were!\" Marlin said in an even tone, neither apologising or unsympathetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The king thought a certain uniformity for the maids, would impress the guests.\" he shrugged, and gestured to Kelos' transforming body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, at that moment, Kelos felt pressure building in her chest, and looking down she saw her bust swelling upwards seeking to escape her blouse top. Already the edge of her areola peeking teasingly at the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kelos struggled to hide her embarrassment, her face began to shift around. Her lips filled out and pulled in, giving her the poutiest lips imaginable, the kind of lips that invited a man's imagination, that denied him any other way of picturing her. With a sharp bony crack, Kelos felt her nose shift, becoming more refined, cuter, smaller overall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo more cracks followed in quick succession, and she felt her cheeks become rounder and her cheekbones higher and more defined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos scowled at the wizard, although the effect was more of a teasing pout, Marlin kept a straight expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The king did want a degree of temptation for the suitors, too.\" he admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh p<i>w</i>ease...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos' teeth clicked closed, as soon as she started lisping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can complain all you like, <i>madam</i>.\" Marlin said raising a hand to stop her objecting. \"However, the magic is not to be trifled with, and that <b>is</b>, your form for the next week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her hope fading, Kelos struggled to adjust her neckline, she certainly didn't want to give a peek of her nipples around so many powerful men, especially men who weren't used to being refused.</span></div></div>",

She opened her eyes and looked around. \"Huh? Where am I?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're in my laboratory, girl,\" Marlin said with a friendly tone. \"I'm sorry, but it seems you came at a bad time and were exposed to a potion that can affect memory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girl?\" Kelos replied. She thought something was off about that, but looked down and saw her obviously female body. \"I'm a girl,\" she said with a bit of confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must have gotten a larger dose than I thought,\" the wizard said with a sigh. He grabbed Kelos' chin and turned her head from side to side, looking in each eye. \"Tell me, what do you remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is...\" Kelos said, struggling to remember. \"I know it starts with a K...

Are you a maid?\" He frowned slightly at saying this. Overt manipulation wasn't his preferred method, but the memory potion would wear off in a few days, at which point Kelos would remember who she, he, Marlin corrected himself, really was, so there'd be no long term harm. Plus, at that point Princess Fia would already be engaged to a suitor from another kingdom, stopping Grovan's ambitions on Traeven for good. If he could convince Kelos \"she\" was just a maid, things would be simple and King Arthas would be satisfied. Sure, Kelos would be furious, but there'd be nothing he could do then without risking a war against two kingdoms, a war Grovan would be sure to lose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A maid?\" Kelos repeated. That didn't sound quite right, but that potion had done a number on her mind. Kelos looked down at the dress she was wearing. It certainly didn't look like something a maid would wear. But still, it wasn't impossible. There was also something about a marriage she thought she might possibly remember.</span></div></div>",

Kelos tried to think of what else she could be but her mind was too foggy.  \"I guess you're right.  I am a maid.\"  Kelos said a little reluctantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good,\"  Marlin said happy to have Kelos out of his hair as soon as possible, but Kelos still seemed to have questions.  There were still some vague ideas in his head that didn't quite make complete sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...I think I'm from Grovan, why am I here, this is Traeven right?  You are it's wizard aren't you.\"  Even with softer features Kelos still had eyes that could strike fear into a weaker man's soul.  Marlin gulped and chose his words carefully,  He did not want to reignite old memories but he didn't want Kelos to be curious enough to go prying for the truth where Marlin couldn't control the story.  \"My dear girl you are from Grovan, you were born there but that doesn't matter at all.  You are here in the glorious land of Traeven now, don't think back on Grovan and think of the hear and now.  You have a good job in the royal castle you should be happy and content with yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again Kelos thought something was off but couldn't think of why, after all what Marlin said sense to her once again.  But Kelos still had questions, \"But if I'm a maid, why am I dressed so decadently?\"  She said referring to the fine dress she had worn for her audience with the King.  Marlin made up on the spot, \"Well earlier you were a bit of a klutz and spilled something on your uniform...but our kind and benevolent princess saw you in need and gave you one of her old dresses.  How nice of her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes.  That is very nice of her. to help someone as clumsy as me.\"  Kelos said taking in Marlin's words, \"Princess Fia is so kind and so benevolent and so radiant and so beautiful and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soon to be married.\"  Marlin said cutting off Kelos, it seemed like a bit of the old price was poking out and Marlin needed to stop that and let the memory potion continue to take hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Married?\"  The word struck a chord within Kelos though he wasn't sure why, \"Fia is to be married...to...me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not!\"  Marlin yelped as he moved over to lead new maid out of his laboratory.  \"The Princess is to find a proper suitor within days the idea of that person being you Kelos, a lowly maid I remind you, is silly and scandalous, and not worth even thinking about for a moment.  Now you go to sleep and clear you mind.  Tomorrow you'll get back to work.  I'll make sure a clean uniform is sent to you.  Now go and stop asking question!\"  Marlin breathed a sigh of relief after he threw Kelos out.  Marlin went back to check his other potions as he talked to himself, \"That should be taken care of.  Soon Fia will have a husband to be and that Kelos will be back to normal and go back to Grovan with his tail between his legs...ooh I should work on giving him a tail, I'll tell him it's a side effect when he turns back.  The king will get a good laugh out of that.\"  Marlin chuckled to himself as he got back to work, \"And it's a good thing Kelos took to the maid story, with a job as simple as that there is no way Kelos can get into any trouble that could cause problems for Fia or the King or anything at all.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Traeven wizard talked to himself, a confused maid made her way to the servants quarters trying to figure things out, \"Fia.  Marriage.\"  Kelos kept saying these things to herself.  There was something about those two words that made him feel...something.  Something that told her those two things were important to <br>\r\nher, if only she could remember why.  The next morning Kelos awoke to a magically fitted and stain resistance maid outfit courtasy of Marlin.  Kelos put it on and went to work.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was somewhat puzzled by the seeming lack of recognition from her fellow maids, but then she hadn't been working here that long, and the shifts were probably all mixed up due to the ball, so it wasn't that unusual. Though Kelos thought she saw the other maids glancing at her, whispering to each other, and giggling. Plus, they all seemed to make excuses and leave when she tried to talk to them. \"Maybe they're bullying me,\" Kelos sighed out loud as she got to work polishing the salad forks. Alone, she began to think about Princess Fia. She must be a really nice person to lend a lowly maid like herself a fancy dress after hers got stained. Still, there was something that troubled her. Princess Fia getting married, that sounded like something that should be really important. Kelos tried to remember why, but it felt like no matter how hard she tried, the answer was just out of reach. Again she sighed. It seemed foolish that this was even bothering her. After all, she was just a maid, it's not like it should be affecting her at all, but there was something off about this whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You there! Maid!\" a voice called out, snapping Kelos out of her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?!\" Kelos replied, looking around for who called out to her. She spotted a burly man in an apron and white hat, standing in front of her. She didn't recognize his face, but he was clearly a chef.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know where Elista is?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I was polishing forks for tonight, so I wasn't paying attention to anything else,\" Kelos replied. She didn't even recognize the name, but assumed it to be one of her fellow maids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn fool girl is probably late because she broke something again,\" the chef said. \"She was supposed to deliver Princess Fia's breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Fia's breakfast! This could be Kelos' chance. She could deliver it and thanks the princess for lending her that dress. Maybe even get a chance to talk to her, to clear up this oddities. \"I can do it!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, I can't spare any kitchen staff today,\" the chef said. \"Make sure you hurry up and get back so you can finish that on time.\" he pointed to the boxes filled with yet unpolished silverware.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, I will,\" Kelos replied. she placed the fork she had just finished with the other polished ones, stood up and went to get the tray meant for Princess Fia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know the way?\" the chef asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so,\" Kelos replied. \"I'll be back soon.\"</span></div></div>",

A noble?\" Kelos asked. It seemed more right than being a maid. \"Wait, don't you know who I am?\" she asked. \"Couldn't you just tell me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, my dear,\" Marlin explained. \"However, it's best if you recover your memories on your own. Otherwise false memories could take root.\" Again he frowned.  The truth was quite the opposite, even false memories Kelos \"recovered\" would be seen by Kelos as real and the magic would further elaborate on them, while things Marlin told her would simply be seen as something told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I suppose that makes sense,\" Kelos replied. She concentrated hard. \"I remember trumpets... They were announcing someone arriving...  I remember, they called my name! Princess Kelos! I'm a princess!\" With that statement, false memories of Kelos' life as a princess filled her head. The military training Kelos received was replaced with lessons on proper etiquette, fashion, and make up. Prince Kelos' graduation celebration from Grovan's officer school was replaced with Princess Kelos' d\u00e9butante ball. In her mind, she was and always had been a princess. Kelos subtly took a more feminine stance as the new memories flooded her mind. \"This does not appear to be Grovan,\" she said. She looked at the wizard. \"You're Treaven's wizard, are you not? Mervin was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Marlin,\" the wizard corrected Kelos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes, Marlin,\" Kelos replied. \"Now why am I in Treaven...\" she thought over the situation. \"I remember a marriage... Princess Fia! She's going to meet suitors at her birthday ball tomorrow. I'm here because of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, Princess,\" Marlin said. \"It seems most of your memories have returned.\" While not the simple solution of Kelos believing she's a maid, believing she was a princess was almost as good and removed Prince Kelos from contention for the next few days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I believe I remember everything,\" Kelos replied. \"I must do all I can too...\"</span></div></div>",

But alas, I am a woman, and my love for her can never be.\" Tears began forming in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlin looked at Kelos, and began to feel guilt over his actions. He had assumed the Prince was merely after Princess Fia for power, to gain control over both kingdoms, yet apparently there was a real feeling there, powerful enough to remain even after having Prince Kelos' memories overwritten to that of Princess Kelos. He pulled a handkerchief out of his pocket. \"Here you are, my dear,\" he said, handing it to Kelos.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Kelos said, wiping her tears. \"How unslightly of me. Even though I told myself I would help my beloved Fia find happiness, look at me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seriously love Princess Fia?\" Marlin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Kelos replied. \"I've loved her since we first met at my d\u00e9butante ball. Funny, is it not? A ball held so I could meet men as marriage prospects, yet I fall in love with another woman.\" She gave a forced smile. \"I remember, she was simply radiant in her gown. She was so kind, even when one of the maids spilled food on her dress, she immediately forgave her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlin thought back. Indeed he had heard Princess Fia speak of such an incident when she attended Prince Kelos' graduation from the Grovan military academy. Apparently real events were simply being reworked in Kelos' mind from the spell. Of course Kelos had not been present for Princess Fia's two hour diatribe about the clumsiness of Grovan's servants after the party. In fairness neither had Marlin, though he had heard about it from the other members of Traeven's delegation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must think me quite the fool,\" Kelos said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all, Princess,\" Marlin replied. \"We cannot control who we fall in love with. Love is a beautiful thing regardless of its form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if it is forever unrequited?\" Kelos asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I think so,\" Marlin replied. \"You said it yourself, you wished to help Princess Fia find someone she would be happy with, and that's because of your love.\" Marlin paused. His earlier guilt caused him to add more more line. \"Though are you sure it would be unrequited?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos looked up at the wizard. She opened her mouth to speak, but then paused for a moment before continuing. \"I have not spoken to her about this. We exchanged some letters, but I dared not broach the subject. Even if she were, our fathers would simply arrange marriages and separate us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose that is likely,\" Marlin replied. \"Yet, are you fine with not knowing for sure?\" </span></div></div>",

I'm sure she'll be happy to see you, whether you're Princess Kelos or Prince Kelos.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so,\" Kelos replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She will. Now, please follow me, Princess,\" Cynthia said. She led Kelos through a twisting mazing of halls and passages, some lavishly decorated, while other with bare walls. At first Kelos struggled to keep up in her unfamiliar heels, but as they went on, she found it easier and easier. Hearing a more steady pattern to Kelos' footsteps, Cynthia looked back. \"My, your stride is improving, Princess. Much more graceful and ladylike.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thanks, I guess,\" Kelos replied. \"I suppose I'm getting used to these shoes.\" With that she misstepped, but quickly rebalanced herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Though it seems you still have a bit to go,\" Cynthia said. \"Tomorrow I shall arrange some additional lessons for you. Oh, and dancing as well. We must have you ready for the ball.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if Marlin cannot find a way to change me back in time,\" Kelos said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Princess,\" Cynthia replied. She reached the end of the hall and gestured around the corner. \"Princess Fia's room is just ahead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Kelos replied as the two of them turned the corner and approached a large oak door with a floral pattern etched in the wood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are,\" Cynthia said, stopping in front of the door. She knocked. \"Princess Fia, you have a visitor.\" She called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in,\" Fia replied from within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia opened the door and stepped aside so Kelos could enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos took a deep breath and exhaled. She then stepped into Fia's room. \"Princess Fia, it is I, Kelos of Grovan,\" she said. \"I apologize for not being my usual handsome self, but I had a bit of a mishap on my journey here. Yet, no matter what form my body may take, my love for you is unchanged, Princess Fia.\"</span></div></div>",

Kelos blushed as their breasts pressed together, a new though certainly not unpleasant experience. \"I can't believe how pretty you are!\" Fia exclaimed as they hugged. \"I just love your hair. You make a lovely princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, but it is merely the work of strange magics, which simply cannot compare to your natural beauty,\" Kelos replied, as she tried to distract herself from Princess Fia's breasts still pressing against her own. She felt an odd warmth with a slight dampness in her new equipment, which she quickly attributed to arousal, given that would certainly be the case with her former male body in this situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're too modest,\" Fia replied as she continued to hug Kelos tightly. She smiled slyly as she felt the transformed prince's heart rate increase. \"I'll bet you'll make some lucky man a beautiful bride.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha? I would never!\" Kelos protested in shock. \"I have no interest in becoming some man's wife! I only love you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm kidding, princess,\" Fia replied with a giggle. She leaned forward and kissed Kelos on the lips. After a moment, she pulled back, and giggled at the shocked expression on Kelos' face. \"Perhaps you'd be willing to become my bride then?\" With that Fia loosened her embrace and took a step back, grasping Kelos' hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos took a few breaths to recover. \"I would prefer to be your groom,\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose Prince Kelos is handsome too,\" Fia said with a giggle. \"If you can't be my bride, I suppose a groom shall do as well.\" She pulled Kelos over to her bed. \"Oh, but you must be exhausted from your eventful trip. Come, sit with me for a bit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, I am a bit tired, Princess,\" Kelos replied. she followed Fia over the the bed and sat down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cynthia, would you be so kind as to bring us some tea?\" Fia called out as she sat down next to Kelos. She clutched the new princess' arm and snuggled up against her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Princess,\" Cynthia said, as she left to fulfill Fia's request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So did you met with my father?\" Fia asked, her playful mood suddenly turning serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I was summoned immediately upon my arrival,\" Kelos replied. \"He told me about tomorrow. Even if it is a day early, might I wish you a happy birthday, Princess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Princess,\" Fia replied. \"But please, titles are so informal and I doubt you wish to be called princess more than necessary. Call me Fia, and I shall call you Kelos.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Fia,\" Kelos replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father must have been surprised to see such a beautiful woman instead of the man he expected,\" Fia said. \"Was he angry, Kelos?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think he would have been angry no matter what,\" Kelos replied. \"I think he considered my replies to his questions acceptable. Though in the end he asked me to become his mistress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, I'd hate to think of my father as a romantic rival,\" Fia said. \"You know he's against our marriage. That's why he invited all those other suiters and misplaced your invitation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suspected something like that was the case. I did not leave long enough ago to have missed an invitation. But I had already made plans to visit Treaven for your birthday,\" Kelos replied. \"Though I did not expect to be wearing a dress for the occasion. In the morning I shall consult your court wizard, with luck I shall be myself for your ball.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful, Kelos,\" Fia warned. \"My father will try anything to prevent our marriage. He believes you only have eyes on the kingdom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Kelos replied. \"He refused to allow me to consult with your court wizard tonight. I was tempted to do so anyway, but I needed to see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you did,\" Fia replied. \"I'd have been rather hurt if you didn't trust me enough to show me your feminine side.\" With that a knock on the door interpreted the two princesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've brought you your tea,\" Cynthia said as she entered the room, holding a tray with a small teapot and two cups. She placed the tray down on the nightstand next to Fia's bed, then filled the cups. She passed one to Kelos, who then passed it to Fia. Cynthia then handed the second cup to Kelos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Cynthia,\" Fia said as she took a sip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, thanks,\" Kelos said, taking a sip from her own cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your welcome,\" Cynthia replied. \"Though I must remind you, it is getting late, Princess Kelos should retire to her quarters soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but can she not spend the night with me?\" Fia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure your father would approve,\" Cynthia said. \"Even if she is a woman now, Princess Kelos is still a suitor for your hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will be fine,\" Fia said, \"Even if she was once a man, even father sees her as a woman enough to ask her to be his mistress.\" She turned to her companion. \"You'll spend the night with me, won't you, Kelos?\"</span></div></div>",

Sure, it might anger the king, but there was little he could say about the situation without acknowledging Kelos was still a man, despite her current form. Plus, refusing might disappoint Fia, who was reacting far better to the situation than Kelos dared hope. How could she say no at a time like this? \"Of course I'll stay,\" she said with a smile. \"If you'd be kind enough to allow it, Fia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful,\" Fia said, smiling back at Kelos.

She curtsied and turned to leave, though not before glancing at Kelos worriedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos looked around the room while sipping her tea, when she noticed the obvious, there was only one bed. She then turned to Fia. \"One thing though, there's only one bed.

Being a princess does come with a certain advantage in that regard, wouldn't you agree?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose you could say that,\" Kelos said, blushing a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been wondering, how do you like it?\" Fia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Being a woman?\" Kelos asked, to which Fia nodded yes. \"It feels strange. Even just walking, I have to move differently, and that's not even taking shoes and clothing into account. Its like my legs are attached differently. I guess it's the hips. It's just off enough that I need to think about how I move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose that makes sense,\" Fia commented. \"We girls do have a different figure after all. But I'm sure you'll get used to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would rather not have the opportunity to,\" Kelos replied. \"Tomorrow morning I intend to consult your court wizard and return to my manly self.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marlin is a capable mage, but there are limits to even his abilities,\" Fia replied. \"If he cannot restore you, what do you intend to do? Will you return to Grovan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For tomorrow, I will attend the ball in this form,\" Kelos replied. \"I would not allow my current feminine body to prevent me from appearing at your birthday celebration.

However, if this was the result of a deliberate attempt to prevent a lasting peace and restart the war, I may not be so fortunate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would it be so bad if it didn't wear off?\" Fia asked. \"You could remain here with me. Sure, we would not technically be able to wed, but we could still have an unofficial marriage. That would secure peace as well, would it not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt your father would allow that,\" Kelos replied. \"After all, a kingdom needs an heir. He would likely still attempt to find you a husband.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must say you are likely correct in that,\" Fia replied sadly. \"Let us both return to Grovan then. Surely your mission cannot be considered a failure if you return with me, regardless of your form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos considered Fia's words. At the very least her mother would be supportive. \"That may be the best course of action,\" Kelos replied. \"Though my sister would still likely try to prevent me from becoming a man again.

I did find two that I believe would fit her well.\" Cynthia held up two nightgowns. The first was long, made of pink silk, with girlish ribbons adorning it. The arms looked to be elbow length, with lace trim. The second was short, made of sheer black lace with two thin straps to hold it up and a matching pair of panties. It left little to the imagination, but at least it wasn't pink. \"Which one would you prefer, Princess Kelos?\"</span></div></div>",

Moments later, Kelos felt the cloth drop from him, revealing the undergarments that she was currently wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did go a long way to prepare yourself for me, didn't you?\" Fia said, admiring Kelos' body. \"Even selecting such underwear.

Stepping inside the room, he expected to see a brutish man inside, violating his dear, young girl. Instead, his eyes were struck by a heavenly beauty in a modest, yet feminine attire. Though he didn't show it, he had begun sweating the moment he laid eyes on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he had been dismissive about Kelos at first, he became interested in her. Maybe she would be a good spouse to his daughter... or to himself? He was a widowed king, and it was important to keep his image with the people. What better than to establish relationships with a former enemy and take a youthful and beautiful bride for himself.

Kelos quickly noticed how she became calm in less than an instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I apologize for that unsightly behavior,\" Fia lowered her head in a jest. \"I didn't expect my father to come here at this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no. It's my fault,\" Kelos retaliated. \"If I wasn't here, this wouldn't have happened. It's too bad that things had to end this way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Fia smiled as she slid up to Kelos. \"So you wanted to explore womanly ways with me tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I-\" Kelos embarrassingly began before she was cut off by the door opening. Both Kelos and Fia turned to take a look at the visitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you here?\" Fia shouted as she observed the intruder. It was Galan, Captain of the Royal Guard and the King's \"Right Hand Man\". Covered in armor, he strode into the room, ignoring the princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you please tell me what you are doing here?\" Fia asked once more. \"Even if you are the king's trusted servant, it is unseeming to enter a woman's bedroom without her permission, especially that of Royalty. If you have no business here, I order you out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I apologize, milady, but the king's orders have higher priority,\" Galan answers, as he gets accustomed to the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you...\" Fia began, before realizing something. \"Wait, you... you're our chaperone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Precisely,\" Galan replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But a chaperone is traditionally a woman, usually of age!\" Fia exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ask his highness, not me,\" Galan shrugged his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is exactly what I will do,\" Fia said, before gracefully walking out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGalan looked after the princess until she was out of sight before turning to sight, before suddenly turning to Kelos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you, what exactly are you doing here?\" Galan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardon,\" Kelos could only ask, not understanding his question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a treacherous Grovanian scum! I'm sure that you couldn't have come due to pure love. What are your ambitions?\" Galan inquired from Kelos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is nothing of that sort! I came to wed Princess Fia because of my love for her!\" Kelos retaliated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Galan quickly marched up to Kelos and pushed her on the bed behind her, before quickly following suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't believe you,\" Galan's breath tickled Kelos' ear as he spoke. \"You're lying! You must be up to no good. I've known the princess for so long and I will not hand her over to scum like you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... no, that is no-\" Kelos was fumbling for words. She never experienced such a situation. She felt <i>weak</i> as the <i>brutish</i> knight manhandled her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see that is not enough to break you. But if you don't declare your withdrawal to the marriage, I will deflower you right here now! You might not know, but having a child in your womb is enough to lock you into the transformation. For the princess' sake, I will be forced to do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pang of fear struck Kelos' heart as the words reverberated through her mind. All she wanted to do is flee this situation. It was alright for her to denounce the marriage, she could easily find another girl to wed. And to potentially return back with not only no princess in hand, but also a bastard in her stomach, filled her with fear. What would her parents say? She needed to denounce it. But...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... please, no... I love her,\" Kelos said, the voice coming out as a whimper. Tears started to flow which shamed Kelos. She did not want to act like a little girl, yet the fear got to her. Instead of being a proud prince filled with courage, she was now a weak, and probably a meek, woman, who would break down in extreme situations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGalan...</span></div></div>",

He began to roughly fondle Kelos' breasts with one hand as he held her down with the other.

Somehow she had been saved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I apologize,\" Galan said, as he immediately fell to his knee and bowed. \"It's just the thought of this Grovan filth marrying our Princess. I thought if I could prevent her from becoming a man again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not want to hear any excuses,\" Arthras said coldly. \"You have breeched my trust.

I...\" Kelos stammered, still overwhelmed at the current situation. Tears flowed from her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, dear, you're safe now,\" Arthras said reassuringly. He placed his hand on Kelos' shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... couldn't stop him,\" Kelos said still crying. \"I tried...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no shame in a woman being weaker than a man,\" Arthras said. \"A woman as beautiful as you needs a good man to protect her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on here?!\" Fia shouted as she came back to her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made a mistake assigning Galan this task,\" Arthras said. \"Take care of Princess Kelos tonight. I have some urgent business to attend to.\" With that he walked out of the room. As soon as he was sure he was out of Kelos and Fia's sight he smiled. \"Just as planned.\" There was no way he would willingly let Prince Kelos marry his daughter, but Princess Kelos would make a fine wife. This was merely the first step to get her to realize it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kelos?\" Fia asked. \"What happened here?\"</span></div></div>",

Right now, she didn't know how to properly respond to Fia. Her dashing prince violated and reduced to tears in the matter of a few moments? She was so weak! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Arthras hadn't protected her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the Traeven princess, upon seeing the disheveled state of Kelos, the torn clothes, and tear-stained face, was quick to connect two and two together, and a spark of fury lit up in her visage. \u201cOh that bastard Galan! Did he hurt you?\u201d She asked, rushing over to the side of the bed to better inspect her feminine suitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flush of red hotness burned on Kelos' face at being so easy to discern. She prided herself on being a tactician as a prince, but right now she was as easy to read as an open book! Still, at least the problem of confessing had been dealt with for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe tried,\u201d She started, a bit of trepidation in her voice. \u201cBut your father came in to stop him.\" Memories of the rescue jolted in Kelos' mind once again; Arthras' commanding voice as he took control of the scene with complete ease, the guiding hand he placed on her shoulder, and the look of reassurance he gave her. It was an inspiration for a future king such as herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis cape smelled rather nice, too...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos shook her head at the last part. \"I must admit, I believe I now owe the man a great deal.\u201d She always thought the king to be a bit of a blowhard; an obstacle in the way to get to Fia, but she certainly had a higher bit of respect for him after this. He at least proved to be honorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFia, upon hearing the explanation, let out a sigh of relief, and opted to sit on the side of the bed next to the other girl. \u201cDaddy can be stubborn, but he's a good person where it counts. I like to think he has what's best in mind for everyone.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was the lingering thought of why he curiously assigned a male to be their chaperone though; the more shrewd part of Fia wondered if it wasn't some strange tactic the king was brewing up to use on Kelos, but another part of her, the part that was his daughter, argued that it was likely just a case of him being overly protective. It made sense- two princesses in one room required double the attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe figured though that these ruminations would do little good to think about at the moment at hand. \u201cYour clothes.\u201d She said, changing the subject. \u201cA princess like yourself shouldn't go around walking in tatters. We need to get you dressed in something more respectable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos, finally having calmed down a bit from her fright, ultimately agreed. While the king's cloak felt pleasant, she needed to show she wasn't so shaken up by this event that she was left whimpering and falling apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould I choose something other than the black gown?\u201d The Grovan royal wasn't particularly in the mood to feel sultry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFia just smiled. \u201cI'll make sure the new dress is even frillier than the pink one.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rays of sunlight trickled through Fia's bedroom window, shining on Kelos' face. The brightness stirred the transformed prince from her sleep. She spit some of her long red hair out of her mouth and sat up in bed with a yawn. The hair in her mouth was certainly a sign she was still a woman, and a glance down at her chest confirmed it. Kelos felt like she barely got any sleep at all, between the unusual sensations of her current body and the experience from the night before. She then glanced at the bed next to her, only to find Fia missing. Apparently she had woken up before Kelos. The still sleepy princess looked out the window. The sun was already fairly high in the sky. \"Eight? Nine o'clock?\" Kelos thought to herself. Sleeping in was unlike her, and the former prince chastised herself for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, sleepyhead,\" Fia said as she walked into the room. Accompanying her was another blonde woman that Kelos thought looked familiar. However, looking closely, she seemed to have strange ears and what looked like a tail swishing from side to side behind her. \"You've got a visitor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos stared at the woman, her half asleep brain struggling to place her. \"Captain?!!\" Kelos exclaimed after a few moments<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it's me, Prince...ess Kelos,\" the blonde girl replied. \"Marlin was able to mostly change me back into a human, though not completely. The scroll had a sort of lock on it to make sure it could only be removed in Grovan. Marlin was able to break it, but the method he used had some limitations. He said the ears and tail will go away when I return to Grovan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you become a man again too?\" Kelos asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a bigger problem,\" the former captain explained. \"Apparently disguise scrolls can't be stacked. If you try using a second one, the first one overwrites your real form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're stuck like that?\" Kelos asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For now, yes,\" the former captain said. \"Marlin said he might be able to make a potion to change me back to normal if he had a hair sample from before I was transformed though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's promising,\" Kelos said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" the former captain agreed. \"For now though, I'm just glad I'm human again.\" She flicked her horse ear. \"More or less. May I resume my duties as captain of your guard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" Fia exclaimed. \"You're a woman now. You should be Princess Kelos' handmaiden. A princess needs a handmaiden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does a handmaiden do anyway?\" the former captain asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, a handmaiden is more than a maid, but not a lady in waiting,\" Fia said. \"A personal servant to a queen or princess basically.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose that wouldn't be so bad,\" the former captain said. \"I wouldn't have to wear a maid uniform though, would I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be up to Princess Kelos,\" Fia replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you won't,\" Kelos said. \"But I'm hoping to not be a princess for much longer. You can be my handmaiden until I turn back to my manly self though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, princess,\" the former captain said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need a new name though,\" Fia said. She looked over the horse eared handmaiden. \"How about Iris?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mind it,\" Iris replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFia clasped her hands together. \"Good, it's settled then!\" She then turned to Kelos. \"So, Princess sleepyhead, breakfast is ready, and when we're finished, shall we take a bath together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breakfast and a bath sound good,\" Kelos replied. \"Also I'd like to...\"</span></div></div>",

Most important is Marlin.\u201d In the absurdity of the past day, Kelos hadn't had a chance to go see the wizard, but if he could make such great strides with the captain so soon, then who knew what he could do with her? She might be able to be a man again before she was buttering her morning toast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFia snapped her fingers in an agreeable gesture. \u201cOf course! It'd be a shame to lose you being such a cute princess so soon, but I understand you want this over with. Take all the time you need with him.\u201d A cheeky grin suddenly formed on the Traeven royal's face.  \u201cBesides... I just remembered Iris and I have to do some things as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain turned girl, turned horse, turned horse-girl, just blinked at that. \u201cWe do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCertainly! You have to get fitted! A new handmaiden like yourself can't go around in frumpy clothes! You need something much prettier if you want to join us for breakfast!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI- but, umm...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo buts, silly! We're going to go see Cynthia!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the blonde could protest further, or even mumble out much of anything comprehensible, Fia had already already begun to drag her away to go see the woman whom Kelos grew quite acquainted with yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the room cleared, the Grovan princess could only let out a soft titter at the antics. Fia, at gatherings and events, always made sure to display herself with the utmost of royal dignity, but once one peeled back that layer of armor, she really was a cute and energetic young woman, and it was nice to see her trying her best to help with the captain. Her father raised her well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer father...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos' eyes shifted over to the adjacent chair where his cloak was now lazily being hung off of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt like she should return the lent garment. True, any of the regular servants around could handle the matter for her, but she felt it would be a solid icebreaker to see his highness again. It would do no good to leave the impression of a timid shaken up girl in his mind. She was a Grovan princess! She needed to show her pride! Plus it really was the least she could do after he helped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging, she supposed it wouldn't hurt to make a quick detour before going to Marlin...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, no, no, right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe she should just keep going forward?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos was really feeling quite silly right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere she was, dressed in an exceedingly girlish nightgown, and looking like a doe lost in the woods, as she moved through the unfamiliar halls of the Traeven castle. Without Fia or any sort of person there to guide her, she wasn't sure where she should be going. It wouldn't have mattered if she left for Marlin first or not, it seemed, because she'd have ended up sputtering around in the maze she was in regardless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to ask some of the help that had been floating around wasn't as fruitful as it could have been; most seemed completely unaware of her status as being the heir to the neighboring kingdom. One rather authoritarian woman kept on insisting she was a servant, and pressed to doll her up in a maid outfit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, Kelo scurried on out of there quick enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe hospitality here has been rather mixed...\u201d After last night, and what she was experiencing right now, things weren't going as smoothly as they could. At this point, she'd settle on just finding Fia and going to breakfast, or-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kelos turned another corner, she found herself plodding into something tall, hard, and, as her hand felt around to figure out what it was... rugged?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, Princess Kelos my dear! What a surprise to see you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was King Arthras. Kelos had bumped head-first into his chiseled frame, and he hadn't even flinched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you recovered from last night?\u201d A tone of concern was in the ruler's voice, as he used his arms to gently pull himself apart from the princess; his royal demeanor making sure to look her right in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh- um, your highness. Good morning.\u201d Kelos found herself frazzled once again; stumbling over her words, as she stared at the calm and cool visage of the king. \u201cI'm much better now, thank you. Ah, thanks to you, that is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monarch gave a reassuring smile. \u201cI <i>dealt</i> with Galan.\u201d His tone had an absolute authority to it. \u201cThe man is now on a particularly treacherous quest. I'm sure once he returns- <i>if</i> he returns, he'll come back a changed person.\u201d Though the truth of the situation was much different. Now he was off on a paid retreat for his compliance with Arthras' plan. A visit to the enchanted springs up north would do his loyal knight some good R&amp;R. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, your highness. Again. You honor me and my kingdom for your swift actions.\u201d There was an awkward pause a moment after, as if Kelos knew not what to say, but a quick realization of what her purpose in looking for him in the first place sparked in her mind. \u201cIt's actually quite nice to see you, as I was hoping to return the cloak you loaned me earlier.\u201d The princess lifted her hands a bit up to show the folded garment cradling in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthras' eyes shot open, and his grin somehow grew wider. \u201cMy cape! How thoughtful of you girl! I remember, before she passed, the queen would always greet me each morning with it.\u201d He took the item, and quickly donned it. \u201cFine memories.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, yes...\u201d Kelos shuffled her feet a bit, not knowing how to rightly respond. \u201cWell, it's nice to see you this early, but I think I'm going to be off to Marlin now. I'm hoping he can maybe help me with my situation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNonsense!\u201d Arthras' booming voice spoke. \u201cYou can talk with that wizard anytime. Right now my dear, you're going to join me for a special breakfast with the king!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos took a slight step backwards at that. \u201cOh, by all means, I don't want to impose...\u201d She really wanted to see Marlin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt wouldn't be imposing at all! I think it would be a grand thing to discuss the relationship of our two kingdoms. Plus, we'll dine on Traeven delicacies I doubt you've ever even heard of!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos crossed her arms and raised a brow. \u201cWhat food does Traeven have that's never crossed into Grovan?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCare to find out?\u201d The king just winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing the dam was breaking, Arthras pressed further. \u201cBesides, do you even know how to get to Marlin from here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silence he received was all he needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen I'll be your chaperone for the day! It's the least I can do after the last night's fumbles.\u201d He reached his hand towards her. \u201cTake my arm, girl.\u201d</span></div></div>",

No, that wasn't possible, surely King Arthras was aware she was really a man. He was probably simply trying to make amends for the actions of his knight. After all, a good leader would take responsibility for the actions of his subordinates. \"I suppose I'm not in much of a position to refuse your hospitality,\" she said. Hesitantly, she reached out and took the king's arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shall not regret it,\" Arthras said with a smile. \"This shall be the finest breakfast Treavon has to offer.\" He led Kelos arm and arm through the hallways to the dinning room. \"I have been meaning to ask you,\" the kind said. \"You have such beautiful red curly hair, is it merely the result of the spell, or is it natural? By that I mean, if you had been a woman normally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos blushed slightly at this. \"I don't really know the answer,\" she replied. \"It does resemble my older sister's and mother's, so it's possible this is the hair color I would have, but I normally have straight hair as black as a raven.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthras looked down at Kelos. \"I'm sure you would be pretty with black hair too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos looked up at the king, who was smiling gently, then immediately looked away, her face beet red. \"T-Thank you,\" she said, her voice shaking a bit from embarrassment. \"but I meant that was my hair color as a man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthras chuckled at this. \"Perhaps, girl, but I stand by my opinion that it would look pretty on you as a woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos declined to reply as the pair continued through the halls. Soon they came upon a large double door with two maids standing on each side. They curtsied as Kelos and Arthras approached, then opened the doors. Before Kelos was a table filled with fruits, pastries, breads, and more. Most of it was familiar, but there were a few pastries there Kelos had not seen before. \"Wow,\" Kelos said, impressed by the spread of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are there not delicacies here you have yet to taste?\" Arthras asked. He looked at Kelos with a proud smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems there may be a few,\" Kelos replied. Arthras escorted her to the table, released her arm, then pulled out a chair for her. \"Thank you,\" Kelos said as she sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" the king said as he then pushed Kelos' chair in, before taking a seat himself. \"I would suggest the pastry with the pink frosting. The late queen had the castle p\u00e2tissier develop it. It has a unique layered texture to it. Fia is quite fond of them as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I will,\" Kelos said. She took one and bit into it. A buttery sweetness filled her mouth as the thin layers inside it practically dissolved in her mouth. \"This is delicious!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you like it,\" Arthras replied. \"But don't be shy girl, eat as much as you want.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kelos had already made her decision earlier when she chose to join the king for breakfast, and as such, felt like trying to rush through things for the sake of getting to the wizard would simply be rude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, she thought, as she finished applying a bit of jam to a piece of buttered toast, his highness was quite correct about the food on offer being scrumptious... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ruler just laughed, as he saw the petite princess take a large bite out of the bread. \u201cThat's right. Traeven is a land proud of its bounties, and its people shouldn't be ashamed of it. The former queen certainly wasn't!\u201d Memories of his beloved late wife filled his head for a moment, until he quickly realized he should quash them. \u201c...I'm sorry,\u201d he started, his face losing a fair bit of the joviality that just seconds ago was framed on it. \u201cI shouldn't be bringing up matters of the past so much. It's in bad taste while in the presence of someone as lovely as yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bright red blush shone again on the young woman's features, as she finished sampling another bite of a muffin that had a flavor laced to it that she just couldn't quite place. Honestly though, what was with her?! She shouldn't be acting this way around a man!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's fine, please, don't concern yourself so much. Truthfully, I'm quite interested in learning more about Traeven first hand. There's only so much books and a few quick visits can tell you, and from what I've seen, it's very nice here.\u201d Kelos was telling the truth. While yes, there had been a whole series of bumps in the road in her recent trip, memories of the various forests and villages that dotted the land were fresh in her mind. It really was a beautiful country.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthras smiled. This Kelos girl actually surprised him a bit. She was more the little charmer than he'd ever thought to expect. \u201cIf you wish, there's much I can show you. I'm sure you'd grow to love it here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos wasn't sure how to correctly respond, but her thoughts that the king might have started to harbor feelings for her seemed to have solidified a bit further. Instead of trying to stumble through her words like a simpering schoolgirl though, she decided it'd be more wise to pause by feeding herself what looked to be a particularly delectable cinnamon bun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe actually let out a soft moan, much to her embarrassment, as she took her first bite into the baked good; savoring the sweet sugary taste it provided, which again, caused his majesty Arthras to bellow out a jolly chuckle. \u201cIf nothing else, I can assure you a steady supply of those for the stay you're making.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's- that's very kind of you,\u201d Kelos responded; trying to regain her composure, while using a napkin to wipe her lips. \u201cThough if you don't mind me changing the subject, I would like to learn of some other things about the kingdom...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I too would like to hear of some matters regarding Grovan.\u201d The lord spoke in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat followed then was an extended conversation where the two royals pitched back and forth light banter about their two kingdoms; all the while, Kelos fed herself with the electrifying treats laid out before her by the castle's chefs. Curiously, though she didn't particularly pick up on it, the king himself never really delved into eating too much; the lion's share of the offerings passing through the princess's lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time moved on, and subjects changed, the matter of politics, and things relating to the various landmarks and wonders that each of their nations held, shifted to somehow be more about the various heroics and victories that King Arthras had scored in his years as both a ruler, and on the battlefield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Then I pointed my sharpened blade mere inches from the cursed noble's whiskers, and stared the man in the eye. It was in that moment he surrendered, and the attempted coup to the throne was finally thwarted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos placed her hand to her chest, as she was absolutely rapt in the story being spoken to her. It was one of deception, bloodshed, and fierce combat, but in the end, goodness and chivalry won out. To think that the man who sat before her here found himself in the center of it all, was nothing less than incredible! And \u201cincredible\u201d was the only word that she managed to gasp out, as she heard the tale finish up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthras grinned proudly at the response he got. \u201cYes, well, I can show you where I keep his enchanted helm as a trophy if you like. The man himself though is now locked away deep in the prisons below.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe evil she'd just heard the headpiece wrought sent shivers down her spine. Truthfully, Kelos wanted nothing to do with it. Though the knowledge of how the king dealt with it made her respect for him grow thrice fold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs well as made the seemingly perpetual flush on her face shine even brighter...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI- maybe later, your highness.\u201d But 'later' suddenly sparked other thoughts in his head. \u201cOh! How long have we been chatting? I don't want to keep anyone held up!\u201d Though considering the empty plates that had been scattered across the table, evidence was plenty that she'd been doing more than just 'chatting'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWorry not, girl. That's the benefit of being the <i>king</i>. Others have to work on my time. If you stick with me, you'll learn that.\u201d The tiny wink he gave her might have been a smidgen too much. \u201c...But it's true it wouldn't be a bad idea to don something more appropriate for the approaching time of day.\u201d Arthras' eyes shifted over the clothes the princess was wearing; her sweet form still attired in the nightgown she slept in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos blinked, shocked at the realization of the frilly thing that she hadn't changed out of. What was she, a slob?! \u201cHa. Y- yes. I suppose you might be right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ruler withheld any cute comments, and instead moved to help the girl out from her chair. \u201cI'll escort you to Lady Cynthia so she can help get you cleaned up. The maids will deal with what's left here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA- alright. Oh- <i>oof</i>,\u201d the lady moaned, as she was assisted to stand up; the heaviness of the meal she just dined on finally weighing in on her. \u201cAh- I mean that sounds acceptable. I'll let you lead the way, your majesty.\u201d She tried to rephrase things, as she took the arm of the man again; this time, without the hint of hesitation as before. He was helping to provide a bit of balance for the woozy fullness she was feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked, something else was niggling at the edges of her mind. Something about her needing to meet with someone, but she supposed she'd figure that out later. Half of her was feeling the need to start the day proper, while the other half simply wanted to relax after the delightful meal she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, she'd let Arthras guide her for now, which, to the king, was perfectly alright to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question to those at large was whether or not the food he had prepared was as innocent as it seemed...</span></div></div>",

None of them were particularly powerful, but taken together they were making the Grovan Princess much more accepting of her situation. One to make her memory a little foggy for a time, one to relax her, one to make her behave slightly more feminine. By the time Kelos realized anything was wrong, if Kelos ever realized anything was wrong, she'd already be a woman permanently, likely pregnant with the new heir to Traeven's throne, and Fia would be safely married off to a convenient ally. It was the perfect plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos, still woozy, looked up at Arthras and saw him staring at her. \"Is something wrong, majesty?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just thinking what a lovely young woman you are. You remind me a bit of my late wife when I married her,\" Arthras replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surely you flatter me too much,\" Kelos said, blushing and looking away from Arthras. \"I never met the late queen, but I'm sure I can't compare to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Modesty is befitting a princess,\" Arthras replied, \"but unnecessary here. I would not say such a thing idly. You shall be the only woman at the ball tonight whose beauty might rival my daughter's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Thank you, majesty,\" Kelos said blushing, though smiling at the same time. While part of her was saying she shouldn't care about being beautiful, another part was very happy to hear the king's praises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthras smiled at Kelos' lack of protest. Treating her as the woman she currently is, combined with the potions in the food, was clearly breaking through Kelos' male persona. The trick now was to find the right balance, push just enough to further Kelos' progression into womanhood, but too far for Kelos to start resisting and reassert her male identity. \"Speaking of the ball, have you picked out your gown?\" the king asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My gown?\" Kelos asked. \"No, I haven't. I was going to see Cynthia for help with that today, but I think there was something I needed to do first.\" Kelos tried to remember what she had forgotten.</span></div></div>",

I'm sure you'll look lovely.\" Arthras replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Kelos fell deep in thought. She didn't know why, but she had a feeling that she was forgetting something. There was something she needed to do. She was almost certain of it. But what would a pretty young lady like her need to?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head. What was she thinking? She was a man! ...Or supposed to be at least. Why was she thinking of herself as a princess? Why did she want to pretty herself up all of sudden? It didn't make any sense whatsoever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe briefly looked up at the king. He couldn't have done anything to her, right? He was a noble man, who saved her from the clutches of that evil knight. He was honorable, and chivalrous. Yet, unbeknownst to her, her woman's intuition, which was enhanced by the potions, was sensing that something is wrong. She needed to go back to being a man as soon as possible. Man...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's right! Marlin! Kelos suddenly jumped up and bowed to King Arthras.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I apologize, but I must remove my presence for now. I have business with the court magician,\" Princess Kelos rapidly fired off her excuse before turning around before gracefully exiting in, unbeknownst to her, a ladylike manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king clutched his head within his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was so close!\" He whispered as he clicked his tongue. His plan was straightforward. First, he would have Princess Kelos come to the ball. Then, he would compliment her, grab her fancy, and offer her a couple of drinks. And finally, he would lead the princess, whose mind would be marred by the potions and alcohol, to his bedroom chambers, where he would consummate with her. It was all so perfect! But alas, the stupid princess had to be smarter than he expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thought skipped to Marlin. How would he persuade him not to turn the Princess back? Bribery wouldn't work. Marlin might be a senile man, but he was still a true and honest man. As he strutted up to the window, pondering, his eyes almost fell out of his sockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that blumbering idiot doing here?\" Arthras swore under his breath, as he saw Sir Golan walking underneath his window into the castle. \"He was supposed to be on a vacation!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Arthras knew not why Golan was here, but he knew he needed to stop him before he encounters the princess. Otherwise, the entire ruse might be revealed to her, and he would look like a total fool! He dashed out of the dining room, praying that the princess would get lost in the halls and meet neither Marlin nor Golan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Princess Kelos is walking quickly through the hallways in her revealing attire. She knew that this problem would need to be fixed as quickly as possible, before she truly loses her mind... and potentially her future crown. Deep in thought, she didn't notice someone walking out from another hallway at a crossroad, and both of them collided, collapsing in a spectacular fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, I...\" Princess Kelos began before she noticed she crashed into...</span></div></div>",

I wouldn't be where I am today if a few scratches and bumps stopped me!\u201d In a swift flourish, he offered his hand out. \u201cMarlin the Court Magician, at your service!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill a little shocked, the redhead could do little else but accept the assistance up. \u201c...Princess Kelos of Grovan. It's a pleasure.\u201d She said, now upward and mobile again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wizards eyes widened in curiosity as he heard this. \u201cAh, I've heard of your arrival! Here for something or another about being a suitor to unite the kingdoms? You must forgive me, I spend so much of my time with my work, I've little ability to keep up with politics. There's still boundless amounts to learn about the arcane arts, and my pursuits leave me limited room for anything else! Why just a while back, one of your contemporaries from Grovan had to come to me to fix a matter regarding finding themselves trapped as a horse! Poor dear was so flustered and happy about being human again, she forgot to tell me she had <i>another</i> spell cast on her! I'm in the middle of dealing with that as we speak.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos was amazed and somewhat bewildered by the man's abundance of energy, as well as his ability to usher out so many words in a matter of seconds. It was making her lose her train of thought. \u201cWell um, yes. I'm the heir to the Grovan throne, and I'm here to offer my hand to Traeven.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout missing a beat, the magician carried on. \u201cThat sounds wonderful!  Traeven and Grovan together at last! And I must say, King Arthras has picked a <i>fine</i> looking specimen to be his new queen!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess's face started to flush the same color as her hair; both from the praise, and the thought of becoming his majesty\u2019s wife. That wasn't what was happening! Was it?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was ridiculous, she was here to marry Fia, not Arthras! Even though she'd probably spent at this point an equal amount of time conversing with both, and while the king had proven to be quite the charmer, she still had other priorities! This old coot was gravely misinformed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, she doubted someone who was so bumbling and inexperienced could do anything but make a fool of themselves at trying to be courted by a rugged man like Arthras. Having to hold up to the standards his late wife must have reached would practically be impossible...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could provide a rebuttal though, the magic-user started to take his leave. \u201cAnyhow my dear, it's quite nice to meet you, but I've much to do today! I'm sure we'll become more acquainted once you've settled in!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat caused Kelos' jumbled train of thought to move in a different direction. \u201cWait! Hold on!\u201d She couldn't forget, this was practically serendipitous! \u201cI was hoping to actually speak with you.\u201d She was now following him as he continued to pace off wherever he was headed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, you <i>have</i> been speaking, though! You're speaking right now! But is there something in particular you wish to speak <i>of</i>?\u201d The tone of the wizard always seemed to have an amused lilt to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos meanwhile was having a bit of a struggle maintaining her walking speed while subconsciously holding a lady-like gait. \u201cYes, well, you see, I was hoping to maybe gain a bit of... magical assistance from you.\u201d She said, while looking a bit flustered as they moved through the various hallways. \u201cIt's quite a long story, but I'd be willing to explain it all if you'd give me a few moments.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlin in turn span on his feet, and placed his index finger barely a centimeter from the girl's nose. \u201cNo need for words, girl! Your face has been saying it all along! You feel your form isn't adequate to your suitor, and wish to use my alchemic <i>mastery</i> to fix matters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess paused for a moment, before a smile filled her face. \u201cYes! That's amazing, you're quite right!\u201d She was a teensy bit shocked he was able to get it so quickly, but he was a wizard. Who knew what sort of powers he had up his sleeve? Looking into her mind was probably child's play!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough it did raise worries with what she should be thinking about...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man just laughed. \u201cWell my dear, once you get to my age, you tend to be able to understand these sorts of matters. Now why don't you come enter my workshop, and we'll see what we can do to aid you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Kelos' surprise, it seemed the place they'd stopped was actually right outside the magician's office, and not wanting to look a gift horse (a gift Iris?) in the mouth, she gratefully followed the man in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the princess wasn't aware of though, was there was an immense amount of confusion going on. Marlin wasn't some telepath. In fact, at the moment, he was quite misinformed! He'd had little care about the arrival of the Grovan party up until they came, and only found himself involved when having to sort the situation out with the former guard captain (now handmaiden in training). Even through this, he took no real interest in learning much about the princess who was before him. Royals were all the same, weren't they? What mattered was if they funded his research! So he knew not of Kelos' original gender, nor even her name until she spoke it to him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he did know though was that she was a girl who was trying to make herself look good to a suitor, and many times in his past, he'd come across a bevy of women who'd beg him to make magical improvements to themselves; cosmetic, or even mental. It'd been how he'd earned much of his pocket change before gaining his cushy Court Magician position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis Kelos person though seemed sweet and kind enough. Looked to treat him with respect! If he had to have her as a queen, chances were it wouldn't be too unbearable. Plus, having a wife around would do the king well. Might make him feel not so on edge. As such, Marlin figured he should at least lend her a bit of aid with 'wooing' the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question was though, should he just give her a few touch ups, or attune her to more of the king's personal and unique tastes, so she can really catch his eye?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiguring such matters out was what was so fun about his job!</span></div></div>",

Kelos couldn't help but wonder about the mysterious compounds and ancient lore contained within, and if any of it was dangerous. She took great care not to bump anything. After all, she has enough trouble with magic already, and certainly didn't need to spill a potion that would turn her into an animal, little girl, or who knows what. Finally they came to a small clearing, barely large enough for two people to stand, with a desk covered with scrolls, books, and scraps of paper on the far side with a chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your lab certainly has some... character,\" Kelos said looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ho ho, might that be your way of saying it's a tad messy?\" Marlin asked jovially. \"It might seem that way, but I can assure you, I know where each and every item in this lab is, from the smallest jar of powdered wolfbane to the shiniest magical amulet.

She bent down and looked through them, finding a gold amulet shaped like a crescent moon with a large green gem, perhaps an emerald, mounted so it was being held by the tips of the crescent right where Marlin said. \"That's pretty impressive,\" she said, holding the amulet up and examining it. \"This is magic though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that particular one is said to have the blessing of an ancient fertility goddess,\" Marlin explained. \"Supposedly a woman wearing it will become pregnant with absolute certainty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos immediately dropped the amulet with a horrified look on her face. \"Surely not just from touching it,\" she asked with a sound of desperation in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, of course not, my dear,\" Marlin said, slightly puzzled why a young woman like Kelos would react that way. Surely being a mother would appeal to her, wouldn't it? \"You would have to actually do the act while wearing it. Though legend says it need not be with a man.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yes, there was definitely something off about this girl. Marlin thought to himself. Perhaps it was the way she was raised. Those Grovan wasn't the most civilized nation. The poor thing had likely been raised as if she were a boy. She may have never had time to be a proper young girl. But that was nothing he couldn't fix. After all, apart from that, she was already quite the beauty, and had apparently already caught the King's eye. Clearly the place she needed the most help was mental. Marlin then pushed aside a stack of scrolls, revealing a chair. \"Come sit, my dear,\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The chair isn't magic or anything, is it?\" Kelos asked as she approached cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all, it's simply a normal chair,\" Marlin reassured the princess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos sat down in the chair in a rather unladylike manor. After all, soon Marlin would turn her back to normal, so there was no point in trying to act like a woman. \"So you can help me?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Marlin replied. \"I'll just need to examine you a bit and ask some questions.\" He bent over near Kelos and examined one of her eyes with a magnifying glass. \"So, tell me a bit about how you grew up. Did you receive military training?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, of course,\" Kelos replied. \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll help me help you if I know about your past,\" Marlin explained. Finished examining her eye, Marlin brushed Kelos' hair aside and looked in her ear. \"Did you play with other girls when you were a child?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My older sister sometimes,\" Kelos replied. \"There was Lucia, the daughter of the former minister of finance too. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Marlin said. So she did have some female peers. He stopped looking in Kelos' ear and began to examine her hands. \"How about boys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was Kendrick, the son of the captain of the palace guard, and Alex, the son of the minister of parks.\" Kelos replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grovan has a minister of parks?\" Marlin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Traevan doesn't?\" Kelos countered. \"My mother always said it's important for cities to have parks and 'green spaces' as she calls them. It keeps the people happier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps we can talk more about Grovan's domestic policies later,\" Marlin said. \"For now, tell me a bit about these other children. Who did you spend the most time with and what did you do while playing together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I spent the most time with Kendrick or Lucia,\" Kelos explained. \"Kendrick would usually go riding with me, and Lucia would usually spar with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spar?\" Marlin asked. Certainly that was an unusual activity for girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Lucia had a real talent for swordplay,\" Kelos explained. \"She beat a full grown man when she was 10. Her dream was to be a royal knight. I'm pretty good with a sword too, but she'd usually win our matches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Alex or your sister?\" Marlin asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex liked to study a lot, so we mostly studied together after class. When he was 14 he left the castle to become a priest,\" Kelos said. \"My sister, well sometimes we'd play together, but mostly we'd play pranks on each other. She'd also occasionally make me wear her old dresses and have tea parties with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I believe I have heard enough,\" Marlin said. Of course the poor girl was like she is, she was raised with boys and a girl who might as well have been one. He stood up, then walked around the room, gathering vials of strange colored liquids. \"I'll have a potion whipped up in a jiffy that will solve all your problems!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Kelos said as she watched the wizard work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlin added the liquids to an empty vial one at a time and mixed. Soon he had a translucent red potion and looked satisfied. He put a cap on it, then turned around and walked back over to Kelos \"This should do it. You might be dizzy for a bit after drinking it, so I'd recommend waiting until you get to your room so you can lay down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos took the potion. \"Of course. Thank you, Marlin.\" she said. \"How shall I repay you for this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to, my dear. I'm happy to help.\" Marlin replied. \"But if you insist, you can tell me more about those parks and green spaces.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd be glad to,\" Kelos replied. \"Thank you again.\" She turned and left Marlin's chambers. </span></div></div>",

She closed her eyes and took a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you not feeling well?\" Fia asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm becoming too accustom to this form,\" Kelos replied. \"I was picturing us getting married wearing matching gowns.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a great idea!\" Fia exclaimed. She hugged Kelos tightly. \"Though I suppose one of us will have to be a man for the marriage to be legal. But we can have a private ceremony like that before the legal one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry to interrupt, but Princess Kelos needs to be fitted for her dress,\" Cynthia said. \"Plus, I need to go over what's expected of her at the ball.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been to these things before,\" Kelos replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, as a man,\" Cynthia said. \"Plus, there are a few special rules for this one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Special rules?\" Kelos asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boring rules,\" Fia said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Important rules,\" Cynthia stated. \"For instance, if a man of equal or higher standing asks you to dance, unless you have already committed to a dance, you must accept their first offer. If you have committed, then you must give them your first available dance. If the man is of lower standing, you may accept if you wish, but are not required to do so. You may turn down a second offer from anyone, regardless of their rank, except the host. In this case, King Arthras. You may turn down his third request though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That seems complicated,\" Kelos replied. \"Is this always the case? I've had women turn down first requests to dance, and others who accepted after committing to someone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it usually isn't,\" Cynthia explained. \"However, this ball tonight is Princess Fia's 18th birthday. It also serves as matchmaking. This is also why there's an equal number of male and female guests.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Fia and I are already engaged,\" Kelos replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not just for me,\" Fia added. \"Most of the guests are young single nobles, rich merchants, that sort of thing. There will probably be at least 10 marriages that result from tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see,\" Kelos replied. \"So the rules about dances are to make sure the men and women mix?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Cynthia said. \"You're starting to understand, Princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if a woman asks another woman to dance?\" Kelos asked, looking over at Fia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I suppose there's no rule against it,\" Cynthia replied. \"It might make a bit of a scandal though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess, Fia, might I have your first dance?\" Kelos asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love to, but it'll have to be my second,\" Fia replied. \"My first dance has to be with my father. It's tradition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it'll be your first dance with a suitor then,\" Kelos said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'll gladly accept,\" Fia said, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos turned back to Cynthia. \"Are there more rules to go over?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Cynthia replied. \"But that was the most important one.

Let's get to the fitting. If I'm to debut as a princess, then I've little desire to be a slovenly one. Rules can wait.\u201d The fact she'd yet to change out of her night clothes while prancing around the castle did enough to damage her image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh! This is going to be so much fun~! I'll help you pick out the <i>perfect</i> gown!\u201d Fia's eyes were practically twinkling at the thought of playing dress-up with her fiancee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris grimaced slightly, knowing she'd have to hamper the mood. \u201cI'm sorry, Princess Fia, but since it took so long to find Princess Kelos, you're equally running behind schedule. You've your own fitting planned in just a few minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd while Mandy and Buffy are far less strict than I, keeping them waiting would be unseemly.\u201d Cynthia added, as she looked to her future queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh foo!\u201d Fia groaned, as her jubilant demeanor quickly soured; head tilting toward the floor. \u201cBy the time we get to see each other again, it'll be at the ball...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos was near equally displeased, but tried to keep a level head; leaning over to the other girl, with hand reaching to lift her chin. \u201cThen I'll have the pleasure of seeing you at your most beautiful there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFia, smiling lightly, inched closer to her betrothed. \u201cI'm more interested in seeing how beautiful you can be...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore their lips graced, Kelo was unfortunately snatched away at the shoulder by the very attentive Madame Cynthia. \u201cAnd to get there requires you to come with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI- but...\u201d Kelos was soon being dragged off by the matron whose time for girlish antics stretched thin; her job was to craft women out of this lot, not playful schoolchildren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Fia's image was pushed further into the distance, Kelos eventually conceded, knowing at least Iris would keep her good company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt spoke volumes to Kelos how strangely comfortable she was becoming in this body, as she sat bare in a bath, and allowed Cynthia to rinse her flaming red mane. It provided an almost strange sense of deja vu, locked in the same room where she was dressed just yesterday, but all the while, lacking a level of fear and sheepishness recently becoming a woman had instilled in her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt must have been the Grovan blood making her adapt so well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to say, Princess, I'm amazed you were ever once a man.\u201d Cynthia eyed the figure before her. Kelos very much looked like a more petite version of the other Grovan heir, Princess Orianna. Had the maid not known of Kelos' origin, she could likely surmise just as well that she was the royal's younger sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI've hopes to be one again...\u201d Kelos commented. The weight on her chest was less unnatural now, but still something she hadn't much a desire to be a permanent fixture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing up her last touches, Cynthia began to gingerly usher her ward out of the tub. \u201cWell tonight, you are not, which is something you should embrace. Your movements are improving quite steadily, but slipping into a mannish posture will only dissuade potential suitors.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was being toweled off, a questioning look took hold over the royal. \u201cThe only suitor I hope to impress is Fia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maid paused. \u201cOh? Are you certain? Don't underestimate animal instinct, deary. There will be plenty of good stock at the ball. If you're not careful, you could end snatched up as some noble's doting little wife.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos' blush was as fierce as her hair; hands protectively wrapping her towel tightly around herself. \u201cI- I'd never! I mean...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia chuckled, as she guided the princess to the adjacent wardrobe. \u201cI may not always look it, but you and your friends aren't the <i>only</i> ones able to have a bit of fun. Calm down.\u201d As she went to pick out lingerie however, her voice echoed out once more. \u201cThough I do hope your morning with His Highness was to your satisfaction.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fire on Kelos' cheeks didn't cool, as her mind turned to Arthras; all the while, giving little resistance, when her assistant tugged the towel away. \u201cThe King... he's kind. I feel I owe a lot to him.\u201d She went ahead and sashayed into a pair of pearl-white panties that were handed to her, while Cynthia stepped behind, and began the less than simple task of helping don the corset.  \u201cEspecially with being so accommodating to... this... mess.\u201d She signaled down towards her body, while the voice that spoke paused intermittently, as she felt the bindings to her middle tighten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mistress just held her tongue about calling that figure of hers a 'mess.' At least she was taught modesty. \u201cThen repay him by presenting yourself well tonight. I've a collection of gowns here that fit your measurements.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos nodded, glad she was given options. If Fia was with them, then they'd likely spend hours trying on every slip, sweater, and skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older woman's last words though were niggling at her. Repaying Arthras... The more she thought about it, the more it seemed like something she ought to do. \u201cCynthia... would you happen to know of a dress that might be to the King's preferences, then?\u201d She wasn't sure if that was the correct way to word it. She had no desire to catch Arthras' attention... honestly! She knew all too well how flirty he was getting with her during breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...But if he had a way he liked women to dress, why not do so?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer maid smiled, as she took out a pink ensemble, not unlike the alternate choice presented to her yesterday when she went for that now ruined burgundy gown; this one however proved far more ornate, and suited for a high class gathering. \u201cHis Majesty prefers his women feminine. Once we get you sorted into this, I can also work toward applying makeup that'll almost certainly grab his attention.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos once again began to balk. \u201cI- I- that's not what I mean! I am <i>not</i> 'his woman!'\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could continue, Kelos' vision was covered in shadow; dress already being shimmied over her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot yet.\u201d</span></div></div>",

She was once a man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\" Kelos replied in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, she was a young knight back when Arthras' father was king,\" Cynthia explained. \"Well I suppose she was he at the time. What was his name back then...\" Cynthia paused as she tried to remember. \"It's been so long... Sir Sigmund, yes that's it. It seems there was a witch terrorizing a village in the northernmost regions of the kingdom. So the kind sent a party of five knights to find the witch and either kill her or force her to leave. While they succeeded in driving the witch away, she gave each of them a curse. They returned to the castle as normal, but when they reported to the king, the curses activated. Sigmund became a woman. One of the other knights was turned into a beastman. The third was deaged into a child. The fourth transformed into a serpent. The last became a statue. Marlin worked to break the curses, naturally, However, something unexpected happened. The young Prince Arthras had never shown much interest in romance. He'd have the occasional fling, but nothing more than that. He was immediately smitten with the transformed Sigmund. He courted her, and by the time Marlin figured out how to break the curse, Sigmund had accepted her life as a woman, changed her name to Liesa, and agreed to become Arthras' bride.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long did that take to break the curse?\" Kelos asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well each curse was different, and Liesa's was considered the lowest priority, so Marlin got to it last,\" Cynthia said. \"It only took a few days once he did work on it, but by then three months had passed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Less than three months from proud knight to bride to be?\" Kelos asked. \"That doesn't seem like much time.\" She wondered if she would meet the same fate if she continued on the path she was on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, your dress!\" Cynthia said excitedly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kelos stared at the gown being presented to her, transfixed. She could have pushed it away, or yelled at at the one offering it, or even just stomped right out of the room. But instead, something far different managed to slip from the corners of her mouth: \u201cCynthia... what was Liesa like?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maid paused, curious, if for only a moment. Quickly however, a pleasant smile maneuvered onto her face, as she just as quickly maneuvered closer to her ward. \u201cOh? Liesa? She was a fair ruler. The people, the kingdom, her husband, they loved her. I especially did. It was a tragedy when that illness struck. Arms up now, dear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos' brow furrowed, as she was guided into the exceptionally froofy outfit. \u201cBut... what about before? And right after? With that curse. How did he- she, cope?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia ran her hands over the princess; arms, waist, checking for any creases that might mar the pretty silhouette she was finally getting a chance to see. \u201cWell Sigmund was a fine knight, I recall. One of Arthras' most loyal. That's why the king at first wanted to help her so.\u201d As Kelos proved rapt, the servant gently took her hand, and started the trot to the makeup table. \u201cThe change though, when it happened, was difficult. Sigmund was very prideful, and hated how she couldn't rightly serve her king.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess gave the tiniest nod, as she was sat down. It was comforting, somewhat. Her story and the knight's didn't sound similar at all. Prince Kelos prided himself on not being too... prideful. This whole experience was proof of that! She liked to think her reason, and ability to not fall into an arrogant stupor, is why the negotiations of this trip hadn't fallen through to rock bottom. She could imagine a thousand other scenarios where ego would only make things inconceivably worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy all means, here she was, sitting in a (surprisingly quite comfortable) ballgown, and getting made up by a, at least polite enough, maid, who just had the fleeting fancy of playing matchmaker between her and the king. It meant something good that romance seemed more on the table than needless bloodshed, right? At least for the sake of the two kingdoms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the powdering her cheeks were getting could be seen as <i>another</i> form of brutality. Cynthia was going out of her way to make her look pretty, it appeared. <i>Very</i> thoughtful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow hold still sweetie, your eyeshadow is next.\u201d The head maid was glad Kelos looked to be taking things in stride. She proved a bit fussy at first, but the maturity to accept a good spoiling is what really set her apart some of the other people she'd known. \u201cThis is just coming from me, but what I honestly believe helped turn things around for Liesa were sessions like these.  I'd only been a young apprentice at the time, but even back then a royal pampering meant something. Don't you agree?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few more moments, but Kelos was eventually allowed to get a peek at the finishing touches being done to her. What sat in front of the vanity mirror was the most primly pristine princess this side of Traeven; a reminder of all those gatherings where she'd seen Fia, and had her breath taken away by just how beautiful she looked. For some reason, her chest was getting all fluttery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI- well... you've- you've done a commendable job, Cynthia. Making me... presentable for the event.\u201d Kelos simply sat for a few moments; looking on in scrutiny, as the woman behind her fiddled with lengths of the red locks cascading down the back of her head. The dress, the artfully applied lipstick, the way her lashes waved every time she blinked. It was hard to describe the emotions knowing that that was.  \u201cI'm... I'm a man, you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia didn't move an inch from her position, as she braided the younger girl's hair. \u201cDear, did I ever tell you Sigmund had a fiancee?\u201d She paused briefly, but her hands kept moving. \u201cIt was a trying time for them as well after the curse, but both I feel through it all learned a lot. Love can mean many things. Relationships aren't as clear as the fairy tales say they are.\u201d Cynthia comforted Kelos by gently gracing her palms on the other's shoulders. \u201cWhile Liesa eventually found Arthras, the love she shared with her fiancee didn't taper. Only changed. Even today, they feel a deep bond.\u201d Smoothly walking over to in front of the girl, and looking down into her eyes, the maid just offered one final thing. \u201cAll I'm saying is you'll be much more happy if you don't let silly expectations tell you how to live. Go to the ball tonight. Have fun. Do what your heart tells you. The only thing you are, is a <i>person</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shade of red was soaking deeply on the princess's cheeks. \u201cI... I want to dance with Fia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen dance with her!\u201d The caretaker cheered. \u201cThough, I still think you and Arthras would make a cute couple.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow adorned in a french braid, and ready for the festivities tonight, Kelos honestly didn't know where this all would take her.</span></div></div>",

She thought it strange that just hours earlier these halls were nearly empty, with merely an occasional servant attending duties or a guard patrolling. Now though, they seemed full of life as guests for the ball made small talk with each other. She passed a few familiar faces, a countess from a neighboring kingdom she had a fling with a few years ago, a prince she had met during an official visit, a duke who had served as ambassador to Grovan for a time, but most of them were strangers. Though she was certain none of the people she did know would recognize her in this form. After all, she had been male at the time. Briefly she wondered if she had in fact known any of those others she had passed. Perhaps some of them were people who had met a similar accident. She giggled a bit at the thought that one of the young women she had passed may have once been a man as well. Or perhaps the opposite, one of the men being a former woman. Her thoughts were lost as she heard the sound of music floating through the air, which indicated she was in the right place. She turned a corner and the entrance to the ball room lay ahead of her. The doorway flanked by guards dressed in ceremonial uniforms holding elaborate golden lances. She wondered if they were solid gold or just gold leaf. She approached, prompting no reaction from the guards. On the other side was a maid, standing behind a podium with a long scroll. Next to her was a butler, carrying a trumpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Princess Kelos,\" the maid said. \"Welcome. Both King Arthras and Princess Fia are really looking forward to seeing you tonight.\" She quickly looked through the list before checking off Kelos' name. She then turned to the butler, and pointed to the name. The butler nodded and raised the trumpet to his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DA-DAA-DA-DA-DUN-DA-DA! the trumpet blared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now arriving, Princess Kelos of Grovan!\" the butler announced at the top of his lungs. The crowd immediately turned to face the door. While Kelos couldn't make out anything specific, a murmur rose from the other guests. Clearly she was now the center of attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that really necessary?\" Kelos asked with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, King Arthras' personal orders,\" the maid said. \"Good luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos stepped through the doorway and looked around. The ballroom was elaborately, some might even say garishly decorated. There was already a decent crowd of people, though from the length of the list the maid had she guessed it wasn't even half the total number of guests. She briefly considered how she was going to get through the night. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was no sense in trying to hide, Kelos reasoned. After all, her plan to dance with Fia would make some waves too. She took a deep breath, faced the crowded ballroom, smiled, and curtsied, then walked in. Man, woman, prince, princess, either way she was Grovan royalty and would face this with her head held high. She looked around for people she knew, and spotted a few, all of whom were staring in disbelief. She was about to approach the closest to her, when someone else had beaten her to the punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cousin Kelos? Is that really you?\" a young woman's voice called out. Kelos turned and looked over the girl. She looked familiar somehow. Cousin? Then Kelos realized who this was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Camille?\" Kelos replied. She looked over her younger cousin, eldest daughter of her father's younger sister, they had played together quite often when there were little. However, it had been years since they saw each other, as her father was Duke of Albio, which while official neutral, was close to Traevan, and had been distancing itself from Grovan even prior to the war. \"I didn't recognize you at first. You were only a little girl when I saw you last, and now you've grown into such a beautiful woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Camille replied. \"Umm, so have you, which is kind of... strange since you were a boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I had a little magical mishap on my way here and was transformed into a woman,\" Kelos replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-is it permanent?\" Camille asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been assured it's temporary,\" Kelos replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad,\" a woman said as she approached the two. \"You make a better woman than you did a man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Countess Therese,\" Kelos said. \"It's been a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not long enough, Princess,\" Therese replied. \"But I must say, your new form suits you. You certainly lacked balls when you were a man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you still have your charming way with words,\" Kelos replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is she?\" Camille asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were engaged to be married,\" Therese said. \"But then you left me for a chance at that bitch Fia!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were not engaged,\" Kelos corrected. \"Mother and father turned down your family's request.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could have said yes,\" Therese retorted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could have, but my heart has always belonged to Fia.\" Kelos said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it doesn't look like that will be happening now, Princess,\" Therese said. \"I do hope you'll find a nice husband and learn what a real man is like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now,\" Camille said, trying to defuse the tension. \"Why don't we put the past behind us and enjoy the ball?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I already am,\" Therese said. With that she turned and walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she's as pleasant as ever,\" Kelos said. </span></div></div>",

At first your hesitant, but then you get lost in his eyes that hide so much mystery. You start dancing and get swept off your feet. The two of you kiss on the balcony just as the ball ends and promise to see each other again.

Like let's say you were stuck as a woman and absolutely had to marry someone here, who'd make the best husband?\" She looked at Kelos with wide eyes, eager for whatever information she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know everyone here,\" Kelos said. \"And a lot of the people I do know, it's only by reputation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's gotta be something\" Camille said, practically begging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Kelos said. She looked around. While it was true she didn't know everyone here, she had met quite a few. Most nobles had stories about their eccentricities spread. Of course many were false, but every so often one was true. She looked around at the growing crowd. In her head she recalled what she had heard about them, and rejected each in turn as a recommendation for her cousin. \"Ah, that guy,\" she said after a few moments, gesturing to a rather handsome man who was chatting with a group of women, who were hanging on his words. \"Prince Bosley of Cresselfurd. He's charming, intelligent, and as far as I know a decent person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those other women seem fixated on him,\" Camille said as she watched the women laughing at whatever he was telling them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's probably my main competition here,\" Kelos said. \"I'll introduce you.\" Kelos took her cousin's hand and began to pull her over. \"Once you get him to fall for you, it'll be one less suitor for Fia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Camille exclaimed. \"We can't just go over like that! What about those other women? Besides he won't recognize you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure we can, and I'm sure he's seen stranger things than a man turning into a woman,\" Kelos said. \"Trust me, he'll tell you all about them too. If there's one flaw he's got, he likes telling stories a bit too much.\" Kelos dragged her hesitant cousin across the ballroom to the prince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And so there I was, still hung over, and woke up surrounded by trolls,\" Bosley said as Kelos and Camille walked up. \"The biggest one, he looked to be their leader., he stepped forward and was like Now human we shall take your life. So I said to him,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just as long as you don't take my liquor!\" Kelos interrupted, completing the Prince's story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBosley looked over at her. \"I'd think I'd remember telling someone as lovely as you this story before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't tell me, I was there,\" Kelos said. \"Then the troll took your liquor and drank the whole bottle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, he shouldn't have done that,\" Bosley continued. He turned back to the women he was talking to. \"If you ladies remember, I said one sip got me drunker than I'd ever been in my life. Well trolls can't normally get drunk, but this bottle, it was the nectar of the gods. Wouldn't you know it, the troll got drunk and he was one of those sobbing drunks. My companions and I spend the next few hours listening to this troll tell us all his problems. Then he passed out, and the other trolls just sort of wandered off.\" He then looked back at Kelos. \"Speaking of my companions, I don't recall a beautiful princess on that hunting trip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because I wasn't one at the time. I'm Kelos, I had an unfortunate magical accident and have become a woman,\" the transformed prince explained. The women listening to Bosley giggled at this news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I can't say I mind the change,\" Bosley replied as he looked over Kelos' figure. \"Much easier on my eyes. But I'll bet the ladies are disappointed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No doubt,\" Kelos replied. \"I wanted to introduce you to someone though.\" She pulled her Camille up front. \"This is my cousin, Lady Camille, daughter of the Duke and Duchess of Albio.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a pleasure to meet you, Lady Camille,\" Bosley said, taking her hand and kissing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no the pleasure is all mine,\" Camille replied, her face turning a deep crimson. The women glared at Camille, who didn't seem to notice them as she gazed into the Prince's soft, brown eyes.</span></div></div>",

Bosley and the women hanging on him looked up as Kelos and Camille turned.

It seemed familiar to Kelos, as if she had seen it recently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, put it on, my dear,\" Arthras said expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me help,\" Camille said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBosley approached Kelos from behind. \"Kel, remember what I said about men who want to make you their wife?\" he whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, accepting this won't mean any obligation to marry me,\" Arthras said with a chuckle. \"Just don't accept any rings, for doing so would be a binding vow of marriage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shall remember that,\" Kelos said. \"Still, I am not actually a woman, so accepting this gift seems somewhat odd. What would I do with it once I am returned to normal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then give it to Fia,\" Arthras said. \"Or pass it down to a daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps,\" Kelos said as she looked over the pendant. She tried to place where she had seen it. Maybe it was the late queen's and she had seen it in a portrait? Regardless, there's no harm in accepting it, right? She turned to Camille and held it out. \"Would you be so kind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Camille said. She took the pendant and unclasped the chain. Kelos turned around as Camille placed the pendant around her cousin's neck, the clasped the chain. She let go, allowing it to hang naturally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks ravishing on you, Princess,\" Arthras said. \"But if you'll excuse me, I must be off.\" He again kissed Kelos' hand and left in a hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure that was a good idea, Kel?\" Bosley asked. \"That pendant might be enchanted to keep you a woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't deny that he would certainly like me to remain this way,\" Kelos said, facing Bosley. \"But surely he's aware using magic to trap me in this form would result in continuing war. I believe he's attempting to convince me to stay like this willingly. Still, it is something to consider.\" Kelos turned to Camille. \"Could you help me remove this pendant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you just put it on,\" Camille replied, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's simply a test,\" Kelos said. \"If it can be removed, it is likely not enchanted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sure,\" Camille said. Kelos turned so Camille could access the clasp.</span></div></div>",

She had brought a similar nightgown, though white, as part of her gifts for Princess Fia. If she wished to Fia wearing it, how could she ask after turning down this one? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, how daring,\" Fia said with a giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Princess Kelos, get up and turn around so I can undo your dress,\" Cynthia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here?\" Kelos asked, then glanced over to Fia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, you don't have anything Princess Fia hasn't seen before,\" Cynthia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess, but still,\" Kelos said. \"There's a matter of impressions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe what Princess Kelos means is she wishes to present herself to me in her nightgown,\" Fia said. Kelos blushed slightly but didn't object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well,\" Cynthia said with a sigh. \"We'll have you change in the bathroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Kelos said. She got up and headed to the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before you go, can you undo my dress, Cynthia?\" Fia asked. \"I'd like to get changed too.\" She stood up and turned around to allow access to the buttons in the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Princess,\" Cynthia said. She walked over to Fia and unbuttoned her dress. Kelos glanced at Fia's back and felt the same warmth in her loins she had when she and Fia had pressed their breasts together while embracing each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry back, Kelos,\" Fia said, winking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Kelos replied. \"I'll be back soon.\" She and Cynthia left, and headed to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem to adapting well, Princess,\" Cynthia said as they walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's probably that Fia has been far more accepting of the situation than I had dared hope,\" Kelos replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fia has always been an... open minded young lady,\" Cynthia said. \"It's that open mindedness that made this attempt at peace between our kingdoms possible.\" They reached the bathroom, Cynthia opened the door, then gestured to Kelos to proceed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Kelos replied as she entered the bathroom. \"I must be thankful for that then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia followed Kelos in, shutting the door behind them. \"Come now, dear, let's get you changed,\" she said as she unfastened Kelos' dress and helped the transformed prince undress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting undressed, Kelos looked down at her naked, feminine body. Though she still felt strange, she didn't find the sight of it as disconcerting as she had earlier. Fia's acceptance must have helped with that, she thought. She ran her hands down her womanly curves, feeling the shape of her new form. \"Well, I suppose there are worse fates than being transformed into a woman,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit,\" Cynthia said. \"Here, put this on.\" She handed Kelos the black lace panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These won't cover much,\" Kelos commented as looked that them. In fact they were more a thong than actual panties. Still, she slid them up her legs and put the panties on. The string in the back settled between her buttcheeks, leaving her feminine rear exposed. She thought about changing her mind but the phrase \"don't ask someone to do something you wouldn't be willing to do came to mind.\" Kelos sighed and held out her hand for the top. Cynthia handed it to her, and Kelos slipped it on. It barely came down to mid thigh and was nearly transparent. \"Even my nipples are visible,\" Kelos said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do have a robe for you, Princess,' Cynthia said, handing Kelos a black silk robe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Kelos replied, as she quickly put the robe on. It was only half an inch longer than the nightgown, but at least it wasn't see through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall we return to Princess Fia?\" Cynthia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's,\" Kelos replied.

He then led her through more corridors to a pair of large, solid oak doors. \"We're here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarved into the doors was an intricate depiction of a battle. The armies had what looked like armor and weapons from a thousand years ago. Rather than horses, one side had armored elephants behind its infantry, while the other had its general, or maybe its king holding a sword up while riding a dragon. Though she had studied military history, she did not recognize the specific battle shown here. While war elephants were once used with some regularity and dragons have been known to aid human armies, she could not think of an instance where both fought against each other. She concluded it must be a scene from Traeven's mythology rather than an historical event. Suddenly the doors creaked and began to open. Kelos looked at Tromil, who stood to the side not saying a word. Kelos took this as her cue and entered the king's study. Inside she saw King Arthras sitting at a large desk made of marble. She thought the king looked older than she remembered him from meeting before the war, his face partly hidden by a thick, grey beard. He was hunched over examining a map. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Arthras looked up upon hearing Kelos enter the room. \"Who are you, girl, and where is Prince Kelos?!\" he shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Kelos,\" the reluctant princess replied. \"There was an incident on the way here. I wished to see your magician to restore myself before meeting you, but I was told you wished to see me right away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthras looked at Kelos disapprovingly, but then looked back down at his map. \"Whatever, we have more important things to discuss than your current gender.\" He gestured to the map. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos approached the desk and looked down. \"What is the problem, your majesty?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king looked up and replied...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kelos shifted in her seat uncomfortably as her breasts bounced upon the carriage hitting yet another bump in the road. She had been attempting to brush up on the dossiers of Treaven's Royal court again, partly in preparation, partly to distract herself from this accursed body, yet had not made much progress as her feminine form was determined to make itself known at every little shake and shimmy of the carriage. She put the current dossier, a boring document about Treaven's Minister of Finance aside, and adjusted her new breasts. As her hand brushed over her nipple, she felt a slight but undeniable wave of pleasure. These things were far too sensitive for Kelos' peace of mind, especially being alone in her carriage. This accursed form was certainly with its temptations, but Kelos refused to give in to it. A new distraction was needed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos opened the curtain covering the carriage's window and looked out. A vast swath of farmland stretched to the horizon, the fields full of what she assumed to be wheat, or maybe barley. \"I guess Treaven will have a good harvest this year,\" she thought to her self. She then slid across the seat to the other side of the carriage and opened the curtain. There, the familiar sight of trees, trees, and more trees. She spotted Jex mounted on his horse riding to the side and a little back. When he saw her, he smiled at Kelos. The reluctant princess returned a forced half smile, which seemed to satisfy him. Looking further back she saw the captain, still a mare obviously, and the scribe trailing a bit behind. One of the guards was riding next to them, a good idea, Kelos thought. She then looked ahead and saw the other guards riding in front of the carriage. She wondered how much longer it would be before they arrived at Treaven. She bent over to look for a map when the carriage suddenly bucked violently, down, up, then down again, before jerking to a halt. Kelos was thrown from her seat, hitting her head on the frame of the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oww, what the devil?\" Kelos exclaimed, as she touched her hand to her head. She felt a bit of a lump, but a glance at her hand afterwards revealed no blood. She looked around and saw the carriage's contents had been thrown about, the carriage itself sloped down to the front left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess! Are you okay?!\" Jex called out, opening the right door of the carriage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm fine,\" Kelos replied, as she looked up, seeing only Jex and the sky. Jex offered his hand to help Kelos out. Kelos sighed and took it, allowing the young guard to help her out. Once standing outside, she turned and looked at the carriage. \"Did we throw a wheel?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite,\" one of the guards on the other side of the carriage said. \"Come look at this!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos and Jex walked around the carriage to the guard. They saw him looking at the front left wheel, which had been broken. They then followed his head to the ground, there they spotted a hole, which appeared to have been carefully disguised. Peering into the hole they saw a triangular piece of steel, placed just right to break a carriage wheel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bandits!\" Jex shouted. \"Men, prepare yourselves!\" He drew his sword, and the other guards followed suit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos also drew her sword, surprised at how heavy it felt in her current body's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scribe came over and looked at the hole. \"I wonder if this is the work of bandits, or an underworked wheelwright.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have heard of such schemes,\" Kelos replied. \"However, we should be prepared for anything.\" The group nervously scanned the woods, looking for signs of ambush.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>No one said a word as the group watched for any signs of an attack, the silence only adding to the tension. It was broken by what sounded like a bird call from the woods. A second later there was another one in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get ready!\" Kelos said, adapting a fighting stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just a bird,\" the scribe replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, bandits often use bird calls to communicate, like a code,\" Kelos replied. She took a step forward, and nearly lost her balance as her foot slid in her now too large boot. \"It's going to be hard to fight like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take this,\" The scribe said, tossing Kelos a scroll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos caught the scroll. \"So what does this one do?\" she asked, giving the scribe a suspicious look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will alter your clothing to something more suited to your current body,\" the scribe replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It better not be a maid outfit,\" Kelos said sternly, \"If it is, bandits will be the least of your problems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The scroll reacts to the thoughts of the user,\" the scribe explained. \"If you think about maids, it will be, but if you think about armor, it will give you something to fight in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkeptical, Kelos tried to think of armor. \"What kind of armor would women wear anyway?\" she wondered as she opened the scroll. A brief flash for light went off, and Kelos felt her clothing change. The first thing she notices was a breeze between her legs. She looked down at what she was wearing. The first thing she noticed was her steel breastplate, it looked much like a man's, save some extra room in the chest for her breasts. Glancing at her shoulders she saw a leather shirt underneath. Her forearms had steel gauntlets protecting them, though she noted a lack of protection of her upper arms. A steel, segmented tasset over a short leather skirt protected her upper legs, but allowed that breeze she felt. She wore leather leggings that went up just under the skirt, and steel greaves protected her shins. Underneath them she felt a pair of sturdy leather boots. Although she could tell they had a slight heel to them, not quite two inches. Not exactly practical combat wear, but not completely useless either. \"Perhaps I should not have thought about it being specifically for women,\" Kelos thought with a sigh. This would have to do though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick series of bird calls sounded thought the forest. \"RAAAAAAAHHHHHHHGGGGGG!\" A group of men, well over a dozen, charged the stranded carriage. They were wearing at best leather armor, armed mainly with clubs, though a few had swords or axes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Protect the Princess!\" Jex ordered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take them alive!\" a voice called out from the woods. \"We'll take their possessions and get a ransom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards did their best to keep the bandits away from Kelos, but there were too many. A bandit armed with a sword deftly weaved past Jex, and lunged at the former Prince. She casually parried him, sidestepped and tripped him. He attempted to regain his balance, but Kelos whacked him in the back of the head with the hilt of her sword, sending him to the ground. Disoriented from the blow, he crawled away under the carriage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like a girl who can handle a sword,\" a voice called out from the woods. A man leapt out of the woods, sprinted towards the group and did a jump flip over the battling guards and bandits, landing in front of Kelos. He then drew his sword. \"Let us see how you handle mine.\" He stabbed at Kelos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos quickly dodged the strike and countered with a thrust of her own, aimed at the bandit's neck. The bandit was just a little too slow to dodge, Kelos smiled as she thought she had slain her opponent, yet she did not feel any contact with her blade. Her smaller body had a shorter reach, which resulted in just missing. \"Damn it,\" Kelos exclaimed, as she attempted to mentally adjust. This was not a mistake she could afford to repeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An excellent try, dear,\" the bandit said. \"You are certainly skilled for a woman. I wonder if you'd be as skilled with my other sword.\" He winked at Kelos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up,\" Kelos replied, striking at the bandit. He parried her blow and returned one of his own, which Kelos dodged. The two exchanged blows, trying to get the upper hand for some time with neither succeeding. Kelos noted she seemed to have the edge in skill, but her current body lacked the strength of the bandit, allowing him to fight evenly. Worse though was Kelos found her arm was getting tired. Not only was this body lacking strength, which was to be expected, but also endurance. It wasn't decisive, but if she didn't win quickly, the bandit would gain the advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must say I'm impressed,\" the bandit said. \"Allow me to introduce myself. I am Uwain, leader of the Sons of Cyhir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good for you,\" Kelos replied, using the bandit's sudden urge for conversation to rest a bit. \"I am Kelos, Prince...ss of Grovan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Charmed, I'm sure you shall give birth to a strong son one day, and much sooner to a hearty ransom,\" Uwain said. \"I'd be willing to assist you with the former, if you'd like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem to be getting ahead of yourself, Kelos replied. \"I hope the likely small bounty on your head is enough to pay for repairs to my carriage, at least.\" Having rested enough to recover some stamina, Kelos thrust her sword at the bandit leader and their battle resumed.</span></div></div>",

However, her smaller frame and shorter arms resulted in the tip of her blade coming short of its target. If she were still a man, this fight would have been decided. As it was now, Kelos was struggling to hold her own. In addition to being weaker, it was subtle things. Her shorter arm made her misjudge her strike reach. Her wider hips and different center of gravity made it harder to keep her footing. She was adjusting, but it was taking time, and time was to her opponent's advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must say, you fight well, for a woman,\" Uwain said. \"But surely, you must see that you are losing this fight. Surrender. I would rather not leave a mark on your pretty little face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you fought half as well as you talk, I might consider doing so,\" Kelos shot back. \"I suppose you aren't terrible with a blade, but I doubt you'd qualify for a royal guard.\" She welcomed this bandit's second break to talk. It was strange though. Surely he realized these breaks only benefited her. If he would keep up the attack, he'd be able to tire Kelos out. Unless... He needed the break too. Why else would a bandit be so accommodating in a fight? With that realization, Kelos went on the offensive. She thrust her sword right at Uwain's neck. Not expecting it, he was caught off guard, and barely managed to dodge. Kelos closed further and slashed at Uwain, who barely parried it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah there, girl, you get a second wind?\" Uwain asked, as he was unexpectedly put on the defensive. Kelos ignored him. She found herself finally getting accustom to her new reach and stance. She wasn't as smooth as in her normal form, but at least she was moving cleanly now. She struck again, with a slash at the bandit's arm. This time he was a little too slow, and the blade met the flesh. \"MMMNG,\" he winced, dropping his sword. Kelos wasted no time, she moved in and struck his jaw with her sword's hilt, sending him to the ground. She kicked his sword away, and pointed her own as his neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bandits! I have defeated your leader!\" Kelos shouted. \"Surrender or I run him through!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this, the bandits, who had been using their numbers to wear down Kelos' guards, lost their will to fight. Some lay down their arms and surrendered, while others fled into the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done, Princess!\" Jex exclaimed, as he collected the weapons of the bandits who surrendered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tie the prisoners up,\" Kelos ordered. She then turned to the carriage. \"Scribe! Get out here and make yourself useful. Attend to the wounded!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am,\" the scribe said as he cautiously climbed out of his hiding place. Looking around and seeing it was safe, he began basic treatment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were holding back,\" Uwain said, as the scribe tended to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all, my skills were simply a bit rusty,\" Kelos replied. She held her sword out, looking down the blade, then tilted it to the side, before sheathing it. \"But it quickly came back.\" She stretched her arms. While not long ago everything about this body felt off, after that fight, it seemed a lot more natural. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess, We've secured the prisoners,\" Jex said. \"However, I'm sure the ones who escaped will be back with friends. What should we do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos thought for a moment. Clearly he was right. Staying was risky, and they should get the bandits to the authorities as soon as possible. Yet with the carriage wheel like that, it wasn't going anywhere. She certainly didn't relish leaving all of her gifts for Fia behind. </span></div></div>",

I'd like to do much more to them,\" Kelos replied. \"Prepare your scrolls, but make sure you take all the actual important documents. I'm going to help the guards unload the cart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even with that body?\" Sean asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not so weak as to be useless,\" Kelos said. \"We're in a hurry, so every hand matters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, your highness,\" the scribe replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now you get to work too,\" Kelos said.

It was a trek, but eventually the group arrived in a small village at the edge of the forest. In the distance was a large pasture, with grazing cows and sheep. The village itself seemed peaceful enough. The houses were well made, built of solid stone, and a there was a small fountain in the middle of the town square. With many stalls set up near the square and people buzzing about, it gave the impression of being fairly prosperous. As they entered the town, some people looked at them with confusion. However, when they saw Uwain, they gave them a wide berth. Before long a man in a suit flanked by 4 guards in armor approached them cautiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos stepped forward. \"Greetings,\" she said. \"I am Princess Kelos of Grovan. My carriage was attacked by bandits on my way to see Princess Fia of Traeven. I was able to defeat their leader and my guards captured several others. I will gladly transfer them to your custody.\"</span></div></div>",

He then took a moment to take a breath and adjust his suit. \"I apologize for that outburst, Princess. That isn't the sort of thing a lady should see. I am Derron, mayor of Grenolyn. Welcome to my humble town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's quite alright Mayor Derron,\" Kelos replied as she watched the guards make the prisoners put down the loads they had been carrying and dragged them off. Literally in Uwain's case. \"I have seen far worse. Plus, it seems you have a history with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that bastard kidnapped my son and his new wife several years ago,\" Derron said. \"They ransomed her, but kept him. He wasn't the first, nor the last, but now that you captured their leader, there's hope that no others will be taken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do they do with the men they take?\" Kelos asked. \"Slave labor? Force them to join the bandits?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing that simple,\" Derron replied. \"They worship an ancient demon who grants them dark powers that let them come and go through the forest as they please. Because of this, we have never been able to track down their hideout. However, this demon has a commandment of its followers. They must not sire children with women. They then kidnap men, transform them into women, and then...\" His voice trailed off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Kelos replied. \"A loophole in the commandment.\" She wondered what her fate would have been if they had defeated her and discovered the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"King Arthras has sent soldiers several times to track these bandits down, but they have all gone missing. Surely they have suffered the same fate\" Derron said. \"Princess, you have already defeated their leader. I must ask you to help us. I will send word to Traeven that Uwain has been captured, however, it will take some time before more soldiers can be sent. I fear the remaining bandits will attempt to free him, and likely take more townspeople for revenge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A valid concern,\" Kelos replied. \"Though with their leader captured they may law low, or try to move their hideout.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are nothing if not brazen,\" Derron replied. \"I do not see them laying low.\"</span></div></div>",

Is it common for Grovan royalty to bring such things on diplomatic travels?\" Derron asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but apparently my scribe always has some with him,\" Kelos replied. \"I have seen them work all too effectively.\" She turned and pointed to one of the horses. \"That horse is actually the captain of my guard. He had an incident with one of these scrolls. Speaking of which, would it be too much to ask for lodging for my men, stables for my horses, and a private stable for the captain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all, Princess!\" Derron replied. \"It's the least we can do in exchange for capturing Uwain the terrible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Kelos replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, thank you,\" Derron said. \"I will be interrogating that bastard, but I'll have my assistant arrange for all your needs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like some assistance with the interrogation?\" Kelos asked. \"I might not look it, but I do have experience questioning prisoners.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I appreciate the offer, Princess,\" Derron said. \"Though I must decline. I intend to continue from where I left off earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More things a lady shouldn't see?\" Kelos asked, forcing a polite smile. This mayor was clearly not an experienced interrogator, but sometimes a simple beating is enough to get someone to talk. Still, she did not think a veteran bandit who rose to leadership would be so easily cracked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regrettably,\" Derron replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If he does not talk, may I try?\" Kelos asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose it won't make things any worse,\" Derron replied. \"Very well.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kelos stepped forward towards the window and touched her reflection. She hadn't really had the chance to look herself over since the transformation, but now she saw the attractive young woman looking back at her. \"What if I'm stuck like this?\" she wondered. There was no way she could marry Princess Fia if they were both women. Orianna would now be first in line for the throne too. Commanding Grovan's armies would also be impossible. Sure, a woman could inherit the throne, but by Grovan law, her husband would be given command of the army. Husband. The very word sent a chill down the transformed prince's spine. Now as second princess, surely she would be married off to secure an alliance. As she was lost in thought, Kelos didn't notice the world start to fade out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're the one who defeated my champion,\" a deep but still clearly female voice echoed from behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's there?\" Kelos asked, spinning around and reaching for her sword. However, she found nothing. Glancing down, she found herself naked. In a near panic, she looked around. The town and her men were gone, and no one was standing there, only darkness stretched out before her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impressive that you were able to win in that weak, unfamiliar body, despite the blessings I gave Uwain,\" the voice said. A point of light appeared, and suddenly Kelos saw a familiar figure in front of her. \"Now this body I could see winning.\" Kelos' male body stood there examining itself, the female voice coming out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the goddess Uwain worships,\" Kelos said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct, I am Cyhir,\" the goddess in Kelos' original body said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I?\" Kelos asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're inside your mind, Princess,\" Cyhir replied. \"Don't worry, barely a second will pass outside. I assume you prefer Princess, given your appearance here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was transformed by a magic scroll,\" Kelos explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your body was transformed,\" Cyhir replied. As she did Kelos' male form shifted to that of the female body Kelos was currently possessing. \"But your form here is how you see yourself.\" She waved her hand and a mirror appeared, showing Kelos' reflection. Rather than the red haired female body the scroll gave her, the reflection showed a body far closer to Kelos' male one. Long, straight black hair ran down her back, and her face was feminine, pretty, but recognizable as her own. Kelos turned from side to side, examining herself. Cyhir stepped beside Kelos, the contrast between the body Kelos had and the one the scroll gave her became obvious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a trick!\" Kelos exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is your own mind,\" Cyhir replied. \"If you view yourself as a man, show me.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kelos closed her eyes and focused on her male form. Short black hair, wide shoulders, strong pecs, well toned abs, muscular arms and legs. Truly a man among men. Yet no matter how Kelos focused, she retained her current form. \"You're stopping me!\" Kelos accused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have the power to, Princess,\" Cyhir said. \"I can create objects, I can show images, but your appearance here is a product of your own subconscious mind. This, deep down, is how you view yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Preposterous!\" Kelos exclaimed. \"Why would I view myself as a woman?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I look through your memories?\" the goddess asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What for?\" Kelos replied skeptically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because the answer may be contained there,\" Cyhir said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More importantly why do you even care?\" Kelos asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've taken a bit of an interest in you,\" Cyhir replied. \"I want to know who Princess Kelos is deep inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Kelos said. With that, the goddess held out her hand, and suddenly a flood of images nearly overwhelmed Kelos. All of the memories she had seemed to play at once. Meeting Princess Fia for the first time, graduating from the military academy, the first time eating solid foods, playing dress up with Orianna... Wait...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There!\" Cyhir said. The other memories faded away and Kelos saw her older sister's room. Everything seemed so big though. She felt a push and a familiar voice behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see how you look in the mirror, Cally,\" Orianna said. Kelos then saw herself? Himself? as a child, wearing Orianna's old dress, with a wig on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I look so pretty!\" Kelos heard herself say in her childhood voice. \"Am I a princess now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as you're wearing this dress you're Princess Cally,\" Orianna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm starting to see where you got that image from,\" Cyhir said. The scene faded away, only for a new one to appear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos saw the hall in the Grovan palace race by. Things still seemed big, but not quite as big. Suddenly Kelos saw the door to Orianna's room. She then saw a young hand pound on it, and heard her voice call out, \"Ori! Open up, it's an emergency!\" The door opened, and Kelos saw it flash by, then the room spined and the young hand slammed the door shut and locked it. Before Orianna could even speak, Kelos heard her voice. \"Ori, I need your help! I was looking around in the south tower for something interesting and I found a necklace and something about it made me want to put it on and I did and I... I turned into a girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to forget about that,\" Kelos sighed. \"Ori helped me keep that transformation secret, but it took a long time to change back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just how long did it take, Princess?\" Cyhir asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a few months,\" Kelos admitted. With that, the scene changed yet again. This time Kelos appeared about twelve, and was with two other boys. The three of them were wearing matching uniforms of the Grovan Academy of Military Arts, which Kelos attended for several years. The three of them were sneaking along a wall leading to the opening in a fence between their school and a neighboring girls academy at night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still not convinced this is a good idea,\" young Kelos said. \"But this way leads to the finishing school. Are you sure you want to do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I have to see her again, no matter what!\" one of the other boys insisted. \"The semester ends tomorrow, so I won't get a chance to see her for over a month!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if we get caught?\" the third boy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be fine,\" Kelos said. \"Just stay hidden here and hold our stuff.\" He handed him two vials containing a blue liquid. \"Remember we absolutely need these to go back to the dorms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" the third boy said taking the vials.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos then pulled out two pink vials and handed one to the second boy.  \"You and I need to drink up though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure this is safe?\" the second boy asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfectly,\" Kelos replied. \"On three. One, two, three!\" With that the two of them drank the pink liquid. A puff of smoke later and two girls wearing uniforms from the Finishing academy were standing in their place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems you willingly changed into a girl that time,\" Cyhir said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I suppose,\" Kelos said. She then let out a girlish giggle. \"We did get caught, but the matron thought we were students there, so we were sent back to the girls dorm. Luckily we met Harman's love and she covered for us. Still, since the Military academy was on break but the finishing school didn't get one, we spent that time with the other girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So another month as a girl?\" Cyhir asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose,\" Kelos replied as the scene faded out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just how many other times have you been a girl?\" Cyhir asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I try not to think about it too much,\" Kelos said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's clear where your image of yourself as a woman came from,\" Cyhir said. \"You won't do after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do for what,\" Kelos asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For my new champion,\" Cyhir said. \"If you had overcome your cursed form and defeated Uwain, you would have demonstrated your strength and could take his place. However, I see you have become too much a woman for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Given your cult's practices, I would not accept even if you had deemed me worthy,\" Kelos said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would have had no choice in the matter, Princess,\" Cyhir replied. \"But it seems I now need Uwain after all, despite his failure. I will now give you a choice. Tell the townsfolk to release my champion by sunset, or I shall order all of my remaining men to loot the town, and transform all its men into new women.\" With those words the dreamscape faded and Kelos found herself looking at her reflection in the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, isn't that just lovely,\" Kelos said frowning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess?\" Jaz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have just been contacted by Cyhir, the goddess Uwain and his followers worship,\" Kelos explained. \"Either Uwain is released by sunset, or his followers will attack the town and spare no man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will we do, Princess?\" Jax asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We must tell Derron at once,\" Kelos answered. \"This is his town, and his choice.

Though, as detestable as it would be to release him, I must ask why you rejected it outright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because he would surely lead the bandits in either a revenge attack or increased raids,\" Kelos replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sound reasoning,\" Derron replied. \"We shall make this town an invincible fortress!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Kelos was successful in stalemating Uwain, her guards were fighting a losing battle. While the bandits were no match for them one on one, they were making effective use of their greater numbers, striking, then retreating while another bandit took their place. The guards fought well, but in the end were defeated one by one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've fought well, Princess, but look around you,\" an exhausted Uwain said. \"Your bodyguards are defeated. Even if you best me, you cannot hope to defeat all of my men. If you surrender, we shall treat you well. After all, we wouldn't want to risk our ransom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos, likewise exhausted, cursed her current form. Had she her normal strength, this bandit would have been defeated as casually as the first one. If the guards had been able to hold the line for even a little bit longer, Kelos was certain she would have still gained the victory, likely demoralizing the rest as their leader fell. But that was not how events played out. \"I suppose there's no choice,\" she said, gritting her teeth. \"I surrender.\" She dropped her sword, and was instantly seized by two of the bandits, who quickly tied her hands behind her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I give up too!\" the scribe called out from in the carriage. He climbed out, and was quickly seized just as Kelos had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Princess, I failed you,\" Jex said sadly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We all failed today,\" Kelos said as the bandits dragged her group along. Kelos looked back at the carriage and saw more bandits climbing over it, taking the chests filled with gifts she had brought for Princess Fia and rounding up the horses. All except one, she noted. The transformed captain was nowhere to be found. \"Perhaps there's still some hope,\" she thought. Though what exactly the captain could do as a horse was a question, surely she didn't simply run away. Kelos allowed that thought to sustain her as she and her men were brought to the bandit camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they arrived, the bandits threw the guards and the scribe into large metal cages, still bound. Kelos, on the other hand was treated somewhat better, being kept in a small wooden shack with a rickety cot and a small table and stool, with two of the stronger looking bandits standing guard outside. \"Probably their royal suite,\" Kelos said sarcastically. Kelos looked around for weaknesses. \"Maybe I could use a table leg as a club,\" she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then there was a knock on the door. A woman appearing in her early thirties, wearing a simple and dirty cotton dress entered. She was missing an eye and had a number of scars on her face. Kelos looked her over and noticed some on her arms as well. She also noticed the woman was very pregnant. She was carrying a lavender ball gown and shoes, along with what appeared to be a corset and some other feminine undergarments. Kelos recognized it as one of the gowns she was to give to Princess Fia<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master Uwain has invited you to join him for dinner, Princess,\" the woman said in a monotone voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would prefer to dine alone,\" Kelos replied. She noted the woman's tone. She seemed to be someone whose spirit was completely broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master Uwain is not giving you a choice,\" the woman replied in the same flat tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose not,\" Kelos replied. \"You're speaking from experience there I assume.\"</span></div></div>",

She did not say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's your name?\" Kelos asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erwin, Princess,\" the woman replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that a man's... oh,\" Kelos said, realizing the implications of Erwin's name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are correct, Princess,\" Erwin replied. \"If the ransom is not paid in time, your guards shall share my fate.\" She rested her hand on her pregnant belly. \"As will you. Women who are captured and are not ransomed will be used as breeding stock. Men will be transformed into women and used as breeding stock.\" she spoke in the same monotone voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos shuddered at this revelation. \"How horrible,\" she said with a gasp. \"Have you tried to escape?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Escape is impossible once you have been marked,\" Erwin said. She lifted her dress to reveal her butt. On it was a brand, a complex pattern that seemed to be shifting as one looked at it. \"Even if you leave, with this, you can be returned here at a whim. She put her hand on her missing eye. \"Escape attempts will then be punished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What monsters!\" Kelos exclaimed. She heard snickering outside. The bandits guarding her were apparently amused at Kelos' reactions to this news. \"Surely Treaven cannot allow this to occur on their soil! Have they not sent soldiers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They have,\" Erwin replied. \"I was the knight in charge of tracking down Master Uwain. Now, I bear his child.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos did not reply to this. The two women remained silent as Erwin finished undressing Kelos and helped her put on the provided clothing. Kelos stood there naked for a moment, taking the opportunity to examine her body. While she had never seen naked breasts from this angle, she could tell they were perfectly proportioned. Her waist was slim, her stomach firm, and her hips flared out seductively. A perfect female body, save one thing, it should be male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErwin then helped Kelos get dressed. First came the corset, which, despite the tightness was not all together uncomfortable. Then came a pair of stockings, that were held in place by garter straps from the bottom of the corset. Next came a pair of panties which Kelos slid on over the straps. Kelos then put on the gown and slipped her arms into the sleeves, after which Erwin fastened the buttons on the back. Finally, Kelos stepped into the matching pair of heels. Erwin directed Kelos to sit on the stool and began to pull her hair back and braid it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally breaking the silence Kelos asked, \"When is the baby due?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Within the month,\" Erwin replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you feel about becoming a mother?\" Kelos asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You misunderstand,\" Erwin said. \"I am breeding stock, not a mother. The boy will be taken from me and I shall be milked like a cow for the next 6 months, after which I shall be impregnated again. I will never see him. Even when he is born I shall be blindfolded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems I was mistaken. I apparently owe monsters an apology for sullying them by comparing them to our captors,\" Kelos replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErwin finished braiding Kelos' hair. \"You are now ready for dinner, Princess,\" she said. \"Do enjoy your meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not think that likely,\" Kelos replied. She leaned over and whispered in Erwin's ear. \"I'll come back and free you, I promise. Even if it takes the entire Grovan army.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you try, you shall join me,\" Erwin said. Not once in their conversation did her monotone voice change inflection.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Lead on to our captor,\" Kelos said with disgust in her voice. She had in her time seen some rather terrible things, you don't get anywhere in Grovan without at least witnessing some \"enhanced interrogation\" of prisoners or an occasional raid on enemy civilians. Taking an important prisoner and ransoming them was a known tactic as well. Still, there were rules to this sort of thing. What Erwin described was certainly well beyond that. Kelos thought about the scars she saw on Erwin's body and wondered how many more were hidden under that dress. Probably quite a number, she thought, enough to break a proud knight into someone who didn't even seem to react to the thought of being treated like a farm animal, to have completely given up hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This way, Princess,\" Erwin replied. She left the shack, with Kelos following. The two bandits standing outside followed just behind as they passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Kelos thought noting this. She also noted their new swords, clearly taken from her men. However, she didn't have time to dwell on this. The short heels on her boots had not been a challenge, but she was currently wearing 5 inch heels, and keeping her balance was proving difficult and demanded her concentration. She nearly fell a few times, but quickly adapted by taking smaller steps and swinging her hips more as she walked. This also caused her dress to brush up against her stockings more, a strange sensation Kelos found herself enjoying despite her best efforts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here, Princess,\" Erwin said as they arrived at a large log cabin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Kelos replied. She approached the door and prepared to knock, but stopped herself as she heard some voices inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm the high priest of Cyhir,\" one voice said. \"I've studied the texts more than anyone. The prophecy clearly warns about a scarlet haired woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are lots of red heads,\" the other voice, which Kelos recognized as Uwain, replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but this Princess is trouble. She beat you,\" the other voice said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She surrendered,\" Uwain stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because the others defeated her guards and she didn't have a choice. Look, if you're not going to listen to my warnings as priest, then listen to me as your friend, be careful around her,\" the other voice said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do appreciate your concern, but she's just a woman,\" Uwain replied. \"Who will make us very rich. Now if you'll excuse me, she'll be here soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos decided this was a good time, knocked, then immediately entered. \"Oh, I hope I interrupted something important,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, speak of the devil,\" Uwain said. \"Not at all, my dear, you're just a bit early. I'm somewhat surprised you didn't need to be dragged here by force.\" He was wearing one of Kelos' finer royal uniforms, one she had intended to wear to impress Princess Fia as Prince Kelos. She felt sick by the sight. \"I must say you look ravishing in that dress.\" He approached Kelos, and took her hand, preparing to kiss the back of it, as Prince Kelos had done to many a fair maiden.</span></div></div>",

After all, she was unarmed, and outnumbered 4 to 1 here. Plus, the lives of herself and her men were at stake here. An opportunity would come later, for now she resigned herself to playing the role of a captured princess, and not do anything to provoke the captors. \"Thank you,\" Kelos forced herself to say As Uwain bent over and kissed her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll leave you two now,\" the high priest said. Kelos looked him over. He was somewhat older than Uwain, his hair and beard spotted with grey, yet he still appeared quite fit. Wearing the same style of clothing as the other bandits, there was nothing to really mark him as a priest, high or otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, won't you stay and tell me more about that prophecy you mentioned?\" Kelos asked, trying to sound innocent, but not quite succeeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe priest gave Uwain a look as if to say, \"I told you so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He has priestly matters to attend to,\" Uwain said, gesturing to the priest to be on his way. The priest complied and continued out. The two guards who had escorted Kelos took up position flanking the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A pity,\" Kelos said. She had hoped there would be some information she could use to help escape in the prophecy, but it seemed they were reluctant to share.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The holy writings are not for the ears of outsiders,\" Uwain explained. \"Only men born into the Sons of Cyhir are allowed to hear of them,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What of women born into your little club?\" Kelos asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Son of Cyhir can only mate with a female marked by Cyhir, and a female so marked will birth only sons,\" Uwain explained. He looked over to Erwin.\"This one is carrying my son, for example. But let us not discuss such things. Come, sit.\" He walked over to a table in the middle of the room, pulled a chair out and gestured for Kelos to sit down. Kelos walked over and sat in the chair, doing her best to mimic how she had seen women sit at dinners, keeping her legs together and brushing her hand under the dress. Urwain pushed the chair in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are my men being given food?\" Kelos asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There will be plenty of time to discuss their fate,\" Uwain said. He then turned to Ewrin. \"Get me rum!\" He then looked at Kelos. \"And you, my dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos pondered this for a second. Was asking for rum just his uncouthness, or was it perhaps meant as a challenge, a drinking match to regain some pride from their earlier battle? In either case, perhaps it would be wise to avoid drinking alcohol, then exploit his eventual drunkenness?</span></div></div>",

It was opened from the outside, and several more guards led Kelos' men into the cabin.

They were obviously uncomfortable, but their lack of reaction to 'will be marked' told Kelos they were likely unaware of the meaning of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple, dear girl,\" Uwain said smugly. \"You'll propose a series of challenges for your men.

They might believe you to be a witch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That man is a capable fighter and good commander in battle, but he always was a bit stubborn and overzealous,\" Kelos replied with a sigh. \"Say... can he hear us like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, the scroll was intended to allow one to spy on important meetings,\" the scribe replied. \"He can see as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Kelos replied. She picked up the captain. \"Well, I suppose both of us learned an important lesson about playing with magic today.\" She placed him down on the seat opposite her then turned back to the scribe. \"I believe it would be best to tell the men...\"</span></div></div>",

Oww!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It most certainly is not,\" Kelos interrupted, fist ready for another strike. \"I simply realize the importance of a first impression. It would be scandalous for the man trying to claim Princess Fia's hand to arrive as a woman!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe the princess would prefer that?\" the scribe replied. \"I've heard she has rejected all suitors thus far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She simply hasn't had the honor of a suitor as handsome and manly as me,\" Kelos said, brushing a curl of hair to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scribe refrained from commenting on the beautiful young woman before him referring to herself as manly while playing with her hair. \"Of course, your highness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go inform the men and dispatch a messenger with the cover story,\" Kelos ordered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If they don't believe me? the scribe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We still have some scrolls left, if they don't believe you, you shall demonstrate one,\" Kelos said. \"So I suggest you be convincing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes your highness,\" the scribe replied. \"Though if I may be so bold as to make a suggestion, you are still wearing your uniform, it doesn't suit your current form.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos sighed and looked down at her painfully feminine form, still wearing her now ill fitting male clothes. \"Nor will anything else I brought with me,\" Kelos replied, frowning at the scribe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps, but we have brought many gifts for Princess Fia. I believe this includes some clothing that might be more appropriate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you saying I should wear a dress?! And one intended as a gift for Princess Fia at that?!\" Kelos shouted angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a suggestion, your highness. Please forgive my impudence, I merely thought you would be more comfortable,\" the scribe said. He bowed and left to inform the men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos again looked down at herself. The scribe was correct about one thing, these clothes did not suit her at the moment. From her boots being too large for her now dainty feet, her pant legs being too long threatening to trip her as she walked. Still, wearing a dress? Surely that would not be much better, would it?</span></div></div>",

She moved to stand up, but her now shorter legs didn't quite reach the ground, resulting in her boot partially slipping off. Kelos landed awkwardly and stumbled to the ground. \"Blast this spell!\" she exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your highness!\" a guard called out. \"Are you alright? The scribe told us what happened, but we could hardly believe it.\" He offered Kelos a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, you simpleton!\" Kelos snapped, swatting the hand away. \"I have not become addled, I'm just not used to my new height.\" She pushed her over sized boot back on her foot then carefully stood up and brushed herself off and took a deep breath. \"Bring me the chest with the dresses intended for Princess Fia. It's shameful, but my current clothes are inadequate for my current form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, your highness,\" the guard replied, as he hurried off to the supply cart to retrieve the chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your highness,\" the scribe called out from behind. \"I have dispatched the messenger to Castle Traeven, and informed the men of the situation. They were a bit incredulous, but I was able to convince them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally something gone right,\" Kelos said. \"Given how the day's been going, I'm surprised. But the men must be sworn to secrecy. None of this indignity can get back home\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, your highness,\" the scribe agreed. \"I must say I'm a bit surprised myself. I was worried I'd need to demonstrate a scroll.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps you should anyway,\" Kelos replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your highness, I brought the chest,\" the guard called out. He carried a rolled up tarp and led two other guards who each held one side of a massive chest. The first guard laid the tarp out on the ground, and the other two placed the chest on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thinking there,\" Kelos said. She walked over to the chest carefully, making sure she avoided tripping again. As she approached, one of the guards opened it, revealing dresses, shoes, and feminine undergarments, made by the finest seamstresses and cordwainers in Grovan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you decided to take my advice,\" the scribe said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be quiet!\" Kelos scolded. She grabbed a green dress, matching shoes, white panties, and a white brassiere. \"I wish there was a place I could clean up though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a stream nearby,\" the guard who opened the chest said pointing into the forest alongside the road. \"I saw it when I looked around after we stopped. It's hidden behind the bushes, but if you need help, we'll be able to hear you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will do,\" Kelos replied. \"If I run into trouble, I'll call for help.\" She headed off into the forest. Sure enough, after clearing the bushes, not 30 feet from the carriage was a stream which seemed to run parallel to the road. Kelos took off her rapier, leaning it against a tree, stripped off her ill fitting male clothes, and cleaned her body with the cool water from the stream. She tried to avoid thinking about her thin, girlish figure and modest breasts. \"It's just for a day,\" she told herself. She then slipped on the panties and brassiere, struggling a bit with the latter. After a few minutes, she managed to fasten it. She then turned to the dress, noticing it fastened in the back. She undid the lowest buttons near the narrow waist, then slipped the dress over her head, rather than undo them all and step into it, as she recognized was proper. She then reached behind and fastened the buttons she could reach. \"Why do they put these in the back anyway,\" she sighed. Finally Kelos stepped into the shoes. While none of it was a perfect fit, it was at least passable. She went to gather up her discarded male clothes, when she heard a rustling in the bushes on the far side of the stream. \"Who's there?!\" Kelos called out, as she quickly grabbed her sword and drew it, facing the direction of the noise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the bushes stepped...</span></div></div>",

I was searching for a prisoner who escaped my custody.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos attempted to reply, but found she could not speak or move. In her head she heard a woman's voice say a single word, \"fool.\" Against her will, Kelos' body lowered the sword and adopted a more feminine stance. \"A knight as handsome as you would surely have no need to spy on a young women, so I must conclude you are being honest,\" Kelos found her body saying on its own. \"Is this ruffian dangerous?\" Kelos struggled to regain control but to no avail. \"What the hell is this?!!\" Kelos thought. The woman's voice replied, \"This is your own fault, you stupid prince, now be quiet so I can find out that's going on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite dangerous,\" the knight replied. \"This was no mere bandit, but a dragon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, a dragon?!\" Kelos' body replied. \"You're the dragon aren't you?!\" Kelos thought. \"Get out of my body!\"  \"Yes, because dragons are renowned for their possession abilities,\" the woman's voice replied sarcastically. \"Now would you please SHUT UP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, she's young, but quite powerful,\" the knight replied. \"I was able to slay her mother, but this one proved difficult. I was able to catch her using a transformation arrow provided by Marlin, the court wizard at my castle which trapped her in the form of a human girl, and a collar that sealed her magic. However, she was able to trick one of my men into removing the collar, killed him, and escaped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How terrible!\" Kelos' body exclaimed. \"What's terrible is you possessing me!\" Kelos thought. This time the woman's voice ignored Kelos and continued addressing the knight. \"But are you not taking a risk approaching me? Could I not be the dragon laying a trap?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said, the dragon is trapped in her current form. She cannot perform such tricks at the present,\" the knight explained. \"But I forget my manners.\" The knight approached Kelos, took her right hand and kissed the back of it. Kelos was disgusted by this act, yet the one controlling his body swooned. \"I am Sir Dioral of Traeven, my lovely rose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Prince Kelos,\" Kelos' body replied, to Kelos' shock. \"What are you doing?!!\" Kelos shouted in his mind. \"If you had just been quiet,\" the woman's voice replied then continued to address Dioral. \"Though at the moment Princess would be more accurate.\" \"STOP!!!\" Kelos thought, but the woman continued. \"I am suffering from the effects of a curse brought about by my own foolishness. Though, unfortunately it is but temporary. Not that I shall think it unfortunate once I return to normal.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDioral was taken back by the frank and unexpected reply. \"So you're a guy?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At present I am a woman in mind and body,\" Kelos' body replied. \"It's a shame that mannish brute I was will return tomorrow.\" Kelos was furious at this. \"GIVE ME BACK MY BODY!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Dioral replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, in the corner of Kelos' eye, he noticed something shine in the bushes behind Dioral. The thing controlling his body was focused on the knight and didnt' seem to notice, but apparently while Kelos couldn't move or speak, he was not stuck looking at the center of the body hijacker's attention. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The thing controlling his body shifted attention away from the knight in time to see shining light from a spell about to be released. \"Behind you, Sir Dioral!\" Kelos' body called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDioral spun around just as the magic spell was released. Instinctively, he dove to the side, landing in the water as the spell flew past him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA young girl emerged from the bush. She appeared about 8 or 9, dirty and covered with scrapes. She was wearing a plain brown linen commoner's dress that had quite a few rips, some of them with what looked like dried blood and no shoes. Her long black hair was a tangled mess with sticks and leaves caught in it. Her ears were covered in dark green scales. Clearly, this was the dragon. \"That spell would have made him my loyal servant!\" she pouted. \"I guess I should have dealt with you first, woman.\" She pointed at Kelos as a ball of light formed on her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll give you control back temporarily,\" the voice in Kelos' head said. Suddenly Kelos found his currently female body responsive again. Without a moment's hesitation, Kelos charged the young girl. She thrust with her sword, hoping to run the dragon girl through with the initial strike followed on my the momentum of the charge. However, Kelos did not consider the shorter length of her feminine arms, resulting in the attack being delivered too soon. The dragon dodged to the side. Still, Kelos' attack managed to nick the dragon's arm, causing her to wince in pain and the spell to fizzle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos passed to the side of the dragon and struck her from behind with the hilt of her sword. The dragon grabbed on to Kelos' dress as she began to fall from the blow. A crackling filled the air as the dragon cast a lightning spell. \"AHHHH!!!\" Kelos screamed as electricity flowed through her. \"DIE, HUMAN BITCH!\" The dragon shouted. Dioral, back on his feet stabbed the dragon with his sword. The dragon screamed in pain, but the lightning from Kelos jumped to the metal sword conducting the electricity right To Dioral. \"Mmmg,\" he grunted as he pulled back. Despite the pain she was in, Kelos took note of what happened with Dioral, and stabbed the dragon. As expected, the electricity conducted right into the dragon. Again the dragon screamed, this time stopping her lightning spell and pulling back. Kelos slumped to her knees, jabbing her sword into the ground and leaning on it, stopping her from completely collapsing. \"That was somewhat disappointing,\" the voice in Kelos' head commented. \"Shut up,\" Kelos replied weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDioral charged the dragon, who leapt to the side and attempted to cast another lightning spell. Dioral quickly stabbed into the ground with his sword, then used it to throw some mud in the dragon's face. Blinded by the mud, the dragon missed Dioral with the lightning spell, striking a tree and starting a fire. She pulled back, wiping the mud out of her eyes. With that, Kelos' guards burst in to the scene. Seeing she was now greatly outnumbered by fresh soldiers, the dragon attempted to retreat, passing the wounded Kelos.</span></div></div>",

In her fall she grabbed at the dragon's dress, causing her to fall as well. In an instant, Dioral and Kelos' guards were there. the guards restrained the dragon long enough for Dioral to put the magic blocking collar back on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOO! My magic!!!\" the young dragon exclaimed as Dioral and one of the guards firmly held her by the shoulders. The young, though still formidable dragon had now been rendered as harmless as a typical human girl. \"I'll get you for this!\" the dragon said, turning and glaring at Kelos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be ready,\" Kelos said, smiling before blacking out. After a period of time, Kelos opened her eyes, and saw nothing but blackness. Looking down, Kelos saw not her current feminine body, but his original male form. However, despite the blackness around him, his body looked as if it were daylight out. Before he could say anything, the blackness was replaced with a blue sky and a field of flowers. Looking around, Kelos saw the familiar sight of Grovan's flower garden. \"I'm back home?\" he wondered aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite,\" a familiar woman's voice called out from behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos spun around, to see a beautiful blonde haired woman wearing the green dress Kelos had put on. \"Princess Fia?\" he asked, recognizing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again, not quite,\" the woman said as she walked towards Kelos. \"We're in your mind. I'm..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the one controlling my body!\" Kelos exclaimed, taking a step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right,\" the woman said. \"I'm a spell intended to make sure your new bride was loyal to Grovan. However, you decided to wear me instead, Princess Kelos.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a princess!\" Kelos replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? You could have fooled me,\" the woman said. She waved her arm and a large full length mirror, which showed Kelos, again a woman, wearing the same dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you do that?\" Kelos exclaimed, looking down at her body and seeing that she had indeed become a woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, we're in your mind,\" the woman said. \"Things here are malleable in ways the real world isn't.\" The scenery changed yet again. The two of them were standing on a balcony overlooking the throne room in Grovan. Kelos' parents were sitting on their thrones, and Kelos saw herself, as a 14 year old boy approach the throne then bow and kneel. \"Remember this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it's when my father summoned me to tel me my application to the military academy was accepted,\" Kelos replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" the woman asked with a giggle. The scene began to replay, only this time, instead of Kelos as a young boy, a young girl walked towards the throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, of course I'm sure,\" Kelos replied. \"I remember it clearly, my mother summoned me to tell me I was being sent to finishing school... Wait, that's not right! It was something else!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, things here are malleable,\" the woman replied. Suddenly, they were back in the flower garden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos focused and again she was back to her male self. \"So I see. Though I still remember being a girl there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, since I changed your memory, you can't change it back without knowing what the original is,\" the woman said. \"I'll consider changing it back for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos scowled at her. \"So what do you want?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to live,\" she said. \"I'm in a fairly bad situation here. I was intended for Princess Fia, so you and I aren't fully compatible. If we were, I'd have fully replaced you, while absorbing all your memories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's terrible,\" Kelos said. \"If Fia had worn that dress, you'd have killed her and taken her body?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a manor of speaking,\" the woman said. \"No one would ever know though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's idea was this?!\" Kelos asked angerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that the thing you should really be most concerned about, Princess?\" the woman asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos looked down and again found herself a woman. She frowned, focused, then turned back into a man. \"So what happens now?\" he asked. \"Am I going to share my body with you forever?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a possibility,\" the woman said. \"Though there are several others, Princess.\" She frowned as Kelos remained a man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't change me if I'm actively focusing on being a male, can you?\" Kelos asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently not,\" the woman said. \"Anyway, there are some more possibilities. I replace you and take over your body, you replace me and I die, or we merge and become one being. Needless to say, I'm not found of the last two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not found of any of them,\" Kelos replied. He thought for a minute. \"Perhaps there's a way to remove you from my body. I've heard of souls being trapped in objects, something like that could be possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you proposing we cooperate?\" the woman asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am,\" Kelos replied. \"We can ask Traeven's wizard for help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose that would be acceptable,\" the woman said. \"But if he can't help, I have every intention of taking your body for my own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose it's fair enough,\" Kelos said. \"But I won't let you succeed... err what's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have one,\" the woman said. \"But I suppose you can call me Kelia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kelia?\" Kelos asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a spell intended to take over Princess Fia who ended up in Princess Kelos' body, so Kelia.\" she explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes sense, except for one thing, I'm not a princess,\" Kelos replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see when we wake up,\" Kelia said. With that the world seemed to fade, as Kelos began to wake up.</span></div></div>",

A spell that would take over your body and life. If I had given this dress to you, and you had worn it, you would have been essentially killed and replaced, and no one would be the wiser.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How terrible!\" Fia exclaimed. \"How could you do such a thing?!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I had known about it, I wouldn't have worn this dress,\" Kelos replied. \"I apologize for this underhanded action by my kingdom. I swear I shall find the person responsible and deliver swift punishment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me why I shouldn't just have my father make you a woman permanently!\" Fia yelled, her eyes seemingly burning in rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because then the war between our kingdoms would never end, and the ones responsible will only gain more influence in Grovan's court,\" Kelos replied, remaining as calm as she could. \"Again, I knew nothing of this, but I would also suggest the possibility that those responsible have placed similar spells on some of the other gifts I brought for you. All of them should be examined carefully before you accept them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFia huffed, still angry, but acknowledging Kelos was probably telling the truth. \"So you said you were possessed.\" she said coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, by the spell I told you about,\" Kelos explained. \"It was crafted for you, and has so far proven able to control my body, but not replace my mind. Right now we're sharing this body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you want Marlin's help to remove the spell?\" Fia said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos' posture shifted and became more feminine as Kelia took control. \"Close, but not quite, Princess.\" she said. \"<i>Princess</i> Kelos and I wish to be separated into our own bodies.\" Kelia reached up and felt Fia's cheek. \"It's a shame I didn't get the body I was made for, it's quite lovely. Though I suppose this form is suitable. Pity it's only temporary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it, did you have to take over now!,\" Kelos thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush, girl,\" Kelia replied mentally. \"I simply wish to make sure there's no misunderstanding that would result in me dying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will not, and I am not a girl!\" Kelos thought. Kelia simply ignored Kelos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the spell Kelos was talking about,\" Fia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My what an observant young lady you are,\" Kelia said. \"You may address me as Princess Kelia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? And just what makes you a princess?\" Fia asked condescendingly. \"Why you're little different than a demon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose that is one way to see things,\" Kelia said. \"But as I was born of Princess Kelos wearing that dress, I like to think of her as my mother, and as the daughter of a princess, I too am a princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother?!!\" Kelos fumed mentally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever,\" Fia replied dismissively. \"So, what have you done with Kelos?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, she's still here, and quite angry at the moment. Seems she doesn't like being called a mother. Perhaps it makes her feel old?\" Kelia snarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't believe that's the issue,\" Fia said flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps not,\" Kelia agreed. \"But I do digress. We wish to speak to Marlin in hopes he will give me my own body. Ideally a copy of yours, secondly a copy of this one, but I would be willing to settle for any body that is both human and female.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if we refuse, or it is impossible?\" Fia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I shall attempt to keep Princess Kelos' body, and keep it as a Princess.\" Kelia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Kelos is essentially a hostage here?\" Fia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose you could say that,\" Kelia said. With that her body language became less feminine as Kelos again regained control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So there you have it,\" Kelos said coldly. \"I need to get her out of my head. If cooperating and getting her her own body is what it takes, than so be it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She can take control at any time?\" Fia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems so, and I have yet to figure out how to regain control unless she allows it,\" Kelos replied. \"Plus she can alter my memories. She's already changed at least one so I was a girl in it. I'm worried she's changed more, but I just haven't noticed yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go then,\" Fia replied. \"I'll take you to Marlin immediately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Fia,\" Kelos said.</span></div></div>",

Suddenly the door opened. \"Come in Princess\" a man's voice called out from deep within. Fia grabbed Kelos' hand and the two of them navigated past dusty piles of books and scrolls. Eventually they got to a clear area and saw an old man with a long beard sitting at a desk, while a young girl wearing a maid outfit was moving boxes full of beakers and test tubes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the dragon!\" Kelos exclaimed, recognizing her immediately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is all your fault, human!\" the dragon said recognizing Kelos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush and get back to work,\" Marlin commanded.

My name is Kelia,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything you can do?\" Fia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It depends,\" Marlin replied. \"I'm not particularly inclined to give a spell created by Xarlat for ill intent its own body to run wild with. However, it does have a hostage here. Though it will require some research.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The spell that made Kelos female will expire in mere hours,\" Kelia said. \"I do not wish to become a man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Extending the duration would be simple enough,\" Marlin said. \"Kelos would have to agree or I won't do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which I won't do,\" Kelos replied mentally. \"Who knows, maybe you'll like being a guy.\" Kelia scowled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it seems like Kelos is not agreeing,\" Marlin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can read Kelos' thoughts?\" Fia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably if I tried,\" Marlin said. \"But Kelia's expression there told me all I needed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I know a way to extend the duration on my own,\" Kelia said. \"Though Princess Kelos might not enjoy it, and it would be rather permanent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Fia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sex. With a man.\" Kelia said. \"It will typically lock a female transformation caused by a disguise scroll. So, Princess Kelos, either agree or I'll spend the next few hours having a lot of sex.

He walked up to Kelos, and tapped her forehead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tiny eep escaped the transformed prince's lips as a tingling wave radiated out from the spot Marlin touched, engulfing her entire body. As it passed Kelos noticed a change, her transformed body had seemed just a little off, but now it seemed far more natural. \"What did you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I removed the disguise spell without removing its effects,\" Marlin replied. \"That is now your true body.

How?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I should mention,\" Marlin said, speaking directly into Kelos and Kelia's shared mental space, \"I have also magically bound you to your word. You cannot take control of Kelos' body or alter her memories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should have known not to trust you, demon\" Kelos thought. \"Thank you, wizard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think nothing of it, my dear,\" Marlin replied, this time speaking aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I miss something?\" Fia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kelia simply tried to break her word,\" Marlin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You win this time wizard, but I will...\" Kelia began to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will behave,\" Kelos finished for her. \"This wizard is going to help you get your own body.

Try his patience and he may decide not to help us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Kelia replied in a huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you should just leave them like that,\" the dragon said. \"It'll be funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now, I have already agreed to help,\" Marlin said. \"Speaking of which, if you ladies will excuse me, I must get to work.\" Marlin started to the door, before pausing and turning around. \"Wait, this is my laboratory. You leave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, sir wizard,\" Fia said. She curtsied. \"Come along, Kelos.\" She then started to leave. Kelos hurried behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not you,\" Marlin said, casting a restraining spell on the dragon as she tried to leave too. \"I will require your assistance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kelos walked out, the door to Marlin's lab closed on its own. Startled, Kelos turned and saw a sign appear on it saying \"Research in progress, do not disturb.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'm sure Marlin will find a solution in no time,\" Fia said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so,\" Kelos replied. \"Being a woman is bad enough, but having a voice in my head makes it even worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you saying there's something wrong with being a woman?\" Fia challenged, looking angry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... it's... it's not that there's anything wrong with it,\" Kelos stuttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're okay with being a woman then?\" Fia prodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!

She took Kelos' hand, and kissed the back of it, as a man would typically do to a woman. \"Would the fair maiden do me the honor of having dinner together tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed as Kelos' entire body turned beet red, and her heart raced. She tried to stammer out a response.</span></div></div>",

She thought back to Marlin's words, a struggle will teleport you directly to the dungeon? That might be the answer. She looked at the others in the room. Clearly Marlin wouldn't fall for such a plan, and Fia, even if she did, as the Princess, she could order the guards to leave.

Even if there are no magical traps on any of the books, it is highly unlikely you'll find the proper spells in any reasonable amount of time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plus there's the whole wizard who will be angry about you going through his stuff,\" Kelos added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose you are correct,\" Kelia said, \"To be so close to success, yet denied because your wizard isn't here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps there's some clue to where he went,\" Fia said. \"I shall check his desk. If there's nothing, we shall ask my father. Do not touch anything else.\"</span></div></div>",

She appeared about 8 or 9 and was dirty and covered with scrapes. She was wearing a plain brown linen commoner's dress that had quite a few rips, some of them with what looked like dried blood and no shoes. Her long black hair was a tangled mess with sticks and leaves caught in it. Over all, she appeared to have been in the woods for quite some time though she did not appear malnourished. Most striking though were her ears, which were covered in dark green scales. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't hurt you,\" Kelos said, returning her sword to its scabbard then fastening the belt around her waste. \"What's your name, girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl shook her head from side to side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos sighed. \"Okay, where are your parents and why were you in this forest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy was killed by scary men,\" the girl said crying. \"Then they chased me and I ran and I hid in the forest and they couldn't find me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you from?\" Kelos asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl pointed towards the east and continued to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos looked her over, analyzing the situation. The girl's story was plausible enough. Bandits attacked and killed her mother, but she was able to escape. However, those ears bothered Kelos, as did her not giving her name. There could be an innocent explanation for it, of course, but still something was off here. \"Where's your father? Did the men kill him too?\" She asked, trying to get more information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy told me he was a soldier who died,\" the girl replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso plausible, given the war. Still, Kelos felt something was off about the situation, but leaving this girl alone could mean her death. </span></div></div>",

It seems I underestimated you.\" She covered her face with her right hand in a peculiar way, index finger pressed to the center of her brow, middle finger under her left eye, and thumb to the right of her mouth, with the other two fingers curled in. She swept her right arm out, fingers spread and palm down and took a dramatic stance. \"Indeed I am a dragon! Not just any dragon, the magical prodigy dragon whose name is renowned throughout the lands! Behold! I am Nalisora, the Viridian sorceress dragon of death, the Mistress of metamorphosis! But to think there was a human who could see see through my disguise. Truly, I have become lax.\" She returned to a normal standing position, crossed her arms, and nodded with a satisfied grin, as if she were proud of her introduction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos looked dumbfounded at the dragon in human form in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you're scared speechless,\" Nalisora said smugly. \"Fu fu fu That is wise of you, miss.

Or maybe I won't ask for a ransom and just make you a slave girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Riiight, let's just go with that,\" Kelos said, rolling her eyes. \"Please mighty dragon, what must I do to convince you to spare me?\" She asked almost mockingly. While the girl in front of her was certainly a dangerous creature, from her behavior, she was likely a child by dragon standards. It was unlikely she would press an attack against the guards if Kelos retreated to the carriage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, while you may have been able to defeat my disguise, you know your place as a lowly human,\" Nalisora said, the mocking tone to Kelos' words flying over her head. \"I demand a tribute to allow you to pass.\"</span></div></div>",

I'm a dragon!\" Nalisora replied. \"To think I would become friends with a lowly human woman! I'm just here for my tribute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She wants a tribute for some reason,\" Kelos replied. \"A magical artifact. I said she could have a disguise scroll.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The rest of them are in the carriage,\" the scribe replied. \"Now if you don't mind, I'd like to finish this hand.

She took a disguise scroll and handed it to the young dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNalisora took the scroll and sniffed it. \"Yes, it's certainly magic,\" she said. Sniffed it again, then took a step towards Kelos and sniffed her. \"You have the same kind of magic on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can smell magic?\" Kelos asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am a dragon after all. This is merely one of many things I can do that lowly humans such as yourself cannot.

It looked like the scribe had just won another hand, and if she knew the man well enough, then she knew that there was likely a bit of sorcerous trickery going on up his sleeve. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, to be having their little game while she was juggling between getting used to the feeling of a silken dress rubbing up against her legs, and consorting with a mythical entity, made her perturbed. Perturbed in a way that left her feeling like her men needed to be taught a bit of a lesson. Oh she was certainly chummy and down to earth with her guards, and would not really hesitate to call them her 'friends', especially after she'd taken a good few sips of wine, but a bit of mischief on her end might help snap them into shape for the future. It wouldn't exactly look good if the prince of a kingdom was taken while they were off goofing around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, she would likely be sitting on her thumbs for the next twenty plus odd hours anyway; no reason to not make them interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what exactly would this 'kidnapping' entail?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNalisora blinked as the words rang through her pointed ears.

She had a long neck with a streamlined head with two horns. Kelos noticed the creature had a patch of lighter, emerald green scales on her left shoulder that looked kind of like a heart. Kelos thought that was kind of cute, in a way, but decided against saying so, as the young dragon clearly thought she was intimidating.

No point in mentioning that she was a buxom girl at the time. Or that the dragon was a child no bigger than the ponies kept in the castle stables. Yes, the beast in her notes will be a good few stories taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough though, the actual, much smaller whelp, appeared to set its sights on something; an adjacent and barren mountainside that no one except the most adventurous of climbers and explorers would really even dare attempt to scale, but it seemed the fearless creature Kelos was clinging onto had in its mind the idea to zoom straight ahead into the upcoming wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNalisora?\u201d Kelos called, her words coming out more as whispers, as the wind cut the sound from her voice. \u201cNali- there's a wall! You're going to crash!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that moment that the prince, turned now 'captive' princess, started to question her choice in actions. This was a dragon, after all, and they were known for making their own unique ways to entertain themselves. Who's to say she didn't let her ride on her back just to turn her into the most royal piece of splatter that Traeven had seen since the wars of old?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer concerns only became greater, as the beast of legend ignored her warnings, and actually started to speed up! A light tittering of laughter could even be heard in her voice as they approached quicker and quicker to their inevitable doom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was in that moment that Kelos couldn't help but let out a very high pitched, very undignified, and most embarrassing of all, very <i>girly</i> scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crash though, didn't come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, the two passed through the mountainside with little difficulty at all, and when Kelos had the nerve to open her eyes once more, she was greeted with another peculiar sight; the real cliff of the mountain had revealed itself, only this one was much more ornate, with a rather large, if a tad weathered, keep, set overlooking the forests and lands below them. They had just passed through an illusory wall, and the innards had finally revealed themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly enough then, Nalisora landed, with both of them now being a couple dozen feet away from the main entrance; obviously the dragon wanted to give Kelos a bit of a tour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cImpressive, isn't it, human?\u201d She said, as the young prince stepped off her back;  once again allowing her to magically reverted back to her (mostly) human form. \u201cThough even I must admit, this isn't just my work. My mommy took this keep a long long time ago, before I was born, and she even set up the magic to keep it hidden! But now that she's gone, it's all mine! And I use it as my base to strike fear into the hearts of you lowly mortals!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInterrupting the dragon's attempt at a supposed diabolical tirade, Kelos gently poked Nalisora on the forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRude.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a brief pause between them at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Huh?</i>\u201d The dragon eventually managed to stumble out, a tone of childlike confusion clearly being able to be discerned in her voice. She had been stopped dead in her tracks by the simple action, and was now staring up at Kelos, doe-eyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Rude.</i>\u201d Kelos said, pointing her finger upward, as if trying to teach a lesson. \u201cYou didn't tell me we were going to fly through any walls or the like. You could have scared a person to death with a trick of that sort!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNalisora though just pouted, and crossed her arms. \u201cIt was just a little joke! <i>A joke!</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos couldn't help but smile at that just a tiny bit. \u201cWell, lets have our jokes be a little less dangerous next time, shall we?\u201d She said, patting the dragon on the head. \u201cNow, do you want to show me your castle, Nali?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Ah yes,\" the young dragon replied. \"Come, witness the grandeur of my hidden lair!\" She grasped Kelos' hand and, practically running, pulled the transformed prince along towards the entrance. Unaccustomed to heels, Kelos stumbled a bit trying to match Nalisora's pace, but somehow managed to keep up without falling. The young dragon stopped just before the large main gate. \"Fu fu fu Behold the gateway to my invincible fortress!\" She said, her voice a mixture of pride and excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos looked up at the gate, which appeared to be made of solid oak, sturdy, if a bit weathered. Above it was a crest, though Kelos didn't recognize it, a detail Kelos thought was a bit odd, given her study of military history and royal lines. \"Say, do you know who originally built this castle?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, but I know it's really, really old,\" Nalisora replied. \"Let's go inside!\" She let go of Kelos' hand and struck a dramatic pose, her right arm extending out towards the massive door. \"Fu fu fu, your mistress has returned! I command you! Open!\" Her hand began to glow slightly with magic power, and slowly, the door began to creek open. As it opened she turned to Kelos, with a smug smile on her face. Clearly she expected Kelos to be impressed by her magical ability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, good job,\" Kelos said, patting the young dragon on the head. Nalisora beamed at even this half hearted praise, which Kelos found kind of cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go in!\" Nalisora said, again grabbing Kelos' hand and dragging her inside. As they entered, the door magically closed behind them. \"This is the lobby,\" the young dragon said, waving her free hand. \"Pretty impressive, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos turned her head and looked around. The floors were made of marble tiles, though chipped and uneven from age. Kelo's heels clicked as she walked, a sound the former man found somewhat disconcerting. She tried her best to ignore it, diverting her attention to the walls, which were decorated with an elaborate mosaic, with some tiles missing, depicting a battle between ancient armies both using a traditional phalanx formation. One of them had banners depicting the same crest as on the outside of the castle. The other army was marching under a more familiar crest, the ancient Divinus Imperium. Specifically, the 19th Legion, which had been wiped out on an exploration mission in barbarian lands. It seemed apparent that their opponents on that fateful day where the same as the ones who constructed this keep. Though that was likely centuries before they built this stronghold, given the architecture seemed more recent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty great, right?\" Nalisora asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it's most impressive,\" Kelos replied, still examining the mosaic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is only the beginning, there's a lot more to see,\" the young dragon said boastfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a library?\" Kelos asked, hoping there would be some information about the builders of this place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but it's boring,\" Nalisora replied. \"And all the books are in some weird human language. I don't think any of them are even magic. Let's look at something better like my room!\" She pointed towards a staircase leading up.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The idea of taking a look at the library definitely piqued Kelos' interests. A lot of this place piqued her interest, to be truthful. The lairs of dragons were known to hold many secrets- many treasures, and while the prince was no thief, she was still quite inquisitive, and had a desire to seek out knowledge, especially knowledge that had been hidden away behind a a wall of illusion for who knew how long. If she could cap off this adventure by returning to Grovan with not only the tale of taming a dragon, but of bringing back with her some long forgotten piece of history, she'd be hailed as a hero, and this would all be on top of obtaining the hand of Princess Fia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn't mind visiting that library...\u201d Kelos' voice was a bit far off, as her eyes still peered over the large foyer around her; imagination contemplating the possibilities that awaited further inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNalisora though just pouted. \u201cBut that's <i>boooring</i>! Boring boring boring boring boring! My room has lots of better stuff!\u201d She huffed and puffed, and then quickly jutted out her finger out, pointing at Kelos. \u201cBesides! I captured you! That means you have to do everything I want to do! It's the rules!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe royal tried her best to not let out a sigh, or say some sort of quip about 'just who wrote those rules'. She didn't want to forget herself. Right now, she was a guest, or rather, a 'prisoner', and as such, it would be a tad rude to demand to poke her nose around her 'kidnapper's' home just a few minutes after stepping past the door. She was a prince (well, technically princess at the moment, but that was just a minor stumble, no need to fuss about it), and as such, manners and decorum were ingrained into her practically from birth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also the small matter that she was dealing with a child, or what was for all intents and purposes, a child, and the fact that she seemed to not properly have anyone taking care of her caused Kelos' brow to furrow in perturbed annoyance. The young prince herself grew up in an environment that often felt somewhat isolated. Her parents were always too busy with royal duties to spend a considerable amount of quality time with their next of kin, but even then she still had her sister Orianna, who provided company despite her teasing personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whelpling here though looked to be all in her lonesome; living in an old decaying keep that was hidden away from the world. At face value, the whole situation made Kelos' soft features frown. If her mother really was dead, then she was an outright orphan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...These were all very silly things to think about, though, and she had to keep reminding herself that she really was in the lair of a dragon of all things here. She didn't even know what the age of the beast actually was! By all means she could have been older than the Grovan royal herself, given the extended lifespans of these mythical creatures, and as such, quite possibly all together capable of handling her own affairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still, from the short time Kelos had known her, she certainly hadn't been acting the adult, and that vexed her in a multitude of disconcerting ways. Before her mind could move into more serious thoughts about what to do with an orphaned dragon though, she figured she could at least do one thing to make the girl's day a bit brighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking herself out of her introspection, Kelos held hands up, and spoke in a mock tone of defeat. \u201cAlright, alright. On second thought, I think I'd love to see your room, oh <i>terrifying</i> dragon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beast's face quickly changed from an annoyed grimace, into a pleased, toothy grin, which managed to show off a pair of cute little fangs that the prince hadn't particularly noticed before. Kelos might have commented, but before she could, she was grabbed by the hand and had to face possibly one of her greatest challenges yet: going up stairs while wearing heels, and all the while as a giddy dragon pulled her towards a far off location deep in the castle's interior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they went, they passed by many rooms, and turned through several halls. Kelos, even in the hurry, still managed to notice what looked to be entrances to several distinct locales, including a dining area, and a room closed up with two massive and ornate doors, that she had to surmise must have led to a throne, or in the least, some other area of importance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching towards the more residential portion of the keep, Kelos assumed that Nali would have taken up board in the master bedroom, but instead, the young prince (who just so happened to be currently donned in a dress) was led to a somewhat smaller abode a little off to the side of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrepare yourself, human! Because your eyes about to feast on the greatest! Room! Ever!\u201d The dragon boastfully remarked, as she jutted open the door with force to reveal what was inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Kelos had to admit, what awaited her as she stepped in certainly looked... unique. It held the appearance of what looked like, at one time, was a little girl's room- quite possibly of some royalty or clout, as it seemed to be fairly lavish. Pink paper donned with a red, heart-based pattern covered the walls, though now a not so unnoticeable amount showed their age through weathering and peeling. In the dead center of the room too, pushed up against a wall next to a window, sat a four poster bed that held the same color motif and pattern as the walls, while also holding the same level of decay, as a tear in the mattress could be noted in its bottom right corner, and the posts, once tall and jutting up in a pure display of vanity, now were starting to chip, with places where the splintering of wood could easily be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were other such similar items around them, dressers, drawers, closets and the like, but what ultimately made this room standout were the oddities and incongruities of where the dragon had clearly added her own touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff in the corner, much to Kelos' shock, and a bit of wonderment, was an outright decently sized pile of gold, gems, and other such riches, simply lying there as if it was the most natural thing in the world. Plopped as the centerpiece of the heap was a large unopened chest that simply seemed to be begging to be examined to see what treasures it held within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelves also lined the walls, and while Kelos could only assume a few of the items came from the original inhabitant of the abode, many were clearly gathered up by Nali herself; bottles of potions, scrolls, little doodads and whats-its, that all must have come from various \u201ctributes\u201d from passing travelers who crossed ways with the dragon, much like she and her men had. Though some were clearly magical in nature, others looked more benign; toys, more than anything. A bag of marbles, a spinning top, a cup and ball game, and several other items of the sort that, if she didn't know better, she could have guessed were parlayed simply because they looked fun to the still developing youth. Though Kelos knew not to doubt their potential for sorcerous potency, given that they were obtained by a creature inherently drawn to the arcane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy all means, Kelos definitely was a bit amazed by what she was seeing, though maybe not for the exact reasons Nalisora would have expected. It was all a mix of decrepit decay, classical dragon hoarding, and a display of eclectic scrounged up goods that were likely obtained from passersby who either were tricked by her initial innocent little girl facade, and managed to give away a quick reward to her due to pity, or figured it all out, and just plain couldn't be asked to put up a bother with dealing with the annoying demands of the dragon, and just handed her a piece of spare tat, while letting her go on her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy, this really is all very... impressive.\u201d Kelos spoke, a slight sense of bewilderment in her tone, as she soaked everything in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, yes. I could tell a princess like you would have a discerning eye for good taste.\u201d The dragon bragged, taking her guest's words fully at face value. \u201cI don't know whose room this was before, but they had a good start. It just needed a few more improvements.\u201d She then quickly pointed toward the gold in the corner. \u201cThe treasure over there was given to me by my momma. She always told me that 'a good dragon always has a hoard.'\u201d Her tone became a tad raspier as she imitated her parent's voice. \u201cBut all the other cool stuff here I got myself!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said this though, her features focused towards an item in particular. \u201cHere, I wanna show you something!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She then twirled and shouted \"Transform!\" Her clothing began to glow and shift. The plain brown dress she was wearing started to sprout ribbons and lace as its color changed to a dark purple. It retreated up her legs to above her knees as the frills puffed it out. The glow traveled down her legs leaving black stockings behind. It reached her feet then reversed, this time forming a pair of purple laced high heeled boots that came up to just under her knees. Finally the glow appeared on her head as a tiny witches hat with a ribbon appeared. \"Fu fu fu! Behold! The dark dragon witch Nalisora!\" the young dragon said striking a dramatic pose. \"Pretty cool right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, very,\" Kelos agreed. Certainly it was a much faster way to change clothes, though the young dragon's taste in clothes were... odd to say the least. \"That certainly is a unique outfit there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, it really suits me right?\" Nalisora asked. She posed a few times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's certainly you,\" Kelos said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" Nalisora exclaimed. She thrust the wand into Kelos' hands. \"You've gotta try it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos held the wand cautiously and looked at it. \"Are you sure that's okay?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup!\" Nalisora said with a smile. \"You just hold it above your head, then spin and say 'transform' and it changes your clothes. But you gotta like picture the clothes you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos kept looking at the wand. \"And it'll just change my clothes?\" she asked, understandably hesitant given her experiences with magic that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup,\" Nalisora replied. \"It'll be fun! But you gotta keep wearing whatever it is until I say you can change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Kelos said, as she held the wand up like she saw the dragon girl before. \"Like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup,\" Nalisora said. \"Now twirl and say 'transform.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but this feels kind of silly,\" Kelos said.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kelos wanted to play it a bit safe, as right now she was still feeling cautious of the dangers that magic could bring about, especially after today! Still though, a nice change of clothes didn't sound too bad. She had originally donned her current green attire so as to make herself presentable to Princess Fia, and show that even when faced with troubled waters, the Grovan line did their best to make themselves stand tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now though, things were a bit different. Kelos was currently on an adventure after being whisked away by a dragon of all things, and cumbersome heels and swishy dresses weren't the most ideal clothing for when delving into ancient and hidden keeps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo as she spoke the wand's magic words, images of simple explorer's gear formed in her mind. Sturdy boots, warm leggings, a breathable vest, and a belt with enough nooks and crannies in it to store whatever little nicknacks she may come across; all very standard, really. It might not impress Nalisora, but if she had to wear something at the girl's whim, she'd prefer it to be practical. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlowing twinkles began to surround her, and a faint ticklish feeling started to overcome her body, as the magic went to work. Moments quickly passed, a big splendorous flash came about, and soon enough, Kelos' apparel, just like Nalisora's, was transformed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInto a big poofy princess dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Kelos was already wearing a gown. It was quite feminine to begin with, but regardless, it held a bit of tact, and arguably practicality to it. Kelos' new wear billowed in front of her, as frills and layers of cloth filled once empty space in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was pink. Bright pink. A <i>gaudy</i> pink. The type of which her sister Orianna would just scoff at. Though she might have appreciated just how on the nose <i>girly</i> it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos' whole body was ensconced in ruffles of soft fabric, with long, elegant opera gloves now covering her arms, of which led towards a set of big, impractical shoulders that needlessly puffed up at her sides. The most absurd thing though about the get up was the long, pointy, conical hennin that now laid atop her head, with a veil of silken cloth that poured down the back of it, and did nothing other than to simply paint the picture of pristine fairy tail princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos simply stood in silence for a good moment as she took it all in. The realization of what happened dawned on her soon enough though, and a rhythmic twitching started to pound away above the brow of her left eye, and a flush of red frustration began to overtake her face; breaking the wholly false illusion of royal perfection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis had to have been the girliest, most feminine thing she had ever seen, let alone worn, and while it certainly was soft, the thought of trying to trek around in it made her head spin. She didn't know what happened, but this certainly wasn't what she asked for!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring all this, Nalisora was having a distinctly different reaction, as the young dragon couldn't help but let out a loud, surprised, but more than anything else, <i>giddy</i>, gasp, as she saw the princess transform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhmygosh you look so pretty!\u201d Nali placed her hands on her cheeks as she rushed to circle around Kelos to get a better look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a practical blitz of movement, she touched, poked, and prodded the dress; feeling its various textures, smoothness, and curves of the frills, which helped in no way with Kelos' temper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments passed passed by with Kelos simply simmering like a pot of tea about to boil. A pot of tea that was being swarmed by a pesky little reptile dressed up as some sort of kooky witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt her analogy might have lost a bit of bite somewhere there, but that didn't matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you stop that?!\u201d She snapped, as the dragon looked over the hem of her gown. Kelos' hands were clasped hard, and a look of unfettered annoyance was on her face, as she huffed out a few deep, unladylike breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause as the room went dead silent, and Kelos realized quickly she needed to calm down. She was in the lair of a dragon, and she didn't want to create too much of a hostile atmosphere. Besides, this wasn't the proper way a princess should act. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if she really was a prince!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNalisora had finally stopped in her machinations, with a doe-eyed look on her face as a result of the other girl's outburst. This gave Kelos a chance to inquire about things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you do this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNali blinked. \u201cDo what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis!\u201d Kelos gestured down. \u201cThis dress!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon's brow furrowed. \u201cNo, you did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! I wanted something practical!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNali paused, as a few gears began to clunk forward in her mind. \u201cAre you <i>suuuure</i>?\u201d She said, with a teasing spark of smugness in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos flushed. \u201cOf course!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr maybe- <i>maybe</i> that's what you really wanted to wear!\u201d The witchy little girl raised her index finger up, in an all-knowing fashion. \u201cThe wand's always worked for me. How do I know you're not just playing one of your <i>weird</i> human tricks? Why would you want something practical anyway? That's <i>boooring</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess just stared for a moment, and then shook her head. \u201cDon't be absurd. Besides, you're a dragon! Maybe the magic works different for humans.\u201d Thinking further, another realization hit her. \u201cOr maybe it's that blasted scroll. The magic of <i>that</i> might be interfering.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Maaaybe</i>~.\u201d Nali spoke in a sing-song tone, as she quickly leaned over, and plucked the wand that was still in Kelos' hand. \u201cBut either way, that's your dress! You promised you'd wear it for as long as I want!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos simply rolled her eyes. \u201cCan you not want it now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope~!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess expected as much. She didn't want to use the wand again anyway. It backfired once already, and she was sure, once Nalisora saw how awkward getting around in the dress was, and how it would harm their 'playtime', she'd want her out of it just as quickly as Kelos herself did. At the moment she'd just have to grin and bear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what do you have in mind for us now, <i>oh great dragon</i>?\u201d</span></div></div>",

She attempted to pursue her young hostess, however, the dress she was wearing heavily restricted her movement. Worse, Kelos found she was now wearing even higher heels than the ones she had on previously. These combined to her barely being able to manage a walking pace. \"I can't move very fast in this!\" she called out as she exited Nalisora's room only to see the young dragon already turning a corner in the halls. She struggled along trying to at least keep sight of the exuberant child, but after a few more turns, it proved impossible. Worse still, Kelos realized she was now lost in the unfamiliar keep. Eventually Narisora would probably realize her guest couldn't keep up and look for her, but until then she was on her own. Though there was the question of these intruders. Surely it couldn't be her men having tracked her down. It would take far longer to get here on the ground, assuming they could even find it. No, Kelos corrected herself, assuming they even noticed she was missing yet. They could be simple adventurer types, or even knights sent to hunt down Nalisora. The latter was safer for Kelos, since knights would surely rescue a princess being held by a dragon. The former though could be unpredictable. Hopefully the young dragon could handle herself in either case. Kelos turned around, to try to find her way back to Nalisora's room. However, she stopped, as she heard faint voices from a hallway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're sure there are no traps here?\" a man asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Positive,\" another man replied. \"This floor's clean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what you said about the last floor,\" the first man replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't expecting a giant boulder trap,\" the second man said defensively. \"I mean who even does those anymore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now, boys,\" a woman said. \"Stop arguing. I've got a good feeling about finding something on this floor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So much for your brilliant trap,\" Kelos whispered. Not only had it failed to stop these people, apparently Nalisora had also managed to miss them in her own castle. These people seemed to be treasure hunters of some kind, given the talk about finding something. Of course that told little about their character.</span></div></div>",

She walked in the direction of the voices, her heels clicking on the floor tiles, announcing her presence to the intruders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You hear that?,\" the unknown woman whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" second man replied quietly. \"Footsteps, a woman it sounds like, heels. From the gait I'd say she's had some military training and isn't accustomed to her shoes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can tell that from how she's walking?\" the first man asked. \"Impressive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's also coming towards us,\" the second man stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well boys, she knows we're here, let's go say hello,\" the woman said. She pushed past her male companions and began walking towards the sound of Kelos' footsteps. The two men looked at each other, shrugged, then followed their teammate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos picked up her pace a bit as she heard the woman's words. She wanted to meet them at a point she could easily retreat to Nalisora's room. It had a fairly sturdy door that could buy some time if things when bad, and hopefully some magic items in there would be of use. She turned the corner to the hall Nalisora's room was on, and headed down, just as the group of intruders also turned down. Nalisora's room was halfway down, so to get in position, Kelos approached the group quickly. \"Who are you and what are you doing here?\" she asked with a challenging tone in her voice as she looked over the trio. The woman in front was wearing a tight black dress with a slit in the side, probably silk, Kelos thought, that showed ample cleavage and clung to her every curve. Her skin was quite pale, and her eyes looked as though she was from the far east. She had long, black hair that reached her butt. She had a pair of soft looking, flat black shoes that matched her dress, and a gold pendant shaped like a crescent moon. Strangely, there wasn't even a wrinkle on her clothes or a stray hair. She looked more like someone who just got dressed to attend a party than had been wandering through an old castle littered with traps. Her companions though looked more the part. Both were wearing light leather armor, though one had a chainmail vest and was carrying a sword, while the other had a pair of daggers tucking in his belt and a bow and quiver on his back. Kelos found herself tracing the woman's figure with her eyes. The woman noticed this and shifted her stance to appear more seductive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My friends and I, we're dealers in antiquities you might say,\" the woman said as she approached Kelos, swaying her hips back and forth. \"We're here because our current inventory is a bit... depleted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this castle isn't abandoned, so you can't just help yourself,\" Kelos replied, her eyes fixated on the woman's hips. Her face was becoming flushed, and she felt a strange wetness below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps not, but I think I can guess why your here,\" the woman said. \"Caught in bed with another girl so your father sent you to this place as punishment perhaps?\" She approached Kelos and seductively embraced her. \"I prefer men myself, but women are nice from time to time.\" She leaned over and whispered in Kelos' ear. \"I'm certainly willing to keep you company for the night in exchange for a few trinkets that might be laying around.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'm visiting a friend who lives here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pity we couldn't do this the easy way, Princess,\" the woman replied. She took a few steps back. \"Okay boys, your turn. Make her tell you where her friend is keeping all their valuables.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right boss,\" the man with the daggers and bow said. He drew his daggers and stepped towards Kelos. The other man didn't say anything, but also approached, though did not draw his sword. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos took a step back as they advanced to assess the situation. If she were still a man, she felt she'd have a good shot at taking the two on. However, at the moment she was in a distressingly female body. Worse, her current attire was greatly restricting her movement. It was unlikely she'd be able to outrun them. Fighting was out of the question, and so was fleeing, this left her with few options. She considered just giving up and leading them to Nalisora's room, however, she couldn't just betray the young dragon without even trying to resist. There was still one option left though. \"Did I mention my friend is a dragon? If you really want me to lead you to her horde, I do know where it is, but I <i>really</i> don't think you want to steal from a dragon. They tend not to be very forgiving of people who rob them. Nor people who hurt their friends\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, princess, and I'm the bishop of Canetralia,\" the man with the daggers said as he continued to approach. The man with the sword stopped and looked back to the woman with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine don't believe me. But who else would live in this out of the way ruin? Plus, how would I get here without a horse or carriage? Simple, I flew here carried by a dragon,\" Kelos said. She stopped backing up and took a step forward, trying to project confidence. \"A very powerful dragon at that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Kelos heard a familiar voice call out from down the hall. \"Good job, you found the intruders!\" Nalisora called out as she ran towards them, still in human form. \"I won't forgive them for breaking in and damaging my traps!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BWAHAHAHAHAHA,\" the man with the swords burst into laughter as his hesitation and concern left. \"That's your powerful dragon?! She's a little girl! HAHAHAHA\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't underestimate her,\" the woman warned as she looked over the new arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She certainly doesn't look like a dragon,\" the man with the daggers said. \"But she's not human either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's a dragon for sure,\" the woman confirmed. \"Shapeshifted to resemble a person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right,\" Nalisora said proudly. \"My magic is top notch! If you apologize and leave a tribute, I might consider letting you go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So she's a threat?\" the man with the sword asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" the woman said. \"You weren't wrong that she's a little girl, but even a young dragon can be tough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos once again considered her options. With Nalisora here, it was 3 on 2, but she didn't really know how strong the young dragon was, nor the dungeon raiders. If this came to a fight, Kelos couldn't predict what the outcome would be. However, they didn't appear confident in their own victory. Perhaps they could be still reasoned with and convinced to leave. On the other hand, if they decided to make a fight of it, that could allow them to lower Nalisora's guard and gain an advantage.</span></div></div>",

Nalisora was a dragon and probably had an edge on the woman, but she seemed to be some sort of magic user. She'd probably try to stall Nalisora, making it two on one. They'd almost certainly win that, by virture of actually having weapons and not wearing a puffy dress, and then turn on Nalisora. Still, letting them go could be worse. They had some idea of what they were facing so they could come back better prepared with reinforcements. It was risky, but fighting was the only option. \"We can take them,\" she said. \"Don't let these thieves go, they'll just come back later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fufufu, I was just thinking the same thing,\" Nalisora said. \"They broke into my home and they need to be punished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said that woman had military training?\" the man with the sword asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, pretty sure,\" the man with the daggers replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two can take one princess,\" the woman said. \"I'll deal with the dragon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nali,\" Kelos called out. \"Transform and take care of the men!\" She then charged the woman as best as she could with her encumbrance. Her fighting the two men was almost certain defeat. Her fighting the woman was also likely defeat. However, Nalisora could very well beat the men. If she could distract the woman long enough, they had a chance. The two men attempted to stop Kelos<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine!\" Nalisora relied as she changed back into her true self. She took a breath and then exhaled a plume of acidic mist in the direction of the men, taking care not to hit Kelos. The man with the daggers dropped to the ground to avoid the acid, while the man with the sword covered his eyes and held his breath to protect himself as best he could. This allowed Kelos to rush past them and approach the woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaken off guard by this action, the woman hurriedly cast a spell. \"Stop!\" the woman commanded, her voice magically enhanced. Kelos heard the woman's voice echo in her head and felt an overwhelming need to obey the order. </span></div></div>",

It would require more than a hastily thrown spell to leave her stumbling over her heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could do that freely in her own time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was why, despite the froofy poofing of her dress, and despite the clacking of her shoes against the slightly gravelly ground, she was able to close the distance against the assaulting intruder, and, gripping the silken edges of her pristine opera gloves, delivered a set of knuckles across the jaw of the would-be robber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thief in turn stumbled back; more due to the brazen manner at which a supposed royal was able to depart upon her a hardened right to her face. \u201cI can see maybe a few more reasons why your <i>daddy</i> decided to put you on time out here.\u201d Her tone was perturbed as she used her hand to ease the impact point against her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere are probably a <i>fair number</i> of surprises about me you wouldn't expect.\u201d Kelos bantered, as she raised her arms up into a fighting stance. It looked ridiculous; this girl appeared more as if she was ready for her wedding day then to fight bandits, yet here she was eager to do so all the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a bout of worse luck for the intruder, a sharp \u201cAAAHH!\u201d came from one of her henchmen, as they were jolted back with a toss; sliding next to his female comrade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFufufu, and <i>that's</i> the power of The Great Nalisora's 'Chaotic Dragon Claws!'\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor anyone who happened to be watching, they would have seen that Nalisora's 'Chaotic Dragon Claws' more or less amounted to tearing a bit of the crook's armor, and then tossing him across the room, but the results either way still proved practical, and so had her acidic breath, which kept the last fighter on their toes to the point of having to back himself up against his two allies as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh for the love of- This was <i>not</i> supposed to be some kind of ordeal.\u201d The magic-user grumbled, as she helped her associates to their feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's what you get for <i>daring</i> to cross paths with a mighty dragon such as myself! Attacking my captive was just the most egregious of your errors!\u201d As she approached the princess, she turned to the girl with an expectant look on her face. \u201cDid I do good? Huh? Huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did <i>great</i> Nali.\u201d Kelos beamed, patting the younger girl's head, and absently feeling the scaled features of the whelp. She may have been smaller than most, but she still packed as big a bite as any drake. \u201cSo are you people willing to give up, and get yourselves out of here now?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you kidding me?! After all the trouble it took to get here?!\u201d The mook whose blade had been dissolved rhetorically asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, we're not leaving here without at least filling our pockets with <i>something</i>!\u201d The one who was nursing his back responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Enough</i>!\u201d In an instant, the voice of the mage between them swelled to a flurry, as a whirl of mana shot forth and caused both Kelos and Nali to brace themselves; the former feeling her dress flutter wildly in the wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI usually tend to be more subtle, but this is just getting ridiculous.\u201d In the moments that the princess and her 'captor' had allowed their guests to recoup, the spellcaster before them had begun to charge up a powerful enchantment; intent on sorting this matter without anymore lost equipment, or lost ego. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sights were set on Nalisora. The girl who smacked her was quite cheeky, but nothing that wouldn't take just a few minutes to sort out. No, the dragon was the real challenge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And maybe prize? The idea had snuck into her brain when she first saw the beast reveal its true form, and was becoming more and more appealing a thought. If they could tranquilize the creature, the amount of gold they might be able to acquire would likely make anything this shabby keep held look like a pittance! Not to mention the regard and infamy they'd earn for their daring efforts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA grin molded itself on her face, as she put more and more energy into the charge. All of these musing had buzzed through in a matter of moments, but it was just enough to know what she needed to do, with, soon enough, a pulsating, electrifying, bolt of unknown wizardy shooting forth from her fingertips, and aimed right down towards the rambunctious reptilian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNali!\u201d Kelos yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this time that the transformed princess did something. It might have been viewed as a stupid something. Or maybe more just a silly something. A something possibly born from her annoying new state, that forced upon her the occasional nurturing thought. Of protecting the little girl she was with, and keeping her out of danger- no matter how many scales she held, or sharp teeth were in her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it ended up, dress or any other hindrance be damned, she, without much thinking, pushed herself in front of the dragon to shield her from the blast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat followed was probably a far more shrill scream than Kelos would have liked to hear come out of her voice, though it was slightly muted by the yell of \u201cHuman!\u201d that came from Nalisora, as she saw what her 'prisoner' had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds, the royal fell to the floor, incapacitated from the energized shock; a few wisps of magical electricity coursing over her frame, and leaving one to question her well being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whelp, seeing all this, stared with her mouth agape.</span></div></div>",

She retaliated with a magic blast of her own. It struck the man in front, instantly transforming him into a small garter snake, his clothes and possessions falling on the floor along side of him. \"I won't forgive you!\" she hissed as she leapt over Kelos' twitching body, shielding her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other man reached down and picked up the confused snake. \"Let's get out of here!\" he shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we've got this, get to a better position!\" the woman shouted as she readied another spell, then fired another blast at Nalisora. The dragon held her ground and took the hit from the magic blast. She then fired back at the woman with another blast from her acid breath. However, the attack proved ineffective against her. \"Silly lizard, I cast a spell protecting me from your acid breath after your first attack.\" she said mockingly. The man began to stealthily circle around behind Nalisora as her attention was fixed on his companion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos let out a feminine moan from pain as she began to regain consciousness. Despite the intense agony, she opened her eyes. Though her vision was blurry, she was able to make sense of the scene. Nali had taken position in between her and the woman. One of the men was circling around, but the other one, Kelos didn't see. Was he circling around from the other side, or had Nali taken him down already? She tried to look around, but found herself unable to move her head. If he was still in the fight, things were probably lost. Nali looked like she was focused on the woman, and didn't see the man. Kelos tried to get up, but her body wasn't moving properly. She then tried to speak, but found that impossible as well as only a tiny squeak escaped her lips. An intense wave of pain shot through her body, but all Kelos could do was let out another feminine moan. She turned her eyes and watched Nalisora fire off a spell at the woman, only for it to seem to have no affect. The woman then returned fire, and this one certainly did have an affect, as Nalisora roared in pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it,\" Kelos thought. It was bad enough she was stuck in this feminine body in this impractical dress, but right now she couldn't even move to help. That had to change. Kelos closed her eyes and tried to relax and focused on her right pinky, and tried to move it. It wouldn't budge, but she kept at it. Before long she was able to wiggle it. As she did she felt the pain subside a bit and movement came back to her. She looked up at the man, who was focused on Nali. Clearly he thought the young dragon was the only threat at the moment. Kelos used this to her advantage. As the man crept closer, she popped up and grabbed his arm. Though he was bigger, Kelos remembered her hand at hand training and drove her heel into the back of his knee. She then twisted so the man's own weight forced his leg out from under him, sending him crashing to the ground with her on top of him. Kelos used all the strength her small frame had to pull his arm back behind his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Human! You're okay!\" Nalisora called out as she turned to see what the commotion was behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you handle one injured girl on your own?!\" the woman exclaimed as she saw her remaining companion get taken down. Nalisora took advantage of this distraction and pounced at the woman. Before she knew it she was on the floor, staring at the snarling jaws of a dragon. \"Fine I give up, I give up!\" she shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do too,\" the man said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tie him up,\" Kelos said. \"I just need some...\" Before Kelos could finish speaking, Nalisora blasted the man with a bolt of magic, transforming him into statue. \"That won't be necessary, human,\" she said. The snake which had been their other companion slithered out of the man's now petrified pocket. \"This is why I'm called the mistress of transformation! Fufufu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do to me?\" the woman asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've always wanted a pet kitty,\" Nalisora said. \"Or maybe you can be my servant. What do you think, human?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos struggled to stand up. \"She's to dangerous to be a serv...\" Kelos stopped mid sentence as a wave of dizziness washed over her. She stumbled and fell to the ground, again blacking out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Human!' Nalisora exclaimed. She then glared at the woman underneath her claws.

Well rested. Relaxed. <i>Calm</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that all meant something <i>not good</i> simply <i>had</i> to be going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, Mistress.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmr?\u201d The princess mumbled; voice dry, as she cracked open her eyes ever so slightly. Getting out of bed wasn't something she particularly would have liked at the moment, but what she saw at first was enough to rouse her in full, and more so, caused her to jitter back to the headboard that lined behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust a mere foot away was the very same woman who had struck her down with that painful bolt of wizardry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Except, instead of the sultry ensemble of a high class vixen, she was dressed head to toe in the frilliest, most quintessentially domestic, <i>maid's outfit,</i> she'd ever seen; trim and lace marking the whole of her, while dutifully applied makeup kept the burglar's face doll-like and serene. It was almost a little uncanny, given the blank, dull look in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos let out a sigh of relief as she took it all in. It appeared she and her dragon companion both got through their little scrape, with the latter kind enough to allow her to sleep it off in one of the Keep's many visitor chambers. \u201cI guess Nali really put you through the works, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMistress Nalisora's spellcrafting helped show me the error of my ways, and in gratitude, I now follow the will of both her, and you, Mistress Human, as a humble servant. I've done my best to ensure that the past several days of your recovery have been a comfortable one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redheaded rolled her eyes, as she took on a more casual disposition. \u201cListen, my name isn't 'Human,' it's 'Kelos,' and-\u201d Her voice silenced itself though, when a look of shock filled her. \u201cDid you say 'several <i>days</i>?!'\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThree days, to be precise, Mistress Human-Kelos. Your healing required an extended rest. Mistress Nalisora has been by near constantly to check in on your condition.\u201d The new domestic spoke all this in a monotone, as a face of growing disbelief gained hold over Kelos. \u201cWould you like a glass of water?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d She yelled as she attempted to stand. A thousand questions, scenarios, and horrors were blowing through her mind at that very moment. The scroll was only supposed to last a day! What in the world happened?! Why was <i>she</i> not a <i>he</i>?! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorse, by now she must have completely missed the rendezvous time to meet Fia. Days late! And days away from her guards, too! If they'd not been scouring the land themselves, then surely they'd have returned to Grovan and alerted her father by now! There could be an entire kingdom-wide search going on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI've got to- I've got to go and- AH!\u201d In a frenzy, Kelos tried to untangle herself from her web of bedsheets and start moving, but instead, a wave of dizziness overwhelmed her, and the nearby maid made quick to guide her to sit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMistress Human-Kelos, you are still not fully healed. Moving is not advisable, and continued action may result in restraint.\u201d Every word was coated in a cold, robotic lilt, despite the former wizard caringly pulling up a warm set of covers over her superior. \u201cI am under orders by Mistress Nalisora to keep you safe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSafe?! The fate of two kingdoms, and my own head are on the line! Hell it might already be too late!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuuuummaaaannn~!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbruptly, Kelos then found herself being clung to by the form of a very excited young dragon, who had just padded into the room. \u201cYou'reokayyou'reokayyou'reokay!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNear instantly, the anger boiling over in the princess started to simmer down to a doable cool. For some reason this silly little dragon kept on finding a way to hold her mood in check. \u201cYes. <i>Hello Nali</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pointy-eared being pulled back from the embrace, with stars in her eyes. \u201cI thought you weren't gonna get better but now you're better and we can both play more!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMistress Human-Kelos still needs to rest before she can play, Mistress Nalisora.\u201d Chimed the maid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuiet slave!\u201d Nali shot back, a bite of frustration in her. \u201cDidn't I tell you to come to me when the Human did anything? You failed! Demerit! <i>Demerit</i>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI apologize Mistress Nalisora. I will do better in the future.\u201d If the servant had any sense of free will left in her, it'd wonder just what exactly a 'demerit' entailed, as she already was set to be the dragon's thrall for however long she deemed fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFufufu. You <i>will</i>, or face the wrath of the Mistress of Transformation!\u201d Said mistress' hands stuck out proudly on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNali, there's something very wrong going on right now.\u201d Kelos interrupted; watching the display from the coziness of her covers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a mood-swing that was as quick as a flash, the haughtiness left the young hostess, and was replaced by concerned uncertainty. \u201cHuman?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe spell that transformed me into a woman isn't turning me back. Now I'm going to be in a great deal of trouble if I don't return to a prince <i>very soon</i>.\u201d The 'human' tired to explain things in as simple a way as she could. She figured mentioning how just being late to Traeven might result in getting her head on a pike anyway, would sully the mood a tad too much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou wouldn't happen to know why I'm still a girl, right, Nali?\u201d</span></div></div>",

This would have rather severe personal consequences for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to worry about that, Human,\" Nali assured as she looked up. \"I sent a message to your servants, and told them how there was a fight and you helped protect my home and everything. They then sent a message to that castle, and everything was taken care of!\" Her mood shifted, and she beamed with pride at her accomplishment. \"Oh! and I said I'd send them another message when you woke up too!\" She turned to the maid. \"You there, send the message right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mistress,\" the maid replied.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kelos swirled these facts around in her head. It seemed her one off sojourn into another gender might turn into a more common occurrence from now on, thanks to the mystical involvement of her draconic companion. Surprisingly, just as Nalisora had predicated, this wasn't something she found herself particularly angry about. To those more blustery and insecure, having a spell upon them that wiped clean the slate of their masculinity, could prove enraging, but Kelos liked to think she was at least a tad more levelheaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, assuming she could change back with just a few words, keeping her new 'quirk' under wraps should be simple, right? Something just to pull out as an interesting parlor trick to friends and family. Her sister, Orianna, would most certainly get a kick out of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough getting the trigger would alleviate a slew of lingering worries...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI must say, while I do appreciate the... gift, Nali, it's a shame I can't yet test it.\u201d She paused, as an imploring tone filled her voice. \u201cAre you <i>sure</i> you're not willing to spare those magic words early?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA spark of mischievousness filled the dragon's eye, as she held her chin up haughtily. \u201cFufufu, <i>impatient</i>, aren't, Human? Can't stand the thought of going a few days without more <i>wondrous</i> feats from the Mistress of Transformation~?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bedded girl rolled her eyes. \u201cYes Nali, <i>something</i> like that.\u201d It was more a desire to change back into a man, should her guards, or someone else approach the Keep. They already had a bandit scuffle that proved troublesome to deal with while in a skirt. It'd be nice to have an opportunity to be fighting ready, even if the chance of more people scaling the mountain proved thin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNalisora puffed exaggeratedly, as she moved in circles around the edge of Kelos' bed. \u201cI told you, you can't change yet! You might get hurt!\u201d She stopped. \u201cBut!\u201d Dramatic pause. \u201cAs penance for allowing my princess-captive to be injured under my watch, I will do my best to keep you occupied and entertained until your full recovery!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...That's nice Nali, but if you could tell me the spell maybe-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI only got to show you one room, too! There's lots more cool stuff that'll be real fun to mess around with!\u201d Kelos tried to get a word in edge-wise, but was halted by a set of excited outbursts from the other girl. It seemed she was dealing with a battle that was already over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMistress Nalisora, I must warn you, it is not advisable to play with any extraordinary items that might cause Mistress Human-Kelos to experience a physical alteration. In her current state, the ramifications are dangerous, and potentially unknown.\u201d As chance would have it, at that very moment, the spellbound maid returned to the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I know that, <i>slave</i>! Who asked you?! Always coming in when you're not wanted! Five demerits! <i>Five</i>!\u201d Nali stomped her foot, as she angrily pointed at the housekeeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy apologies, Mistress Nalisora. I just wished to inform you that I have finished casting messages to Castle Grovan, Castle Traeven, and Mistress Human-Kelos' escorts, all indicating to them that she is in recovering health.\u201d While the woman's days of thieving may have come and gone, her ability to manipulate magic still proved useful in serving her mistresses; teleporting correspondences near instantly was a skill any person dabbling in the art was quick to learn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos, from where she sat, couldn't help but lightly giggle, as the tiny dragon still seemed to find <i>some reason</i> to bark at her new servant. From the looks of things, matters were finally starting to calm down, if just a little bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought though of more transformations did worry her. Maybe should she speak up? There was a chance here she was letting Nalisora run too rampant, which might not be the best idea, if it involved something even the whelp herself talked about being dangerous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy all means, shouldn't she try and get going, too? Already she was days late to meet Fia! There was a chance the drake was proving too distracting to her overall goals, and the goals of her future kingdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill... there was a part in her who was fascinated by the goings on that'd happened through the past few days. It was almost like a fevered dream. She'd been turned into a girl, befriended a dragon, flown with it to a mysterious, isolated Keep, and battled crooks and rogue spellcasters all the while! This was stuff ripped straight from storybooks! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Plus she <i>was</i> still a princess. If memory served, leaving now would be breaking a promise to Nali.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Plus, I do still feel somewhat weak.\" Kelos laid back down and pulled the covers over her. This bed was surprisingly comfortable for such an old castle to have. Just then something occurred to her. \"Oh, what happened to those two men with her?\" Kelos asked. \"Did you do anything else to them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh the snake guy slithered off somewhere,\" the young dragon said. \"The statue guy, he's still a statue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This castle seems awfully big for just <i>one</i> maid, don't you think, Nali,\" Kelos suggested, winking at young dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh... Oh OH! That's right, Human. Fufufu,\" Nalisora replied happily as she struck a strange pose. \"It seems being around the Mistress of Transformation has given you some good ideas!\" She turned to the maid. \"Slave, make sure she's comfortable and has everything she needs, I'll be right back.\" With that the young dragon ran out of the room excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you require anything, Mistress Human-Kelos?\" the maid asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am thirsty,\" Kelos said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well,\" the maid replied. She walked over to a small table on the far side of the room, where a pitcher and chalice sat. She filled the chalice, then brought it over to Kelos, who sat up in bed, took the chalice, then looked at the drink. The liquid was pink in color. Kelos eyed it suspiciously. \"What is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is juice from a fruit known as a blood orange,\" the maid explained. \"It is grown in my native land.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos shrugged and drank the juice, it was sweet, though tasted acidic as well, there were some other flavors as well. \"Is that some raspberry in it?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but the blood orange does have a hint of a raspberry like flavor,\" the maid explained. \"That made it preferred to the standard ora...\" Their conversation was interrupted by the sound of a stone being dragged across the floor of the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNalisora walked into the room in her dragon form, a rope in her mouth, tied to the statue of one of the male thieves. She dropped the rope, then transformed back to a human shape. \"I was thinking, Human,\" she said to Kelos. \"Since it was your idea, why don't you transform this one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How? I don't know magic,\" Kelos replied, looking confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fufufu, I am a great and powerful dragon, I have just the thing!\" she rushed around to the other side of the statue, and retrieved a small pouch that was dragging behind it. She then pulled a small ring with a black gemstone out of the pouch. \"Behold, human! The statue changing ring thingy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a... creative name,\" Kelos said, giggling slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You take the ring and put it on like this,\" Nali said, putting the ring on her left middle finger. \"Then you touch the statue you want to change, and think about what you want it to look like.\" She touched the statue of the man and made a small change to his ears, reshaping them to a point. \"See, it's easy.\" she took the ring off, skipped over to Kelos, and handed it to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it safe for me to do?\" Kelos asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, you're not being changed at all so it's fine,\" the young dragon said reassuringly. Kelos looked over to the maid, who remained silent, which Kelos took to mean she did not see any harm either.</span></div></div>",

She normally wasn't one for jewelry, but she normally wasn't one for dresses either, or for that matter, female pronouns. Life was proving to be filled with unique happenstances lately, and this was one she felt she ought not miss out on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin moments, she could feel the tiniest tingle radiated from her hand. If what Nali said was true, she now (temporarily) held the power to reshape and manipulate most anything she came in contact with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could just <i>imagine</i> what would happen if this artifact got in the wrong hands. Any regrets about the fates of the thieves further drifted from her thoughts. A smart assassin could topple kingdoms with this ring!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs these weighty matters dwelled on Kelos' mind, a certain dragon was showing far less patience. \u201cCome oooonnn~! Test it test it test it!\u201d Nali chirped, hopping up and down, as she pointed at the statue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR- right!\u201d Kelos nodded, escaping from her daydream, as she stepped forward; the stone figure of the burly man looming over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, that notion in particular kind of annoyed her. As a man, Kelos was decently tall, but with her gender swapped out, most anything other than Nali seemed to tower over her. Almost subconsciously, her hand went to the brute's shoulder, and just sort of... pushed it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was strange. With little resistance, the figure started shrinking. First just a little bit, but then soon enough, it was inches below Kelos' line of sight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHah! He's <i>so</i> tiny now! Do more! Do more do more do more!\u201d Nali seemed to be a frenzy; taking joy in the sight of someone experiencing their first taste of transformative power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to disappoint, Kelos continued. This time, focusing on the 'he' aspect of the dragon's statement. As someone who had their orientation altered herself, the princess felt just a tad drawn toward sharing the wealth with others. Plus, it just didn't seem right that a crook would be allowed to be the only man around three 'beautiful' women. He didn't deserve it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis endeavor was far more intricate than the last, with Kelos taking reference from their newest maid. As she was from the east, Kelos wanted to diversify, and make this companion appear more from the frigid north; difficult as it was, working with stone, she ensured the shade of the locks were lighter, to reflect the future blonde's appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikewise, as the maid's features were sharp, and still spoke of the dangerous assassin-wizard she once was, Kelos wanted to remove any of that sense of original gruff this man had; making her cheeks cherubic, and eyes full of wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis translated naturally to her curves. An expansive chest, and wide hips, spoke, at least visually, of someone who'd spent little time on the battlefield, or really, away from any homeward comfort. All the same however, she had a litheness to her that noted she wasn't an unkempt sloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt went without saying as well that she was to be donned in a maid outfit; the same as the other girl's. Their silhouettes uniform, but unique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos spent a near half an hour working on her 'piece' here, with the maid at her side watching in fascination as her fellow former thief was transformed. Nali could barely hold back her giddiness; keeping silent long enough, until Kelos stayed her hand to assess the work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFun, right?!\u201d The dragon bellowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAck~!\u201d The Grovan royal yelped, so lost in thought from her actions. \u201cI- I- I mean... yes. It's quite... interesting.\u201d Truthfully she was enthralled. Never in her life had she experienced such a taste of magic. Slowly seeing her wants and thoughts take shape with just the touch of her finger... It was amazing! \u201cNali... I was wondering, is there a way to change aspects of this girl's mind?\u201d Certainly the dragon had the power. The maid was proof of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMm-hmm!\u201d Her draconic friend nodded. \u201cJust put your hand to her forehead, and you'll be able to dive into her brains! Then you can make her think all kinds of funny stuff!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Kelos thought the idea of 'diving into a brain' was somewhat unclean, she still felt compelled to investigate- after all, she'd gone this far already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinger aligning to the brow, what happened next wasn't rightly describable. She saw into the former man's life, memories, personality, and everything that made him- now rather her, really, <i>her</i>.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she could change things about it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike at first with the physical modifications, she started small. This person honestly wasn't happy. She was a former bandit in her old life, after all, and most who get into that profession aren't exactly excelling at life. If she was going to become her new maid, then she needed to be a tad more upbeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot just upbeat, though... Perky. Blonde, curvy, and perky. That all sounded like it fit perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a slight charge, as something deep within the girl was changed fundamentally. She had no proof, but somehow, Kelos knew her magic went into effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she dug deeper into the now 'perky' maid's mind, she found new things. Interesting things. Like, apparently she had a crush on the former sorceress-turned-servant. Maybe it was the romantic in her, but Kelos fancied the idea of making that pining a tad more overt; see how exactly the other, seemingly more stoic maid, might react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUltimately, the princess decided to not fiddle with any of the combat skills she parsed over. Just like with the wizard, who knew when something of that sort would prove useful? She did of course though instill an absolute loyalty toward her and Nalisora.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While it had taken days for Kelos' carriage to cross from Grovan into Traeven, Nalisora zoomed though the sky at speeds Kelos could have barely imagined. She watched the ground zip by. It seemed like mere moments when the familiar towers of her home appeared in the horizon. But this point the young dragon was flying low enough that Kelos could make out people on the ground. Farmers working the field, merchants with their carts bringing their wares to market, guards on patrol, children playing, never before had Kelos seen her kingdom like this. Most of these people were too engrossed in their lives to look up, but occasionally Kelos noticed one pointing in her direction. \"If only everyone could see the world from above,\" she mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see what the big deal is,\" Nalisora replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because to you this is just an average day,\" Kelos replied. \"For a human who has never gotten further off the ground than the top of a tall tree, I can assure you, this a complete new way to see the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess,\" the dragon said. \"I'm gonna land soon so get ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos tightened her grip. The maid did not, but Kelos wasn't sure she could tighten her grip any further without crushing her. Nalisora flapped her wings hard, breaking her forward momentum, and bringing her in for a landing right outside the castle gate. The maid quickly hopped off, seemingly glad to be back on solid ground. Kelos was a bit slower to get off, but dismounted and looked up at the sky. \"We must do that again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" Nalisora replied as she changed herself back to her human form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Kelos looked around. They were just outside the gate. Behind them lay the town of Grovan, and the royal square, a park where the royal family would occasionally host events for the townspeople. A crowd began to gather around them, awed at the three girls who came from the sky. \"Nali, why did you land outside the walls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I found out that humans get mad when you land inside their castles, and they try to poke you,\" the young dragon replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't deny that as a possibility,\" Kelos replied. \"I suppose I had better tell the guard I'm home and need to see Xarlat right away.\" She walked away from the crowd toward the gate. A guard stood along the right side. He was carrying a glaive with an ornate blade that appeared to be made of gold, clearly more ceremonial than practical. Though Kelos knew the blade was merely gilded, and underneath was an entirely functional blade of fine steel. While it would never be used in combat, it was more than capable of dealing with an intruder. She approached the guard. \"Please inform my mother and father that I have returned home, and wish to consult with Xarlat. My little problem is more serious than originally expected. This is my guest, Nalisora, and her servant. They will be accompanying me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard looked at Kelos quizzically. \"And who might you be, girl?\" he replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's right, you won't recognize me like this,\" Kelos replied as she looked down at her body. \"I am Prince Kelos. I was transformed into a woman, which is why I must consult Xarlat. I'm sure you can verify my identity with my parents.\"</span></div></div>",

It seemed a typical day, except for the fact that she was a woman, and being escorted by a dragon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow there are so many humans here!\" Nalisora exclaimed as she looked around excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, this castle is the center of my country's government after all,\" Kelos replied. They then entered the keep, where a butler was waiting. He was an older man, with grey hair, though he still had most of it. He was clean shaven and had strong, blue eyes. Kelos recognized him, as he had been in her family's service since before she was even born.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies, please follow me,\" he said, giving a polite bow, while gesturing for them to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know my way to the throne room, Raymond,\" Kelos replied. \"But come along, you do have your orders to escort us, do you not?\" She continued walking in the lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know my name?

Are you perhaps a relative?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am,\" Kelos replied. \"But don't worry, you aren't becoming forgetful, you wouldn't recognize me like this. I've changed quite a bit since you saw me last. I am Kelos, I was transformed into a woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm terribly sorry, your highness!\" Raymond exclaimed. \"If I had known it was you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos raised her hand to cut him off. \"There's no need to apologize, you were simply not informed,\" she said. </span></div></div>",

Thus, I have come home to seek Xarlat's aid in restoring me to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrianna's eyes lit up at this news. She immediately controlled herself, to not appear too happy with this news that she was now first in line for the throne, possibly permanently. \"Of course,\" she said. \"Though it seems a shame to let this opportunity go to waste.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Opportunity?\" Kelos asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it's the perfect chance for some sisterly bonding,\" Orianna said. \"Plus, a chance for you to learn more about a woman's heart, which could help immensely with Fia.\"</span></div></div>",

She hasn't been with Nali long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you're not wrong about children not being alone,\" Orianna replied. \"But little dragons eventually grow into big dragons and start kidnapping princesses. Which she's already done once I'll add. She's dangerous. Are you sure she hasn't done anything to your mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fairly sure she hasn't,\" Kelos replied. \"You see the maid's flat affect. I can assure you she wasn't like that before. Plus, a dragon allied with the kingdom would be a nice asset.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up human!\" Nalisora called out again. \"The wizard guy's waiting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'd better get going,\" Kelos said. She turned to the doorway. \"I'm coming!\" She then hurried to catch up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrianna watched Kelos leave, then turned to her aide when her new sister was out of earshot. \"Where is Xarlat really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As far as I know, he is in his laboratory, as you thought,\" the aide replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe Kelos is being controlled by that dragon,\" Orianna said. \"It is vital to Grovan's future she be kept a woman until that control is broken. You must tell Xarlat to do whatever it takes to stall changing her back until then without letting them know the reason, and you must do so before those three arrive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand, your highness,\" The aide said. \"I shall deliver the message personally. Now if you'll excuse my rudeness as I make haste.\" With that he turned and sprinted out a different door, taking an alternate path to Xarlat's lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrianna grinned wickedly. That controlled by the dragon story was plausible enough. If she played her hand well, her inheriting the throne was within her grasp. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Thanks to Nalisora's childish curiosity about the castle delaying Kelos, the aide managed to slip by the three and reached Xarlat's laboratory first. He knocked on the door. \"Master Xarlat, I have come with orders from her highness, Princess Orianna.\" He waited for a few moments with no response. He prepared to knock again when the door slowly creeped open. Seeing no one there, the aide cautiously entered. The door then closed behind him with no viable cause, leaving him in pitch darkness. Then a blue orb of flame appeared before the aide, then slowly moved deeper inside faintly illuminating the corridor. Realizing this was to be his guide, the aide followed it through the winding corridors of the laboratory. Soon the aide noticed a light ahead. Clearly this was where Xarlat was currently working. As he reached this area, the orb disappeared with a puff of smoke. The aide stepped forward and saw a man in a dark grey robe and a black cape sitting at a table. On one side was an old scroll the man was currently reading, while various beakers and jars bubbling with unidentifiable contents. The aide opened his mouth to speak, but man spoke first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What pointless idiocy does that featherbrained princess feel is worth interrupting my work this time?\" Xarlat asked without even looking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Prince Kelos,\" the aide replied, igoring the wizard's remark about his princess. \"Rather Princess at the moment. She was transformed into a woman, and is coming to seek your aide to transform back. However, Princess Orianna feels Princess Kelos is being controlled by a dragon, and therefore should not be changed back until this control is broken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No she doesn't,\" Xarlat replied. \"She believes that as long as Kelos is a woman, she is next in line for the throne. Whatever, she's ordering me to not help Kelos then?\" He looked up from the book, took a beaker with a green liquid, then poured it into a jar containing a red liquid. A puff of pink smoke emerged from the jar, and the contents slowly lost their color, becoming a clear liquid. Xarlat began to write notes about the effect of mixing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but not to let Princess Kelos or the dragon realize this,\" the aide replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll consider it,\" Xarlat replied. \"First I must examine Kelos. If the problem is more interesting than my current research, I will work on it. If it is not, I'm certainly not opposed to making Kelos wait until the King and Queen come back and override the Princess' order.\" With that the lights in the chamber pulsed. \"Speak of the devil.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess Kelos must not find me here!\" the aide exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, drink the purple one,\" Xarlat replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe aide cautiously picked up a baker with a purple liquid in it. \"What does it do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ensures Kelos won't find you here,\" Xarlat replied. \"I'd hurry if I were you, I've already opened the door for Kelos.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe aide swallowed the mysterious liquid in one gulp. It surprisingly had a sweet, pleasant taste to it, with a hint of fruit. \"This tastes pretty nice,\" the aide said, and in doing so realized something was very wrong. Looking down, the first thing the aide noticed were her new breasts. The second thing was she was now wearing a maid outfit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't talk, just curtsy when Kelos arrives, give no indication of recognition, then leave when I dismiss you,\" Xarlat said. With that, voices could be heard down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This place is so cool,\" Nalisora exclaimed. \"I'll bet this wizard has a lab filled with stuff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's always seemed a bit sparcely equipped to me,\" Kelos said. \"But somehow it always has exactly what is needed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cause it's magic, obviously,\" Nalisora said. \"Oooh I see a light ahead!\" The trio approached Xarlat and the new maid. Following Xarlat's instructions, the new maid curtsied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may go now, girl,\" Xarlat said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the new maid turned to leave, the blue orb reappearing to light her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So is your problem any less mundane than that stupid maid's?\" Xarlat asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you don't recognize me like this, but I am Prince Kelos, I have been turned into a woman by a disguise scroll, then I was hit by a spell that disrupted that magic, preventing me from turning back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This might be mildly interesting,\" Xarlat replied. He waved his arm and a blue light traced Kelos from feet to head, then back to her feet before dissipating. \"This could be a problem. There's a spell lingering on you. I'm afraid it will make an attempt to transform in any way fail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything you can do to break the spell?\" Kelos asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I may, I'm the one who cast the spell in question, if you require any information about it, I will tell you all that you need,\" Nali's maid said.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Xarlat examined Kelos, he came to a conclusion, this wasn't worth his time. The spell was somewhat tricky, and lesser wizards would surely find it impossible to remove, but it was child's play to him. He had already formulated a counter spell in his head. Then all that would be needed was a simple transformation and Kelos would be a prince once more. Five minutes work top, but those five minutes could be better spent on pretty much anything else. He glanced over to the maid. While he first considered Orianna's concerns a foolish attempt at keeping Kelos female so she would be higher in line for succession, the dragon had done a number on this other woman's mind. He still doubted Orianna was sincere, but this made the idea somewhat plausible. What had this dragon done to that woman, he wondered. Right now this seemed a more interesting avenue of research to the old wizard. \"Yes, I believe I could use your assistance,\" Xarlat finally said. \"This magic affecting Kelos is tricky, and I could use all the help I can to solve it.\" He turned back to Kelos. \"With her assistance, I believe I can have your highness out of that dress and into your armor in three days, tops. Likely sooner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos sighed. \"Three days? Is there anything that can speed this up?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and your little dragon friend staying out of my lab so I can get to work,\" Xarlat replied. \"I'll call for you when I'm finished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww... I wanted to watch!\" Nalisora said, while looking closely at the beakers and test tubes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay away from those!\" Xarlat yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fiiiine,\" the young dragon said with a pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's leave Xarlat to his work,\" Kelos said. \"I'll see what I can do about getting you one of those glaives.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" Nalisora exclaimed. \"Okay slave, I order you to stay here and assist Xarlat with his research.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, mistress,\" the maid replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay human, let's go,\" Nali said. She grabbed Kelos' hand and started pulling her towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, the light to guide us out,\" Kelos protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't need it, I can see fine,\" the young dragon said. \"Dragons can see in almost total darkness. If it's close enough we don't even need to see to see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not in your dragon form right now though,\" Kelos said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but it still works,\" Nali said confidently, as she bumped into a wall. \"When I'm paying attention,\" she finished sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos laughed slightly, though it came out as a rather feminine giggle. \"I'll believe you, but remember I can't see in the dark very well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, you're safe with me!\" Nali replied as she carefully led Kelos throught the darkness back towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A prince turned into the princess and then getting saved by the dragon is certainly an unusual tale,\" Kelos commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better than the same old story with different names all the time,\" Nali replied. \"So what should we do next?\"</span></div></div>",

I have a dagger that was said to have been owned by the first king of Traeven. Which I'm sure King Arthras would love to get his hands on if he knew it existed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have something that belonged to the founder of the country you're fighting?\" Nalisora asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose it does sound a bit odd now,\" Kelos agreed as she led her guest through the halls to her room. \"However, our kingdoms were once allies. It was a gift long ago, given to my great, great grandfather. Since then it's been passed down to the first son of the king and queen on their 16th birthday. Or first daughter if there are no sons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't it be given to your sister then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may temporarily be a woman, but I was the first born son,\" Kelos said as the pair continued on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right,\" Nalisora said. \"I've only ever known you as a Princess, so I forgot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose that is true,\" Kelos replied. \"Anyway, my room is right around the corner here.\" The two of them turned, and Kelos was shocked by what she saw. Servants were removing furniture and boxes from her room, while others were carrying in others. Kelos rushed up to them. \"What are you doing?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Orders from Princess Orianna,\" a maid overseeing the operation said. \"Your room is unsuited for a lady, Princess Kelos. We are redecorating it. Don't worry, it shall be done within the hour. May I suggest having some tea in the meantime?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I demand you put everything back the way it was!\" Kelos insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess Orianna said you might object, but I can assure you, this is for your own good.\" the maid said. As things were brought out she checked them off a list. \"We're keeping careful track of your belongings. If you are somehow transformed into a man again, they can be returned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shall be restored within three days. I can assure you this is quite unnecessary,\" Kelos stated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is unseemly for a Princess to sleep in a man's room,\" the maid insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my room!\" Kelos exclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, so it must be made into a proper lady's room for you, Princess,\" the maid insisted. \"Princess Orianna's orders. If you have an issue with it, I suggest you discuss the matter with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this really a big deal?\" Nalisora asked. \"You can just get your stuff back when you turn back into a man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose,\" Kelos said. She thought the matter over as she watched some servants carry a lady's vanity with a large mirror attached into her room. </span></div></div>",

I need...\u201d The maids too were of no help: sweeping and swooping around their new princess to get the job done.

Were she not the strong, <i>infinitely</i> powerful Mistress of Metamorphosis that she was, she might... <i>begrudge</i> the fact that she didn't really have a family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...A small frown did eek its way onto her face, though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reverberations of clacking heels came to a halt, as the redhead wearing them sighed: turning to younger girl. \u201cI <i>certainly</i> do not hate Ori.\u201d She answered: hand going to absently brush through the dragon's hair. \u201cWe've gone through a lot together growing up, and I care deeply for her.\u201d A pause, as a sly grin formed on her face. \u201cBut don't let her go and hear that!\u201d Before the clacking noted they were walking again. \u201cThis just feels like another one of her sorry pranks. She's probably <i>tittering</i> over having a 'little sister' to play with, and I <i>did</i> somewhat blow her off when trying to find Xarlat earlier. This is probably payback.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA prank?\u201d Nali repeated: eyes widening. \u201cOh! Oh! Then Human, we should prank her back! You don't want to look like you have bad prank etiquette!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrank etiquette?\u201d Kelos questioned: eyebrow raising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA vibrant cocksuredness occupied her companion's face. \u201cFufufu~.

I <i>know</i> you work quite hard on your potions, and I'm sure whatever effects it'd have would be...\u201d A pause, as she tried to find the best phrasing. \u201c<i>Enjoyable,</i> but I don't think any sort of inebriation would be a good influence for Nali here.\u201d She emphasized that by placing a hand on the girl's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older heiress seemed strained for only the tiniest of a moment... until a sly smile began to adorn her face. \u201cMy <i>goodness.</i> I teased you earlier about your maternal side, but you really <i>are</i> protective of your little dragon friend here, aren't you~?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new princess's face lit up in a fiery blush, but before she could rightly rebuke that remark, Nalisora was quick to jump in: features sharp in victory. \u201cFufufu~. Human's silly sister has it backwards! As my officially kidnapped princess, Human is to be kept under my protection forever and ever! So that means no potion pranking!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Forever and ever,</i> huh~?\u201d Ori chimed in the most patronizing tone imaginable: trying hard not to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNali...\u201d Kelos hissed in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, it's <i>quite</i> alright, <i>sister.</i>\u201d Orianna interjected. \u201cAs an 'officially kidnapped princess,' you ought to play your role! Forever and ever, even!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger royal simply just huffed, as she crossed her arms under her ample chest: feeling like this wasn't a hill she'd be able to claim victory over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut of course, tell me though! Now that we've got time, how <i>did</i> you two meet, and what <i>exactly</i> went on while you were away?\u201d Orianna urged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt appeared, from the more troubled subject matters that began this conversation, things were transitioning to a lighter affair, as Nali was eager to give details on her grand adventure with Human, while 'Human' did her best to quiet down what embellishments she could: hard to do, when the young whelp was casting them every other word!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis went on for a long enough while, with laughter, red cheeks, and anything and everything in-between. Kelos did have to admit, that after the stress of everything, it was... nice to vent, and not have to deal with rampant craziness. Even if the tea that was supposed to help her even <i>more</i> grew cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I can see how you got yourself wrapped around our little 'Mistress of Transformation's' finger, dear sister!\u201d Ori tittered, as the trio stood. It was growing increasingly late, and at some point, both princesses took note that Nali was getting a tad worn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm <i>not</i> tired!\u201d The dragon insisted, even through a yawn that escaped her lips. Absently, she allowed Kelos to take her hand, as they began meandering themselves to the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, well...\u201d Kelos paused, as she leaned in to whisper to her sister. \u201cWe can discuss more... <i>permanent </i>arrangements for her tomorrow, perhaps? Alone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wide grin adorned itself on Ori just then. \u201cOnly if it's over tea~.\u201d She said, as she leaned in to offer two quick pecks on each of Kelos' cheeks. \u201cNow enjoy your new room!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And suddenly. <i>Terribly</i> so, Kelos found the door closed on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy room!\u201d Kelos gasped with a rising fervor. She got so distracted, she couldn't negotiate demands to change it back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Human?\u201d Nali questioned: sounding <i>very</i> groggy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 'kidnappee' paused and just sighed. \u201cIt's nothing, Nali. I think my sister just got away with another 'prank.'\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMm, Human's sister should get pranked, too.\u201d The dragon hummed, as she sleepily leaned into the older girl's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe...\u201d 'Human' answered, with an exasperated smile. \u201cBut for now, let's crawl into bed, shall we?

Still half asleep she wondered why she was sleeping on the floor and why she had a leather blanket. As she shook off the lingering drowsiness she quickly realized the situation. Nali had wanted to sleep with her, and Kelos obliged. However, at some point during the night, the young dragon had apparently reverted to her true form, pushing Kelos out of her own bed before covering her with an stretched out wing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new princess slipped out from underneath the dragon's wing and stood up. Nalisora was curled up into a ball, sleeping peacefully, covering herself with one wing, while the other had been covering Kelos. For an instant Kelos wondered if it was deliberate on the dragon's part, before remembering she had also pushed her out of bed. Kelos simply sighed, then went to open the wooden shutters on her window. The fresh morning scent wafted in, along with a bit of an early morning chill. Kelos looked around her room and spotted a lavender robe hanging on a rack near a vanity. She walked over and put it on, instantly feeling much warmer. She thought it strange that the cold hadn't affected her as much when she was still a man. Perhaps it was her now smaller body? It was something she'd have to get used to as long as she had this body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down at the vanity. It had lots of makeup and a jewelry box in front of a mirror. Curious, she opened the box's lid. Inside were dozens of pairs of ear rings, necklaces, bracelets, rings, all fit for a princess. She picked up a pair of gold stud earrings with rubies set in them. Examining them closely, she noted the posts seemed sharp. like they could effortlessly poke through her unpierced ears. They seemed to glow slightly, then Kelos found her hands moving on their own. As if she had done it a thousand times, Kelos pushed one earring through her right earlobe, then the other through the left, before applying the clasps. She admired how they looked on her in the mirror, and then realized what had happened. Ori had put enchanted earrings in the jewelry box. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kelos put on the earrings, Nali began to sniff the air and wake up. \"I... smell... a magic item,\" she said sleepily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Kelos replied. \"It seems my sister has pulled yet another prank on me.\" She turned her head to show Nali the earrings. \"I suppose it's harmless enough. They enchanted me to put them on. But then it is odd a girl my age doesn't have her ears pierced so I'm sure Ori was only trying to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNalisora transformed back into her human form and bounded up to Kelos. She examined the earrings closely, sniffing them and visually inspecting them. \"I don't think their magic is done yet,\" the dragon said. \"You should take them off!\" She then rummaged around in Kelos' new jewelry box. \"Here, these are safe.\" She held up another pair of earrings.</span></div></div>",

The new princess's equally new hands were certainly more delicate than they used to be, but not so much so as to be unable to handle jewelry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt appears they've grown rather attached to me.\u201d She hummed through pursed lips, while leaning in closer to the mirror. Her aim was to get a closer look, and see if there was anything wrong, but this also afforded a better opportunity to admire the expertly cut rubies. Despite the enchantment, Ori certainly had good taste... The red accented her hair well, while the gold helped them pop and not fade into the background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI knew it!\u201d Nali huffed with a growl. So soon from her transformation, you could easily see a tiny plume of smoke escaping from the tip of her nose. \u201cHuman's prankster sister is on a mission to just keep pranking and pranking! She's like a prank monster!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor what it's worth,\u201d Kelos noted, still eyeing the mirror. \u201cThis doesn't seem like the <i>worst</i> prank.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon was swift to raise a pointed finger at that. \u201cHuman should know by now that magic stuff can have lots of <i>extra</i> magic stuff stuffed right in it! Who <i>knows</i> what spell got cast on you?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that <i>did</i> raise some concerns in the royal, as she backed off from the vanity. \u201cI suppose you're right.\u201d She said with a sigh. \u201cI really shouldn't be so lax with Ori. I know she likes to tease, but she's taking matters far further than they ought to be.\u201d There was also the uncomfortable worry stirring about the recent status change she'd technically received. From prince to princess wasn't so bad, but at the moment she'd been demoted to <i>second-in-line</i> princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's right!\u201d Her whelp friend barked in return. \u201cWhich is why we should set up a super duper <i>mega</i> prank to get back at her! Equivalent exchange!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos couldn't help but offer a small smile, as she ran a hand across the top of the young girl's head. \u201cI'll settle for a way to get these off first.\u201d She indicated towards the locked gems. Though internally she pondered if there was a way to make them <i>completely</i> unenchanted... They <i>were</i> quite lovely. Wearing them out certainly wasn't going to be a chore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the touch of her kidnapee almost like a receptive pet, Nali subtlety tilted in closer. \u201cSo is that what we're doing today? More Human-Sister stuff?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe noble's eyes squinted as she thought. There <i>were</i> a myriad of matters to deal with. Xarlat said a reversal potion wouldn't be sorted for at least three days, so for the time being, she'd remain of the fairer sex. Kelos' greatest concern however was ensuring Nali's ability to stay in Grovan. Which involved talking with Ori over tea... Alone. \u201cFor a little while, perhaps. Though would you be willing to do something for me, Nali?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuman?\u201d The drake questioned with curious features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos was somewhat hesitant towards how to phrase this, until an idea wormed itself between her ears. \u201cYou see, I think you're quite right that my sister needs a good pranking! But to ensure total and utter prank <i>dominance,</i>\u201d she assertively put a fist in her palm. \u201cI need to go in and prank my sister by myself. On <i>my</i> terms!\u201d There was an exaggerated bravado in her voice at that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c What I need from <i>you</i> though,\u201d a finger gently touched Nali's forehead. \u201cIs to inspect this room. Thoroughly! Make sure there aren't any possible pranks around, like my earrings, while I'm gone for say, roughly... an hour or so?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNali gasped as such an important task was dole out to her... Plus it'd give a chance to mess around in Human's room! \u201cFufufu~. Leave it to the Mistress of Transformation to sniff out any transformative trinkets the Prank Monster's laid out!\u201d She struck a <i>truly</i> ominous pose at that. Or at least... What she thought of as ominous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight. Of course.\u201d Kelos stiffly said, as a sweatdrop formed. So long as it kept her from running a muck around the castle though... She wanted the dragon to live here, and that might not go so well if she winds up bothering Xarlat, and messing with the maids' routine. \u201cSo an hour. And after that, I'll give you a grand tour of everything!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAye aye, Human!\u201d Nali seemed to be only paying half-attention, as she was already snooping under the bed, and preparing to combat any recently developed dust bunnies.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This situation needed to be handled delicately. While she was certain she could get Ori to agree to let her new dragon friend stay and help convince their parents to make it permanent, Kelos was a bit concerned about the price of cooperation. At the very least she'd demand some sort of fashion show, Ori might even try to get her to agree to stay like this! As Kelos was lost in thought, Ori's door swung open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, if it isn't my dear little sister!\" Ori said. \"What brings you to my room so early?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to thank you for these lovely earrings,\" Kelos said cheerfully, as she twisted her head from side to side to show them off. A voice in her head told her that wasn't quite right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. good, I wasn't sure you'd find them so soon,\" Ori replied. \"I included a special enchantment just for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I've noticed I can't quite remove them,\" Kelos commented. \"Though I suppose that isn't really much of an issue. They certainly do suit me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They absolutely do!\" Orianna said. \"By the way, have you noticed the other effects?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Other effects?\" Kelos asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No? Well, they'll just be a surprise then,\" the elder princess said. \"But may I ask, where is your little dragon friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's looking for other magical items in my room,\" Kelos said. \"OH! That's right, I wanted to talk to you about Nali. I can't believe I forgot something so important!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Ori replied. \"Would you care to discuss it over some tea?\" She stepped back and motioned for Kelos to come inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want Nali to live here,\" Kelos said as she walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to invite a dangerous creature to live in the castle?\" Orianna replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's not really dangerous,\" Kelos protested. \"From what I can gather, her mother was killed, and Nali's been living alone in an abandoned castle ever since. I don't want to leave her alone like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well far be it for me to go against my little sister's maternal side,\" Orianna said as she prepared tea. She poured two cups and brought them over to the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos inspected the tea, which appeared normal. \"This is just regular tea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Ori assured. \"I would never try the same trick twice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos hesitantly took a sip. \"It's good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naturally. I'll have you know your big sister is an accomplished tea maker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll remember that,\" Kelos replied. \"But about Nali.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, I'll add my support to allowing her to stay,\" Orianna said. \"However, I do want something in exchange.\"</span></div></div>",

She can think, speak, and apparently scrounge for magical artifacts! If what you've told me she's doing right now is true.\u201d She giggled somewhat in the pause. \u201cShe's also very notably taken a preference to <i>you.</i> You're her 'Human.' I doubt she'd particularly like being watched over by the maids. Didn't you say she turned a bandit into one?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger royal cringed at that, but as the words lingered, she slowly turned more contemplative. \u201cI suppose you're right...\u201d Just the thought though of 'adopting' Nali was making strange butterflies tingle in her stomach, in a way she couldn't properly understand. Even if this was more or less what she came in to ask, the manner with which Ori was wording it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I am~.\u201d Orianna happily chimed. \u201cNow as I was saying, <i>adopting</i> Young Nalisora is going to come with its own set of challenges! Especially if she grows up to be a proper dragon! But I'm more thinking of matters in the immediate moment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was more what Kelos was <i>expecting</i> to talk about in this conversation. She gladly latched onto it. \u201cWell I figure she'll need her own room...\u201d She mused. \u201cThough if she prefers mine, I don't mind her staying there. But she'll need a bed. We'll have to renovate it again. Maybe make it-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA tad more feminine?\u201d Ori quipped: tongue in cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos just stared at her in a deadpan. Honestly, would that even be <i>possible?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut yes, yes, Little Sister. You're being <i>quite</i> the utilitarian! However, you're missing the forest for the trees.\u201d With a dramatic flourish, she pointed a finger towards Kelos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a moment for her to understand, but eventually it clicked, as she glanced down. \u201cMy gender?\u201d She asked. \u201cXarlat said he'd have a reversal potion sorted out in the next few days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, Yes. Well...\u201d Ori was in the process of eyeing her nails as she spoke this. \u201cI believe that the change back should be delayed for a while longer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOri?\u201d Kelos implored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHear me out, Little Sister!\u201d The older royal happily defended. \u201cYoung Nalisora only knows you for the you you currently are now! And the you you currently are now is?...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA... princess?\u201d The 'princess' cautiously answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's right! Good girl! Which is why, for the benefit of Young Nalisora the most, of course, we should try and instill as much of a sense of stability into things as we can, at the moment. You're her Human, and her Human has only shown her feminine side! Changing yourself to be so much more masculine could come as quite a shock!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's not 'changing myself,' Ori! I'm just going back to normal...\u201d Kelos crossed her arms under her chest at this, and began glancing off to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's not how <i>she'll</i> see it! To her, her Human is a gentle, <i>oh so maternal</i> redhead, so anything else could be quite jarring!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos' lips pursed as this was all being said. \u201cSo what are you proposing then, Ori?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm <i>proposing</i>, that until we know your dragon friend can comfortably acclimate to Grovan, you stay as your gentle, <i>oh so maternal</i>, redheaded self.\u201d At that, Ori took a final sip of her tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh. Kelos was mentally mulling it all over. This was tricky. In the very least she didn't request that she stay a princess <i>forever,</i> but the 'comfortably acclimate' part left it rather open. \u201cAnd if I say no?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen you don't get my backing on the situation when mother and father return.\u201d Ori said this rather flippantly... Before a glint of mischievousness filled her eye. \u201cUnless you want follow through another, <i>much more fun</i> demand~.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven just goading her to say it was like taking one step into the lion's den. \u201cAnd what would <i>that</i> be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWellll~.\u201d Ori hummed in an exaggerated sweetness. \u201cSince you <i>love</i> your new earrings so much, I was thinking it might be for the best if you went and enjoyed some of the other gifts I arranged for you! So if you <i>really</i> want my approval for Nali, <i>without any other strings</i>, how about you try whatever items your dragon friend scrounges up while sniffing around in your room~?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It could be traumatizing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can certainly deal with remaining a woman for a bit longer,\" Kelos replied. \"I don't think mother and father will be happy, but they should understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course they will,\" Orianna said reassuringly. \"In fact, I believe they'll be proud of you. A lesser person would selfishly demand to be changed back no matter how much it hurt that poor girl. Even if Mother and Father aren't, I'm proud of you, little sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos blushed and smiled slightly. \"Thanks, Ori. I know we've had our disagreements over the years, but I'm really lucky to be have you as my sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do believe we are overlooking one important detail though. Does your dragon friend want to stay here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't asked her yet, but I think she will.\" Kelos stood up and smoothed her dress out. \"I just need to find the right way to ask her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent!\" Orianna took another sip of tea. \"Though I never expected you to become a mother before me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos blushed. \"I'm not... If anything I'm like her big sister!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sly half smile escaped before Orianna contained it. Kelos had referred to herself as the dragon's sister spontaneously. The longer this could be drawn out, the more Kelos would think of herself as a woman. Why Kelos might even decide to stay like this without further influence! \"Pity,\" Orianna said. \"I must say, I quite liked the idea of being called auntie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos blushed even harder. \"I'll see what I can do, but Nali will probably insist on calling you 'Human-sister.' Speaking of which, I should get back and check on her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrianna put her tea down and stood up as well. \"Yes, get back to my niece and keep her out of trouble.\" She then held out her arms, inviting Kelos for a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos looked confused for a moment, then stepped towards Ori and hugged her. \"You haven't really hugged me before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It just seems more apropos. Now then, good luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Kelos tried to pull away, but Ori held her tight, then leaned in closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make me even prouder, little sister.\" With that she let Kelos go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will, and thanks,\" Kelos smiled brightly at her sister, before leaving the room.</span></div></div>",

Look at all the stuff I found!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk back from Ori's abode to hers was a long one, even if it wasn't so physically: full of blushing, and contemplating thoughts over... <i>motherhood!</i> Goodness! The idea of even being a <i>father</i> hadn't so much as crossed Kelos' mind when she was a man, so to think of a change so drastic...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, those worries had a pin put in them upon seeing her little dragon companion beaming, as she held a hoard of trinkets and doodads abreast in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my!\u201d The redhead gasped in semi-exaggerated shock. But only <i>semi.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuman's sister hid a whole <i>bunch</i> of pranks here!\u201d The 'semi' being the truth of that statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I suppose they're all as <i>lovely</i> as my new earrings?\u201d Kelos intended for that question to have more bite and sarcasm, but it came out with a light giggle, and a flicking of her hair to show off the jewelry. They really were lovely... What was she complaining about, again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh huh!\u201d Nali affirmed: marching over, and placing the pile atop the desk of the new princess's vanity. Kelos might need to be careful: there were necklaces, and bracelets, and other items that could easily blend in and be mistaken for 'real' finery. \u201cNone could hide from the Mistress of Transformation!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe'll have to find a place for you to stash it all away.\u201d The royal chimed: simultaneously staring at what, if Nali were to believed, was an enchanted tiara. A <i>tiara!</i> Did Ori seriously think she'd wear such a thing?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmittedly, the sapphire gem in the center was quite attractive...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?!\u201d The whelp gasped: already imagining adding them all from the collection she had back at her tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos paused at this: wondering if it might be a good opportunity to segue into the actual conversation she wanted to have. \u201cI was thinking a room in the castle?\u201d She was slowly kneeling down to get on her ward's eye level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuman?\u201d Nali asked: voice questioning, as she tilted her head to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNali... I've been wondering lately, but... Would you like to live here? With me?\u201d She asked, placing a sincere hand on the others' shoulder. \u201cThat keep of yours looked like it could get awfully lonely... And this way, I could be with you.\u201d A pause, as the next phrase hung itself on her lips... Until she took the plunge. \u201cTake care of you.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There were many rumors that stirred around the former Prince Kelos, now, and forever, Prince<i>ss</i> Kelos. Some grounded, some fantastic. Maybe the potential weight of the crown just proved too much, and abdicating was her own, true choice? Or there were the implications that her sister, now Queen, manipulated her mind, and made her desire to stay a woman. Anyone who'd met her would tell you she certainly was quite feminine for a person born a boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the most baffling explanation, and the explanation Princess Kelos would tell you, smile <i>wide</i> on her face, was that an adorable little dragon simply happened to enchant her heart~.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c'Little' dragon? Are you serious, Sister?\u201d Queen Orianna palmed her face, as she contemplated how empty the kingdom's coffers would be once construction on the castle's new <i>dragon's roost</i> was finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos, current mother of one, merely just raised a finger in the air. \u201cNow now, Ori, we were fully aware of the responsibility we took on when we invited her to live here. I've made <i>plenty</i> of sacrifices myself for it, you know.\u201d Despite the heaviness of some of her words, a caring, jubilant smile never seemed to leave her face. Motherhood truly had done wonders for the redhead's disposition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it too late for you to take the throne?...\u201d Ori grumbled half-seriously. She always had dreams of inheriting her father's title, but who <i>knew</i> it involved so much paperwork?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh goodness, no! I couldn't! Nali's almost a teenager, now! Or at least, a dragon teenager. Believe me, my hands are going to be <i>full.</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat statement was promptly followed by a reverberating *boom* echoing its way through the halls. An increasingly familiar sound, as of recent years, with a certain, now much fuller formed drake, making her landing in an outside courtyard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Moooooooom!</i>\u201d That was another increasingly familiar sound as well, as a slightly older looking Nalisora, in human form, marched her way into the throne room, as if it was as natural as walking into her very own living quarters. \u201cI was flying around, and saw a caravan of what looked to be troops from Teutonis! I scared them off, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos just shook her head, and gave an exacerbated sigh. \u201cThey likely wanted to enter our borders to cross into Traeven. Good work, Dear~.\u201d Her words sweetened up, at that last statement. With the arrival of an actual, unironic <i>dragon</i> in Grovan's inner circle, suddenly, many of the surrounding nations began to shy away from conflict. Who would have thought~?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Orianna however, held some hesitance. \u201cUm, Nali dear, Auntie has a <i>bit</i> of a question.\u201d A pause. \u201cHow <i>exactly</i> did you 'scare them off?'\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe growing whelp smiled with a twinkle in her eye. \u201cWell using my fire breath would have been waaaaay too borrrrringgg, and I'm not the 'Mistress of Transformation' for nothing, fufufu~.\u201d She gave a small wink at that. \u201cLet's just say what Teutonis might be lacking in soldiers now, they've instead earned themselves a surplus of maids!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOri couldn't help but duck her head down, as Kelos giggled: gliding over to her daughter to give an approving head-pat. \u201cKnowing your magic, I'm sure they'll take to their new professions <i>quite</i> well!\u201d The young mother's thoughts turned to the former raider-turned-servant, who'd found a very suitable spot as Xarlat's personal assistant. Her previous experience as a spellcaster actually proved useful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgghhh, I'm going to have to write a personal apology letter to King Aison now...\u201d Ori grumbled from her throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning from her daughter to her Queen, Kelos just gave a coy grin. \u201cWell, if he raises too much of a fuss, I'm sure Nali here wouldn't mind giving him a new perspective or two. 'Fufufu~.'\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that, more or less, was the story of a prince turned princess, that met a dragon who enjoyed turning others into <i>lots</i> of different things, and proceeded to completely upended her life. For the better, she'd always note. After all, if her daughter was the 'Mistress' of Transformation, that had to make her the 'Mother,' didn't it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe not as regal as 'Queen,' but 'Princess Kelos, Mother of Transformation' didn't have the worst ring to it~.</span></div></div>",

She sat up and looked around, she was in a candle lit room. Nali was there, once again in her human form, asleep in a chair, with her head on the bed. \"Huh, she must have actually been worried about me,\" Kelos thought. She smiled and gently stroked the young dragon girl's hair. She wasn't such a bad kid. Perhaps she should invite her to come to Grovan. Kelos then stretched. Surprisingly nothing seemed to hurt besides her head, but she was very thirsty. \"I wonder how long I've been out,\" she thought as she carefully got out of bed, trying not to disturb the sleeping dragon. She noticed she was no longer wearing that puffy gown, but a white silk robe. Her long black hair fell down to her butt as she got up... \"Wait a minute,\" Kelos thought. She looked around the room again, searching for a mirror. Spotting one on the far wall, she headed over, and gazed in. The reflection that greeted her was not that of her true manly self, nor even that of the woman she had been transformed into. It was the face of the sorceress from the far east whom she had been fighting earlier. \"NALI WHAT DID YOU DO TO ME?!\" Kelos shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha?\" the young dragon said, rubbing her eyes. \"Ah, human you're awake.

Strangely, they seemed to glow softly for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her suspicions about the girl, Kelos couldn't turn down a request like that. \"Fine, I guess I can take you to a nearby village or something,\" she replied. \"Come here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look of confusion flashed for an instant, but quickly left. \"O-okay,\" she said, as she approached Kelos cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I won't bite,\" Kelos said, holding out her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl tentatively reached out to take Kelos' hand. The instant they touched, a look of realization overtook the girl. Here eyes drifted down to Kelos' discarded male clothes. \"So that's why,\" she murmured to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Kelos asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your hands are soft and dry,\" the girl said. \"Like mommy's...\" She looked down with sad eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos reached over and hugged the young girl. In turn the girl wrapped her arms around Kelos. \"Don't worry, I'll take you someplace safe,\" Kelos said. \"But for now,\" she picked some leaves out of the girl's tangled hair, \"let's get you cleaned up a bit, okay?\" Kelos led the girl to the edge of the stream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, miss. Your dress,\" the girl said. \"It'll get all wet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos looked down at herself. \"Oh right,\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your dress is so pretty,\" the girl said. \"It's important to take care of pretty things.\" Again her eyes seemed to glow slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was I thinking?\" Kelos exclaimed, suddenly shocked that she would risk such a fine dress. She took a step back, holding up the hem of the dress so it wouldn't get dirty. Then she took off her sword, then reached behind to undo the buttons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can do that,\" the girl offered. She walked around behind Kelos, and began unfastening the buttons for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Kelos said. As the girl finished, Kelos took off her shoes and carefully stepped out of the dress, then hung it on a tree branch. \"There.\" She turned back to the girl. \"Now it's your turn.\" She helped the girl take off her dress. While there were more scrapes and bruises on the girl, strangely, they didn't match the tears in the dress. It seemed odd, but Kelos just shrugged it off and helped the girl get clean, doing her best to pick out the debris in the girl's hair as the girl washed herself off in the cool, clear water. \"There all done,\" Kelos said after a few minutes. The girl's hair was still a mess, but Kelos had been able to remove the debris and most of the knots and tangles. The rest would be handled by a brush when they got back to the carriage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl stepped out of the stream and went to put on her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" Kelos said. \"Now that you're all clean, you shouldn't put on that filthy old thing.\" She walked over to her discarded male clothes, and picked up her shirt, bringing it over to the girl. \"Wear this. It will be big, but at least it's clean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" the girl replied. She put the shirt over her head. It fell past her knees, and the sleeves extended quite a distance past her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos rolled up the sleeved for the girl, then buttoned the shirt. She then walked over to her dress, and carefully stepped into it. She then turned her head. \"Would you mind?\" she asked the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl walked over to Kelos and buttoned the dress. She then circled in front of her. \"You're really pretty, miss,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know about that,\" Kelos replied a bit uncomfortably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are,\" the girl insisted. \"It's nice to be pretty.\" Again her eyes glowed slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why thank you,\" Kelos replied. \"Though I'm sure when you grow up, you'll be even prettier. But we should really get back to my carriage. My guards are probably getting worried.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" the girl said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos took the girl's hand. She then turned to her old clothes and sword.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a cold and damp morning as the carriage rolled through the hillside just outside the Kingdom of Traeven.  Prince Kelos, the 22-year-old heir to the throne, was taking part in a goodwill mission to the neighboring kingdom of Traeven.  The mission was to finalize a peace accord that would end the decade-long war between the two kingdoms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn order to end the war, Prince Kelos would take part in a marriage with the daughter of Traeven\u2019s rulers, Princess Fia.  Coming along for the journey was Captain Jex of the Royal Guard, and lowly scribe named Mathias.  With only a few hours left before their arrival, Kelos was beginning to feel somewhat nervous.  \u201cI wish this wretched journey would come to an end; so I can be married to the Princess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re almost there, sire.\u201d Looking at the Prince, Captain Jex said, \u201cIt can\u2019t be more than a few hours left.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell we need to stop; I have to relieve myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only a matter of minutes before the carriage came to a stop next to a small stream.  After assuring Captain Jex that he\u2019d be fine, Prince Kelos strode towards the stream where he found a large rock to hide behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, he\u2019d just finished when he was startled by the sudden appearance of Mathias.  Looking at the scribe, in anger, Kelos said, \u201cHow dare you approach me unannounced, scribe!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cApologies, my Prince.\u201d Reaching into his satchel, Mathias said, \u201cBut as we\u2019re close to our destination, I felt it prudent to give you this.\u201d<br>\r\nTaken a rolled up scroll from Mathias, Kelos said, \u201cWhat is this?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a letter to you from your father; no doubt expressing his thanks for your part in ending this war.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing to open the scroll, Kelos vaguely noticed Mathias starting to back away but thought nothing of it.  When he opened the scroll, he didn\u2019t see a letter from his father; instead, he saw what looked to be gibberish.  Looking at Mathias, Kelos said, \u201cWhat is the meaning of...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos was interrupted by a bright light; raising his hand to cover his face as the light engulfed him.  Mathias watched in amusement; fully aware of what was happening.  Captain Jex, seeing the bright light, rushed to the river.  He arrived just as the light subsided; leaving a beautiful young woman in body armor where Prince Kelos had previously stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain Jex, not aware of what had transpired, immediately drew his sword.  Pointing it towards the now female Prince Kelos, he said, \u201cWhat have you done with the Prince, fair maiden!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFair maiden?\u201d Prince Kelos began to protest when he suddenly heard his new voice.  A quick glance downward revealed the feminine body of a young woman.  \u201cCaptain, I\u2019m Prince Kelos.  The wretched scribe Mathias has done something to me.\u201d<br>\r\nTurning his sword towards Mathias, Jex said, \u201cExplain yourself, scribe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis young woman is telling the truth; she is Prince Kelos.\u201d Pausing, Mathias said, \u201cAlas, I\u2019m sorry to say that the point of this journey isn\u2019t what either of you thought it was.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou better tell us what the real point is; or so help me, I\u2019ll find a way to make you a woman as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy Prince, you weren\u2019t sent here to marry Princess Fia.\u201d Sighing, Mathias said, \u201cYou were sent here _______.\"</span></div></div>",

The king wouldn't lift a finger to save him, leaving the act to his employer - Kelos herself. And Mathias knew that Kelos would not leave this treachery forgotten, leaving him to rot in the hands of the bandits, who wouldn't hesitate to kill him when they find out he was worthless, or - god forbid - turn him into breeding stock. All because he tried to win the king's favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" Mathias mumbled, too quiet for Kelos or even the guards to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Kelos remarked, leaning over the window of the carriage to better hear him. \"I apologize for my lack of tact, but I cannot hear you at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M SORRY!\" The scribe's voice resounded through the surroundings, loud and clear. His next action shocked even Kelos herself, as he promptly dropped to his knees and arched his back, performing a full-fledged bow. \"I'm sorry I didn't tell you!

Please... please forgive me, Princess... no, Prince Kelos!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos looked downwards at the trembling scribe. She remembered when she first met him. He was ambitious; studious; but most of all, prideful. Kelos genuinely liked him and his character - they really stood out among the other applicants, who were dreary and old men. To have such a young scribe aspiring towards his dreams caused her to feel a bit of envy. She felt incredibly betrayed by him, but this sight caused an even more disturbing emotion to give rise. She couldn't stand watching what she considered her close servant lowering himself to such a manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stand, Mathias. You're embarrassing yourself,\" Kelos rebuked, motioning him with her arm. \"Quickly get in before the other soldiers see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean you-\" The scribe began before Kelos quickly cut him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain, stand aside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Princess!\" Captain Jex exclaimed, saluting, as he stood aside to make way for the scribe. Princess Kelos could swear that this was the fastest she's seen anyone run, as Matthias picked himself off the ground and darted towards the carriage within a second, seating himself on the comfy cushion before Kelos could say, \"Princess Fia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. Thank you so much, Your Highness!\" Mathias exclaimed, practically in tears, as he grabbed Kelos' now dainty hands and shook him. Kelos was amused by this action. Never had she seen the scribe be so emotional before. Yet she steeled herself and regained her regal tone of voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is fortunate that you have finally come to your senses.\" Kelos replied, his voice cold. \"Need I have remind you once more for whom you work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, my Prince. It is you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly.\" Kelos pointed out, her tongue clicking. \"You work for me, and me alone. Not my sister, not my mother, and not my father - but for me. Do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Yes, Prince Kelos.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Then let it stay that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-|-|-|-|-|-</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the trip was quite uneventful. There weren't any bandit attacks on the way, any stranded people, or anything of that nature. Yet Kelos was quite preoccupied with his own body. It now felt incredibly soft, the skin was smooth to the touch. Her long, curly black hair bounced with each step that the horses took as they pulled the carriage, and her breasts were no less active. They kept moving - jiggling all over the place. Kelos was quite surprised by this because they were definitely not all that big - quite a modest size at best. Still, they bounced, and bounced they did. It would have annoyed her if the sensation wasn't so new, so foreign, so alien. She had caught the scribe many of times staring at them, before quickly averting his gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrived at the castle, Kelos spared no time in heading to the palace to meet with King Arthras. She had thought there was no point in making him wait. After all, even if she was his hostage for the moment, he was her host, and there was also a code of conduct among royalty when it came to prisoners. In fact, commoners would look upon it as more of a vacation than anything else, a temporary relief of duties as they played around in a foreign kingdom. And Kelos had to admit that this was not far from the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess Kelos has arrived!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos had sashayed into the throne room as courteously as possible, still wearing the outfit she had on when she was a prince. Yet despite the clothes being made for a man, her breasts and hips were accentuated in them, and she did not look too badly in them. Walking up to King Arthras, who was surrounded by the Captain of the Royal Guard, Galan, and the General of the Traevan Army, Dioral. Kelos remembered the teachings from her Ethics class and executed a curtsy as best as she possibly could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have arrived, King Arthras,\" Kelos said, paying her respects to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed,\" Arthras responded, as he stroked his beard. \"I can see that you had no time to change. Not that men's clothes hide that beautiful figure. I would liked to see you in a dress though. Oh! Where are my manners? I hope you did not mind becoming a female much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was a bit peeved, of course,\" Kelos replied, picking her words carefully. \"But I understand the situation. If I was holding a foreign prince as a hostage, I too would be worried about his contact with my daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos noticed that Arthras seemed to be surprised by his words, as he exchanged glances with both his guards. \"I am not quite certain what you speak of, but I am afraid you were misinformed about something. We never intended to be so rude as to hold a hostage from a foreign power. No, you came here to be...\"</span></div></div>",

While Jex remained outside to control the carriage as they continued down the road, Kelos sat in the cabin.  He struggled to find a comfortable position to sit in; the armor he wore was ill-fitting around his new female form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each breath he took, his breasts were pushed against the armor chest piece.  He could only imagine how it must feel when his sister was forced into the corsets and tight-fitting dresses that she wore.  <i>How can women live like this?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving finally found a comfortable position to sit in, Kelos took a deep breath as the journey continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***********************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, Captain Jex had stopped the carriage in a small clearing.  Opening the carriage door, he offered his hand to Kelos.  \u201cMay I help you out, m\u2019lady?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping out of the carriage without assistance, Kelos glared at her guard.  \u201cIf you call me m\u2019lady again, I won\u2019t be the only one who suddenly finds themselves a member of the fairer sex.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy apologies m\u2019la...Prince Kelos.\u201d Bowing, Jex said, \u201cIt was simply a force of habit; it won\u2019t happen again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy have we stopped, Captain; have we reached our destination?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, your highness.\u201d Gesturing to the horses, he said, \u201cThe horses need to rest and have some water.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you take care of that earlier?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForgive me; but I thought it more important to keep you safe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did a fine job of doing that, Captain.\u201d Venting her frustration, Kelos said, \u201cHow much longer before this journey is finished?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be but another few hours, my lord.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood.\u201d Glancing at the back of the carriage, Kelos said, \u201cThere\u2019s a gown in the back of the carriage.  It was meant as a gift for Princess Fia, but I fear I have a more pressing need for it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading towards the rear of the carriage, Captain Jex said, \u201cI\u2019ll retrieve it at once, my lord.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took some effort on Kelos\u2019 part even convince herself to change out of the armor and into the gown.  It was the same decadently feminine style that his sister and mother wore; it was not something he\u2019d ever pictured himself having to wear.  <i>I cannot believe I am even considering this.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos paced around in a circle behind the carriage, looking at the gown that Jex had hung in back.  It was of modest size; Kelos didn\u2019t see any reason why it wouldn\u2019t fit her new form.  It was a mixture of green and gold.  Kelos thought about how nice Princess Fia would have looked wearing it; she never imagined having to wear it herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long before Kelos had gotten into the gown; it was a snug fit and did nothing to hide her new feminine figure, if fact it simply accentuated it.  After doing some minor rearranging to get comfortable, she peaked around the corner of the carriage.  Spotting Captain Jex sitting on a nearby rock, she said, \u201cCaptain, would you be so kind as to help me with this gown.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, my Lord.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain Jex walked over to the back of the carriage.  As soon as he rounded the corner he stopped in his tracks and started to laugh.  He struggled to contain himself.  Glaring at the Captain, Kelos said, \u201cIf you say anything to anyone about this, I will see to it that you clean the stables by hand for a month.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course...my Lord.\u201d Stifling a laugh, Jex said, \u201cHow can I be of service?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis gown as a corset built into it.\u201d Sighing, Kelos said, \u201cAlas I\u2019m unable to tighten it myself; could you help me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took some effort on Captain Jex\u2019s part but he was soon able to tighten the corset to wear it was still comfortable for Kelos.  As she got the hang of walking in the gown, Kelos said, \u201cI trust the horses are sufficiently rested?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, my Lord.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, let us get moving.\u201d Heading towards the carriage, Kelos said, \u201cIf I\u2019m to be a gift for the Traeven Royal Family, it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate to keep them waiting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, my Lord.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few embarrassing attempts to get into the carriage by herself, Kelos had to ask Jex for his assistance.  Once she was safely inside the carriage, Jex got the horses moving and they continued on their way.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The rest of the trip was quite uneventful; save for Kelos\u2019 constant discomfort coming from her new body.  While she was no longer feeling constricted by her armor, she felt exposed and awkward wearing the gown.  The movement of his breasts, along with bouncing of her now shoulder length curly brown hair served as a reminder that she was no longer a man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they arrived outside the walls of the city, Captain Jex briefly stopped the carriage and stepped down.  Walking to the door, he opened it and said, \u201cForgive me m\u2019lord, but I fear we have a problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat sort of problem?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt would cause your family unbridled embarrassment if we were to introduce you as Prince Kelos.\u201d Sighing, Jex said, \u201cI understand you\u2019re not really a princess, but your current form says otherwise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos knew where Jex was going with his speech.  She knew there was no way around what he was suggesting.  Taking a breath, she said, \u201cIf you must introduce me as a Princess; then do as you must but don\u2019t use my real name.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course...m\u2019lady.\u201d closing the door, he said, \u201cWe\u2019ll be at the palace shortly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride through the city streets was an interesting experience for Kelos.  The War had been hard on Traeven; under the command of his father, the forces of Gorvan had devastated the farms and livestock of their enemy.  The ride through the streets forced Kelos to see dozens of starving citizens; some no more than children.  <i>I never imagined I\u2019d see something like this.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the carriage arrived at the palace, Captain Jex stepped off the carriage and approached a guard standing in front of the steps.  \u201cI am Captain Jex of the Gorvan Royal Guard; I\u2019m here with Princess Orla at the request of your King.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf any of the guards were confused as to why a mere Princess was coming to mediate the peace talks, they didn\u2019t show it.  At that point, another guard walked out of the palace.  \u201cWe were expecting Prince Kelos.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Prince sends his regrets but he was unable to leave the Palace.\u201d Gesturing towards the carriage, Jex said, \u201cHe sent his sister in his place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well.\u201d Pausing, the guard said, \u201cOpen the carriage so we may see this Princess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos watched as Jex walked towards the carriage; saying to herself, \u201cHere goes nothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith help from Jex, Kelos stepped out of the carriage in full view of the guards.  She started blushing when she saw how they looked at her; it was a look she\u2019d given to girls many times in the past.  Kelos walked over to the guard; who looked at her and said, \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, Princess Orla, my name is Galan, I\u2019m the Captain of the Royal Guard.\u201d Looking at Kelos, he said, \u201cForgive our confusion, we weren\u2019t aware of the Gorvan Royal Family had a daughter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, they do.\u201d Putting on a fake smile, Kelos said, \u201cPlease escort me to your King, so I can commence the peace talks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, m\u2019lady.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Kelos and Jex followed the guards into the palace.  As the palace doors closed, Kelos wondered how this day could get any weirder.</span></div></div>",

The palace, it seemed, was more ornately decorated than the one he\u2019d grown up in.  There were large tapestries and vases all over the place.  <i>This Royal Family sure knows how to live.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving outside the door to the throne room, Kelos was about to enter when he saw someone approach Jex.  Straining to listen in, Kelos heard the stranger say, \u201cGreetings Captain, I am Marlin; the King\u2019s sorcerer.  I wonder if I might have a few minutes of your time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI must stay with the princess to keep her safe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about her safety; this will only take a few minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Marlin and Jex walked off, Kelos heard Marlin say, \u201cAm I to understand you\u2019d do anything to keep the princess safe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing her confusion aside, Kelos entered the throne room as the guards closed the door behind her.  As much as she dreaded the position she was in, she knew that if she was going to be an unwilling guest in the palace that she best make her prescense known to the king.  Remembering the lessons from her father\u2019s advisors about eticate, performed the best curtsy she possible could.  \u201cKing Arthras, I\u2019m Princess Orla of Gorvan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, Princess Orla of Gorvan.\u201d Standing up, King Arthras said, \u201cI\u2019m King Arthras, welcome to my home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Arthras was a somewhat overweight man in his early 40s; he was a widower raising his daughter Princess Fia on his own.  \u201cUnder the circumstances, you\u2019ll understand if I don\u2019t appreciate the sentiment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand.\u201d Looking to his guards, King Arthras said, \u201cLeave us at once, the Princess and I have much to discuss.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes m\u2019lord.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos watched in confusion as the guards left the room.

She couldn\u2019t understand why her parents would involve her in such a crazy scheme; she was a man at heart, there was no way she\u2019d let herself become the new Queen of Traeven.  Even But she knew if she declined that Arthras would carry out his thread to bombard Grovan.  While her army was suited for the task of defending the city, she knew there\u2019d be casualities.  If word ever emerged that she could\u2019ve prevented the war, then the citizens and the military would never forgive her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking through the hall, passing several servants and officials on the way, Kelos was faced with another perplexing dilemma.  Ever since they had arrived here, he had been acting strangely.  She could not quite put her finger on it, but she knew there was something off about him.  <i>He\u2019s never been here before, how does he suddenly know where the Queen\u2019s chambers are?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Kelos could do anything about the situation, Jex stopped outside of a large door.  \u201cM\u2019lady, here are your chambers for the duration of your visit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>His voice seems higher for some reason; and has he gotten shorter?  </i>Fully aware of something happening to her guard, Kelos wanted to question him but wasn\u2019t sure how.  Taking a breath, Kelos nodded and said, \u201cThank you, Jex; that\u2019ll be all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBegging the Queen\u2019s pardon, but I must stay with you to ensure your needs are met.\u201d Opening the door, Jex said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be much of a handmaiden if I didn\u2019t do my job.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping herself as she walked through the door, Kelos turned to face Jex; who was clearly shocked by the sudden stop.  \u201cI am not the Queen, Captain; and you\u2019re certainly no handmaiden.\u201d Getting confused, Kelos said, \u201cWhat is wrong with you, Captain?  You\u2019ve been acting strangely ever since our arrival from Grovan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must be tired from your long journey, it's making you say strange things.\u201d Smiling, his voice getting even higher, Jex said, \u201cYou are the future Queen Orla of Traeven; I have been your loyal handmaiden for these last 5 years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing a crowd forming, Kelos pulled Jex into the room and closed the door.  \u201cThey\u2019ve done something to you, Jex.\u201d Staring at her confused guard, Kelos said, \u201cFulfill your duties and protect your...princess before she is harmed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment it looked to Kelos as if Jex was fighting what was being done to him.  \u201cN-No one will ha-harm my Princess; her saf-safety is my top...perhaps you\u2019d like me to draw you a bath?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that whatever had been done to Jex was too strong, Kelos relented and said, \u201cFine, you may draw me a bath.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jex left the room, Kelos was left alone in the Queen\u2019s chambers.  It was a large room, not dissimilar to her own mother\u2019s chambers.  There was a large, but comfy looking bed in the center of the room.  A quick look through a closed door revealed several extremely feminine gowns, all of which Kelos imagined were in her size.  <i>If Arthras thinks these will affect my decision, he\u2019s sorely mistaken.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nKelos was female in body only; she was surprised Arhtras thought the gowns would win her over.  Had her sister been the one selected to be the new Queen, Kelos was fully aware that she might very well agree to the proposal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on the bed, Kelos allowed herself a moment alone with her thoughts.  <i>Well Kelos, this is a fine situation you\u2019ve gotten yourself into.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nJust then there was a knock at the door.  Winowhereo where to be found, Kelos realized he had to open the door.  Getting up, breathing a sigh of frustration, Kelos went over to the door.  Opening it, she saw _________________ standing there.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Putting her annoyance aside, Kelos opened the door and found herself staring at a young woman; perhaps no older than 18 or 19 years old.  She was wearing typical servant clothing and looked to be rather pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I help...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Kelos could even finish her sentence, the woman pushed her back into the room and quickly followed suit.  After she closed the door, she turned to Kelos and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for the intrusion m\u2019lady but this is quiet urgent.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow dare you place your hands on me in such a manner!\u201d angry, Kelos said, \u201cI shall inform King Arthras of this at once.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease m\u2019lady, don\u2019t inform the King.\u201d Taking a breath, the girl said, \u201cI had to come see you once I heard tell of the King\u2019s request.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching as the girl paced around the room, clearly upset about something, Kelos said,\u201cWhy would a servant concern herself over such things?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause, almost a year ago, he made the same request of me.\u201d Turning to Kelos, she said, \u201cYou see, I wasn\u2019t always a mere chambermaid for the Royal Family.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping her anger to herself, Kelos said, \u201cWhat were you then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was King Ligart of Brusmel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos would never have believed such a story had she not currently inhabited a female form.  The Kingdom of Brusmel was a neighboring Kingdom to the North; they had with Gorvan in the early days of the War until a decisive attack by Traeven had caused their surrender.  The anyone had heard of King Ligart, he had been killed while on a mission to discuss peace.  If what the servant said was true, then he had be dealt a much crueler fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is preposterous; King Ligart was killed in combat almost 2 years ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it really preposterous, Princess Orla \u2013 or should I say Prince Kelos?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter realizing that the servant knew more than Kelos had initially thought, she decided it was best to listen.  \u201cOkay King Ligart \u2013 wait, that doesn\u2019t seem appropriate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking towards the floor, embarrassed, the servant said, \u201cMy name is Gisella now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay...Gisella.  What do you know of King Arthras request of me?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHe wants you to marry him and become his new Queen, otherwise he\u2019ll destroy your Kingdom in a decisive attack.\u201d Taking a breath, Gisella said, \u201cI\u2019m here to advise that you take the offer; no matter how degrading you feel it is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re asking me, a man, to become his Queen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe alternative is that he destroys your Kingdom and punishes you.\u201d Taking a breath, fighting back some tears, Gisella said, \u201cThere are worse fates than being forced into a marriage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of silence, Kelos said, \u201cI\u2019ll consider your advice, Gisella.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s all I ask, m\u2019lady.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gisella stood up to leave, Kelos said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind my asking, what happened to leave you in this situation?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing Kelos was referring to her pregnancy, Gisella said, \u201cAbout 3 months after my refusal to marry Arthras, I was living in the village.  One day I was going to the market when I was grabbed by one of the Royal Guard.  As it turns out, he\u2019d lost a brother during one of the bloodier battles of the War; he\u2019d somehow learned of my fate and wanted revenge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGisella clearly didn\u2019t want to speak of the incident, but she did so anyway.  \u201cHe forced himself on me and vowed that I would suffer for all the deaths my men had caused in the war.\u201d Taking a breath, Gisella said, \u201cI eventually got away, but it was too late.  I discovered about 2 months later that I was with child.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for what happened to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot as sorry as the guard was.\u201d With a faint chuckle, Gisella said, \u201cArthras took pity on me and gave me a job in the palace, but he had his sorcerer turn the guard into a female bloodhound to breed more hunting dogs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts funny you should mention the sorcerer, Marlin.\u201d Getting up, Kelos took a few steps before stopping and turning to face Gisella.  \u201cAfter our arrival, he approached my guard, Captain Jex.  Ever since that meeting, Jex has been behaving strangely; thinking he\u2019s been my loyal handmaiden for the last 5 years.  I do believe he\u2019s also gotten shorter and his voice higher.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard stories about that but never thought it was true.\u201d Looking at Kelos, Gisella said, \u201cIf what you say is true, then Jex is been cursed to slowly become a woman who believes herself to be your loyal handmaiden.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSurely there\u2019s a way to reverse it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid there isn\u2019t.\u201d sighing, Gisella said, \u201cBy sunrise the day after tomorrow, your guard will be a young woman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing footsteps outside, Kelos said, \u201cThat must be him now; you should leave.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take the secret passage, he won\u2019t see me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, Jex entered the room carrying two buckets of what appeared to be hot water.  \u201cMy apologies for the delay, m\u2019lady.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Jex.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jex went to put the water in the tub, Kelos got a good look at his guard; sure enough more changes had occurred in the time he was gone.  His hair was definitely longer and his skin was becoming softer and more feminine.  <i>There may be no saving Jex, but I must escape this place before I am trapped as Arthras\u2019 Queen.</i></span></div></div>",

Her new body, she found, was much more sensitive than her old one.  After finishing in the tub, with a little help from Jex, Kelos found herself wearing a rather feminine gown that the King had left in the closet for her to wear.  Looking at herself in the mirror, she said to herself, \u201cWhat I wouldn\u2019t give to be wearing some armor; anything but this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Jex walked over and said, \u201cM\u2019lady, the King requests your presence in the main hall for dinner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I don\u2019t have much of a choice.\u201d Sighing, Kelos said, \u201cI\u2019ll head there now, but first I have to make a stop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course m\u2019lady.\u201d Despite not wearing a dress, to Kelos\u2019 amusement, Jex curtseyed before leaving the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was alone, Kelos couldn\u2019t help but think about Jex\u2019s situation.  She knew he was a somewhat immoral man, having heard stories of his actions in the war, but she knew he didn\u2019t deserve this.  <i>I will find a way to reverse whats being done to you, Jex.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer decision made, Kelos left her chambers and made her way through the halls.

After knocking several times, the door opened to reveal a short made in his mid-40s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could respond, Kelos grabbed him by the throat and shoved him back into the room.  After closing the door, she turned to him and said, \u201cDo you know who I am?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I do.\u201d With a flirtatious glance, Marlin said, \u201cI must say I find your current form most pleasing, m\u2019lord.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI may be a woman, but don\u2019t think I won\u2019t cause you harm.\u201d Realizing her grip on the sorcerer, her voice seething with anger, Kelos said, \u201cI demand to know what you\u2019ve done to my personal guard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean Captain Jex?\u201d pausing, Marlin said, \u201cI asked him if he was willing to do anything to keep you safe; when he said yes, I placed an enchantment on him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomehow I feel becoming a woman wasn\u2019t what he had in mind.\u201d Pacing the room, glancing at the assorted potions and trinkets strewn about, Kelos said, \u201cI demand you reverse it once.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t do that; even if I wanted to.\u201d Pausing, Marlin said, \u201cThe only thing I can do is give him his old memories back; he\u2019ll still be a woman and he\u2019ll still be your new handmaiden, but he\u2019ll remember his old life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t seem like a fair trade.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid that\u2019s all I can do; other than making him more...accepting of his female form.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose if that\u2019s the best you can do.\u201d Taking a breath, Kelos said, \u201cNow if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019ve been told my presence is required for dinner.  As much as I\u2019d prefer not to be seen by Princess Fia, or anyone else, in this form; I\u2019d much rather not anger the King.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI trust you\u2019ll give his request some thought.\u201d Again with the seductive tone, Marlin said, \u201cA woman such as yourself would make a lovely Queen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than let her anger out, Kelos simply left Marlin\u2019s chambers and headed towards the main hall.

The more information she heard from people like Fia or Gisella made her fear for what Arthras had planned for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as they were about to enter the Great Hall, Arthras stopped and turned to Kelos.  Taking her hands in his, he said, \u201cI trust you\u2019ll give careful consideration to my proposal.  You\u2019ll find that  being my Queen is a life filled with happiness.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment Arthras stopped speaking, Kelos started to feel strange.  It was as if her thoughts were no longer her own; gone were her concerns over her safety, having been replaced with thoughts of marrying Arthras.  Sensing something was wrong, Fia walked over and said, \u201cPrincess Orla, are you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s fine, my daughter.\u201d Turning to Kelos, Arthras said, \u201cIsn\u2019t that right, my dear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, my King.\u201d With a smile, still under the King\u2019s spell, Kelos turned to Fia and said, \u201cI\u2019m  finding myself falling for your father.\u201d<br>\r\nConcerned, Fia said, \u201cFather, may I speak with Princess Orla in private?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course.\u201d With a smile, Arthras said, \u201cDon\u2019t be long, my Queen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be with you soon, my King.\u201d To Fia\u2019s surprise, Kelos leaned in a briefly kissed Arthras on the lips.  With a smile, Kelos said, \u201cConsider that a taste of things to come.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to wait any longer, Fia pulled Kelos away from her father; leading her out a nearby door into the garden.  Once they were alone, Fia turned to Kelos and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s gotten into you, Kelos?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing, Fia.\u201d Smiling, Kelos said, \u201cI\u2019m just overwhelmed with love for your father.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t you, Kelos!\u201d shocked, Fia said, \u201cHe\u2019s placed you under some spell; you have to fight it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy should I fight it; the marriage is inevitable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Gisella appeared in the garden.  Seeing Kelos, she said, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy father placed her under some spell; I think he intended to make Kelos fall in love with him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard talk of such a spell.\u201d Pausing, Gisella said, \u201cThere\u2019s only one way to break it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat way is that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA virgin of noble bearing must kiss her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you mad?  I\u2019m not kissing Kelos in his current form; I don\u2019t find the female form appealing in that way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must, m\u2019lady; you're the only one here who can.\u201d Pausing, Gisella said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t Kelos will forever be under your fathers spell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFia was tormented for a moment; wonder what she should do.  After a few moments of indecision, she finally relented.  \u201cOkay fine, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then proceeded to grab Kelos and plant a passionate kiss on her lips.  After a few seconds of nothing happening, Kelos\u2019 eyes bulged out and she broke the kiss.  In shock, no longer under the spell, Kelos said, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy father placed you under a spell that made you fall in love with him.\u201d Blushing, Fia said, \u201cI had to kiss you in order to break it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-It all seemed so surreal; I wasn\u2019t in control but part of me wanted it to continue.\u201d Catching her breath, Kelos said, \u201cIs your father truly this desperate to make me his Queen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt would appear so.\u201d Sighing, Fia said, \u201cUnfortunately for you, you have to continue as if you\u2019re still under the spell.

As the two women walked towards the Great Hall, sensing her discomfort, Fia turned to Kelos and said, \u201cYou\u2019ll do fine; you\u2019re better at acting then you give yourself credit for.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow can you say that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOutside of those of us who know the truth, everyone here thinks you\u2019re really a woman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis whole affair is an affront to my manhood.\u201d Sighing, under her breath, Kelos said, \u201cI came here thinking I was to marry you; not your father.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry; but I\u2019m not attracted to women.\u201d With a smirk, Fia said, \u201cYou\u2019d be out of luck.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up, Fia.\u201d As they entered the Hall, Kelos said, \u201cMaybe I will marry your father; only so I can punish you as your stepmother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Arthras walked over to the two women.  With a smile, he said, \u201cI trust nothing is wrong.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything is fine, my King.\u201d Putting on a fake smile, Kelos said, \u201cI was simply getting to know my stepdaughter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that; I want you to be on good terms.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Arthras led the two into the Hall, Kelos got a chance to look around.  The room was only slightly larger than the Hall in her family\u2019s palace; there were 2 tables on either side of the room with a smaller one overlooking the two.  Kelos realized the smaller one was meant for the Royal Family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking she was getting out of this situation easily, Kelos felt a lump in her throat when Arthras stopped moving.  Turning to address the crowd in the room, he said, \u201cBy now you\u2019ve all heard of my marriage proposal to the beautiful Princess Orla of Grovan.  I trust you\u2019ll welcome her with open arms as she adjusts to her new home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three of them sat down, Kelos took Arthras hand and said, \u201cMy King, why would you announce such a thing when I haven\u2019t agreed to the wedding yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimply a precaution, my beautiful Queen.\u201d With a smile, Arhtras said, \u201cI know you must agree with everything I ask.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Not exactly, you bastard. </i> Fighting to keep herself from blowing her cover, Kelos said, \u201cOf course, my King.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dinner went smoothly, for the most part.  Kelos swore she saw a few of the King\u2019s advisors looking at her with looks of arousal.  She hated how she was having such an effect on the men.  There had been times when she felt she would slip up but thankfully she didn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner was over, Kelos stood up and started to walk away.  She stopped when Arthras said, \u201cWhere are you going, my Queen?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI grow weary, my King; I feel I must go to bed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNonsense, you\u2019ll be joining me in my chambers this evening.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA panicked look formed on both Kelos and Fia\u2019s faces; as neither of them were sure what was going on.

Kelos knew she was trapped; she couldn\u2019t say no without revealing the enchantment was broken and she couldn\u2019t say yes because that would mean being intimate with the King.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Kelos, Fia said, \u201cAre you alright, Princess Orla?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout acknowledging Fia, with no other choice, Kelos turned to Arthras and said\u2026</span></div></div>",

She scurried off to prepare a nightgown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos sighed. Surely there must be a way out of this. Jex was no help in this state, maybe that blasted scribe could do better, assuming Traeven's wizard hadn't changed him as well. She then thought back to Arthras, and barely stopped herself from vomiting, this morning she had been a prince, and now she was a woman and pregnant with that bastard's child? Impossible! There's no way she could accept this. With that a knock on the door interrupted her thoughts. With Jex busy she answered the door herself, to find an old man with a long beard standing outside. \"Marlin.\" Kelos said coldly. \"Come to check on your handiwork with Jex? I can assure you you've turned him into a fine handmaiden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I have other business to attend to tonight,\" Marlin said. \"Might I come in?

Next time you sleep, your body will age ten years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well at least I'll be older than my sister and still first in line for the throne,\" Kelos quipped sarcastically. \"What's the second thing, that I'll give birth to kittens?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure I could arrange that with some research, but no,\" Marlin said. He looked around the room. \"She was a good woman, the queen. She completed Arthras. He was never quite whole since she passed.\" He paused a bit before continuing. \"But I'm just making excuses. There's a question I like to ask myself every now and then, to keep myself grounded. As I'm sure you can imagine, it's easy for a wizard to get lost in his work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't say,\" Kelos replied with a scornful tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't blame you for hating me, I've done some terrible things to you,\" Marlin said. \"Which gets back to that question I like to ask myself. 'Are we the bad guys?' Normally my answer is 'no, of course not The Kingdom of Traevan is righteous as is its king and those who serve him.' Tonight though, my answer was yes. I think it time that changed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What exactly are you proposing?\" Kelos asked skeptically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic that is done is difficult to undo, much like you cannot unbake a cake,\" Marlin said. \"Magic that has yet to work its effects may still be countered.\" He held up a scroll. \"This contains details of the enchantment on you, and its side effects. With it perhaps Xarlot can cure you of it before you sleep.\" He then held up another scroll. \"This one is a teleport scroll. It shall return you and your entourage to Grovan.\" He then handed them both to Kelos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you doing this?\" Kelos asked with surprise as she took the scrolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you why,\" Marlin said. \"Tonight my answer was yes. I wish to change that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Kelos said. She paused to think. \"Arthras will be furious.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, he's already quite mad,\" Marlin said, rubbing his neck. \"I fear it may be in both senses of the word, and this will only add to it. But let me worry about that, I can take care of myself. You go home already.\"</span></div></div>",

Surely the king knows of their involvement.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t much that can be done to Gisella that hasn\u2019t already happened; her life and identity have been taken from her.\u201d Sighing, Marlin said, \u201cAs for the princess; I\u2019ll simply say she isn\u2019t the first Fia, and sadly I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll be the last.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was last year; about a month into the war.\u201d Pausing, Marlin said, \u201cOne of your soldiers was captured trying to sneak into the kingdom.

Although the prince's guards came quickly when they heard the cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards watched the situation unfold, as a strange lightning ran over the prince's skin. It burned without pain, leaving the stunned prince to wonder what was going to happen next. The answer came quickly as his right hand started to tingle and itch. He dropped the scroll in shock and watched as his hand became slimmer and more delicate. He started to scream as the magic progressed up his arm which winnowed down to a mere stick thin, with practically no muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain on seeing the scribe with a handful of scrolls acted drawing his sword and advanced on the scribe, \"Is this curse your work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scribe babbled not being used to being on the sharp end of a sword. \"No, no, no, I swear it. It was the king's idea, to have a selection of disguises, that would allow me or some of his men to go about Arthras's castle unchallenged.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked back to the prince who was now entranced by the changes starting on his other hand. \"I was just explaining to Prince Kelos, that I might be able to help him with information as to how to win Fia's heart, when he snatched that scroll.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain looks between the transforming prince and the scribe. The babbling fool is too cowardly to make up such a lie, and despite loyally serving Prince Kelos, he too knew him to be....  a little impetuous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slid his sword back into it's scabbard, \"Your majesty.\" he turned to the prince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magic was giving the prince a significant cleavage, and the captain had to consciously focus on the prince's face. The prince found his armour to be hanging rather oddly on his transforming body, his arms had also shortened and retreated inside his sleeves. Looking at the ground he saw his leggings hung baggily around, as he had lost at least six inches in height from his legs. His ass however, was bucking the trend, expanding relentlessly it felt, pushing painfully against the unforgiving armour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lightning started to run over his armour now, changing it to softer fabrics. The prince sighed in relief, as the pain from his enlarged ass vanished as the armour there was replaced by a generous skirt. He reached to his crotch already fearing the worst. His hands patted it vainly seeking his cock, but finding only what he feared. A high pitched scream split the night, as the prince fainted dead away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain sighed and lifted the prince back into the carriage. The changes continued as the prince slept on. Apparently this disguise was of a maid. She was blessed with curves in all the right places, her low cut blouse leaving nothing to the imagination. Her deep breathing proved very distracting to both men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a disaster.\" the captain announced to himself. \"I think you'd better tell me more about these disguise scroll, scribe.\" he held his tone even, but there was an undercurrent of anger in his voice.</span></div></div>",

Indulged from birth as only a child of royalty could be, he never learned caution and patience.  Any wrong done by him passed to servants close at hand.  The prince gurgled and sputtered awake too the potion passing his throat spitting some of the elixir out.  \"What are you trying to do poison me?  What foul concoction did you give me?  Captain, why are you not protecting me?\"  Prince Kelos face flush with anger looked strange to the onlookers used to a manly visage now presented with a comely young woman with a sweet voice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took the captain a minute to snap to attention not used to the form that now pressed questions to him.  He spoke to Prince Kelos calmly hoping to ease the tension of the situation.  \"I gave order to the scribe to give you a possible antidote to our current problem.  Time is a luxury we don't have and I thought giving the potion time to work it's magic best.\"  The captain would not shirk any blame that was his to bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrince Kelos suddenly felt a pressure start to build up in different parts of his feminine body.  His hand began to swell and grow.  Then his feet seized in pain as they ripped through his lady shoes.  \u201cWhat the hell is going on?!?  Why aren\u2019t my clothes changing like last time?\u201d Kelos\u2019s eyes bulged as his chest dwindled and torso expanded ripping through the top of her dress.  Muscles began returning to his body but they stopped before they reached their former glory.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe onlookers saw the prince returning to a shadow of his former self.  Toned and fit the prince form no longer imposing or rigidly masculine.  Sitting in the tatters of cloth the voyeurs saw that no bulge where one should reside.  Blood drained from the scribes face at the realization.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, no this can\u2019t be.  Return damn you.

I did tell the captain that there could be unforeseen consequences.  At least it restored you mostly to your male form.

The prince's clothes hung loose on his body without the bulging muscles to fill them out.  He tightened his pants the best he could.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain nodded in approval at the prince acting with  thought and not emotion.  He made it clear to those few in the know must remain tight lipped about this lest the Traeven kingdom use it against them.  They stood on enemy soil that barely tolerated them, best not to give an excuse to them for treacherous action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scribe for his part felt a slight relief that no punishment seemed forth coming.  The fault wasn't truly his but royalty decided that.  He also looked forward to poring through the library in Traeven castle if the prince secured permission.  The prince's appeal of appearance and speech lent him much ability.  Still, King Arthras looked down on the match and distrusted anyone from Grovan.  He might not be easily persuaded to give anything to those he saw as enemies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe carriage soon on its way with the prince pondering how he might best pursue the princess.  The alliance between the two great nations remained secondary to his desire for Fia.  He failed to work out how to get her alone so that he might express his true feelings for her.  When the carriage arrived at the castle a short greeting was given to Kelos. King Arthras had Prince Kelos shown to a room before leaving to take care of other matters.  Kelos felt confident that all went as well as could be expected of the first meeting. <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

His hair had continued to grow and was now just past his shoulders. Shoulders which were also looking somewhat less broad. His waist had also narrowed, while his hips widened. Worst of all, he looked to be nearly 3 inches shorter than before. While still a man where it counted, he would likely pass for a woman if he so desired. \"Scribe!\" he called in his rather feminine voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, your highness?\" Edric responded as he looked up from the book he was reading, and immediately saw the issue. \"The changes are accelerating?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do something!

His body indeed now possessed a feminine shape, and his nipples had grown yet again, this time protruding slightly as tiny mounds formed the beginnings of breasts. The scribe went to work, painting arcane runes on the prince's body. As he finished, they began to glow. Slowly some of the changes began to reverse themselves.

He rummaged around some luggage and recovered a pair of sheers, then passed them to Kelos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least something went right,\" the prince said as he began to cut his own hair. It didn't take him long to trim it into a cute bob cut. \"What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... you did a good job, but that isn't exactly a manly hairstyle,\" Edric replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prince looked into the mirror. \"Why did I do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is a potential of mental change too,\" Edric reminded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently,\" Kelos said. \"I do look cute though.\" He sighed, then trimmed his hair to his normal, short cut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to stay focused, your highness,\" the scribe cautioned. \"My runes won't last very long as it is, but they rely on your will to remain a man. If that fails, your changes will accelerate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand,\" the Kelos said. \"An iron will.\"</span></div></div>",

I can't remember anything after that!\" Kelos exclaimed, clutching her face in horror. \"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ah, memory loss.</i> The scribe thought. <i>This will be a problem.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, you opened one of the scrolls... it seems to have changed your clothes. And only your clothes,\" the scribe repeated to affirm the prince that there was nothing wrong. \"I have no idea why you cannot remember it. Perhaps you were frightened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prince nodded. \"That makes sense,\" she stated. \"But how will I appear before Prince Fia now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to worry, we have some spare clothes,\" the scribe stated as the captain rushed with the gift intended for princess Fia. The dress overflew from his hands. It was one of those gaudy dresses that princesses would wear for balls, decorated with lace all over. The light pink color made it stand out, causing the wearer to look like an innocent soul. It was truly meant for coming-of-age princesses to attract suitors. Kelos held her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A tad bit gaudy,\" she began. \"But... it shall do.\" She stated slowly to not give away the fact that she was fascinated by the dress. The scribe nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We shall wait outside for you to get dressed,\" he stated, hopping off the carriage and motioning the captain to follow him. The captain nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do we do now?\" The captain began, scratching his head. \"Make way for Traevan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you an idiot?\" The scribe spat. \"Don't you realize that we're stuck in a predicament? I only bought us some time. But we cannot just continue our merry way as if though nothing happened. We need help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain slowly processed the scribe's words. \"So... who shall help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already know who,\" the scribe replied. \"I just need to write this letter. Do anything that would delay this trip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" The captain asked, tilting his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not know! Anything.\" The scribe began, before an idea came to his mind. \"Here, use this scroll in front of the carriage. It will turn the ground into a viscous mud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But wouldn't the carriage fall through and get stuck?\" The captain said, inquiringly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's exactly what we want! Now get a move on it!\" The scribe stated as he began to write the letter. In it, he included everything: how he needed help, how the carriage got stuck, and every detail of Prince Kelos' curse. Nodding to himself, he said as he finished it, \"That shall do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a screeching sound was heard as the carriage fell through the ground, its front wheel inevitably getting stuck halfway through the mud. Kelos, hearing the sound, peeks out of the carriage, not daring to ruin her newly found dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" She called out the scribe. \"What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My apologies,\" the scribe began, \"It seems that the carriage got stuck in the mud. We will not be able to continue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Kelos exclaimed, eyes bulging out. \"But I am supposed to see Prince Fia. Soon! Whatever shall we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not worry. I have written a letter, asking for help. I had foreseen that this would happen.\" He stretched out the hand with the letter, showing it to the princess before it quickly vanished before her eyes, warping through space. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To whom did you send the letter?\" Kelos asked inquisitively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, a princess is shocked as a letter suddenly appears in her hand.

She had crawled over to the very edge of the bed.  Her eyes moved away as she caught the captain's glance.  She had hastily gathered the loose top of her dress to cover her breasts.  She had failed to cover more than half of the bare flesh that seemed to spill out her now tiny hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain Britain guested over to the cowering figure with his sword.  \"Does this timid creature look like someone who would take a strange man to a dark corner?

Especially one as well equipped and staffed as yours.\"  The shrewd tavern owner's grin grew wider.  \"I'm sure you can spare a few coins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain Britain's eyes narrowed.

The captain was not happy that he had to give up more than half of the remaining funds for the journey in order to satisfy the tavern owner but it was far preferable to drawing any more attention to their situation than was absolutely necessary.  The rest of his men seemed to be thoroughly enjoying their time off the road.  He heard more than a few groans when he informed them to be prepared to leave at daybreak.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly once he had made all of his own preparations to leave did he think to check in on the scribe and Kelos.  He opened to door to the room they had retired to only to be shocked once more.  The former prince and the scribe were locked together in an embrace, one of her arms was draped around his neck and her other hand was firmly grabbing his cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scribe! What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She just threw herself at me now,\" he exclaimed as he tried to squirm out of the embrace.  \"The scroll's magic appears to be far more powerful than even I had imagined.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain was suspicious but he knew the scribe well enough to know he was an honest man.

Little trace of Prince Kelos remained in her mannerisms, or behaviour, she still recalled Kelos, but upon questioning, it was clear 'he' was little more than a memory in Cally's story. The captain and Scribe exchanged worried looks. The former prince looked to have suffered doubly from the magic, the first transforming him into ... well... her. The second scroll burying Kelos deeper, as it boosted Cally's charms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe combination had extended Kelos' stay as Cally, and built on the Prince's love of tavern wenches, and low-born ladies impressed with an eager prince. Looking over the bound figure wriggling on the bed, Cally's arms bound behind her back, the rope around her middle acting like a second corset gave her an even more exaggerated figure. Her over-lush charms threatening to fall out of her bodice as she squirmed, and beneath that the black skirt billowing out to those wide hips, and too firm, too full ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly the threat of gagging her kept her from screaming the tavern down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scribe's hand snapping to those hips, as she almost rolled from the bed to the floor. A shocked look from the captain at his handling of their royal charge, falling into silence. He pushed her back towards the middle of the bed, away from the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suspect that Cally is suffering from Kelos' favours.\" he grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's become the tavern wench he wanted to bed. Libidinous, busty and a s<i>lu</i>.....\" he stopped himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point, surely.... Cally would be restored, and this conversation might be reported to the king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked between the bound woman, and the Captain an idea clear in his mind. An option he didn't want to raise clearly needing to be spoken. The captain eager to hear the idea, helped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't stay here, until he is restored.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't leave her here alone, and continue to the castle... if we return to find a pregnant wench our funerals would be assured.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is as wilful as before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scribe nodded at each point. Captain Britain seeing the idea getting nearer to being spoken, nodded for the scribe to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have gold... and we have a wilful woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the captain's turn to silently nod for the scribe to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We continue on and present the king's offer, without Kelos, and Cally...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked hesistantly to the bound woman, \"Currently, she's not Prince Kelos.\" the captain repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We leave Cally in a nunnery, as a novice until we can reclaim her later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCally's chest swelled as she readied herself to scream the tavern down. Two callused male hands leaping to cover her mouth, the scribe landed atop her, driving the air from her lungs in hiss that disturbed no-one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gag was fashioned, and tugged into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A nunnery?\" The captain asked, doubting that Cally could pass as someone interested in any religious order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question didn't need any clarification for the scribe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's little more than a prison for troublesome women, and the strict discipline will help, I'm sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a scribe he was friendly with several monks, some of whom were less than holy, but wrote with a good hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a nunnery along the way, well, only a short detour and we can keep the peace between our countries, and the good lady Cally's virtue intact.

However, she noticed something strange as she got to the fall of man. God was instructing the serpent to tell Eve of the fruit? This was not how the story went!

Each twitch of the mother superior's tail sent another wave throughout her body.

But that turns into a mounting roar of approval as the pair gently put an arm around each others' waist. As they start synchronising their swaying hips. The roars turn into cheers, and the loud stamping of boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head, he shares a look of disbelief with the open-mouthed scribe. \"We might well be escorting a princess come the morning if she keeps up this behaviour.\" He mutters into his beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if he does, I doubt it'll be our worry. He'll have our heads on pikes, if we return with a slut of a barmaid instead of his son.\" The scribe answered in a duller, slightly tipsy tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least they're away from the customers.\" He growled, hoping they stayed in the kitchen as long as possible. The captain already eyeing up the table. Fairly sure he could defeat them without too much risk. However, there would be consequences for what would be a bloody showdown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping an eye on them, he knew the night was going to be a lot of work. His eyes narrowed, and he started to rise from his seat as a suspicion grew in his mind. Cally was taking too long. As he reached his feet, the kitchen door swung wide, opening with a creak the drew every eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was the figure strutting proudly out that kept their attention. The barmaid that Kelos had kissed as Cally swept into the room. A bounce in her bust, and a sway to her hips. She was breathtaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/11/4b/61/114b61ad1eb1ded0eff3ddbc76f9bc53.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/11/4b/61/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Things women do for tips...\" he muttered to the scribe in amusement, openly enjoying the wanton display as she swiveled back into service, clearing and cleaning tables, with a calculated dip to display even further her already very visible bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA leer coming to his lips as he spotted the next girl emerge. A suede corset accentuating her tiny waist, making her hips look wider and her bust awe-inspiring!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/00/ce/3b/00ce3bf66d3d330ca326b7adea65aac4.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/00/ce/3b/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the captain's gaze reached her face, he sprayed the mouthful of beer over the scribe. He recognised Cally, who was trying to outjiggle the other girl, and had the goods to do it! She moved with a more fluid grace, tuned from years of sword training, and adapted for her new hips. She shone with a sensual elegance, while her competition looked crass and obvious... Not that any of the customers were objecting.</span></div></div>",

If a leering bunch of drunks could be described so respectfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping an arm around her waist, he lifts her from her feet. A shriek of delight as a man takes charge of her Cally is more gigglish and excited than she's been the entire evening. Cally wasn't heavy, but her giggling stopped, as she was hoisted onto his shoulders. Breath driven from her lungs, she went from giggling to outraged in a single stolen breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKicking futilely, and her arms beating at the soldier's back the assault was futile. Only the captain's steadying hand sinking into her delightfully full rump held her struggling body in place. A new arrival was all that spared the tavern door from being kicked off it's hinges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new arrival barely taking in the sight, before the soldier swept past him.

Sitting on the edge of the water trough, the sound of hand on arse-cheek, was only interrupted with the sound of splashing, as he dunked her head in the water trough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA steady, but low litany of \"<i>Sorry Sire's</i>\", spilled from the captain's lips as he administered the corporal punishment to Cally's ass.

It took everything she had to remain in control and not march right to them demanding to know what they were talking about in her back. Even more so, when one of the other wenches demand that she take a couple more mugs of the insipid ale to another table full of those sweaty, fat, filthy commoners. It is a fact that she has never been so thoroughly humiliated in her life!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she fumes and walk around, fending off uncalled personal touches and the need to vomit in disgust and humiliation. Captain Britain, politely listened to Ben the owner of the establishment. The man seemed only too eager to offer them good prices and all the rooms to accommodate the whole envoy. But of course, in these lands, suspicious characters were nary rare and aside from keeping a simple watchful eye, he didn't feel the need to really push investigation further on the subject. Throwing a glance back at the prince, and taking a sip of the served drinks. He instead moved closer to the scribe, to inquire more about the spell placed on the prince .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos threw a silver piece in the air and caught it before placing it in a pouch of her apron. She would not go so far as saying she felt proud, but she was getting a knack for doing the tasks she was asked a little more easily and faster, and with a fake smile, a little giggle, she had noticed that the tips she were given were a little more substantial. A palmy sum for a noble like her, but it was better then just the butt pinching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritain was frustrated at the lack of progress, he had been sitting with the scribe for what felt like ages, but couldn't have been more then an hour or two. But between the people asking for portraits, the raucousness of the tavern and the long roundabout ways the scribe was using to explain things. He didn't feel like he'd made a lick of advance in understanding what he had asked the scholar. And took another sip of the ale that had been offered by one of Ben's girl. A pretty flirtatious thing that had smiled and made small talk, even sitting on his lap. He looked around quickly for the prince, but only caught a glimpse of her walking around. He figured that her no longer stomping everywhere was progress and returned to the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKallios was giggling as one of the barmaids recounted a most spectacular evening that had happened a couple months ago when one of the dukes of the kingdom had set foot in the tavern, all tall and mighty and demanding everything at a drop of a hat, like the world was his. Despite their best efforts and through a series of clumsy errors, the duke had stormed off all offended, and had all but forgotten most of his possessions in his room, perhaps having thought one of his many servants would have picked them off, whilst they instead had all followed him away in a panic. By the barmaid's words. Like chicken with their head freshly cut off! Who knew that low-born could have such enticing stories!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the seventh time already that the girls had served captain Britain and the scribe fresh mug of the ale. But they had been in such heated conversations that counting and precautions had started to fall to the leeway. The captain that had barely been able to understand the scribe's words had definitively a hundred times more issues with it now. He had only been educated in martial arts, hand to hand combat, self defence, sword fight and bow. The usual things. And certainly not things as complicated as magical arts!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCallio moved around the tables with a certain grace and feminine poise as she continued to serve the tavern's many raucous patrons. Gossiping with the other girls when she could, serving the men when asked. The earlier anger and tempest all but forgotten, for a much more pleasant, perhaps even servile attitude. She felt like something was amiss, with the men she was servicing, but she could not recall the earlier disgust either. And her mind ground itself to a halt for the tenth time in a short order, as a resounding fleshy swat was heard. She shivered lightly in pleasure at the large masculine paw of a hand that was resting on her ass after one of her patrons spanked her, giggling and going to get the requested roast from the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBritain, his men and scribe were all at a new table as they had rejoined together, a collection of mugs taking all the space on the table and some. The men were surrounded by many of the barmaids, laughing and singing drunkenly. The conversation about what was going on with the prince, the potential effect of prolonged immersions in a submissive role, as well as the danger of the prince having sex as a woman. Long pushed aside and forgotten for the evening of a lifetime!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCally was one of the most popular girl in Ben's tavern and by far, and the well endowed girl had certainly taken very well to be taught by his girls thought the innkeeper to himself. The party that was going right now and the additional men that had come from the village was a testament to it. He watched her as she giggled and flirted and used her ample charms on the patrons for a couple silvers, then turned to the men that she had been with, partying and drunk. Perhaps it was time to talk to Cally about his other job as the tenant of this area's brothel. They were far away, in a desolate place of the kingdom and the men did occasionally get lonely afterall.</span></div></div>",

He had to have her, to add her to his girls. With it getting so late, he motioned for his girls to start bringing clients to the rooms upstairs, and then waved Cally closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cally, come here lass\" He said in his enthusiastic, but gruff voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir?\" She answered the call with heed, calling him sir with all the reverence of a noble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waited until she was closer and then softly waved her to the backstore. Amidst the provisions, he softly placed his hands on her shoulders and made her sit down on the stacks of potatoes. She looked up at him, with a hint of wonder but no hint of worry. The mix of the evening toll on her legs and the docile rewiring of her brain, leaving her unable to protest the gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I needed to talk to you, I have been very genuinely impressed with your work tonight\" He began<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you sir!\" She answered readily, a small swell of pride at the compliment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really noticed how well liked you were with the men and how friendly you were with my girls...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it was nothing milord\" She replied sheepish, as the servant was unused to such treatment<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen smiled to himself, since it was going so good and the girl only seemed so eager to please. He lowered one hand and softly cupped one of her heavy breasts through the maid dress, eliciting a little squeal of surprise from her. Before he went down her svelte waist and to her rolling hips. Impressed with her figure, he allowed himself a little chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very very good\" He commented to himself, more then anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sir?\" She said, still looking up at him, slightly confused and embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached into his heavy apron and took out a gold coin as he straightened up and let go of her, showing the coin up to her, with a pleasant smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw how happy you were with those silver coins you were making at the tables... I bet you're not making much money as one of the servant in the court... do you?\" He asked plainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N...no sir, not much\" She replied, embarrassed again. Being a low born commoner maid, she could not aspire to making much of any fortune at all. Even the royal maids were not royal themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if I tell you, that you could make one of these? For each time you 'help' my girls with their last task of the night?\" He said softly, pacing himself and playing with the gold coin between his fingers. Before putting it down in the middle of her open palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How....?\" She said meekly, staring at the gold coin in her hand<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just help my girls, find the patrons that are not too drunk... Get them to a room upstairs, and then do everything they want to do, to make sure they are pleased and want to come back... You do want to make sure all of my patrons are satisfied with your work...don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finished, in more of a commanding tone then a suggesting one. The servant maid looked back at him like a deer caught by surprise by an arrow whizzing right next to it.</span></div></div>",

Things had gone perfectly over, the abundantly curvy lass had been so easy to convince, if she was so eager to please, maybe he could outright buy her from the envoy she was travelling with. Perhaps even with the money she'd made him, pleasing the men. Wouldn't that be a thing! He laughed a little more and started to move back toward his bar, he didn't want to leave the main room unattended for too long, lest some of the more brash villagers may try to take from him behind his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCally watched the tavern's master leave the storeroom with wide eyes, her plentiful rump still sat on top of a crate full of unwashed potatoes. She had one hand raised to her chest, as her heart beat a thousand pulses a minute, she kept staring from the gold coin to the rough curtains separating her from the tavern and back. Deep down, she had the feeling that something was going extremely wrong, but an evening of playing the docile maid had left her unable to recall what. Her true mind completely obscured to her by the disguise. Why was the promise of one single gold coin for each time she'd help the tavern's girls, made her so excited, she couldn't tell. As a low born commoner, in the maid household of the castle, her wages didn't amount to much, specially with clothes, bed and food covered for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, as if coming to an important decision, Cally pocketed the gold coin into her apron with the other silvers she'd accumulated so far. The weighty clink of metal giving her an excited little shiver. It wasn't just about all the money she could help herself to, at any rates. She'd become so servile, that in her mind she genuinely wished to please his patrons, to have her work praised is a bliss all of its own after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up and softly patted her dress clean from the earth and dust of the crates, making sure her uniform was on right. She then moved back to the main room, with a new mission on her mind. In all of her years working at the castle, she'd never serviced any men in such manners and felt like she was rightfully nervous of being able to please any man. But with her nerves steeled and a drive born out of the desire to serve. She moved back to the tables of the tavern, moving along drunks, partying and singing men. She would continue to serve them ale and food, watching the other girls work, trying to ascertain how best to pull one of the patrons up the stairs with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple minutes later and Cally was half draped over the broad chest of a burly villager, his body was strong with muscles born of hard labor, his skin wasn't too sunburnt and he was fair of visage, neither too old or too young, just a small scar on the jaw. The lumberjack was holding her close and slowly caressing her round ass, a nice change from all the abuse and slaps it had received through the night. Cally herself was laughing at his words, his humor. It was a little more rough around the edges then she was used to in the castle, but nothing her ears hadn't heard some of the chefs uses before. More importantly, he was neither too drunk to move, nor violent and seemed quite interested in spending a little more quality time with her, in privates from prying eyes. Cally found herself also wrapped up in the moment and getting a little excited at the prospect of playing around with this muscular piece of a man, wondering idly why the men around the castles were never trying to court her, while this stranger found it so easy to compliment her looks and roam his hands over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long and with a complicit air of eagerness, Cally was pulling the man along with her, pulling on his arm and hand as she guided them upstairs. She didn't give the soldiers, the scribe of the captain a second glance, and the partying men didn't pay her any mind either. Giggling, she guided the villager deeper into the inn part of the tavern, now that they were both upstairs, they could plainly hear the other girls having sex with some of the earlier patrons. Blushing and flustered, Cally looked back at the man and saw his mixed expression, somewhere between embarrassment and carnal hunger, a slight red to his cheeks making her laugh softly but encouragingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe peered around and finally found an empty room, quickly ushering the man in after herself. She watched as he went to one of the corner and placed his meager possessions down, boots, belt and pouch. She moved to the single desk in the small bare room and grabbed the candle there, going back to the hall to use one of the oil lanterns mounted on the wall to lit it up. When she came back inside, a small shiver of pleasure went down her spine as he stood before her shirtless, his muscles bound torso making her want to fan herself lightly. She caught herself and closed the door behind her, locking the simple handle's mechanism to prevent anyone from barging inside and placed their now sole source of lighting back on the desk she took it from.</span></div></div>",

He start to lavish her soft neck, caressing her lightly as he kiss her smooth flesh. Commenting about how good her skin and her hair scent to him, as she tries to not just moan and melt against him. She's never done anything like this, and she feels a little faint as her heart race again. She softly caress and hold him at the hips, lightly grinding her full butt against him, as she feel him stir and harden. His hand travel up and meet her breasts, carefully cupping and caressing their weighty size. She's gifted like usually only pregnant women are, but her bosom enjoy the firm ripeness of youth. He murmur approval, which she drinks in quite happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggle softly, starting to feel a lot more inclined to continue what's happening as she feel less and less nervous and insecure, the disguise spell still influencing her in subtle ways. Making her more natural, perfect at her tasks, whatever they may be. She feel his hands leave her fine bust and move to her neck as he kiss up her head a bit, soon he's untying her apron from her and it fall off of her and to the floor with the metallic clinks of all her coins. He doesn't stop there, undoing the soft ties of her top, loosening the ties of her skirting. Before long her heavy wench dress fall down to the floor to reveal her underwear, exposing much of her soft supple flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe caress her longingly and then turn her around, pulling her into a soft embrace as he tilt her chin up and lean in for a kiss, soft at first, then more eager and hungry. Quickly escalating into a full on deep kiss, his tongue darting across her lips, enticing her to open her mouth. He firmly plunge his tongue into her mouth as soon as her lips part slightly, pushing against her warm wet tongue in dominance and exploring her small mouth. She's literally breathless as he kiss her like she's only known about from finding some of the older unwed maid's randy adult novels, not that she'd complain as it leave her aroused beyond beliefs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he kisses her busily, his hands move along her body on a leisure cruise. He take his time to enjoy the abundant curves of her ass, the small swell of her juicy hips and thighs. Up her back and caressing her luxuriant dark locks flowing down her small back, he grins at the eagerness with which she kiss him back and the small shivers of her excited body, Her thick nipples, clear against the soft material of her white undergarments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbeit not the man that has bedded the most women in his life, around these parts, he's fairly competent as he untie the simple corset holding up her bust and let it join up with her dress. He unhook her garters from her stockings and help her out of the rest of her simple clothes. Once nude, he pull her up to himself by her ample derriere for another deep kiss, the feeling of her naked warm and soft body, of her huge breasts and hard nipples against his chest making him shiver in trepidation just as much as it does her. He help her to sit down on the bare thread mattress provided by the inn and quickly hurry out of what's left of his own clothes. Tossing them to the rest of his belonging, before climbing to bed with the young lass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCally could hardly believe how fast things had moved, she'd decided less then an hour ago to help the tavern girls with their task. She was a virgin, but here she was on this ratty little bed and completely nude with a stranger. her nudity was embarrassing to her, exposing her too large breasts with her thick nipples and areolas, her juicy creamy body with her wide rump and hairy snatch. She hardly felt appropriate despite how feminine and completely enrapturing she really was. Yet, as she looked up to him, she could only hear her own rapidly beating heart and excited breathes. She felt his strong hands on her frail shoulders and allowed herself to be pushed down on her back, he was kissing her yet again, squashing her under his powerful and masculine body. This time, managing to elicit a womanly moan of sheer desires out of her. He wasn't too rough on her, which she appreciated as he took his sweet time caressing her, making sure she was ready. She allowed him to spread her legs, lifting up her knees to expose her most intimates of secret gardens. Her breath catching in her throat in a light squeal as his thick shaft started to pierce up her maidenhood. She shivered from an unknown pain she couldn't describe, a trickle of blood tainting his manhood from her pierced hymen, the walls of her inner most sensitive region contracting against the intrusive phallus, for the first time of her entire life. She swayed and stared up at the wall as the sensations wracked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he started to move, slowly pulling back and despite the pain, she'd found herself trying to squeeze on his rod and keep it inside. He let out a soft grunt of effort and thrust into her even harder and deeper then before, deeper then her mind could comprehend. He caressed her legs softly as he did it again, pulling back slowly and carefully, before slamming inside her, wracking her body and jolting it with a duality of pain and pleasure. She almost question why, but he start to kiss her again, devouring all questions and thoughts themselves. As he continue to roll his hips, to pull and push. She can't describe the sensations of pains ebbing away to let more space for the pleasure and bliss, a warmth spreading from her lower belly where he's taking her, slowly warming the whole of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe find herself eager for more, leaning in to kiss him as deeply and passionately as him is doing to her. Her hands softly holding his back tenderly as she finds herself moaning out into the lip-lock kissing. He's now lodging himself as deeply as he'll go, each thrust making her feel his shaft to the hilt, and he's only beginning to move faster, increasing the pace of his pounding. The initial warmth becomes like a fire that ripples across her being, the wet heat rumbling her stomach, making her breasts feel heavier and more sensitive. Jolts of pure bliss moving up and down her spine each time her nipples brush against his chest, as well as when his cock grind against her clitoris when he roll his hips, like bolts of lightning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's flush with heat and sweat, her cheeks red and her tongue lolling softly as he pause his kisses and start to lavish her neck again, down to her shoulders he lick and nibble. His hands caressing her hips and her perfect bubble butt, making her moan even more with more heed and passions, raising in intensity with each further hair raising pleasurable wave overtaking her body with each plunge that he take into her. The pleasure is incredible and she feels like she's going to peak and orgasm any second now. Her cunt awash with love juices as he keeps on pounding her for all she's worth.

Cally is breathing faster and shorter, out of breath from the bliss wracking her whole senses of self, her body giving powerful shivers and her spine sizzling with the jolts. Her mind is hanging perilously close to succumbing and exploding into thousands of pieces of glass. And then she feels a flare of molten lava erupt into her lower body as he grunt loudly, his spunk filling her womb to capacity in powerful burst. Allowing the golden waves of her own climax to be unleashed on her right afterward, painting everything white and making her see stars! Her eyes are wide, but she doesn't see, something in her cracking irreversibly, giving out as she creams herself, howling in a primal moan of orgasm in the darkness of the night.</span></div></div>",

He also knew the various comings and goings, and was discreet enough to say nothing. A prince was expected to sew wild oats after all. Although his father would never hear from Sean how the Prince had fucked a castle maid in the royal throne. Her legs spread wide, hooked over the arms of the throne. He wasn't sure Kelos had noticed him arrive or leave, other matters were holding his attention. His hands roaming all over the girls body, as he tickled and teased her, at the same time trying to keep her shrieks of joy from getting too loud. It had certainly left an impression in Sean's mind. The Prince had a natural gift for pleasing the ladies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos nudged him, \"So is she ...\" he cupped his hands over an imaginary bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scribe was the only one who had actually seen Princess Fia, in the flesh. The truth was, Fia wasn't the most curvaceous of girls. But she was equally far from being boyish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean flushed, as he tried to work out how to break the news to the prince. He didn't want to lie to him, but he didn't expect Kelos to be shy about passing on the scribe's description to Fia in her turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She has... she has the necessary curves, sire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still I'd imagine you have the necessary magic to enhance her physique should that be needed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean's speciality was indeed in body magic. Enchantments to transform or enhance. His magic served as prisons for a number of rapists. Serving a life sentence working in brothels as mute girls. Certain of the Cavalry were serving his king too. Although, they usually had their minds wiped or simplified. It send a shudder down his spine when he watched their eyes transform. The sparkle of humanity flicker and fade, as a dumb animal mentality replaced their individual nature. He had the final say on whether a person was transfigured, or dealt with by more mundane means.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would certainly be a pleasure if he could use his magic to enhance. To strengthen the bonds between the two kingdoms. The prospect of a long peace and a time of prosperity were what encouraged him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos' tongue darted out, licking his suddenly dry lips. Apparently he was enjoying his own thoughts too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps a potion to make her more biddable. I don't want a shrew for a wife.\" he said with a snort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean knew exactly what he wanted. The prince was simple in his needs. \"He wanted a whore in the bedroom, a whore in the throne room, and whore in the kitchen, and to not object when he whored around with other women.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe truth of the matter was, it was several years since even he'd seen the Princess, so perhaps she had blossomed in the intervening years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe yellow scroll kept bouncing against Prince Kelos' thigh, as the carriage jostled its way along the uneven road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe picked it up.</span></div></div>",

This also drew together some other changes as her skin settled into a fresh alignment. His face now lacked his rugged chin, and manly lines. His eyes were deep set and very wide, giving her an innocent... naive look. His nose had shrunk down to a cute little nub. But the most damning change was his mouth. It was narrow now. Much narrower, although his lips had gone in the opposite direction. She looked like she had a permanent pout on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It....

He looks unsettled, you see it start to swell and expand, rounding out. His hands push back with all their energy, but it has no effect. The prince continues his transformation into his dream woman. A truly bed-able woman. Busty, Curvy, Petite, and wanton. The prince is straining to burst the seams of his clothes. Snatching the Captain's dagger, he cuts his own belt off. It slides to the floor with serpentine grace. But the stitching on his breeches gives way with a long, loud rip, as his new ass is now on display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe look of fear on the prince's face, and the position of his hands tells you that Kelos is no longer a prince.

Sean... do what you can...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gestures with trembling hands to her whole body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The physical changes appear to be over....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That a good thing.... <i>wight</i>...\" her voice trembles in fear, making it sound even more feminine and scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to shake your head, and stop before you reveal too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After the physical changes, the magic moves on to the mental changes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos' face falls, \"Will... I .... Will I still be me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lips tremble, and her mouth is slightly open. She looks like she's begging for a cock to suck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It won't erase your memories....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe claps her hands excitedly, like a little girl at a seeing a princess dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou have to continue, \".... however, it will affect everything you do, say and think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But.. I'll still be me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sire... My Lord... ma'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos gives a squeal, at being addressed as <i>Ma'am</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I. am. still. a. pwince.\" she puts her hands on her hips to emphasise her determination. But the quaver in her voice, and the lisp are undermining her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain chips in, \"Ma'am... sire... at the moment, you lack certain princely features, so perhaps you should consider this as a disguise... a chance to act as a spy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did say .... I did try to warn you... the scroll was intended as a disguise ... a chance for a radical change, and to allow you to escape if things went badly...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's biting her lower lip, as she talks, and that's doing interesting things to Sean's libido, and an erection starts to swell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What ... What should I do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain shoots you a look. \"You need a new name, and identity, ma'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGritting your teeth you continue, \"This is one of the first mental changes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like your women to be submissive, and ask before acting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! I just wanted them to be wespectful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean didn't argue the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you should consider this a good thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weally, and why is that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prince Kelos wasn't known for picking the smartest of girls either. Busty, submissive, dumb and wanton.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos flinched, previously he had admitted this, and dismissed it as a royal freedom. Now it took on a whole new meaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that why we packed women's clothes.\" The captain asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean gave a curt nod, \"Hmmm, yes. I think it's time....

Slimmer, and smaller overall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a disguise scroll.\" Sean rushed the words out, \"Your father wanted to ensure you could escape, should negotiations go badly...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll give you a prefect disguise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Disguise...\" The prince asked, the captain also eager for the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's your father's joke...\" Sean started uneasily. \"It'll disguise you as a woman... as your ideal woman...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scroll was already going to work, the effects visible to all, and obviously felt by Prince Kelos. His starched military uniform was unravelling in a way that could only be magic. The threads unweaving themselves, and straining to fly apart. As they managed that, the seams surrendered. The threads flew into the air, turning briefly to dust, before becoming smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prince's hands slapped over the sleeves of his uniform, as if trying to beat out a fire. But the magic was unaffected by his efforts. If anything adding to the disintegration of his uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey revealed slender arms, lacking the muscle tone, of a skilled swordsman, and the squirming in his seat, he realised that his boots were vanishing too. Slapping at the progress of the magic up his trousers, his legs were revealed as silky smooth, and femininely round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMortified, Kelos felt his body change beneath the decomposing clothes. Already his chest was rounder, and fuller beneath his dress shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shriek, too high for a man. Kelos' hands snapped to his crotch. The fumbling digits desperately hunting for 'Little Kelos' beneath the trousers. His feverish scrabbling getting more and more desperate, with each moment. Until with a heaving sob, his fingers went limp in his lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strain of the wider hips drawing the trousers tight. Nobody could deny that the Prince was fully female. She went as limp and unresisting as her fingers as the uniform continued to crumble apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps a dignity sparing hope of his father. But, as the last of the uniform turned to dust, a dark cloud surrounded Kelos. A cough came from the cloud. It was womanly, and as the captain wafted away the cloud, the prince was revealed once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, she was dressed to suit her body. A simple robe wrapped around her body. Her cleavage on display, and the robe short enough that her bare legs were revealed too. A shaking hand rose to her head as if she were battling with this new reality. Her fingers touched and paused as they discovered the wave of long dark hair cascading down her spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c7/d9/38/c7d938112c0709f998dd2ce128b9e345.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c7/d9/38/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....

Kelos tried to put as much authority into her bearing as she could. Straightening her shoulders, and looking directly at her captain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/88/45/80/884580920c336e1b82d26ffcbe2f0787.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/88/45/80/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut whatever words she was going to speak. Whether rousing speech, or craven request. A look of uncertainty crossed her face, as if her stomach were unsettled she looked terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... NO.... NO!\" Her voice rising in panic as she started to quake once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas Prince Kelos' taste in women was about to rebound on the former prince. With an eye catching ripple, Kelos' bust suddenly surged forward. She was the most blessed woman any of them had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/8e/94/f5/8e94f53cce8aa6dff0673e8abec79a94.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/8e/94/f5/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis attempt at authority now looking like pouting pride in her sultry body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still P<i>w</i>ince Kelos.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe frowned at her own lisp, \"We must <i>w</i>et<i>w</i>eat, home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/23/42/2f/23422f5a3376879af2722b7bed60f8e0.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/23/42/2f/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnwilling to talk further, she sat back down.

Looking as you currently do, you cannot go by your real name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then perhaps my guards should be women too.\" Kelos said, with a pout on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prince Kelos' hand is still part of the negotiations for Fia, but you will have to act some other part.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could be Grovan's best delegate, or Kelos' most trusted servant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis lips thinned, and grew pale, at the idea of playing a servant.

The prince indulged so many desires that for Sean were just fantasies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his horror, the changes happened as with the prince. Perhaps a little more rapidly for the Scribe. Her unspoken fantasies stoked by the recent events were driving Sean's changes. In moments, she was bound tightly in a dress that left nothing to the imagination. Thrusting a disconcerting set of boobs high and proud. They caught the edge of Sean's vision, with every supple movement. Given their size, and support they were very mobile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/cc/4f/56/cc4f5633479ddb42ba3594da50e2ca4f.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/cc/4f/56/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMortified to be so blessed, Sean avoided meeting Lady Nahid's gaze, sure that her own transformation amply showed her admiration for Kelos' new form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStitches popped, as seams burst and reassembled.

Enjoying their questions, their uncertainty. Belinda knew the prince had preferred bimbos, and those impressed by his title.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear the spell, extended to mental changes as well as the purely physical. Cursing herself, she should've known the impetuous prince would become an equally rash young woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelinda thought that at least he'd kept his mind intact. Mentally, reciting the alphabet, and spelling words to herself. Her lips moved, cutely, but at least she could still read, write and spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doubted the prince, while never a dedicated student was probably illiterate now.</span></div></div>",

Belinda/Sean didn't want to be too heavy handed about the prince's taste for low and lusty women. Though, she was keeping an eye out for any further degrading of Kelos' former faculties.

The passage of foreign soldiers, and a rich carriage causing people to draw back and mutter. It was unsettling, and as Belinda thought about closing out the ignorant words of the villagers. Their thoughts poorly informed, she settled back in her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it was Nahid who caught her attention as the carriage passed through. She seemed fascinated by the villagers. One in  particular, the scribe looking from her former master, to where she was looking and back again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was impossible to deny, she was ogling the blacksmith. His sweaty body, covered in only a stiff leather apron, his muscular arms black with soot, and streaked with effort. As he tipped a bucket of water over himself, Belinda realised how fascinated she was by the sight, as it fired up her imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back to Nahid, she sees the Lady fidgetting in her seat. Obviously agitated, her tongue darts out, moistening her lips, as she watches. Lust clear in her expression, as if she were hypnotised by the vision of masculinity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe castle walls loomed, casting them all into shadow. Belinda realising the village wasn't separate from the castle, instead it surrounded it. The shadow caused the carriage to dull, and chill. Lady Nahid was clearly still thinking about the blacksmith, as the carriage reined in, and stopped in the courtyard of the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey'd arrived!</span></div></div>",

When the second scroll wore off, you would remain a woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Given that I'm soon to be married, I'll make sure to avoid that,\" Kelos replied. \"Though couldn't someone use a scroll, then another scroll, then a third scroll to turn back to normal, then a fourth to lock that as their form again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose it's possible, but magic can stack in unpredictable ways. You may find yourself as some grotesque mixture of the various forms,\" the scribe warned.</span></div></div>",

Use one.\" Kelos repeated. \"I don't care which.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scribe sighed. \"Very well your highness.\" He began to look through the scrolls, carefully evaluating which to use. \"No, that one will last too long, that one would turn me into a cup of water, that one would turn me into the Prince.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" Kelos asked impatiently. \"Just pick one already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apologies, your highness, but it would hardly do for me to pick the one that would turn the user into you, Princess Fia, or some other important figure for a length of time,\" the scribe replied, as he continued to go through the scrolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a point there,\" Kelos replied, though he tapped his foot impatiently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This one will do,\" the scribe said. He held up a black scroll with white and brown trim. \"It will turn the user into a maid with Castle Traevan's uniform for half an hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why so short?\" Kelos asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This one is just for sneaking past guards,\" the scribe explained. \"It might be short lived, but I believe it will be the most illustrative. This one changes the user's clothes. Most of the longer lasting ones just change the user's body.\" The scribe opened the scroll, and a flash of light filled the carriage. When it cleared, a young, though somewhat stocky and plain looking girl with brown hair in a maid outfit was sitting across from Kelos. \"There,\" the scribe said in her now feminine voice. \"For the next half hour, I'll be stuck like this. Satisfied with their effects, your highness?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it's quite impressive, though why such a plain girl?\" Kelos asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said, this is to slip past guards. So a plain girl who doesn't stand out and will be harder for the guards to describe in detail was ideal for it,\" the scribe explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that certainly makes sense,\" Kelos replied. \"Too attractive and the guards might hold you up with flirting too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly,\" the scribe replied.</span></div></div>",

Kelos watched very closely as the scribe subconsciously played with the hem of the maid outfit's skirt giving Kelos a very nice up skirt shot.  Sean the scribe eventually noticed Kelos licking his lips while looking at him and felt his face flush, \"Well, that's enough magic for the day, I'll just put these up and wait for the thirty minute maid spell to finish up.\"  Sean tried to reach for the scrolls to put them up but Kelos grabbed his feminine arm.  \"No need to do that, there is fun to be had.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean wanted to jump out of the carriage but all he could do was stutter, \"But but sir.  My liege.  I will turn back to normal in just a few minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but if you use another scroll this becomes your new form correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir please.  I don't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos smiled, \"Oh my sweet little scribe.  As your prince I think I have earned the right to have the whoever I want at my side as my servants.  You'll still have your mind, you'll just have a much improved body.  But if you're too scared to do it yourself, allow me.\"  Kelos picked up a purple and black scroll and opened it pointing it at the scribe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Kelos, you couldn't aim a scroll.  The magic affected who opened it and in a flash Kelos sat in the carriage magically transformed...or not.  When Kelos opened his eyes he saw that the scribe was still the plain maid.  Fearing the worst he looked down, but breathed a sigh of relief when he saw that the scroll had only changed his clothes from his traveling wear to his formal military uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this seems a bit flashy and a waste of magic but it does get the job done.  Scribe, when we get back to Grovan have 3 of these made a day with the appropriate clothing.\"  But when the prince looked to his scribe, he saw that he wasn't dutifully writing down notes or nodding, he was wide eyed and seemed terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's you're problem scribe, you looked like you've seen a ghost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That that that wasn't a simple clothes change spell.  It was another disguise scroll, a Prince Kelos disguise scroll.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos scoffed, \"Well then it seems it was a bit of a waste on me.  How foolish, now, I believe we were in the middle of giving you a new permanent form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no no no you don't understand the magical implication of what you've done.  You've killed yourself!\"  The scribe said with tears now flowing down his cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about.  SPEAK!\"  Kelos was not amused by what the scribe said and slapped the maid bodied scribe.  With the tears flowing more freely the scribe spoke again, \"Wh-when the magic scroll runs out, it will erase all signs of the disguise spell, so when the Kelos disguise scroll runs out it will erase all signs of Kelos from you.  You will cease to be.  You will no longer exist.  You will di...!\" Kelos cut of the scribe with another slap.  \"I get it.  You and your damned magic has doomed me.  Now fix it or I will cut our your tongue here and leave you on the side of the road.  Fix it now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord, the only thing I can do now if give you another body until I can get access to a magical laboratory.  That will stop you from being erased.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then do it!\"  Kelos screamed as the scribe stumbled around trying to find the best scroll to keep Kelos from dying.  Sean knew that a scroll without a time limit was the best thing.  He dug around his bag until he found one he was hoping he wouldn't have to use.  It was a scroll of an obedient maid.  It was a much more drastic version of the spell the scribe was under but with no time limit and a mild obedience spell to go with it.  It was to be used only if a very long term surveillance mission was to be taken, or perhaps used on a bandit, but now seemed as good a time as any.  Sean reached into the bag to grab the scroll to give it to his lord.</span></div></div>",

Getting increasingly annoyed, he picked up one of the scrolls next to him. \"It doesn't have to be a specific one,\" the prince stated as he opened a golden scroll. The scribe looked up, seeing the scroll Kelos had chosen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not that one!\" Sean exclaimed, but too late. A bright light filled the cabin, and when it passed where Kelos had been now sat a young woman with long golden blonde hair. She wore a scarlet dress cut low, revealing the top of her modest bosom. \"That one turns the person into Princess Fia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, better than disappearing,\" Kelos said as she looked down at her new body. \"I'm sure normally I'd think these too small,\" Kelos placed her hand on her new breasts, \"But from this angle they look a lot bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean looked at Kelos aghast. \"This is terrible and all you can think of is Fia's breast size?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my breast size too,\" Kelos replied nonchalantly. \"Besides, what's the issue? I'm no longer at risk of disappearing, right? I might as well use this time to become more familiar with Fia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well not as long as the scroll lasts,\" Sean admitted. \"But we can't very well continue to Traeven, where the closest magical laboratory is, I might add, with you looking exactly like Princess Fia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let's turn around and head back home,\" Kelos suggested. \"I wonder if Fia has a nice singing voice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The trip will take too long,\" the scribe said. \"That scroll only lasts 12 hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, if I used this scroll, doesn't that mean it locked the last one as my true form? Since the last one was me, when this wears off, I'll turn back to myself, right? Problem solved.\" Kelos observed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normally yes, but since the last scroll was you, it works a bit differently,\" Sean explained. \"The initial problem still remains, when this scroll of Princess Fia wears off, you will still cease to exist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, though that doesn't make any sense,\" Kelos said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The rules of magic are complex and often defy logic and common sense,\" Sean replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what if I use another scroll? Will that still make my current form permanent?\" Kelos asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's risky, your highness,\" Sean said. \"We'd have three magic scrolls combined. The results can be very unpredictable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if we do nothing, I will cease to exist when the Fia scroll expires in 12 hours?\" Kelos replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regrettably,\" Sean said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then...\" Kelos started.</span></div></div>",

Kelos had already opened the scroll. A bright light filled the carriage as once prince transformed again, into a small black cat. \"Your highness?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos took great care figuring out how to move in this new feline form, carefully standing up, slowly moving, learning how this body functioned. It took the formerly human prince about 30 seconds to get confident in walking. Another minute and Kelos figured out how to jump and get the claws to extend. The next few minutes of Sean's life seemed far longer as Kelos leapt, claws out, into the scribe's lap, then practiced climbing up her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your highness please stop!\" Sean pleaded as the kitty Kelos made it to the top of Sean's head and began to claw at her maid bonnet. \"You're doing this deliberately aren't you?\" The scribe grabbed for Kelos, but the former prince's new form was too agile and jumped away. Sean, unfamiliar with her current body's proportions promptly fell. Kelos took this opportunity to claw at the hem of her skirt. The remaining time on Kelos' cat transformation passed with the still human scribe utterly defeated, looking as if she had participated in an epic battle to decide the fate of nations, while Kelos sat across, flicking her tail back and forth smugly until she felt the now familiar sensation of transforming.</span></div></div>",

You stay here, since there's no way they'll recognize you.\" With that he opened the door and climbed down from the carriage. \"Why have we stopped!\" Kelos yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry sir, but there's an overturned cart in the road ahead,\" the driver replied. \"The horses stopped and I had to apply the brake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So go around it!\" Kelos ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't sir, it's blocking the entire road,\" the driver said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then push it to the side and let's get moving!\" Kelos said angrily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At once sir!\" the driver said.

Kelos noted that despite being flipped, the times in the back were strangely organized. \"I have many rare and valuable antiquities, relics from ages past, when gods and demons walked the Earth openly.\" She struggled to pull out a long pole wrapped in a cloth. The tip seemed to have a some sort of bladed bit, clearly it was a pole arm of some sort. \"Yes, this may interest you,\" the old woman said. \"This spear was carried into battle by a valkyrie of myth. It is said to have many strange and mystical powers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Said by whom?\" Kelos asked skeptically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By me, were you not listening?\" The old woman replied. \"But perhaps some other items would interest you more?\" She again rummaged though her cart before pulling out another long object wrapped in cloth. \"This sword was forged from a link of the chains that bound Prometheus for his crime of giving fire to man. It is capable of binding the soul of those it slays to the will of its wielder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does binding the soul even mean?\" Kelos asked, growing increasingly annoyed. \"Plus, that's from a completely different tradition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have artifacts from across the world, from over the seven seas,\" the old woman boosted. \"If you don't want something for yourself, a gift for a lover perhaps?\" she continued. She pulled a small jewelry case out of the cart, opening it to revel two solid gold rings, with engravings in a language Kelos didn't recognize, those he noted they did appear to be real gold at least. \"These magic rings will slowly change the wearer into their partner's ideal lover.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all well and good, but I do not desire payment,\" Kelos said.

They then tried to right the cart, which they were more successful in doing. much to their confusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, good sirs,\" the old woman said. \"Now I certainly must give you some form of payment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Kelos said, hoping it would get the woman to not further waste his time. </span></div></div>",

The shaft itself was surprisingly also made of metal, with gold trim. The spear seemed to be more ornamental than combat ready, but it did appear to be valuable. \"Well this is a surprise.\" Kelos unwrapped the spear completely, and held it in his hand. as he did, he heard a woman's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mistress!

Reginleif, I'm ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! I will finally be able to see mistress again!\" Reginleif shouted, squealing as if though she was a little girl receiving a new doll. Kelos ignored that strange remark as he draws the blade against the skin of his finger, drawing blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos instantly felt a strong force pulling onto him, as if though it was attempting to wrench his soul out of his body. He could feel large amounts of power flow out of it as his soul unified with that of the spear, becoming one in heart as the link began establishing between them. Kelos suddenly felt his body change, undergoing a rapid transition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hair tumbled down his shoulders and back as it changed into a purple color, braiding itself into a nice long braid until it ended just below his butt, resting on his back. His broad shoulders became slimmer as he also shrunk in size, becoming shorter by a head before stopping. His hips widened into ones that seemed as if they were meant for birthing children, while his backside arched into a fine curve. His waist slimmed to narrow proportions, creating an hourglass figure, while his stomach tucked in the slight belly fat to create prominent abdominal muscles. His chest enlarged slightly into moderate breasts as his arms and legs became softer, daintier, and slimmer, though they retained some muscle. His face reconstructed itself to that of a painting he'd seen of a goddess of beauty, while his butt gained considerable weight. Finally, his penis tucked itself in as it created a fully functional vagina with ovaries and a uterus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer clothes had then also begun to undergo a rapid transformation. A small helmet appeared that covered only the front portion of the head, white feathers sprouting from it. Her expensive dress shirt turned into a plain white undershirt, and a blue armor appeared over it. It extended from her waist to her shoulders, with shoulder pads completing the protection. Her underwear changed into simple, yet elegant garments, as a plain white battle skirt appeared that extended towards her ankles. Blue gauntlets appeared to cover her hands, wrists, and arms, while her shoes turned into blue greaves to cover her new, daintier feet, ankles, and shins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha... What the...\" Kelos said. Her new voice was higher pitched than it was before, but carried a powerful and menacing tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mistress Lenneth! You're back!\" Reginleif exclaimed as the spear... <i>coiled</i> itself around Kelos like a snake, squeezing her in a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cut it out! Would you stop it!?\" Kelos shouted, wrenching the spear off herself. \"Who's Lenneth? Why do I look like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sorry, mistress! I completely forgot that you lost your memories,\" Reginleif said, recomposing herself. \"Lenneth is... was your previous incarnation, and my previous mistress. She was a Valkyrie, a being closer to gods than humans. She... died in the Last Holy War between gods and demons, bravely sacrificing herself and she charged into the midst of a swarm of demons to open the path to victory. But now she's finally returned! You've regained your former Valkyrie form, mistress! Though your powers have somewhat waned due to not using them in a while, you should still be stronger than most right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel so powerful...\" Kelos remarked, observing herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, mistress! Valkyries were created to be the attendants of gods!\" Reginleif remarked, before adding in a whisper, \"...<i><font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">and their concubines</font></i>. Aaaaahh, Apollon would be so rejoiced to hear of this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's Apollon?\" Kelos asked, interested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, mistress, the god of the sun!\" Reginleif replied ecstatically. \"Noble, just, and charismatic, he was worshiped by all humans before he ascended to the heavens. But, but, but! His most important trait was his daring streak of breaking the rules... he was your lover!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>WHAT</i>?\" Kelos yelled, jaw gaping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaahhh, it was so romantic. A god and his attendant, breaking all rules to be with one another.\" Kelos could <i>feel</i> the spear blushing. \"He was as heartbroken as me when he lost you, maybe even moreso! You should seek him out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense!\" Kelos replied. \"I already have a fiance that I was going to get married to, and now you brought me into this mess! Damn. Why did I listen to you before finding out all the details...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But mistress!\" Reginleif replied. \"Mortal worldly affairs are none of your business anymore! You should...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Kelos could interject, she heard a cough resound near her, causing her head to spin at great speeds. Shit! She completely forgot about the scribe! Wondering how to explain this to him, he suddenly opened his mouth...</span></div></div>",

I don't want to lose you again, Mistress! Not after I finally found you after so long!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reginleif has apparently nixed that,\" Kelos said. 'Something about being hunted down if I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that makes sense. Gods not favoring one side in a conflict,\" the scribe said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure there's any point in continuing to Traeven like this,\" Kelos said. \"But I do want to see Princess Fia. If nothing else, she deserves to know what happened, and I want to tell her personally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps the wizard can help restore you to normal,\" the scribe suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you are normal now, Mistress Kelos. This is who you really are,\" Reginleif said. \"Even if you love this Princess, she's a mortal. You no longer are. You'll still look like this when her great great grandchildren are old and grey. I implore you Mistress, forget about her! It will only bring you pain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Reginleif, but I can't give up on her,\" Kelos said. \"Not only would marrying her bring peace between our countries, but I do love her. Maybe I'm the reincarnation of Lenneth, but I have my own life I'm not willing to abandon.\" She then looked up at the scribe. \"We shall continue to Traeven, and I will meet with the wizard.\"</span></div></div>",

It was their fortunate luck that enabled them to come further to the city without incident, and the guards passed them without any trouble, assuming that the Prince had arrived. After all, who else would ride such a lavish carriage?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see that the city hasn't changed much,\" Kelos noted, peeking from the carriage curtains. The cityfolk truly did remain the same, cheerfully talking, arguing, and bargaining over prices in the marketplace. The busy life of the city went on the way it did before, unchanging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you been here before?\" The scribe asked, surprised. He hadn't heard of any excursions to Traeven by the prince. It was mostly Fia coming to Grovan to visit them in their youth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, once,\" Kelos nodded. \"When I had first met her at the ball, I was so smitten by her beauty that I <i>had</i> to visit her. However, once I had gotten past the city walls...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You became so afraid that you left in a hurry?\" Reginleif finished much to Kelos' surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blasted spear!\" She yelled out with a confused scribe watching her. \"How did you know?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can read your heart, mistress,\" the spear said, in an almost ecstatic voice. \"After all, the two of us are now linked, bound to be together for all eternity!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos blushed, realizing that she now had a companion that could read her like an open book. No matter how she would try to hide her emotions from people, there would be one person... or rather, one spear, that would always be able to know how she feels and understand her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe carriage abruptly stopped at the front of the palace, signalling that they were finally here. Kelos motioned the scribe to exit first, before following suit with Reginleif (the spear would just not let go of her). The sweet, soothing beam of sun hit her face, blinding her for a moment, as the dozens of spears of the king's guard suddenly pointed at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Halt!\" One of them, the tallest of the king's squad, roared at her. \"Who are you, and what have you done to Prince Kelos?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <i>am</i> Prince Kelos.\" Kelos' menacing voice sounded out, intimidating the soldiers. \"I have just encountered a couple problems on the way. And besides, don't you think that pointing a spear at me is a tad bit rude?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo...you're right!\" The soldier suddenly flinched, backing off. \"Oh forgive this pitiful, lowly soldier, Your Highness!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Weird.' Kelos thought. 'Why are they suddenly so subservient?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's because they cannot help but submit under the presence of a god's emissary.\" Reginleif commented, responding to her question. \"Your aura is affecting those of lower rank than you are. Only nobility may stand before your might.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Reading my thoughts again?' Kelos thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your heart! I'm reading your heart!\" Reginleif rebutted, correcting her. \"Didn't you want to see someone here? Go! Now is your chance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos proudly walked through the halls of the palace, escorted by her own guards. She had never seen the palace before, but now that she was looking at it, she had to admit that it was refined. The exquisite paintings and mural gave a fine touch to the walls and ceilings, and the floor was lined with beautiful marble. Truly a palace worth obtaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you, girl?\" King Arthras exclaimed after Kelos walked, leaning in his throne. His captains Dioral and Galan were to the right of him, while his daughter Fia and trusty mage Marlin were to the left. \"I was expecting Prince Kelos, but some wench strides into my throne room instead. Speak!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not some wench,\" Kelos rebutted, shaking her head. \"For I am Prince Kelos, heir of Grovan's throne! I have just run into several complications on the way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sense power in you,\" Marlin's croaking voice suddenly remarked, causing all heads to turn to him. \"Very great power. Even an experienced mage as I would not be able to stand against you. No human can wield this power. If you are Prince Kelos, which I can tell by the color of your soul, how did you manage to come about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos realized that there is no point in hiding the truth. \"The thing is, some old lady gave me this spear and it told me to form a contract with it. But once I did, it turned me into this form, and now it's telling me about some valkyrie nonsense!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not nonsense! And I was only doing what I thought was best for you!\" Reginleif screamed, and her voice felt as if tears were welling up in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you did.\" Marlin said smiling, surprising Kelos in that he could hear the spear. \"But I'm afraid you did doom Kelos to such a life. A Valkyrie's soul remains a Valkyrie's soul no matter where it transmigrates. Kelos, I'm afraid that this is your real form. And I...\"</span></div></div>",

After all, Sean the scribe had crafted it on direct orders from the Queen of Grovan.  While the King was either ignorant or simply didn't care about Kelos' gallivanting about with the maids of the castle, the Queen was another manner.  She was ready for Kelos to finally take on the responsibility of prince and do his royal duties and make political relationships with the neighboring kingdoms and more importantly provide her with grandchildren to continue the family line, preferable the non-bastard kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that was why she'd asked Sean to create a scroll of binding marriage that he was to use on Kelos and Fia as soon as they came to terms on their arranged marriage.  It was a tool to be used to make sure neither could back out or go behind each other's back without dealing with the magical consequences.  The fate of two kingdom's relied on that little yellow scroll, and with each bounce and bump of the scroll Sean felt like it was punching him in the heart.  With this in mind Sean gulped and said, \"I believe it's time I put that back in my pouch my Prince.\"  Sean reached for the scroll but Kelos pulled it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think not, I think I'd rather read this myself to find out what kind of magics you've prepared for the Princess.  I'm afraid I'm going to insist that I know if you're magic will make her worthy of my gaze.\"  Kelos reached for the magical seal and Sean yelped out, \"NO!\"  and grabbed the other end of the scroll.  But at the same time the carriage ran over a rather sizable branch.  The two men slammed back into their seats, each with half of the now torn yellow scroll.  Sean's eye's widened as he realized what had happened, \"Oh no, oh no, oh no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos slapped Sean with the back of his hand, \"Calm down fool, you'll just have to make another, it's probably for the best, the first one was probably not good enough, I'll tell you exactly what I want your next scroll to say and it's going to...going to.\"  Kelos suddenly felt himself getting light headed and Sean was feeling the same sensation, however he was ready for it, as much good as that would do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew the Scroll of Binding Marriage, at least the way he had made it, could only be used to create a magical marriage between a man and a woman, and sense the scroll had gone off with himself and the Prince as the only possible subjects, it's magic was about to take a dramatic hold on one of them.  The only question was in this accidental magical marriage, who would be the husband, and who would be the wife?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The torn pieces of the scroll began to twist and turn in the air before dissolving into a single beam of light that went from Kelos to Sean.  After a few seconds, the light disappeared into both of them.  Sean feared what was coming next and his fears did indeed come true as he felt his body shifting and turning and molding itself.  Where before there had been a slumped down scribe who hid in the shadows, was now a positively glowing woman with golden blonde hair, a sizeable bust that even Sean's frumpy clothing could not completely hide, and a void where his manhood had once been.  Kelos was the first to speak, he seemed to have felt some magic too although physically he didn't seem to have changed.  After checking himself to make sure of that Kelos shouted, \"You klutz you're carelessness could have...could have...\"  Kelos had risen his hand to strike his scribe but stopped when he saw the gorgeous woman before him in the carriage.  \"My my, you have outdone yourself this time scribe.  Although when you use the scroll on the Princess I think you could afford to be a bit more generous.\"  Kelos reached out and squeezed Sean's new breasts, \"But not a bad start, well done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's not what it was meant for. That scroll was supposed to...Oh my!\"  Sean tried to say that the scroll was a magically binding marriage spell, but Kelos was more interested in examining the scribe's new body than anything else.  \"Whatever the spell was meant for it turned out well, did it take care of everything?\"  Kelos reached down into Sean's pants and Sean gasped as Kelos felt for himself the newly formed womanhood.  \"My Prince...please...\"  Sean whimpered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before Kelos could continue his exploration the carriage stopped and the captain of the guard proclaimed from the outside, \"May I present to Castle Traeven, the honorable Prince Kelos of Grovan!\"  Kelos muttered to himself, \"Damn.\"  He quickly made sure he was presentable, and before opening the door of the carriage opened, he looked to Sean and said, \"I expect to see you in my quarters tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that arguing with the Prince quick to anger Prince was not a good idea under any circumstance, Sean simply bowed and said, \"Yes sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Prince left Sean alone in the carriage.  He got a few confused looks from the guards who had accompanied them on this quest, however they were all used to seeing strange and beautiful women seem to pop up out of nowhere when Kelos was involved so nobody asked any questions.  The Castle Traeven staff were kind enough to lead Sean to a spare servants quarters.  Thankfully he wouldn't have to share a room with the guards.  He'd even been provided with a simple dress and undergarments to wear.  Apparently it was unseemly for women in this country to be seen in men's clothes.  When he was left alone in the room, Sean began to get dressed as if it were second nature to him and took a moment to reflect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must calm down and think.  I know that I don't have the supplies to undo this spell as of now and will have to wait until we get back to Grovan...that is if the Prince lets me turn back.  Or he could just use me tonight and leave me here so his family doesn't ask any questions.  No Sean, don't think like that now.  He wouldn't do that to you, you are now magically bound to him as his wife now.\"  A light bulb went off in Sean's head.  \"I'm married to the Prince.  That means I'm a Princess, I'm the next in line to be Queen!  I no longer have to toil as a mere scribe.  I have true power!\"  Sean felt a power hungry smile spread wider and wider across his face as he finished putting on his dress.  But Sean shook his head to end his power fantasy, \"Stop thinking like that Sean, it's only going to last a few days, besides, the Prince himself is going to want to end this even quicker than I do when he realizes some of the consequences of the spell.  Like what happens when he cheats on me with someone, no he will not like that.\"  Sean chuckled to himself before letting out a gasp of horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!  I must warn the Prince before...oh no!\"  With that the scribe sprinted to the door to go off and warn the Prince, however there was somebody on the other side of the door waiting for him.</span></div></div>",

His personal bodyguards guiding the confused prince back to the main castle. His attempts at speech coming out as mangled noises, his vulnerability was assessed as he was taken away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis long equine neck stretched over the stall door, watching his body being lead away. Looking down, Kelos guessed he could probably open the stall door, working the wooden bolt with his teeth. But without any way to communicate who he truly was, it might simply ensure he ended up in a more secure stall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't an easy decision, but he knew he had to wait, and reveal himself... somehow, when the King came to investigate himself. Hopefully, they'd have more of an idea about his predicament from observing the stallion in his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to shrug, resign his fate to a long wait, but a shudder rippled down his back at the attempt. The wait was almost painfully long and dull. The water bucket and food trough, gave no variety or taste, as he crunched away at the oats. However, he was getting used to the altered senses of his new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis nostrils flared, as he scented the air. An atmosphere that spoke with more depth and vibrancy to him. He could tell without seeing all the other stable residents. The aroma of three mares, and a gelding pricked at his senses. Even in the confines of the stall, he felt intensely aware of his new stallionhood. Every slight movement, set it in motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Sun dropped below the battlements, and darkness filled the stables, Kelos felt the draw of his animal instincts. With his mind insufficiently occupied, his equine nature was making more of the decisions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fact he became uncomfortably aware of, as he felt himself stiffen. The taste of the mares, the musky odour of their arousal bitter, but enticing. The sensation was intriguing, and unsettling. His erection felt massive, and obvious, shifting around it slapped heavily from side to side, too long and distracting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis own pheromones felt intoxicating, pulsing through his veins with every beat of his heart, and each throbbing beat sending an eager twitch through his cock. Putting an effort in to fighting these strengthening instincts, Kelos found his own stallion musk adding to the problem, driving the mares to become louder in their restlessness, their pheromones intensifying with each deep breath. A lungful that filled his body, and stiffened his resolve.</span></div></div>",

The sight of his mare, and her twinkling pussy needs no further invitation. The stable girl holds her tail aside, her need undeniable. Rearing up on his hind legs, animal nature takes control, and the Prince is a passenger, as he plunges forward. His erection sinking endlessly deeper. A natural rhythm coming, as he powers away. Her muscular ass making him sweat. The musk of their mating sends his nostrils into spasms, as she whinnies, in time with his thrusts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensation is overwhelming, as Kelos discovers a passion, a frenzy he never knew even as a Prince sowing his wild oats.

The ire of King or a Prince stepping in horse shit wasn't something anyone wanted to test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo-one even muttered about the work they were in the midst of, as Prince Kelos walked down the central aisle. The furious scrubbing as people brushed the area ahead clear, the harsh bristles working to remove anything offensive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos allowed himself a tight smile, enjoying the feverish activity, and the fear his presence inspired. He was used to horses and riding, the pungent smell hanging in the air was familiar if not pleasant. Sensing he was getting too close to those working to hide the shit from him he paused, and looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpotting the bottle, he picked it up, and glancing at the label recognised the scratchy hand of his mage. Making a note to himself to ask what a magician's purpose was in the stables, he put it back on the wooden divider. The stable staff were trying to avoid his eye, and he didn't want to appear ignorant, so for the moment the purpose was unknown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas, in his feigned interest Kelos didn't quite put it back in the same place. Seconds later it fell to the stone stable floor, missing the steaming piles, and the strewn straw. The bottle shattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lurid puddle formed, a violet hue looking out of place and unnatural. But the puddle quickly evaporated, and a cloud of pink and purple rose from the floor. Sparks of magic lit the cloud, which moved with an intelligence and direction that unsettled the Prince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if targetting the horse in that stall, the mist drifted towards it's face. Disappearing into it's immense snuffling nostrils. Leaving only a trace or silver sparkles to form a ring around each nostril.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos watched the horse fascinated to see if he could spot any changes. It raised it's head... A quick glance checking.... She raised her head, the wide animal eyes deep, dark and blank she looked uncomprehendingly at the prince. Her jaw shifted from side to side, and her nostrils twitched, but the hints were too late, and his reaction too slow, as the mare sneezed in the face of Prince Kelos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spray of hot, wet, smelly horse spittle hitting him in the face, decorating his shirt. The sudden shift in the atmosphere of the stable. The moments' hesitancy in the brushing meant everyone had spotted the incident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as the stable workers decided between offering to help the Prince clean himself up, or pretend they hadn't noticed, the specks of horse snot and spittle, evaporated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the illuminated mist rise for his face, Kelos waved his hands, to dissipate it, to block it. But the cloud continued to rise, and be inhaled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wave of dizziness hit him, and instinctively he grabbed the stall door to steady himself. Closing his eyes against the now spinning stables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a couple of deep breaths, Kelos surprised himself at their depth. Not wishing to appear weak, and starting to hear a tone of concern in the general babble of voices around him, he reopened his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walls were still spinning, and he felt very odd. Even the man opposite with a concerned look, also resting his hand on the stall door looked worried. Snapping shut your eyes, you squeeze them tight, in the hope that this'll help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes flash open as he realised it was himself you'd seen. Or rather his body, not recalling any mirrors or need for them in the stables, he  open his eyes once more. This time the full horror sinks in, he was in the horse's body, and looking at his own former body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud whinny of protest erupting from him.... from Her, as he recalled the sex of the horse in the stall... of her sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stable boys and girls race to the prince's side</span></div></div>",

The whole aim of his journey was peace, and that was best secured by blood. A marriage was the outcome that would win that best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, he felt vulnerable with only two knights for escort. Damon was a good friend who had advanced through the guard ranks without any help from the Prince. On the other side he saw Dirk, a capable soldier. Although Kelos didn't know him personally, he had stayed alone and surrounded to defend his horse when it became lame and he was separated on patrol. In the morning he was found in a copse of trees. His horse had it's leg strapped up, and the bodies of over twenty enemy troops littered the ground. He didn't like to speak of that night, but whenever the ladies heard of his deeds he usually found a warm bed for the night. His brood dark looks didn't do him any harm either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three riders received bruised and suspicious looks from the villagers as they passed.

The plan was as simple as it was evil, first Xarlat turns himself in to necklace, second Kelos gives Fia the necklace. Who ever puts on the necklace then swaps with the person in the necklace therefore when princess Fia puts the necklace on Xarlet will take over her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mad reason for this plan was Kelos's father doubted princess Fia would go though with marrying Kelos, whereas Xarlat had been forced to sign a binding magic contract that he would do everything in his power to make sure Kelos ruled both kingdoms for a long time and no harm came to him. The reason for the necklace was Marlin would spot Xarlat a mile off but as the necklace he would not be able to detect him. Once Xarlat was in princess Fia's body he could finally get close enough to kill his arch nemesis, Marlin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the marriage Xarlat would give Fia her body back, put a spell of enslavement on her so she does what Kelos tells and without Marlin no one would be able to break the spell.

Though they had not told him the reason. A mystery that can only be solved by attending. He hurriedly got dressed and headed down stairs. He passed several servants in the halls who greeted him, but he simply ignored them in his rush. He arrived to find his sister Orianna waiting, with his parents yet to arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was beginning to think were going to be late, little brother,\" Orianna quipped as Kelos entered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The sun is barely up,\" Kelos replied. \"I suspect we still have time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently so,\" Orianna replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, the two of them stood in an awkward silence. While they had been close as children, over the years they drifted apart. Years of magical pranks had led to hurt feelings between the two, such as the time Orianna turned Kelos' prized hounds into foxes, or Kelos turned Orianna's horse into a giant chicken. Worse, Orianna made it no secret that she wished to inherit the throne. After all, she was older than Kelos, but the rules about sons being given priority over daughters for succession denied her what was in her mind her birthright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Kelos said, at last breaking the silence. \"Have you been told anything about why Mother and Father called us here today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a thing,\" Orianna replied. \"I imagine it's the same for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is,\" Kelos replied. With that the silence resumed. This would be mercifully brief as before long Queen Latissa and King Reginald walked in. They sat down in their thrones. Kelos knelt and Orianna curtsied in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My children,\" Latissa said. \"We have called you today, for a very important mission. As you know, our war with Traeven is nearing its end, and we have been in negotiations for peace. As it stands now, it will be one favorable to Grovan, and Kelos, you shall take Princess Fia of Traeven as your bride.\" She then turned to her husband for him to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our armies have met with great success over the past several months, and have even managed to raid farmland that directly feeds Castle Traeven,\" Reginald continued. \"This has left King Arthras with little recourse but to yield to our might. However, little recourse does not mean no recourse. Our spies have reported that he has sent an emissary to the Empire of Teutonis to convince them to come to Traeven's aid. Teutonis has a large army, and if they were to enter the war, Grovan would be hard pressed to stand before it. Perhaps if we were not also at war with Traeven, but as it stands, we would be fighting on two fronts, and our defeat all but inevitable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surely, they have nothing to offer Teutonis,\" Orianna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As of the last war council, Traeven's treasury was depleted,\" Kelos added. \"With no money to pay them and little food, what would Teutonis gain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Traeven as a vassal and Grovan as new territory,\" Reginald said. He then turned to his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As such, I have the following mission,\" Latissa said. \"You are to travel to Teutonis, together, and negotiate to stop them from allying with Traeven against us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Together?\" Orianna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Together,\" Latissa repeated.</span></div></div>",

Perhaps, just perhaps there is a way to get the royal children to better understand each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you propose, old friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I have quite the idea,\" Xarlet approached the king and queen, and whispered just loud enough for them both to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That seems extreme, but I suppose there is no other way,\" Latissa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, wizard, make it so!\" Reginald ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With pleasure,\" the old wizard replied with a twisted smile. He turned, and pointed at Kelos and Orianna. A pair of white orbs flew out of the wizard's finger and hit the prince and princess, entering each of their bodies, only to immediately exit. They then crossed paths as the orbs, now each glowing golden, flew towards the other royal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell was that?\" The Grovan princess exclaimed. She looked to her right and seeing no one standing there asked. \"Ori?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" the Grovan prince said, looking down at himself. He looked at his hand as he opened and closed his fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh their different reactions are certainly fascinating,\" Xarlet chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess spun to her left, and saw the prince examining his body. At this point she realized what had happened. \"You swapped our bodies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed I did,\" Xarlet said with a wicked smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will handle the situation with Teutonis personally,\" Reginald proclaimed. \"Until I return, you two will remain in each other's bodies. Hopefully literally spending time in each others shoes will help the two of you get along.

Kelos, Orianna, and 'Sean,' their new trusty 'adviser' on any and all Teutonis-related affairs, were just now seating themselves for the long, <i>long</i> trip ahead. It was awkward, and it was tense, and it was every emotion the pair of siblings felt ever since those old Grovan traditions started to rear their head, and it'd been decided that Kelos, not Ori, would inherit the reigns to the kingdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch a shame, too. In their earlier years they were <i>quite</i> close. Ori still had fond memories of the times she'd convinced her brother to play 'dress up.' What were the names they came up with for 'him,' again? Kelas? Kelia? Cally? Surely all of them got tossed around at one point or another, as she helped the dear swish into another pretty outfit. The tea parties they shared were divine!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut alas, those days were over. Only drudged up for the occasional emotional drubbing, or light blackmailing. The future 'ruler' faced increasing responsibilities to occupy his time, while Orianna was left to her own devices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer own devices, however, were not knitting and basket weaving. She'd spent many an hour in the castle library, or with private tutors, studying various forms of magical alchemy, as well as in-depth knowledge of politics and diplomacy. Other than ego, it's why she'd insisted on usurping Kelos on this escapade. She wasn't there to be a simple pretty face, and she'd prove that to Mother and Father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI <i>wondered</i> where you shuffled off to, Scribe.\u201d Kelos wryly said, as he appraised his old friend. To the royal's mind, this trip just got a lot more palatable: A chance to catch up to someone who'd gone ghost for months now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy apologies, your highness! King Reginald's orders though weren't to be ignored! But it <i>is</i> nice to see you, again.\u201d Sean smiled, with his tone full of warmth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOri merely rolled her eyes. \u201cThat's all well and good, you two, but we can proceed with frivolities <i>after</i> we're briefed on the mission.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yes! Teutonis. <i>Quite</i> the interesting place. Going through a bit of a political and cultural upheaval right now as it is, actually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That</i> seemed to perk the ears of both royals. \u201cUpheaval?\u201d Kelos echoed: turning more towards his companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMm! Appointed their first male king in nearly a millennia! It's traditionally a matriarchy, you know! The first in line was relieved of their duties due to, ehem... <i>complications.</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Scribe.</i>\u201d Orianna glowered. \u201cNow is not the time to be obtuse.\u201d She informed, crossing her arms under her ample chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's an obtuse situation, my princess!\u201d The servant defended: waving his arms forward. \u201cA situation that might be better explained over some tea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI... wouldn't be <i>against</i> a cup...\u201d Kelos remarked rather hesitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOri slowly nodded, if only because she believed it would help take off some of the edge she was feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent! I've just the scroll that should brew us up a batch faster than you can blink!\u201d Sean cheered, peering into his adjacent satchel of various spell-laden parchments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParchments that had a long history of, ehem... <i>complications.</i></span></div></div>",

It would be a simple act, merely a drop of her latest creation would do. She watched the scribe. Why Kelos wouldn't even know it was her, he, no, she would assume it was the scribe's doing. What better time could there be? If she were somehow discovered, another drop would reverse the transformation. Orianna smiled slyly as she convinced herself. Neither Kelos nor the scribe noticed as they were focused on the scrolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are,\" Sean said as he pulled out his scroll and held it up. On the outside was written \"Instant tea set - creation magic - makes a pot of fresh brewed tea and several cups appear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have them labeled, I see,\" Kelos commented approvingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, some past incidents have taught me just color coding isn't enough,\" the scribe replied. \"It's best to have a written description of what the scroll does on the outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I assume you've tested this,\" Orianna said, laying the groundwork for her plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Princess,\" Sean replied. He pulled open the scroll and indeed a pot of tea and 4 empty teacups appeared in a flash of light. Orianna used this brief distraction to pull a small vial containing her latest potion from its hiding spot sewn into the sleeve of her dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got an extra cup,\" Kelos said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Four seemed like a good number,\" Sean replied. \"But maybe I could make the spell vary based on the number of people in attendance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least it seemed to work,\" Orianna said. She reached for the teapot and poured a cup for herself. She then turned towards Kelos' cup and filled it, while carefully adding a single drop of potion. She then reached over and did the same to Sean's cup. It was riskier adding a drop to both, but it would make it seem more likely the tea was the cause. She put the pot down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you princess,\" Sean said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you were about to explain why the first in line was removed,\" Orianna said, taking a sip of tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes,\" Sean replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also what this cultural upheaval is,\" Kelos added. He took a sip of tea. With attention on the scribe, Orianna slipped her vial back into his hiding spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's start with the crown princess,\" Sean said as he also took a sip of tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is it so hot in here all of a sudden?\" Kelos asked. He felt flush all of a sudden and was sweating heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't look well, brother,\" Orianna said. She placed her tea down and reached over to feel his forehead. \"Why you're burning up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm suddenly feeling hot too,\" Sean said weakly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My whole body feels like it's on fire,\" Kelos said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my,\" Orianna said as she looked at Kelos. \"Your chest is swelling.\" She then glanced over at the Sean. \"Yours is too! What was in that tea, you blundering scribe?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was just tea,\" Sean insisted. The changes accelerated. Both Kelos and Sean's chests ballooned into ample breasts. Next, their arms and legs thinned out and lost all hair. Their feet and hands shrank, their waists narrowed, and their hips expanded. The final change was their genitals rearranging to form perfect female anatomy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's passing,\" Kelos said in her new feminine voice. \"My body feels weird though.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same here,\" Sean said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure you want to look, but I don't think you're my brother anymore,\" Orianna said. \"You look more like my sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos looked down at herself. She was still dressed in the same clothes, but they did little to conceal her new curves. She felt her new breasts and confirmed they were real. She then looked over at Sean, who was discovering her own changes. </span></div></div>",

Brown tresses now dangled over her bangs, and while hidden by the fabric of her robes, an attractive set of curves were not too difficult to outline. 'Bookwormish,' would be the word to use, and not in a derogatory way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Sean</i>.\u201d On the other hand, there was a little firecracker sitting right beside, who was <i>none too pleased.</i> \u201cI should never, ever, <i>ever</i> trust you with those damned scrolls!\u201d Each word was punctuated with a shake of the new girl next to her, with the prince(?) throttling her companion by the shoulders. \u201cEvery time you do, something <i>idiotic</i> goes wrong!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos was a sight. But not an <i>unfamiliar</i> one. If Ori wanted a younger sibling, she would be happy to know she got that, and maybe a fraternal twin, as well. Pale skin illuminated radiant, azure eyes, that drew contrast to the fiery red mane that flowed down around them. It was like looking in a mirror. The only peculiarity was how <i>short</i> the royal had become. Both Sean and Orianna towered over her by several inches, making her petite, if not incredibly cute. This was only aided by how much more... <i>modest</i> the chest she'd obtained was compared to the two beside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY- your Highness! I'm sorry! I don't know how-\u201d Their adviser was having <i>quite</i> the difficulty articulating her words, as soprano-pitched beratements filled the air mere inches from her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSufficed to say, this all made Orianna <i>very</i> pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Now now,</i> is this any way you should be acting, <i>little sister?</i>\u201d The most senior of their ranks freed the scribe from the 'vicious' onslaught, and plopped the metamorphosized woman down on the seat next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it were, there'd be no mistaking between either who was Grovan's rightful representative. Kelos, currently, looked like a tag-along. Someone to sit idly at hearings, acting as a 'pretty face,' while the <i>real</i> work was done by the important people. A role Orianna begrudgingly played all too often in her 'official' life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't drink the tea, Ori.\u201d Kelos huffed, as she crossed her arms under her bosom: mimicking her sister from moments ago. Humorously though, there was a fair bit less 'cushioning' up top as protection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wasn't planning to.\u201d She replied in a sort of maternal, if condescending tone, before turning. \u201cScribe,\u201d she began, harshening up. \u201cExplain yourself here. What happened? How long with this magic persist?\u201d Ori, of course, sly minx that she was, needed to put up a front to pretend she didn't know <i>exactly</i> what was going on. The concoction she utilized didn't <i>have</i> an expiry date. At least, not a date spanning a human lifetime. She held complete control over Kelos' gender here, with the 'antidote' lying within her hands (or rather, up her sleeve). And let it be known she had <i>no plans</i> of even <i>thinking</i> of utilizing it until <i>after</i> they'd returned to Grovan. Her 'sister' was going to be in for a rather... <i>unique</i> experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike I said, I don't know! I even labeled the scrolls this time! <i>Labeled</i> them!\u201d Sean bemoaned, as she adjusted her glasses (did she always have those?!). \u201cI'll have to look into it... But it may take some time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime I doubt we have.\u201d Ori conjectured. \u201cYou've yet to debrief us on Teutonis.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would think correcting our genders should take precedence!\u201d Kelos offered in a perturbed cry. \u201cWhat will people at the castle think once we arrive?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, sire, it <i>might</i> be to our benefit...\u201d The adviser offered: gently scratching a Cherubic cheek. \u201cLike I said, it <i>is</i> a matriarchy...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd thankfully, out of all of us, <i>I</i> am still in a presentable state.\u201d Orianna affirmed: downplaying the problems, while reasserting her pivotal role in headlining negotiations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm not sure how I could ever be presentable like... <i>this.</i>\u201d The transformed princess grumbled, as she assessed herself in the terribly awkward, terribly ill fitting attire she was adorned in at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that, stars began beaming in Ori's eyes. \u201cOh I'm not so sure~.\u201d With a heavy tinge of playful menace, she loomed over her sister. \u201cTell me, dear, do you prefer Kelas, Kelia, or <i>Cally?</i>\u201d</span></div></div>",

She was still wearing her male clothing as she held a cup of tea in her hands. This one had been brewed in a conventional pot the old fashion way, with no magic used. Next to her sat Sean, still wearing her scribe robes, just with the sleeve rolled up. They looked a bit large on her, but not nearly to the extent of Kelos' own clothing. Orianna was currently in the process of searching her luggage for clothing Kelos could wear. Kelos simply sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still don't understand it,\" Sean said. \"I checked and rechecked my scroll, and the tea should have been fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You probably just mixed them up while you were labeling them or something equally careless,\" Kelos huffed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that will do, that will do nicely!\" Orianna exclaimed. She pulled out a dress, brought it over to the carriage and placed it inside. She then practically skipped towards her new little sister. \"Kelia! I've found the perfect dress for you to wear tomorrow. It will be so lovely with the style I have in mind for you.\" She reached out her hand to help Kelos stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well at least someone is happy about this,\" Kelos quipped. She handed her cup of tea to Sean and reached out to take Orianna's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know this isn't what you're used to, but makeovers are fun!\" Orianna said cheerfully as she led Kelos to the carriage. \"If you had been born a girl, we could have been doing this every night!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somehow that isn't making me feel any better about this, Ori,\" Kelos replied. \"Just make me look presentable, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust your big sister,\" Orianna said. She helped Kelos into the carriage, then got in herself, closing the door behind them. The carriage was lit only by a pair of torches on each side, so it was dim, but still workable. \"Now then, strip and I'll help you with your new undergarments.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos hesitated for a moment, but then shook her head and complied. She quickly removed her male clothing, and sat in the carriage completely naked. \"I don't know why, but I feel really cold. It's not even chilly out\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're quite a bit smaller, so that will happen,\" Orianna replied. \"Now then, let's get you dressed!\" In what seemed like an instant, Orianna had her new sister in panties and a bra, which somehow fit perfectly, despite the obvious difference in size. \"There.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had expected your clothing to be loose on me,\" Kelos commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have all my clothing magically enchanted to ensure a perfect fit,\" Orianna explained as she sat next to Kelos. She noticed her shivering a bit. \"Come here, I'll warm you up.\" She held out her arms inviting Kelos for a hug. The former prince turned Princess again hesitated, but eventually accepted. \"Don't worry, Kelia, your older sister will take care of you.\" She began to stroke Kelos' hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This feels nice,\" Kelos reluctantly admitted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It does,\" Orianna replied. \"I can't help but think we'd have been a lot closer as two sisters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll never know for sure,\" Kelos replied. \"Maybe you would have hated me for being too pretty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's still a chance for that,\" Orianna replied with a giggle. Kelos smiled in response. \"Though I'd say you're more cute than pretty. Which brings up what I want to do with your makeover.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm well out of my element here, so I'll trust you with it,\" Kelos replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you trust me,\" Orianna replied. A part of her suddenly felt guilty for what she had done, yet it seemed to be a huge success. \"But you should still have the final word on this, since it's your appearance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, just make sure it's phrased in a way I can understand. I'm new at this being a princess,\" Kelos said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're short, even for a woman,\" Orianna said. \"So I was thinking a bookish look would be best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bookish?\" Kelos asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, to put it another way, I'm going to try to make you look really smart and well read. This way if you offer a suggestion at the negotiations, it won't be dismissed as prattling of a child.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see,\" Kelos replied. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Intentional or not, 'Kelia' felt a sting from Orianna's words. 'More cute than pretty,' 'short, even for a woman,' 'dismissed as a prattling child.' These were concerns that'd not once passed through the new princess's mind since getting transformed. Her current goal was to look acceptable to the Teutonian royalty, yes, but what that really entailed wasn't a matter she'd ruminated too hard on: rather busy reeling from the change in the first place!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a man, he'd studied a variety of military tactics, as well as some considerable training with a blade. While never <i>overtly</i> violent, he always thought it lent an air of respect to him in diplomatic meetings- however much of a placebo that might've been. Seeing herself now though... Could she actually hold a sword? Glancing at her delicate, waifish arms, the answer was an obvious, bashful, '<i>no</i>.' It'd be comical, if not dangerous. Kelos was beyond her reach here, and all those years of formal education were urging that she defer to someone with more expertise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Whatever you think best, Ori. Like I said, I trust your judgment. Plus, you <i>are</i> in charge.\u201d The half-naked girl said with a gently wry smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was not a <i>single</i> word in those three sentences that Orianna didn't like. Oh! If she knew <i>this</i> was the response to a little, <i>minor thing</i>, like a gender change, then she would've done this <i>ages</i> ago! Kelia was acting <i>so</i> well behaved!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe practically pounced from there: taking the statement as a means to go carte blanche with her idea. Maybe it was because of the surprisingly pleasant way the scribe turned out, or perhaps there was simply something to taking a proud warrior, and making them a tad more demure, but Ori was giddy with the possibilities!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pair of eggshell colored, knee-high socks, were first to claim the redhead, with their cotton sure to aid in abating the cold. An elongated dress then followed: blue, with gentle, white highlights, and a hem that draped down to her calves. Feminine frills adorned it, but not to a <i>terribly</i> absurd degree: a careful line needed to be ridden, lest 'Kelia' come off years younger than she actually was, thanks to her limited 'assets.' Unfortunately, the mary-janes she was further adorned in, likely did nothing to defer a sense of regression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most notable change in character though came to the royal's facial features: hair pulled back into a bangless, braided ponytail, while a set of glasses, similar to Sean's, were rested upon her brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I don't need these, Ori!\u201d Kelos interjected, mid-makeover. She had worries that they'd make her vision blurry, but strangely, she saw fine in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFashion before function, dear sister.\u201d The older sibling tutted, as she finished tying the last loop in her target's tresses. \u201cThey're fake. I've worn them occasionally during meetings to 'smarten myself up,' especially while going through documents. But now they're yours, and I <i>must</i> say, they make you an absolute dish!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos blushed heavily at that. She'd like to think she didn't have have experience with gowns and skirts before, but childhood memories were swiftly cropping up. Those times Ori ushered <i>him</i> off into one of the castle's many closets, and made the <i>oh so manly prince</i> (who didn't know any better) swish and giggle, until they were inevitably caught by a dutiful maid. There was even that time he got wrangled into playing with Mother's makeu-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow then, we just have a few finishing touches up here!\u201d Orianna beamed, as she pulled out her personal cosmetics kit. \u201cAfterward, we can show you off to the guards, and ask what they think! Won't that be fun~?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spectacle-laden royal was coming to the conclusion that tonight was going to be a <i>very</i> long night.</span></div></div>",

Kelos never gave her the respect she deserved, but \"Kelia\" was much more aware of her older sister's greatness. \"I may have helped, but it will ultimately be you who succeeds,\" the older princess said, feigning modesty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting across from them, Sean, who had taken to calling herself Sionna, rolled her eyes at this display. Kelos, no Kelia, she corrected herself, had adjusted well to being transformed. Probably due to Orianna's coaching. She had had no such assistance and found this body deeply uncomfortable. Worse, she had spent the majority of the trip attempting to inform the princesses on the state of affairs in Teutonis and had little opportunity to find a way to undo this. Still, as long as the mission was successful, she would have plenty of time to figure out what went wrong back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the guards knocked gently on the window of the carriage. \"We're arriving now,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Orianna replied. She then turned back to Kelos. \"It's time for your big debut, Kelia.\" Kelos smiled weakly in response. \"Remember, call yourself Kelia, think of yourself as Kelia, be Kelia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll try,\" Kelia replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That goes for you too, Sionna,\" Orianna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do my best, Princess,\" Sionna replied half heartedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the carriage came to a halt. Orianna was the first one out, followed by Kelos, and then finally Sean. The three of them stood in the courtyard before the gate to the main keep. A soldier from Tuetonis was having a conversation with the captain of the guard detachment. This was certainly not the welcome any of them had expected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't there be someone here to meet us?\" Orianna asked. \"Or does Teutonis do things differently?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There should be, Princess,\" Sionna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll find out what's going on,\" Kelia said. She then approached the soldier talking with the captain. \"Excuse me,\" she said. \"I am Princess Kelia of Grovan. Might I ask if there's a problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no problem, Princess,\" the soldier replied. \"The King has simply decided he should meet you personally, but is currently in a meeting. He shall be here momentarily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well,\" Kelia said skeptically. She returned to Orianna's side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the problem?\" Orianna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The King will greet us personally but is running late,\" Kelia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so it's that old keep them waiting to throw them off trick,\" Orianna replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it seems,\" Kelia replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter waiting for nearly half an hour, the gate began to rise. As it did, twenty women, wearing rather impractical armor that left quite a bit of skin exposed filed out in two columns. They took positions on either side of the gate. Finally a tall man walked out. He was thin, but still had some muscle definition, especially in his abs, which were entirely visible due to his lack of a shirt. \"Welcome to Teutonis, ladies,\" he said. \"I trust your trip here was pleasant.\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Years of training in diplomacy and decorum had Kelos almost <i>instinctively</i> feeling the urge to answer: words forming right on the tip of her tongue. But she held them. Held them, since, as it had been <i>rightly</i> established in the beginning, that <i>Orianna</i> was to be dictating the proceedings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is a pleasure to finally get a chance to meet you, King Aison.\u201d And dictate, she did: gracefully curtsying to the Lord. \u201cI am Princess Orianna of Grovan. To my side here is our Scribe, Sionna.\u201d 'Sionna' stumbled into something between a bow and a curtsy herself: it came off oddly fitting, for the scatterbrained assumptions of her title. Though the jiggle her chest brought probably offered some <i>additional</i> attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd this,\u201d Ori continued: an air of pride growing on her voice. \u201cIs my little sister, Princess Kelia. Here to accompany me during our negotiations.\u201d 'Little Sister Princess Kelia's' face tinged red at that, but with only the smallest hesitation, she curtsied as well. It looked like a young sibling nervously meeting someone for the first time, but not at all unbecoming for the royal that she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh! the pleasure is <i>all</i> mine, Princess Orianna.\u201d King Aison seemed quick and energetic in anything he did, and soon he was upon the eldest Grovan: lending a gentlemanly kiss to her hand. \u201cIn <i>fact,</i> I am hoping this stay of yours will be equal amounts of play as it will be work. You'll find things here in Teutonis are <i>far</i> less... How should we say... <i>stuffy?</i> Compared to where you're from.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough this, as the King offered various pleasantries, Kelia was ignored. Sidelined. Treated secondary to her sister. There wasn't a singular moment between Aison and her sister where she could get a word in edge-wise. This, in its own right, was an... <i>interesting</i> experience. Not something she at <i>all</i> was used to, since, as 'Prince Kelos,' attention was <i>constantly</i> splayed his way. Aison certainly wasn't being <i>intentionally</i> rude, but it did make her wonder... Was this something <i>Ori</i> had had to deal with over the years, and she'd just never noticed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut even still!\u201d Aison had just gotten done speaking of all the luxuries and accouterments they would be afforded at the castle. \u201cWe'll make sure this visit will be <i>plenty</i> educational for your young sister here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe'll be sitting in during our meetings.\" Orianna confirmed. 'Sitting in,' though... Not 'participating.' Not 'being involved...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course!\u201d Aison beamed. \u201cLearning the art of diplomacy is important! Even at her age!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And that caused her teeth to grit. 'Even at her age?!' She was 22! Wasn't she?... That confounding Scribe's magic didn't have some regression spell baked in it, right? Glancing over at Sionna though, seeing the softness of her skin, her features, she was <i>easily</i> believable to be in her late teens, if anyone were to judge. And that's <i>despite</i> her 'attributes.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey say they have a <i>spa</i> here~.\u201d The brunette dreamily whispered, which only led Kelia to rolling her eyes. She was beginning to believe that this was going to be the <i>strangest</i> 'diplomatic endeavor' she'd ever been on.</span></div></div>",

You're so cute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooriii! I'm serious!\" Kelia pouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you pout like that you look at most 14,\" Orianna giggled. Kelia merely narrowed her eyes in response. \"I'd say you do look young, I'd say about 16.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right! Exactly!\" Kelia said. \"And that scribe, even though she's more... developed... she doesn't look much older!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Is my sweet little sister jealous?\" Orianna teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not it,\" Kelia insisted, stamping her foot. \"I was thinking, what if there was some sort of age regression magic in that scroll too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose anything is possible,\" Orianna said. \"But I believe it's more you just look young for your age.\" There hadn't been any age regression magic in the pills she slipped in the tea, and she seemed the same age as before so the scribe's scroll likely didn't have any either. Still. it really couldn't be completely ruled out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which means no one is taking me seriously!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps not,\" Orianna agreed. \"But is that such a bad thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Kelos insisted. \"If no one takes me seriously, I can't be of any use here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not true,\" Orianna said. \"I think you can use it to your benefit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" Kelia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If no one takes you seriously, they won't be as guarded around you. It may allow you to discover things that would normally be kept secret,\" Orianna explained. \"You're a girl now, and a girl needs to use every weapon she has in order to succeed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're saying my youthful looks and natural cuteness are weapons?\" Kelia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and when used properly they can be as potent as a sword. You look about 16, so introduce yourself as 16. That's the perfect age to be learning the art of diplomacy from your accomplished older sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I understand,\" Kelia replied. \"I'll try my best at using my girlish charms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent,\" Orianna replied. \"Now then, let's turn in for the night. We have a busy day of negotiations ahead tomorrow.\"</span></div></div>",

Don't you remember what Sionna told us on the way up~?\u201d Orianna was being a tad obtuse, while simultaneously untying the braid in her sister's hair. \u201cFamily is very important in Teutonian culture! So sharing something as simple as our body heat is <i>perfectly</i> natural!\u201d Of course, she left out the part where it becomes somewhat <i>un</i>natural when those family members 'come of age,' but Kelia <i>hadn't</i> 'come of age.' She was a delightful, impressionable, and oh-so-still-learning-the-ways-of-the-world 16 year old, who <i>greatly</i> needed her older and wiser sister's guardianship!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, that's what she told King Aison, when she requested they share a room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, Kelos failed to earn a word in edge-wise. Maybe it was having to deal with so many new sensation and situations, but the former prince was much less assured of himself as a girl than he ever was as a man, which meant hanging on Ori's words was becoming much more common.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...But was that so bad? As she was guided by the arm to a <i>very</i> ornate and frilly queen-sized mattress, a strangely comforting notion looped through her head: Ori was in charge. She wasn't. She didn't have to bear <i>any</i> of the weight of leadership. She just had to be good, do as she was told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow let's be proper guests, and share our body heat! Shall we~?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonight, at least, 'being good,' and 'doing as she was told,' involved Kelia playing the role of Ori's human-sized stuffed animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-_-_-_-_-_-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMm, a spa~.\u201d Sionna, meanwhile, was currently having her <i>own</i> little adventure: the bespectacled brunette leaning back in a heated pool, with the 'obscene' parts of her chest <i>just</i> rightly obscured by the ebb and flow of the water. It was evident that, even given the late hour, the young Scribe <i>entirely</i> had her priorities set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the very least, she was having much less philosophical quandaries about her role and gender.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-_-_-_-_-_-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelia had to admit, despite a myriad of worries and thoughts whirling around her head, this was oddly one of the best rests she could remember in recent memory. Cuddled up against her elder sibling's bosom, she felt warm, and safe. Protected. It eased her burdens in a way she couldn't rightly articulate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was why she was saddened to find herself awakening to an empty bed, early the next morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOrriii?...\u201d the young redhead mewled: wiping the sleep from her groggy eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was letting you sleep in a bit, Dear.\u201d The older girl gave a calm reassurance, as she sat at an adjacent table: brushing her hair, and going through some papers likely given to her early this morning. Staring out at a nearby window, Kelia couldn't <i>help</i> but give a short gasp, as she noticed it had to be <i>well</i> past dawn!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI- I'm sorry for being so sluggish, Ori...\u201d She stuttered through heated cheeks, as she crawled herself out of the sheets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNonsense! A young girl like yourself needs her rest so she can grow into a fine lady!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was only a slightly teasing tone to her words, as Ori turned back to her work, which caused Kelia's face to burn all the hotter. Truth be told, given her station, she probably <i>wasn't</i> needed to be up early. She had no need to plan for negotiations or treatises if she was just 'sitting in.' \u201cAre those papers for a meeting today?...\u201d She lightly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMm, something like that. Don't you worry about it.\u201d Ori spoke this in the most droll, unfun, flippant tone imaginable: a stark contrast to her mood on just about everything else lately. Like a parent dealing with work, and not wanting their child to get in the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelia was going to interject a bit: maybe ask some questions, until she absently caught a look of herself in a full-sized wardrobe mirror, and it vanquished all other ideas from her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGosh... She looked so... <i>petite.</i> Those were her thoughts, as she inched herself forward, and put a hand on the glass. \u201cOri... are you sure there wasn't any regression magic in that spell?\u201d The... 'modest' size of her chest... The Cherubicness of her face... Her <i>height.</i> Goodness, her height! She was told she came off as 16 yesterday, but this was a 14 year old by any measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrianna couldn't help but giggle, as she sashayed over to her sibling. \u201cOh, I don't <i>think </i>so, Dear~.\u201d Even if she did think so, she might not say anything... \u201cIt's just that without your hair done up, and without your glasses, you look a tad less... <i>mature.</i>\u201d Not that there was much maturity to scrape by with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI... Maybe?...\u201d Kelia's features scrunched up, as she still couldn't naturally believe that this was what she looked like as a 22 year old woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow now, it's best not to dwell on needless worries!\u201d A glint couldn't help but shine in Ori's eyes as she uttered the following suggestion: \u201cWhy don't I help you get dressed~? We've got a long day today!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A dash of make up, the right style, and it would surely allay Kelia's silly fears of getting younger. At least, that was the plan. However, as Orianna put the finishing touches on her little sister's ensemble for the day, one little fact was clear, she really <i>did</i> look younger. \"Oh my,\" was the only thing the elder princess could say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ori?\" Kelia asked. \"Is something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps I have been a bit too dismissive of your worries. I tried to make you look a bit older, but I dare say you barely seem 14.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See! I told you!\" Kelia exclaimed. She rushed over to the mirror to look at herself. \"At this rate I'll be an infant in a week!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now, we don't know if this will continue,\" Orianna replied with as calm a voice as she could muster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't know it won't!\" Kelia replied. \"I could keep getting younger until I cease to exist!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose that is a possibility,\" Orianna conceded. \"We shall have the scribe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" Kelia replied emphatically. \"This is all her fault in the first place! I'll make sure that if she keeps getting younger too she won't get the cure until she's 6!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could ask it King Aison has someone who can look at you. Otherwise the only option is to send you back to Grovan for Xarlet to examine. That will take a few days, and if you continue to get younger, you'll only be 7 or 8 by then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to be an 8 year old again!\" Kelia exclaimed. \"Being 14 is bad enough. But we can't let Teutonis find out! They might figure out who I really am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that leaves Sionna as the only option.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already said no,\" Kelia replied, crossing her arms. \"There's no hope if we leave it up to her.

I'd rather you stay here so I can know how you're doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ori...\" Kelia replied. She put her hands on top of Orianna's. and closed her eyes, smiling. It had been years since the last time she felt Orianna had genuinely been concerned for her. Mother and father had given them this assignment together to help them get closer, and while they certainly didn't expect their son would be transformed into a girl in the process, it did seem to be bringing the two of them closer. Leaving now would risk leaving Ori too worried to succeed, yet would Teutonis even be able to help? Xarlet would easily be able to fix this, so returning home would be a certain cure. \"I've decided.\"</span></div></div>",

She'll do her best to sort it out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the span of a blink, a duo of buxom, scantily-clad spear-wielding women were at Kelia's side, with hands on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you tremendous, Your Highness!\u201d Ori beamed. \u201cOnce we tackle this, we can move forward with our meeting.\u201d Internally the older Grovan was breathing a sigh of relief that this 'small problem' that she... maybe-kinda-sorta was totally responsible for was smoothing over- seeing as how she transformed Kelos in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAison however waved his hand off. \u201cOh, nonsense! We can start right now! Your sister is in the <i>best</i> of hands, and we have much to do!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready Kelia was being dragged off: her petite form no match for resisting the Amazonian types put in her charge. \u201cO- Ori?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKing Aison, I-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrianna was interrupted. \u201cOh, I know you're concerned, but if you want Kelia to grow up, playing mother hen so much certainly won't help!\u201d The Teutonian heir hopped out of his chair. \u201cSeeing a spellcaster live is equally as educational as any meeting she could peer in on!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing between each other for a moment, both sisters ruminated that it couldn't be <i>too</i> bad, right?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The guards whisked Kelia through the countless twists and turns of the castle's corridors on the way to their alchemist's lair. Kelia wondered if it was really necessary to take such a convoluted path, or if it was attempting to confuse her so she couldn't find her way back on her own. Either way, it made the trip seem to take forever. Eventually though, they arrived at a corridor leading to a large door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The head alchemist's lab is down there,\" one of the guards said, pointing, but making no moves towards the door herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We shall remain here to escort you back to your room,\" the other added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelia looked up at the guards, then towards the door, then back up to the guards. \"You're not even coming to the door?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards looked nervously at each other, then down to their small guest. \"No, well... You see... Privacy!\" one of the guards stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that's it, you should have privacy!\" The second guard gave the first a look as if to say good job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Privacy, you say?\" Kelia replied skeptically, looking the two guards in their face. Despite their nervousness they did appear sincere. She then turned towards the door. \"I thank you for escorting me here.\" She then approached and knocked. The door opened, and a spectral hand beckoned Kelia in to a black void beyond. Part of her wanted to turn around and leave at this sight, yet the seriousness of the issue simply wouldn't allow her to wait. Kelia took a deep breath, then stepped through the doorway. As she did, the door slammed shut behind her, and she was left in complete darkness. Taking another breath, Kelia steeled her nerves and called out. \"Hello? I'm here to see the castle wizard.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those words, Kelia felt a sudden rush, as if she were moving faster than even a horse at full gallop could manage. An instant later the darkness cleared, and she found herself face to face with a woman who appeared to be in her late 20s wearing a bright pink outfit with a skirt that came barely halfway down her thighs, and a blouse that left her belly completely exposed while also showing off her ample breasts. This was clearly not an outfit a servant would wear. Kelia concluded this must be the magician. \"Look, if this is about my late cookie bill, I told you girls, you'll get your money!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cookie bill?\" Kelia replied with an extremely confused look. \"No, I'm in need of your help. You're the castle magician, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, oh good. Just forget you heard me say that,\" the woman replied. She then took a bit of a sterner tone. \"I am the head alchemist, not some pull a rabbit out of the hat magician.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should hope not, I have a problem that only someone well versed in real magic can help with!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alchemist's face lit up at this. \"Excellent, excellent. Tell me all about your problem!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting younger,\" Kelia said. \"I'm not really a young girl, I'm supposed to be 16!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, I see,\" the woman replied. \"Yes, aging backwards is a well known symptom with many possible causes. Tell me, how long has this been happening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since the day before yesterday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's quite a rapid onset,\" the woman replied. \"Very well, we shall need some readings!\" She snapped her fingers and the room changed. In the center was a small round platform about a foot high and two feet in diameter. The top was flat with a magic circle drawn on it. Next to the platform was a rack with a pink robe. \"Take off all your clothes, and I mean everything, undergarments included, then put that robe on and stand on that platform. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dress buttons in the back,\" Kelia said, blushing slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" the woman said. The same spectral hand that opened the door appeared, unbuttoning Kelia's dress before again vanishing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Kelia had finished undressing and put on the robe. \"I'm ready,\" she said, as she stepped onto the platform. \"Oh and forgive my rudeness, I haven't introduced myself, I am Princess Kelia of Grovan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let's begin the diagnosis, Princess! No matter what, don't move.\" the woman said without giving her name. The room suddenly filled with lights of all the colors of the rainbow. Kelia shielded her eyes, yet it seemed to do nothing, almost as though the lights were going right though her body. This lasted for several minutes before finally ceasing. \"Okay, you may step down now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelia complied, as a scroll appeared in the alchemist's hands. \"Might those be the results?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, they are,\" the woman replied as she unrolled the scroll. \"You said you are Princess Kelia and you're 16, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just going to ask, are you being truthful with me? These results are...\" She paused to pick the right words before continuing. \"They're strange for a 16 year old girl with your reported symptoms. If you're not being honest with me, any treatment could have unexpected side effects.\"</span></div></div>",

Here she was, practically in her birthday suit, regressed to almost half her real age, and without her 'big sis' to offer any guidance. All that insistence of allowing someone else to be in charge might have started to drum up a submissiveness in the young teen, that previously would have readily held a poker face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, can you keep a secret, Miss Alchemist?\u201d She asked sheepishly. Experience had shown to her as well that lying to a wizard was not a good idea. Xarlat could get very... thorny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAllenia!\u201d The peculiar spellcaster noted. \u201cYou can call me Allenia, dear. Allenia the Alchemist. It's why I prefer the title so much to 'wizard,' or something so much less alliterative!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat caused a slight smile to tilt onto the teen's features, before she somewhat wilted again. \u201cWell, the truth is, Miss Allenia... I am not exactly 'Princess Kelia...' I'm actually more <i>Prince</i> Kel<i>os!</i>\u201d Her voice noted in a more heightened, revealing tone, before a lump swiftly occupied her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrince Kelos?\u201d The alchemist parroted: turning her eyes towards the others' chest. \u201cDear, you're not exactly developed, yet, but I wouldn't call you a boy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT- that's not what I meannnt!\u201d Kelia rapped back in a stuttery, mildly whiny voice. \u201cIt's... embarrassing, but on the way here, I accidentally did something- I think it was a magic scroll from my scribe, and it made me a princess! It made me a girl!\u201d She said, shifting her head down to hide away. \u201cBut it did even more, I think... Now I'm getting younger, and I'm not sure what to do!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoooh, I see, I see!\u201d The wizard said, growing much more enthusiastic as the situation elaborated, and the 'problem' grew. One thing she was <i>certainly</i> becoming appreciative of was just how <i>adorable</i> this girl was! So shy! \u201cAnd you want me to fix all that? Turn you back into a boy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN- no!\u201d Kelia was actually quick to correct. \u201cI- I can't go back to being a boy yet. I made a big debut here in Teutonis as a girl! The whole regression issue is humiliating enough...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm.\u201d Allenia's lips pursed, as she put her hand on her chin. \u201cWell this <i>does</i> complicate matters somewhat. And you said it was a scroll that did this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI... think so? My scribe is a bit of a dolt.\u201d Kelia huffed: crossing her arms. She didn't know where Sionna was right now, but she sure hoped she wasn't enjoying herself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInteresting! Well, I asked all this because there were some strange oddities in the results of your test. I was detecting <i>multiple</i> enchantments on you from <i>multiple</i> sources. The gender change helps explain things!\u201d The magician nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelia was not in a nodding mood. \u201cSo I got cursed <i>twice?</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I wouldn't call being as cute as you are a 'curse,' but changed, definitely!\u201d Allenia teased. \u201cAnd I'm sad to say, it's <i>more</i> than twice! But I think I have the answers- Did you know the clothes you came in here with were enchanted? Did you know the glasses you're <i>wearing</i> are enchanted?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe youth's eyes widened. \u201c<i>What?</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMinor enchantments, really, but they add up! It feels like something someone dabbling in alchemy themselves might try. Clothes that always adjust to fit the wearer, and glasses that have some minor translation properties to them! You can probably read different languages you don't know right now!\u201d Allenia revealed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA light bulb went off in the youth's head. Ori dabbled in alchemy all the time... This was probably something she did to her own clothes, and didn't think anything of it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut yes! I think that might be the concern! Overexposure! Those minor little additions added onto the cocktail of your gender spell, and now you're getting younger!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelia's brow furrowed. \u201cS- so what do we do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alchemist took a step forward, and in one lightning fast motion, pulled the glasses off the girl's eyes. \u201cThere! Part one of the problem solved.\u201d She chirped: placing them onto a nearby desk. \u201cYou need to go cold turkey on the magic for a tiny while! You should stop getting younger if you're not exposed to it. But for now, you'll just have to be a bit smaller and cuter!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe royal's mouth moved, but words failed to articulate. It was... <i>good</i> she supposed that she wasn't getting younger now? But she was hoping for more! \u201cW- when can you age me up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm, perhaps by the end of your trip? Though, truthfully, if you want to go back to being a man, you might just want to wait until your Grovan wizard can see you! I hear Xarlat is a <i>real</i> charmer!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then he remembered, he was going to travel to the northern villages today! He sprang out of bed and opened the window. The sun was still low in the sky, so he hadn't overslept at least, but he did need to get moving. He hurriedly dressed and strapped on his sword. He stood in front of the mirror and drew it and re-sheathed it a few times. \"Perfect form\" he thought to himself, as he opened the door and stepped into the hallway. He heard a clacking of heels, and turned to see a young maid walking towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, your highness,\" the maid said, giving a polite curtsy. \"May I ask what you would like for breakfast this morning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prince thought for a moment. \"I don't have time for breakfast,\" he replied. \"I'm in a hurry today, I'll just have hard tack on the road.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maid made a pouty face. \"That's not a suitable meal for the heir to the throne,\" she insisted. \"But if that's what you want, I'll make sure your saddlebag is packed.\" She then curtsied again, before turning and heading down to the kitchen. She then stopped, and turned around. \"Oh what time to you plan on returning, your highness? So dinner can be ready for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It depends on how the tour goes, but I'd say 6 at the earliest,\" Kelos replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll need time for a bath, so I'll arrange for dinner at 8, if that's okay,\" the maid said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure that should be fine,\" Kelos said. The maid curtsied again, then left for real this time. Kelos watched her leave, when he heard a voice behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kel, you're up, and checking out the help's ass I see,\" a woman's voice called out. Kelos spun around, angry at the impudence to address the crown prince like that. He was greeted with the sight of a familiar looking woman, wearing the armor of a royal knight. It took him a few seconds, but he finally recognized her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucia?\" the prince asked cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Lady Lucia, Knight of Grovan,\" she replied with a confident smirk. \"First woman to ever hold the title.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why wasn't I told about this? When were you knighted?\" Kelos asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yesterday,\" Lucia said. \"I asked your father not to tell you, because I wanted it to be a surprise. I'll be coming with you on your trip today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm in good hands,\" Kelos said. \"Though I'd like to think I've gotten better than you by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep dreaming, Kel,\" Lucia replied. \"But we'll spar once we get back. I won't go easy one you though.\" She winked at the Prince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't forgive you if you did,\" Kelos said. \"I'm going to beat you fair and square.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The loser buys the winner a drink,\" Lucia said. \"Since you're up, I'm going to make sure the rest of the guards are ready. Don't take too long, Kel. Oh sorry I should probably call you Your Highness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least on duty, Lady Lucia,\" Kelos replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha yeah,\" Lucia replied. \"See ya in a bit then.\" She walked away. Kelos watched her leave as well, but regrettably for him, her armor concealed her curves. \"Don't think I don't know you're trying to check me out too,\" she called back as she continued on.</span></div></div>",

They also mounted their mighty steeds and the group left the castle. They traveled north along a main road out of town. People lined the streets to see the heir to the throne on his way. Kelos rode proudly past the cheering crowds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey thinned as the group approached the edge of the city, and before long they were on a pleasant cobblestone road, well maintained by the Grovan military, with trees lining the sides, carefully pruned to give travelers shade, but not give a place for bandits to hide. The sky was clear, with barely a cloud in sight, and the early morning sun cast long shadows as it rose to their right. It promised to be good weather for the trip. The prince and his entourage passed several travelers and merchants coming the other way, some were from Grovan, and recognized him immediately, while others were from other lands, near and far, who did not. Kelos wished to talk with some of the traders from far off lands, but Lucia kept him on task, as they had quite some distance to cover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun was beginning to rise in the sky as the group reached the first stop, the village of Maesurford. Vast fields of wheat spread out in both directions from the road leading to the hamlet. The group continued onward down the road to the town center the streets were eerily quiet, with no one seeming to be about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kel, I've got a bad feeling about this,\" Lucia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This does seem strange,\" Kelos said. \"It's unlikely the entire town decided to sleep in today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a dog over there,\" a guard said, pointed to their left. A grey mongrel rushed out of the door to the town tailor and quickly approached the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come with me!\" the dog shouted. \"We need to get off the streets fast!\" It turned around and started back to the tailor shop. It then stopped and looked over its shoulder. \"Hurry, you fools!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did that dog just talk?!\" Lucia asked in shock.</span></div></div>",

It meant Kelos had a plan he was sure would work, and more often than not, he was wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not going to try to seduce her. are you?\" Lucia asked, giving the prince a skeptical look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think that's all I do when meeting women?\" Kelos replied with annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Based on past experience, yes,\" Lucia replied instantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos opened his mouth to retort, but then paused for a moment. \"Okay, fair point,\" he said after a bit. \"But that was not my plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what is your plan, my prince?\" Lucia replied with a somewhat sarcastic tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos turned to the dog. \"So this witch, she takes notice of people on the street?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, your highness,\" the dog replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what does she do?\" Kelos asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It depends. Sometimes, the victim will disappear, and something that used to be them will appear moments later. Other times, the victim will be transformed as they walk. Rarely she'll appear before the victim in person, taunt them, then transform them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I can't rely on her coming to me for a chat,\" Kelos said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kel, you can't go out there!\" Lucia exclaimed. \"Who knows what the witch will do to you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't just do nothing, and I won't send someone out to talk to the witch in my place,\" Kelos stated as he turned back to Lucia. He then turned back to the dog. \"What is your name anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apologies, your highness, I'm William,\" the dog replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know where this witch lives, William?\" Kelos asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've heard talk that she lives in the forest, but that is simply rumor,\" William stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What of the people who disappear and return changed, do they remember anything of where they were?\" Kelos asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really don't like where this is going, Kel,\" Lucia interrupted. \"As a knight, I am sworn to protect you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'll be fine,\" Kelos said confidently. He nodded to William to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The ones that came back still able to speak were unable to say anything that could identify the location of the witch's home,\" William said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'll have to hope the witch is in the mood to talk,\" Kelos said. He headed towards the front door. \"Lucia, you and the men stay here. If I fail, try to find a way to warn the castle. I'm sure Xarlat would love to have free reign to fight a witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Kel!\" Lucia protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are my orders,\" Kelos said as he put his hand on the door knob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Lucia said. \"But don't come crying to me when she turns you into a newt or worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to worry about that,\" Kelos said as he opened the door and stepped out. He took a deep breath then shouted, \"I am Prince Kelos of Gorvan! I seek an audience with the witch!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kelos felt his surroundings instantly warp, twist, change immediately. No longer was he in the desolate roadway of the village, where the stonemasons had just begun to lay stones -- no, he was in the middle of what seemed to be a castle, with walls made of stone and not a single window in sight. Chandeliers were illuminating the area, and a red rug extended beneath his feet up a small staircase, with a throne perched on top of it. Someone was sitting in that throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good day to you,\" the figure's voice revealed itself. As Kelos' eyes got used to the dim lit, he noticed that the throne-sitter -- the witch, perhaps -- was not an elderly woman with a crooked nose and a humped back like he imagined her to be. No, she was young -- or at least appeared to be young, with a black as night dress adorning her slim, yet curvaceous figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face... he didn't know how to describe her face. The only two words that came to his mind were charming and mysterious. Her shining black hair cascaded down her neck and back in a strange way -- enchanting almost, and her eyes seemed to pierce into the depths of his soul. But her breasts were perhaps the most distinguished part about her. Kelos had never seen such large breasts before in the country. It almost seemed as if she was made for child-rearing, not practicing dark magicks, and Kelos couldn't imagine how much milk could be contained within her bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And to you as well,\" Kelos replied, bowing. He wouldn't normally do that, but he had to admit that she was currently in a higher and more advantageous position than him. \"I thank you for at least greeting me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't just leave a prince without hospitality, could I?\" She made a wry mouth. \"That would be quite rude of me, especially after you took your time to come seek me. Pray tell, what is it that you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you know what I've come here for,\" Kelos rebuked, clenching his fist. \"After all, you yourself whisked me away from the place of the incident. Why did you turn transform my dear and loyal citizens and pervert their true forms? Was it all for your own entertainment, witch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch stared blankly at the young prince for a few seconds, and then erupted into a burst of laughter. Kelos felt offended. It appeared as if she was laughing at him, mocking him for asking such an innocent question. He frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really do not know anything, do you?\" The witch said after finally settling down. Her laughter had lasted for almost a minute. \"About that dear village of yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it that you mean?\" Kelos' eyebrows furrows. He did not like being made a fool of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I had wandered the world, training and building my reserves of magic, I had met many of people. You see, I have an innate gift to see the purity of people's hearts from birth. These people would have an outer layer of justice, compassion, and virtue covering them, but all it was was a shell, meant to hide their malice, greed, anger, and treachery. Their evil. I had been convinced that a good person does not exist in this world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos remained silent. He didn't know what the witch was talking about, but he knew it wasn't anything good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take your village for instance,\" She continued, nodding at his silence. \"William, was it? He used to hit dogs out of the frustration of a long and hard day of work, leaving the poor creature bruised and battered in order to vent his anger. Why not let him spend the rest of his life as a dog to atone for it? Or how about the blacksmith who would cheat on his beloved wife with that of his neighbor? Is it not appropriate for him to live through the hardships of a woman from now on? Or how about the barber's son who would steal his sister's undergarments to... satisfy his sexual needs? Would it not be better if he served his sister as undergarments himself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos was shocked. He didn't think that humans could be so depraved. He had, of course, heard about individuals performing vile deeds, but he had never thought that his own citizens -- his own people would be the ones to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even so,\" Kelos slowly pronounced, thinking of what he should say, What <i>should</i> he say here? \"They are my people, and by extension, my responsibility. All their actions reflect on me, their ruler. If what you say is true, then they are truly deserving of some punishment in life. But not like this. Let them go, I ask of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha!\" The witch clapped her dainty hands, seemingly amused by something. \"And your true nature finally starts to surface. I am willing to bet you are doing this for your own purposes. Do you want the praise of your father? Or the admiration of your citizens? I have met royals before, and they are one and the same! Shall I look at you for who you truly are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos noticed that her eyes began to shine a golden color, prodding and examining him as they searched for something. They must have finally found what they had been looking for, as Kelos began to feel a kindred spirit fill him. It was warm and soothing, calming all his worries and easing all his problems. It was a good feeling, and Kelos wanted to remain this way for the rest of his life. But alas, all good things must come to an end, as the feeling was harshly cut by a gasp elicited by the witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-impossible,\" she uttered, extending her hand towards Kelos. She suddenly appeared in front of him, most likely through teleportation, and began to stroke his rosy cheek. \"You truly do love your people. I have never seen a soul this pure before, filled with goodness to the brim of the heart. There were dark spots, of course, no doubt due to you being a man. But the rest of it is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that mean you will take the spell off the villagers?\" Kelos inquired, not sure how to feel. It felt like he was getting pampered by his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, excuse my manners!\" The witch suddenly retracted her arm as if though she's been shocked. \"I am Ariadna, the High Witch of the Northern Lands. You ask to take the spell of the villagers? I do not particularly wish to, but if you are willing to take responsibility...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will do it,\" Kelos said without hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well,\" Ariadna replied. \"Then I bid you farewell, and I hope we meet again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelia suddenly found herself in the village's roadway once more, the exact spot where she was teleported from. She glanced around. The villagers seemed to still be cooped up in their own houses, so she decided to examine herself. Her long, red, curly hair was still there, her fine breasts were still propped up by the corsage that she was wearing, and her favorite white dress had still extended to her ankles. It seemed that everything was in its place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems that I have convinced the witch,\" she declared when she walked back into the house and saw a new tall figure standing there, with the dog nowhere in sight. \"The village is now free of the curse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-Kelos,\" Lucia stuttered. \"Is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelia frowned. Who was this Kelos? She didn't know anything about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you are referring to Kelia, the Second Princess of Grovan, then yes, it is me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelia saw Lucia frown. It was a frown that chastised her many times when she was young and in the wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kelos, don't tell me the witch actually cast a curse on you!\" Lucia shouted at him, waving her finger. \"That's why I didn't want you to go alone. You are really selfish, you know, always trying to solve all the problems by yourself. Now you up and turned yourself into a girl! What will I tell your father?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucia, please,\" Kelia begged with a hushed tone, \"As you can see, nothing has happened to me. My clothes and my figure have remained the same. I have always been a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-Kelos...\" Lucia uttered in an already frightened tone. \"You mean you don't remember being a Prince? All those times we sparred with swords together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sparring?\" Kelia asked. \"I would never do such a barbaric thing! And you probably should not either. You're a girl too, after all, but you hardly ever wanted to play dolls with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dolls? I... I would never...!\" Lucia blushed, obviously taken off-guard. Kelia smiled. Oh how wrong she was. Maybe Orianna could not force her to partake in the activity, but two small streams of tears and she was running to Kelia to satisfy her whims. Still, Kelia thought that it was quite strange that Lucia thought that she was a boy. After all, she was a princess of Grovan!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I actually do not recall of any Kelia or Kelos,\" William suddenly piped up, entering the conversation. \"As far as I'm aware, Orianna is the sole heir to the throne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two ladies looked at William and then back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See?\" Lucia pointed. \"His mind was probably affected by the spell because of the residual influence of the transformation. His memory of Prince Kelos was wiped, but he didn't gain any false memories like you did!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or maybe,\" Kelia countered. \"His mind built a resistance against the witch's spells. Maybe you had your mind wiped and memories gained, and he resisted that aspect!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both looked at William once more.</span></div></div>",

William shrugged and followed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Kelia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The horses,\" Lucia said. \"One for me, each of the soldiers, and you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's consistent with your memories, but also mine,\" Kelia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I can show my memories are right,\" Lucia said. \"Kel, do you remember how we got here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do, we rode,\" Kelia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what are you wearing?\" Lucia continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My favorite dress,\" Kelia said. \"I'm not sure where you're going with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you were riding a long distance, would you wear that dress?\" Lucia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I suppose I would not,\" Kelia admitted. \"It's not really suitable for riding long distances.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why are you wearing that dress now?\" Lucia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I don't know,\" Kelia replied with a confused look. \"I remember waking up, putting this on and riding, but I wouldn't ride in this, I'd wear one of my riding outfits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, that's proof the witch transformed you and altered your memories!\" Lucia exclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I admit it's possible, and some details about this day don't add up,\" Kelia replied. \"But, if I really was a guy originally, why would the witch transform me into a woman and alter my memories?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, maybe as some sort of price for changing everyone back?\" Lucia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she did say something about me taking responsibility,\" Kelia said. \"But if I don't remember being Kelos, it doesn't seem like I'm paying a price at all. There was something else she said at the end, but for some reason I can't clearly remember what it was... Something about something again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe the two of you are looking at this wrong,\" William said. \"What if it's not a price, but a challenge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Lucia exclaimed. \"That witch is challenging you to overcome her spell and regain your true form!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose that could be the case,\" Kelia said. \"But so could it being a price for changing everyone back to normal.\" She considered the situation.

She was sitting sideways so as to not damage her beautiful dress. She had fond memories associated with it. It was the dress that her sister Orianna had given her, promising to find her the most handsome and suitable prince when she became queen. The thought itself made her blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough it was quite strange. She knew that she should actually be Kelos, Prince of Grovan, the heir to the throne. But in her mind, she was the kind and meek Second Princess, who spent her days at Fia's castle, engaging in tea parties and gossiping about the latest events. Speaking of Fia, the princess felt her heartbeat rapidly speeding up every time she thought about her. It was quite a peculiar sensation, one that she had never felt around her before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucia?\" Kelia called out to the young knight's strong figure. Her eyes unconsciously wandered down her backside, briefly examining it before landing upon her arse. They lingered on the swollen and slightly jiggling buttocks before she shook her head. <i>How shameful of me!</i> Kelia thought, chastising herself.<i> Why was I interested in a woman's body?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" Lucia replied without turning back around. Her voice was so soothing to the princess, yet filled with power at the same time. She always loved hearing that voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you tell me more about Fia? It's just that... she's my dear friend, so I wish to know how I should I conduct myself around her. I wouldn't want to inadvertently cause her pain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's more than that to you, Kelos.\" Lucia hesitantly responded, slowing her horse so Kelia may catch up to her, before continuing with a firm voice. \"She's your fiance and you two are supposed to unite the kingdom. I remember how smitten you were when we were both children, always saying \"Fia this\" and \"Fia that\". I was quite tired hearing you rambling about her day in and day out. Though recently you had stopped talking about altogether, talking about your plans for expanding both kingdoms once they were in your grasp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why?\" Kelia was surprised to hear this about her. \"Fia is such a sweet girl! If I was a man, I would do anything I can to devote my love to her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knows?\" Lucia shrugged her shoulders. \"I didn't really inquire about what was going on inside your mind at the time. Speaking of love, do you still love Princess Fia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos hesitated for a second. \"I don't know,\" she finally shook her head. \"I can remember being quite fond of men, yet for some reason, every time I think of Fia, my heart skips a beat. And...\" Kelia realized that her eyes had wandered down to Lucia's arse once more. She reddened. Lucia noticed her gaze as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Checking me out, I see?\" She giggled. \"It seems that there is <i>some</i> Kelos left inside you after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelia's eyes shied away as she wondered if this was the challenge that was imparted on her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Kelia was walking down the hallway of the castle, with Lucia at her side, as she wondered how she should break in the news to her family that she was not the same as before, that she was a completely changed person. She sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, Kelos?\" Lucia asked. Kelia has already gotten used to that name, though it still felt somewhat alien to her, like it didn't belong there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing. It's just that I don't know how I will face my father. He's always a bit tempered and a worrywart at times like these. Sometimes I think he cares too much about me and Orianna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not sure?!\" Lucia snorted. \"What about me? How will I explain that I neglected my duty as your protector and allowed you to go outside to face a witch and get yourself cursed to boot! And right after I got my promotion too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelia wanted to console her and rebuff her statement -- that it was her decision to challenge the witch's authority -- but she didn't have time as the heavy steps of a military figure resounded through the hallway, turning their attention away from the conversation. Someone was approaching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucia!\" Reginald's heavy gait approached her. Kelia performed her customary curtsy. \"I have heard from the messenger that something had happened to my son! What is it? And who is this woman beside you?\" He narrowed his eyes. \"Wait. That hair. Those eyes. They're similar to those of my wife and my daughter Orianna. Are you... Kelos?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, father.\" Kelia affirmed her father's guess with a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReginald turned back towards Lucia. \"You mean to tell me that Kelos was cursed? Where were you when this happened?\" Lucia bit her lip. She didn't have an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father, it's all right,\" Kelia stepped in for her childhood friend. \"It was my fault. I ordered her to stay back. She was simply fulfilling her duty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph,\" Reginald snorted. \"I guess that excuses her of high treason. But she will still receive punishment. Oh dear, oh dear, how will we resolve this mess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's also the issue of the lost memories,\" Lucia added in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReginald froze. \"You mean to tell me that my son does not remember his old father anymore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite,\" Kelia intervened. \"I do remember you quite well, father, but as far as I am aware, I have lived my entire life as a girl. It was only thanks to Lucia that I was somewhat convinced that I am not in fact the Second Princess of Grovan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReginald groaned. \"If that is the case, then I have decided on Lucia's punishment. Lady Lucia, you are hereby stripped of knighthood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Lucia exclaimed, eyes bulging. Her childhood dreamed had always been to be a knight in dazzling armor, shielding His Highness from hordes of enemies with her body as she cleaved a path to victory for him. And now that it has come to this, she had not only set the record for being the first woman to become a knight, but also the record for being the first to lose it as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Reginald continued. \"And you are hereby forbidden to wear suits of armor. You may only wear dresses from now on, as someone befit to be Kelos' new lady-in-waiting. This decree shall last until Kelos returns to manhood. I suppose that is enough motivation for you to find a cure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucia wanted to object, but bit her tongue. She knew that Reginald gave her a just punishment. Kelia spent her time giggling as her father chastised her friend. She did not like seeing her friend inflicted with such misery, but had to admit that spending some time as a woman would do some good for her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that we have gotten that out of the way,\" Reginald straightened himself out. \"It really is a problem that you had gotten yourself turned into a girl at this time, Kelos. After all...\"</span></div></div>",

At least that's how I remember things. Did Kelos enjoy a closer relationship with him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, your memory is fairly accurate in this regard as far as I know,\" Reginald said. \"He has been reclusive inside his manor for quite some time. Only his personal servants have seen him in years, until today. He rarely even replies to my letters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I must see him at once,\" Kelia replied. \"Surely it must be important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is expecting his grandson,\" Reginald said. \"I don't know how he'll react to a strange girl claiming to be Kelos. Plus, your memories are unreliable, which further complicates matters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but nevertheless I must see him,\" Kelia said. She then turned to Lucia. \"You will accompany me, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Lucia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well,\" Reginald yielded. \"He is waiting in my private study.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shall go at once,\" Kelia said. \"It won't do to leave grandfather waiting any longer. Come along, Lucia.\" She curtsied to her father and turned to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Lucia said. She began to bow, but saw Reginald's disapproving look, and curtsied instead, reflecting her new job. She then followed Kelos. After they left Reginald's presence, she asked, \"Should we change first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Kelia said. \"It would take too long. I doubt you have any dresses prepared, nor would there be any that fit me. Despite the resemblance, neither mother's nor Orianna's clothes fit me.\" The two women walked through the halls until they arrived at Reginald's personal study. Kelia paused outside the door. She remembered being a little girl, playing with her dolls while her father worked on plans to defend the kingdom. Fond memories of childhood. Yet none of that was actually real. Nor was anything she remembered about the grandfather she was about to meet. Nor anyone else for that matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay, Kel?\" Lucia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw the door to father's study and it dawned on me, nothing I remember is real,\" Kelia said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Events might not have happened as you remember them,\" Lucia said. \"But that doesn't mean nothing you remember is real. You remember me as your friend, right? That's real. Even if we don't remember things the same way, whether you're Kelos or Kelia, I have always and will always be your friend.\" She held Kelia's hand gently and smiled at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelia closed her eyes and smiled gentle. \"Thank you. I don't know if I could deal with this alone.\" She opened her eyes and looked into Lucia's. \"You're not just my friend though. Father can strip you of your title and make you wear a dress, but he can't change the fact that you're my knight.\" She paused for a moment to compose herself. \"Now then, let's meet grandfather.\" She knocked on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know your there, get in here already,\" an old man's voice called from within.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kelia steeled herself, wondering what events are waiting for her behind this door. She shook her one more time, and gently, yet firmly, pushed it open. The interior of the study room opened itself up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA room full of books. Unbeknownst to all but his close family, King Reginald had somewhat of a guilty pleasure when it came to reading. Whether it be a bright and sunny day, or a dark and rainy one, he would continuously sneak away to his study, abandoning his kingly duties, in order to crack open the newest story that had come out. His wife Latissa would often find him holding his breath as he read a story about a knight in shining overcoming trials and hardships to save a princess, before promptly proceeding to drag him out of the study to tend to the kingdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now, in that study, there was another man -- hunched over with graying hair, peering over a book, before licking his finger to turn the page. Kelia's arrival had caused his eyes to turn upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in, my dear daughter!\" His jolly, croaking voice resounded, as he waved her closer with his bony fingers. \"It is so nice that you've come here together with your friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Archibald, do you...?\" Lucia began, but she was cut off by him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call me Archee, like I told you once before,\" Archibald flashed his crooked teeth at her. \"After all, you are my daughter's friend. Aaah, I remember you two playing with dolls like it was yesterday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls exchanged glances, both of them with bewildered looks on their faces, with Kelia's containing a slight tinge of hope. Could it be that grandfather Archilbald remembered Kelia as a girl? Kelia couldn't help but be filled with hope -- that maybe, just maybe, she was a girl this entire time. Maybe it was the others that were cursed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that hope came crashing down as the cackling voice of her grandfather resounded through the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should... have seen... the looks on your faces!\" Archibald said in between breaths. \"I am sorry for playing such a trick on you. Yes, Kelos, I remember you being a boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelia puffed out her cheeks. Memories of her childhood came flowing back to her, as her grandfather loved playing pranks on people. It seems that she was yet another victim of his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was horrible, grandfather!\" Kelia protested, biting her lip. \"How could you play with a girl's feelings like that? Uh, a boy's feelings, I mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArchibald simply flashed a smile in return, before suddenly changing. His face became stern, and serious, and the air around them changed. Reginald always likened him to a coin, because Archibald's personality was just as two-sided. He would be a jokester one moment, and then switch to being a stern figure the next one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that we got that out of the way, I would like to discuss something with you,\" He noticed that the ladies were still standing. \"Sit down, sit down, don't make an old man feel guilty.\" Kelia and Lucia promptly took a seat, smoothing out their clothes as they did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you come here all of a sudden, grandfather?\" Kelia decided to not hesitate and asked him. She was particularly curious as to his arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because of this,\" he suddenly reached into his tunic and took out a crimson-red pendant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Lucia butted in, observing the marvelous opaque stone. She was not as fond of trinkets as other ladies were, but even she had to admit that it was quite dazzling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An indicator,\" Archibald briefly replied. \"An old hag gave it to me many years ago when I was still a young lad, but it is quite a useful device -- it tells me whenever a curse has been cast on my family. Its original state is a dark, simmering violet, but whenever someone in my family has been afflicted with a curse, it turns into a fierce, crimson red. As soon as I saw it, I knew that I must immediately head to the castle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And when you saw that neither my father, nor my mother or sister were affected, you naturally assumed that it was me, right?\" Kelia inquired, pointing a finger at herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite so,\" Archibald nodded, affirming her guess. \"But now that I have taken a look at you, I think I know what the issue is. You met with Ariadna, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to restrain himself from smirking when he saw Kelia's jaw drop. Lucia slammed her fist against the table. \"How did you know?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, my dear Lucia,\" Archibald made a wry smile. \"It seems that the fate of Grovan's royal family is intertwined with that of the line of Northern Witches. Fifty years ago, I was inflicted with the same curse that Kelos is struggling with now... by Lucretia, Ariadna's mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you know how to break the curse?\" Lucia jumped from her seat. Despite her naturally calm demeanor, she was quite emotional when it came to issues that concerned the prince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do,\" Archibald nodded once more. \"Though it took me seven years to break the curse, during which time I sired my little boy Reginald. Ah... don't tell him that story, he doesn't know about it. Anyways, before I go on... Kelos, tell me what you think of swords fighting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that...\" Kelia wrinkled her nose. How should she answer this? Should she go with an answer that Prince Kelos would have went with? Or should she remain true to herself? In the end, she decided that it was best to stay honest. \"...swords fighting is a brutish activity that should stay outside the hands of girls.\" She flashed a side-glance at Lucia, who simply shrugged her shoulders in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, I see!\" Archibald reached over and clapped her shoulder. \"I was the same. Back when I had to spend my days as a princess, I was quite... erm, feminine, so to speak. I loved to sneak into the royal kitchen to make pastries. My sister Liliana used to tease me for that. But I am sorry to say that it will be your biggest hardship. You yourself do not want to return to being male.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you meaning to say that feminine activities will keep me... a woman?\" Kelia quizzically asked, catching the flow of the conversation. Archibald silently nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In order to break the curse, you must embrace your male self. Swords fighting, hunting, archery... and yes, this includes love towards females as well. This is why it took me so long to break the curse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelia hesitated. She realized what her grandfather was speaking of for a while already, but she just couldn't accept it. Her embracing a female and making love towards her? Preposterous! Unholy! How sinful! A proper lady should never entertain such thoughts. But then again, she wasn't really female, was she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I'll do it.\" Kelia slowly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Prove it.\" Archibald smiled, though that smile carried hints of pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prove that you will be able to overcome your female self. Prove to me that you will be able to embrace your fiance. Kiss your companion here right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\" This time it was Lucia shouting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelia hesitated. On one hand, this was her friend with whom she played since childhood, with whom she entertained no such thoughts before. But on the other, she must overcome this trial, if she wants to right her memory and her self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she do?</span></div></div>",

Though some part of her found the idea enticing, it just wasn't proper. And besides, Lucia was almost like a sister to her. While Kelia hesitated, Lucia did not. She embraced Kelia, bent her over and kissed her deeply and passionately. Kelia's eyes popped open in surprise, but that quickly passed. Soon she found herself returning Lucia's embrace and returning the kiss. It was improper, Lucia was her friend, her knight, and they were both girls, yet still, it felt right to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not quite what I had in mind,\" Archibald said as Kelos and Lucia slowly separated from their kiss. \"But it's a start. Tell me Kelos, how did that kiss feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It...\" Kelia paused and looked over at Lucia blushing, then continued. \"It felt natural.\" She stepped to the side and snuggled up to Lucia. \"And romantic. A princess and her knight in a forbidden love.\" Kelia was practically swooning as she latched onto Lucia's arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Lucia, I fear that by initiating the kiss, it didn't trigger the male parts of Kelos' mind,\" Archibald said with a sigh. \"In fact, it seemed to appeal quite strongly to Kelos' currently feminine senses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, sir,\" Lucia said. \"I was only trying to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Archibald replied. \"You must remember, this curse is not something that can be beaten in a single day. With my guidance and support from friends and family, it should not take seven years, but it will still take time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would it be so terrible if I remained a woman?\" Kelia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, terrible isn't quite the way to put it,\" Archibald replied, trying to pick his words carefully. \"However, it's important for the future of the kingdom that Prince Kelos marries Princess Fia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the doors burst open. \"Grandfather! What are you doing to my sister?!\" Princess Orianna shouted as she stormed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ori!\" Kelia exclaimed, seeing her older sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Orianna, this is between Kelos and I,\" Archibald said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard what's going on,\" Orianna said. \"Kelia, it's perfectly fine for you to remain a girl if that's what you wish. Father, grandfather, your confused friend here, they all want to make you who they want you to be. What's important is who you want to be. Come with me, and we'll have some tea and talk. I do so want to hear what your memories of growing up are like.\" She held out her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelia let go of Lucia and took a step towards her sister. \"Wait, don't go!\" Lucia said. \"Sure, she's right, what you want is important, but she's only trying to keep you a woman so she can inherit the throne instead of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A total coincidence, I assure you,\" Orianna said. </span></div></div>",

She was now wearing a simple black dress, which despite its plain appearance was apparently made out of a fine silk. It clung tightly to the transformed prince's new body and accentuated its feminine shape. It billowed out a bit on the legs, reaching just short of the ground. She was wearing a pair of matching heels that were somewhat difficult to balance in. Kelos' new breasts weren't overly large, but well formed. Her black hair, kept short as a man, now extended to her waist. Clearly the witch had transformed her into a woman for some reason. \"Fine, I am apparently Princess Kelos, if that pleases you for some reason.

Easy to maneuver in, if Kelos needed to get away. What more could a princess going to 'parlay' ask for?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I'll go with <span class=\"cppink\">the maid uniform, of course.</span>\u201d The girl <i>swiftly</i> went cup her hands across her mouth, unsure <i>what</i> she was saying, but a cloud fogged her mind: lips instead speaking those words without missing a beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam and the guard briefly looked between each other, before shrugging. It wasn't an implausible choice, and the princess's knight certainly took a small ounce of pride in how he suggested it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI should have an outfit or two 'sensibly' befitting. If that's what you truly desire, Princess.\u201d The transformed pup answered: trotting over to one of his shelves, while another guard, with opposable thumbs, went to help him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos took a moment to shake the cobwebs from her head: slightly confused. \u201cI... do?\u201d She half answered, half asked. She thought she was going in a bit of a different direction a minute ago, but evidently not! \u201c<span class=\"cppink\">Don't forget the headdress!</span>\u201d Couldn't forget the headdress. For a good maid, it was essential! As essential as the apron. All the maids in Castle Grovan wore them immaculately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short while later, Kelos found herself trotting up to William's daughter's bedroom, where she could have some privacy to change, and mentally prepare for the moment at hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And slow down enough to realize that she was a <i>she</i> now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot like it's the first time.\u201d She tsked while under breath: fingering the hem of the oh-so-short skirt she initially found herself poofed into. There were those years back of playing dressup with her sister Orianna. 'Cally-time,' as they called it. There were also those few months as tween when she was stuck enchanted by a necklace, and got to experience a full gender change. Then there was that incident where she spent a month stuck in a girl's finishing school after drinking that transformation potion. Or-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, so <i>far</i> from the first time.\u201d She said with an exasperated sigh. But the maid outfit was new. \u201cMy subconscious is clearly wanting to spice things up.\u201d This was uttered as she rolled a white stocking up her leg. First the left, then the right: enjoying the smooth softness it brought. \u201c<span class=\"cppink\">I definitely made the right choice.</span>\u201d Her voice echoed, with just that electric tinge of... <i>something</i> in it that seemed a tad off...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably just still riding the wave of the spell that that blasted witch cast on me.\u201d This woman certainly seemed powerful, and she was going to need al lher wits about her if she wanted to face the fiend properly! To think she warped Lucia's mind the way that she did! What an awful thing... Imagine someone influencing your thoughts, the aspects of who you were- your very essence as a <i>person!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat anger was left to fall to the wayside however, as she donned the rest of the ensemble. No point in fuming here in her lonesome. There were more productive things she could be accomplishing! Like putting on a dress!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that dress came post-haste. Ebony, with a skirt that 'sensibly' went down all the way to her ankles, which were then proceeded to be covered in 'sensible' flats: easy to work in. Said 'sensible' dress also came flourished in a fluffy, frilly, white white apron, to protect it from any dust bunnies which might assail it. And of course. There was the... <span class=\"cppink\">headdress.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos' gentle fingers crowned herself in it, as she examined her features in the room's sole mirror. Examined her features, and noticed the small blush tinging her cheeks. It made her look quite... 'proper.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">Servile, even! </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just hope Ori doesn't see me like this. I'll never hear the end of it!\u201d The last object to think about was, apparently, for whatever reason, the maid uniform came with a feather duster! \u201cA tad silly.\u201d She mused. \u201cIt's not like I'm going over to clean house. There's a village at stake!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was just about to leave it behind, and go down stairs to greet the boys, when a sideways glance at an adjacent table drew her attention. It was covered in dust. This whole room looked to be in so much more of a state of disarray than when she first entered it. How awful!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell... I do have the tools to assist...\u201d The raven-haired royal raised up the duster, with a slight smile slowly growing more and more on her features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took a scant few extra minutes, but by the time Kelos was done cleaning, she found herself with an extra skip in her step, as she made her way to go greet everyone.</span></div></div>",

Kelos smiled at this, but was soon interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must admit, I expected you to run off as soon as I transformed you,\" a woman's voice said from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the witch, I presume,\" Kelos replied without moving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No points for an easy guess like that,\" the witch replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like to turn and speak face to face,\" Kelos said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, Princess,\" the witch said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that permission, Kelos turned to face the witch.

What can I do for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, let me ask so there are no misunderstandings or false accusations, are you the witch responsible for transforming the people of this town?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you believe me if I said I was not?\" Ariadna asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not see a reason for you to lie about it,\" Kelos replied. \"Besides, what hope is there for an arrangement if I cannot take you at your word?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young witch giggled a bit. \"Fair enough, Princess. I am the one who transformed the town. I suppose you wish me to transform everyone back to normal, and leave the town in peace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, if you would be so kind,\" Kelos said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope,\" Ariadna said. \"Now will there be anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not ask you to do this for free,\" Kelos said. \"I would like to make you a proposition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see what you could be in a position to offer me, Princess, but I may find it amusing,\" the witch replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The current magician of Grovan is powerful, but old and not particularly loyal,\" Kelos said. \"When I become Queen I shall require the services of a new magician. I offer you the job. You would have the backing of the crown, a well equipped magical laboratory, and freedom to conduct whatever experiments you see fit on prisoners.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm impressed, you actually found something you could offer me. I'd love to get a look at Xarlat's notes,\" Ariadna said. \"I'm not really a castle kind of girl though, I much prefer my forest. For amusing me I shall make an offer of my own, I shall leave this town untouched from this day forth and transform you and you alone back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos considered the offer. Sure, the townspeople would remain transformed, but no one else would be, and she'd be her handsome male self again. Not a complete win, and the people of the town might see it as a betrayal, but perhaps Xarlat could help cure the people. </span></div></div>",

So she whipped her long black hair from her eyes and said, \"I accept your offer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriadna's face for the briefest of moments betrayed a look of surprise but it was replaced by a smile, \"Very well, I shall leave this village in peace.  And I do very much look forward to working with you much more in the time to come my future queen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\"  Kelos asked as Ariadna rolled her eyes, \"Fine, future King.\"  Then at these words a wind storm seemingly came from nowhere with dirt and branches flying everywhere and the sound of howling wind along with a faintest tint of laughter were the only things Kelos heard.  When Kelos opened his eyes he saw that once again he was male again, although he was still wearing the same black dress as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very amusing,\"  Kelos said dryly making his way back to the taylor where Lucia and his knights were waiting in the doorway.  Lucia ran up to Kelos as though to hug him but seemed to change her mind at the last second as she came inches away from Kelos but quickly backed off and bowed, \"Kelos, my Prince.  You managed to outwit the witch!  You saved this village!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I suppose I ow!\"  Kelos grabbed his now freshly hit head, Lucia seemed to have decided to forget formalities for a moment, \"Kelos I swear if you ever do something that brash again I will castrate you myself.

I'm the one who has to take the fatal blow for you, I am your knight not some little girl to be cast aside as you play the hero.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point the other knights decided enough was enough and pulled Lucia back and forced her into a bow possition,  one knight said \"Forgive her my prince, she will be disciplined when we return to the castle.\"  While the other added, \"Thank you my prince for saving us, you are truly a great man who would make your father proud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need for thanks, I only did what was best for the kingdom, now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to get out of this dress.\"  Kelos walked into the tailor's and told the dog who had watched the whole thing, \"Please fetch me a new outfit if you would.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog began to growl before saying, \"I will not <i>fetch</i> you anything.  You sold out this village for a little power!  What about my daughter!  What's to become of her now?!\"  Kelos looked at the magically deformed hunchbacked woman and said, \"The witch gave her word leave you all untouched by her magic.  I believe that means she will let you find outside help.  You can feel free to come to the castle and have Xarlat and see what he can do.  But after what I just did to help this village, if you do not trust Grovan I believe Traeven has a decent wizard in Marlin who could also help you.\"  William's daughter stumbled up to Kelos with a decent looking outfit adorn with purple and silver trimming.  \"Thank you, I wish you and this village the best of luck.

Kelos noticed this and slowed his horse until he was riding alongside her. She turned her head away still angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't doubting your ability,\" Kelos said. Lucia just ignored him. \"I don't think of you as just a little girl, but we were fighting a witch. No matter how skilled you are with a sword, it won't help if you're turned into a newt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucia was still looking away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand I put you in a hard position, but you understand what would have happened if we attempted to fight the witch right?\" Kelos asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucia hated to admit it, but Kelos was right. Despite her skill with a sword, that witch could have given her a form incapable of even holding it well before she could have brought it down on her neck. But really that was the problem, despite all her hard work, when the time came to defend her prince, none of her skills mattered. \"I need to learn magic,\" the knight said at last. \"At least enough to get close enough to strike against a witch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you wish,\" Kelos replied. \"But I think it unlikely that we'll run into many more witches. Though some magical wards built into our armor should become standard after this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Riders coming up on us fast, your highness!\" one of the knights in the front called out. Kelos and Lucia both looked up to see three men in palace guard uniforms on horseback approaching at a full gallop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something must have happened,\" Lucia noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed,\"Kelos agreed. He flicked the reins and headed up to the front. \"Coming?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Lucia replied, following.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe riders saw Kelos' group and slowed as they approached.

He then dropped his saddlebags and as much extra weight as he could do quickly. \"Lucia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" the knight said as she did the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The rest of you gather out belongings and come as quickly as you can,\" Kelos orders.

No one remembers what the petitioner looked like or what they were wearing. The guards can't even agree if it was a man or a woman.\" Sean said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure this person left?\" Lucia asked. \"They could be in the castle still, waiting for their chance to cause more problems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We aren't sure, but we think they left,\" Sean said. \"At the very least there haven't been any new reports of magic. Orianna had the castle guards put on alert for anyone who doesn't seem to belong here though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's a start,\" Kelos said. He looked over at the children who used to be his parents. \"Did their memories get changed too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't know,\" Sean said. \"They haven't been very cooperative. All they've been doing is fighting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can see if they know me,\" Kelos said. He walked over to the kids. \"Hello there.\" he said as he knelt down next to them.</span></div></div>",

Though they may not suit a Princess. If you wish, I can make you a custom...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no need to go that far,\" Kelos said.

I should simply strip you of your title, but that will not stop it.

But then others of us prefer to do things the natural way and conceive a child with a man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kel, you can't be offering what I think you're offering!\" Lucia gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am,\" Kelos replied. \"I will bear your child, Ariadna.

I'd say it will take at least another two years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two years?\" Kelos asked. \"You can nurse the child yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's better if the birth mother does,\" Ariadna insisted. \"On the child's second birthday, I'll come and claim her, and turn you back to a man, if you so wish. If you turn this down, I'm leaving, and will continue to play with your precious subjects, beginning with that knight girl you're so fond of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well,\" Kelos said. \"I accept.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent choice, Princess,\" Ariadna said as she waved her hand.

That takes courage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or foolishness,\" Lucia muttered. Kelos glanced towards Lucia indicating that he heard it, but said nothing to rebuke her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only did my duty,\" Kelos said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call it what you will, but you saved this town,\" William said. \"As such we must celebrate!

The handsome young prince, confronting the witch, holding firm even after being transformed into a woman, impressing the witch with a steely resolve. Word of Kelos' feat spread far and wide. Many compared him to the champions of yore, and nearly all felt Grovan would be in good hands when he finally ascended the throne. However, the tales being told left out one key detail, that the prince had agreed to once more be transformed into a woman and bare a witch child. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet this same detail weighed on Kelos' mind for quite some time. Time passed, days turned into weeks, weeks into months, and still no sign of Ariadna was seen. Deciding not to let promise with the witch dominate his life, Kelos moved on. He traveled to Treaven and asked for Princess Fia's hand in marriage. After months of courtship, the two consummated their relationship, somewhat before the wedding date, and Fia was now carrying the heir to both kingdoms. The date was thus moved up to maintain the illusion the child was not conceived out of wedlock. Now the day of the wedding finally arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm telling you Kel, that witch is going to try something today!\" Lucia exclaimed. \"I need to be in my armor, not this!\" She gestured down to the ball gown she was wearing. It was crimson red, as chosen by Fia for the bridal party, hanging off her shoulders, with a V neck, loose flowing sleeves, and a billowy skirt. While the Princess didn't particularly like Lucia, partly out of jealousy of her friendship with Kelos, the prince insisted that she be a bridesmaid, so there would be someone trusted close at hand to his bride if there was trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not so bad,\" Kelos said, tying the sash on his dress uniform. \"At least that dress lets you conceal some weapons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you've had some experience in the matter, but I have no idea what you're talking about,\" Lucia replied, playing innocent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure,\" Kelos said. \"I appreciate your concerns, but the odds that witch will pick today of all days to collect on the promise are quite low. Both Xarlet and Marlin are here and have made sure to seal the church against magic. Now you need to join the rest of the bridal party.\" He placed his hand on Lucia's shoulder trying to be reassuring. \"And if something does happen, I'll have you right there to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That kind of smooth talk is going to get you in trouble with the princess,\" Lucia joked. \"But fine, just don't say I didn't warn you when you're borrowing her clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If something happens you have my permission to tell me you told me so every day,\" Kelos replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll make sure I do,\" Lucia said. \"And one more thing, Kel. Congratulations.\" With that, she turned and left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos watched her leave, then went back to final adjustments of his uniform. Taking a last look in the mirror, Kelos left to head for the chapel. </span></div></div>",

He looked around the hall and saw no one. \"Maybe I didn't get enough sleep,\" he muttered to himself. He turned a corner then saw a pile of bedsheets right before smacking into someone, sending the sheets plummeting to the floor. He looked down and saw a maid who had fallen on her butt and looked dazed. \"Are you alright?\" Kelos asked, as held out his hand to help the maid up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, of course, your highness,\" the maid replied as she reached up and took Kelos' hand. \"It's my fault for piling the sheets too high... AH! They're all over the floor!\" she exclaimed as she got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as long as you're not hurt,\" Kelos replied. He looked at the maid. She was young, probably in her teens, fairly pretty but not extremely attractive. Her hair was dark brown, tied back in a bun. Her eyes though were an unusual shade of brown that almost looked red. She was also entirely unfamiliar to Kelos. \"I don't think I've seen you before. Are you new?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes I am, your highness,\" the maid replied as blushed and gave a weak smile. \"My name is Amicia, and I just started working at the castle this week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Kelos said with a smile that came off as a bit of a smirk. \"Well, I know for a fact that the head maid isn't very appreciative of girls who drop the laundry.\" He looked her over. While her face was pretty, she had what the prince would describe as a near perfect figure. \"Though I must admit I do appreciate a woman with a bit of a clumsy streak. How about we get to know each other a little better tonight, Amicia?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love that, your highness,\" the new maid replied. She then stepped towards the prince and latched on to his arm, looked up at him, and batted her eyes flirtatiously. \"But why wait until tonight? We can get to know each other better right now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos could feel himself getting hard as the blood rushed to his crotch. \"I would like nothing more,\" he said. \"However, I have duties to attend to, as do you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmicia looked surprised for a brief moment, but shook it off. \"Of course, your highness. Forgive me for being so bold. Could I just ask for a kiss to hold me over until then though?\" She looked up at Kelos with pleading eyes.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Of course,\" Kelos said. Today was apparently going to be a good day. He just met a new maid who not only accepted but eagerly returned his advances. And tonight he would show her the time of her life. He held the maid close, and leaned down to kiss her deeply on the lips. At which point the world began to look dark and fuzzy. The last thing he saw was Amicia's face with a wicked grin on it before he lost consciousness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My head...\" Kelos thought as he regained consciousness with a splitting headache. He tried to reach up and touch his forehead, but found he couldn't move his arm. \"Damn it, how could I have been so dumb.\" He opened his eyes and tried to look around, but saw only darkness, with hints of light coming through a crack in what he assumed to be a wall. He tried to move again, but found it wasn't just his arm, his entire body was immobilized. \"MMMPHH\" Kelos tried to call for someone, but all that came out was an unrecognizable muffled noise. \"So I'm tied up,\" Kelos thought. He tried to move his head from side to side, and could tell from the crack of light that he was turning his head. However, that was the only way, as his entire body had no feeling in it. \"I can't get through the ropes if I can't even feel my fingers,\" he thought.\"But maybe...\" Kelos started trying to rock from side to side. The movement relative to the feeble light source showed this was working somewhat, meaning he was in a chair, rather than something untippable. Before long Kelos toppled to the chair to the floor with a loud thud. He hoped whoever had captured him wasn't close by so he'd have time to work his way out of the ropes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on in there?\" a woman's voice called out, dashing Kelos' hopes. He heard footsteps approaching the door, which then swung open. An older woman stood there. She was thin, practically bones, her skin wrinkled, and her hair mostly white with some faint traces of black, her age not yet removing all color from it. \"Ah looks like you're awake at last, deary,\" she said with a wicked grin. \"That girl caught a real prize this time. Maybe a bit dumb, considering how you fell right into her trap, but you'll still do nicely.\" She walked over to Kelos and righted the chair with ease, which surprised him, given the woman's frail appearance. She then headed to the window and pulled a curtain open. Light poured into the room, revealing it to Kelos. The room had a bed with four large wooden posts, a free standing wardrobe, and a woman's dresser with a small mirror on top of it, though angled away from Kelos. The furniture looked decent, of solid construction, but lacked some of the elegant trim the prince was used to. It seemed to belong to someone who was well off, but not rich. \"Since you're awake, I'll be a good hostess and let you have some light.\" She then left the room, locking the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft alone again, Kelos looked down to see how he was tied up. As he did Kelos was shocked to discover:</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"MMPPHHH?\" Kelos exclaimed, muffled by the gag. The prince was looking down at an ample bosom, the gap between the breasts peeking out through the top of a low cut, light blue woman's blouse. It was a sight Kelos normally enjoyed seeing. However, this time the perspective was reversed, these breasts were firmly attached to his, \"hopefully still his,\" Kelos thought, chest. That hope faded quickly as Kelos looked over the rest of what was undeniably now her body. Kelos' formerly broad shoulders were now narrow and feminine. Kelos' arms were much thinner, though still well toned. Looking further down, the blouse was part of a light blue dress. It shimmered in the light and seemed to be a high quality material, but was plain, without the fancy embroidery Kelos was used to seeing in the dresses his mother, sister, or Princess Fia wore. The dress concealed Kelos' legs, but it clung tightly to her torso, showing her new female figure. \"So I've been drugged, kidnapped, and turned into a woman,\" Kelos thought. \"When I get out of this, I must have a talk with the head of the castle guards. Clearly they aren't vetting the new maids well enough. Either that or someone let an imposter in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill unable to feel her body, Kelos examined the ropes holding her to the chair. They didn't seem particularly strong, but certainly enough to hold her. A rope was wrapped around her waist, holding her body fixed to the back of the chair, while other ropes held her legs to the chair's. She couldn't see her hands, as her arms were tied behind her, but most likely there was some rope holding them together as well. With her body still numb, there wasn't much she could do at the moment. She turned her head towards the window. It had thick iron bars covering it, and was fairly high on the wall. Looking out, Kelos could only see the clouds and an occasional bird. She then turned to examine the rest of the room. Nothing seemed odd about the furniture. The stone walls seemed sturdy, and the door looked to be constructed of stout wood, as did the floor. This may have looked like a bedroom, but Kelos was getting the impression of a cell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith nothing else to do at the moment, Kelos tried to hop in the chair over to the mirror to see how she looked. Better yet, if she could knock it down, she could use a shard to cut the ropes. Before she could get even a quarter of the way, the door flew open again. \"What are you doing this time?!\" the old woman exclaimed as she burst into the room in a surprisingly spry move. Clearly she was not as she seemed. She smiled as she saw Kelos had moved the chair closer to the mirror. \"Well, if you want to see your pretty new face that badly, I suppose I can help you with that. She walked over to the dresser, picked up the mirror, and brought it over to Kelos. \"Here you are, deary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos' eyes popped wide open as she looked at her new reflection. Even with the gag covering her mouth, looking back was one of the prettiest women she had ever seen.  Pretty, yet familiar. Her hair was unchanged, and Kelos could see traits of her male face, just softened, which somehow worked astonishingly well. \"Well, I can tell you'd be at a loss for words even if you didn't have that gag in your pretty little mouth,\" the old woman said. She took the mirror away and placed it back down on the dresser, this time, so Kelos could see it. \"I'll leave you to fall in love with your own reflection, Princess. If you're a good girl and don't make me come back in here for the rest of the day, maybe I'll take that gag off so you can hear your lovely new voice too.\" With that the old woman left, leaving Kelos to stare at her reflection.</span></div></div>",

She decided all she really could do is be a good girl and wait. So she did. Minutes passed, then hours. The transformed prince found feeling slowly returning to her, as she became aware of the silken fabric her new, feminine body was clothed in. She also began to feel the need to go to the bathroom. Fortunately, the old woman returned, \"Well, you did behave yourself after all, Princess. As a reward, I'll take that gag off.\" She approached the captured royal and removed the gag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than thanking her captor for showing some kindness, or uttering idle threats, Kelos' first words with her new voice were straight to the point. \"I need to go to the bathroom.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old woman let out a small cackle at this. \"Very well, Princess. We'll take care of that before I take you to see your hostess.\" She stepped back and snapped her fingers, causing the ropes holding Kelos to immediately fall to the ground. \"Do take care in standing up. Heels can be quite challenging if you aren't accustom to them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos stood, and took a step with ease. \"I have had opportunity to become accustom in the past. Now then, if you'll direct me to the toilet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, if you'll come this way.\" She gestured for Kelos to follow. The transformed prince walked effortlessly behind her. \"Will you be needing any assistance in the toilet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe I can manage,\" Kelos said with a hint of snark. As they arrived, Kelos rushed in to relieve herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most of our guests have trouble walking in heels and need assistance their first time in the bathroom,\" the old woman commented through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My sister enjoyed dressing me up when I was little,\" Kelos replied. She noted the \"most of our guests part.\" Clearly she was not the first man to have this happen to. This meant her captors were likely good at what they did. She was now free of her bonds, so incapacitating this old woman and escaping seemed possible, but something still seemed off about her. Kelos finished her business in the bathroom, and exited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling better, Princess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much. I'm curious to meet this hostess of mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right this way, dearie.\" The old woman led Kelos onward towards her captor.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"As if I'll just sit here tied up and be a good girl,\" Kelos thought as the old woman left. Still, she was in a precarious situation. Her body was still numb, though she was starting to feel a slight tingling in her fingers. But even once she got feeling back, she was still tied up. Hopefully the kidnappers weren't that good at this and she'd be able to undo them. If all else failed, there was the option of breaking the mirror for a shard of glass, but that would surely attract attention. Plus, there was no way to know how many kidnappers there were. The only person she had seen here was the old woman, but there was also the fake maid with the brownish red eyes. That's at least two people. It could be just the two of them, but it would be dangerous to assume that. Plus, where was here in the first place. Kelos had no idea how long she had been out. It could have been hours, it could have been days, which means a long trip back to Grovan in this feminine body. Not a prospect she was looking forward to. She sighed, then began trying to move her fingers and toes to see if she could speed up getting feeling in her body. As she did so, she thought back to home. Surely they were at least aware of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, back in Grovan, the castle was in chaos with news of the prince's disappearance. Guards had searched every nook and cranny of the castle to find Kelos, yet hadn't succeeded. Nevertheless, the did find some clues. Lucia approached the throne with Jex, with the evidence they had collected. \"Your highness,\" Lucia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your report,\" Latissa said impatiently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our search was unsuccessful in finding Prince Kelos,\" Jex started. \"However, we did find several clues to what happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only clues?\" Latissa asked with an angry glare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We believe we have enough evidence to reconstruct the events of the kidnapping,\" Lucia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on,\" Latissa said. \"But do so with haste. Every minute we delay is a minute these abductors have to take my son farther away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We found the Prince's clothing in a supply closet near his room,\" Jex said. \"Further we found a fake maid's uniform in a supply closet near the gate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While conducting interviews with the palace staff, many of them reported a maid they didn't recognize,\" Lucia said. \"She's described as having an amazing figure and brown eyes that seemed almost red. Earlier today some of the staff saw this apparently fake maid helping a woman who seemed very drunk. When asked, she told them this woman had 'spent the night in the the Prince's bedchamber.' I woke Kel... Prince Kelos up personally this morning. He was alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The guard at the gate reports a woman in normal clothing helping another woman who seemed intoxicated out of the castle and into a waiting carriage,\" Jex said. \"The woman was described as having the same brownish red eyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're saying this woman disguised my son as a woman and that was enough to fool the guards?\" Latissa asked, with a cold anger behind her words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite,\" Lucia said. \"The theory we're working on is the fake maid used some sort of magic to transform Kelos into a woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The guard at the gate took a close look, and insists the woman he saw being carried out could not be a man in disguise,\" Jex said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Latissa said. Her eyes narrowed at the news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Kelos had begun to make some progress. Feeling had finally returned to her fingers, and she was able to feel out the knot in the rope. It was a standard bind, with a short lead. Had it been tied to the base of the chair, Kelos would have had less room to work, but as it was, she was able to feed it back through the knot, loosening it just enough to get her hands free. Once her hands were free, she undid the rest of the binds and was finally free. \"That took long enough,\" she whispered to herself after removing the gag. She stretched her new body for the first time, though it still mostly felt numb. She thought about trying to stand, but thought better of it. Without being able to feel her feet yet, she'd likely just fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos carefully lowered herself to the floor. She then crawled over to the window as quietly as she could. Once there, with the wall to support her, Kelos pulled herself to her feet. Thanks to a combination of the numbness and the heels she discovered she was wearing, she almost fell but Kelos was able to catch herself. She then peaked out the window, hoping there'd be a landmark that would tell her where she was. Unfortunately, all she saw was forest off to the horizon. Kelos sighed. She still might not know where she was, but at least she was free of the ropes. This left the next step of getting out of the room. The old woman seemed to have pretty decent hearing, so she couldn't make too much noise. Then again she could set a trap.</span></div></div>",

She leaned against the wall and removed her heels, as the last thing she needed was them clicking on the floor. After placing them on the floor carefully, she examined the window. It was just large enough for her to get through, but the iron bars seemed well secured. Even in her normal male body, Kelos thought she'd have little hope of budging them. \"Well not getting out that way,\" she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos then made her way to the wardrobe. As she crept across the room, she noticed the first feeling from her legs since she was a she. The swish of her dress passing over her stockings sent a wave of pleasure through her body with each step. Not only pleasurable, but also nostalgic. Long suppressed memories from childhood flooded into her head.  \"How do I look, Ori?\" Kelos remembered asking long ago. The then young prince stood in front of a full length mirror wearing a red dress, white stockings, red mary janes, and a long brown wig. Orianna then replied, \"You look very pretty, a perfect little princess,\" to which Kelos smiled happily. It was a game they often played. Orianna would dress her younger brother in her old clothing, and they'd pretend Kelos was her sister, at least until a servant caught them. She took a breath and focused, then proceeded to the wardrobe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos carefully opened the door, making sure it didn't squeak. The inside was stuffed with dresses of all colors and styles. She looked through them and noticed something odd, they all seemed to be different sizes. Kelos pushed a dress clearly sized for a plump woman aside to find one clearly sized for a young girl, only for one for a thin, tall woman to be behind it. Clearly this collection couldn't be for the same person. Looking on the bottom of the wardrobe, Kelos saw a wig covering a collection of shoes also of varying sizes. Picking up the wig, the blonde strands of hair cascaded down, almost hitting the floor as she held it. Something seemed strange about it, almost as if it was speaking to her, telling her to put it on.</span></div></div>",

Surely such things were beneath him, but a guilty look around confirmed she was still alone and unobserved. Checking the underside for poisoned pins, or other traps, she walked around the little room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a shrug she decided, 'Where's the harm?', and dropped it into place. The full length mirror allowed her to preen and pose for her own amusement. Surprising herself she did enjoy the experience. Flicking her head she mimicked the court ladies who had fought for his attention. The faux-casual glance that sent her hair flying ... just so... That made her look so bedable, and coquettish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as those last realisations sank into Kelos' mind, she went to rip the wig free. However, the wig had other ideas, pain lanced through her head, as the wig warmed quickly becoming painfully hot. Her fingers dove into her hair to pull it free. Instead finding it rooted into her skull. The answering pain quickly stopped her efforts, but that wasn't the only problem Kelos faced, as the weight increased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mane of hair was erupting from his skull. Wave after wave now flowing down to his broad hips. Clutching it in disbelieving hands, it overflowed, as if racing for the floor. Brushing down Princess Kelos' thighs, it was become awkward and fuller bodied, seeming to billow in too many directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPacing anxiously, Kelos soon found herself kicking it out of the way. The growth relentless, until it reached the floor. She wanted to shriek, to rage against the unfairness of it all. This punishment for simple curiosity far outstripping the price. Kelos scowled at her reflection, even now, she looked more feminine. Her face finer, paler, more delicate and feminine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8f8f01114fc5e37c0a29f0de2e2aca7b/tumblr_ptm5ftGr9K1w2lwkto1_540.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://66.media.tumblr.com/8f8f01114fc5...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos looked every inch the princess. With a gasp, a tightness crushed Kelos' ribcage. She looked down just in time to see 'the girls' bubble upwards. Each looking fuller, riper, and abundantly squeezable. Their sheer size ensuring their obvious display, the tightly bound corset ensuring they had nowhere else to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis nightmare imprisonment was getting worse by the moment. Charging for the stone balcony Kelos trailed a train of hair behind her. The lustrous locks more degrading than she could've imagined just moments before. Her hands clutched at the stone wall, unsure whether she was about to throw herself off, or shriek her outrage to the indifferent forest.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Quietly, slinking behind the bushes, dashing across open areas, whoever this person is, they're clearly trying not to be seen. A thief? One of the crown's agents? No matter who they are, it seemed like they had nothing to do with the kidnappers. Though Kelos considered the possibility of it being a ruse, the kidnappers attempting to see if she had indeed gotten free. However, Kelos quickly rejected that. After all, there was no reason for them to bother when they could just check on occasion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiguring she had nothing to lose and freedom to gain, Kelos decided to try to get the mysterious stranger's attention without alerting her captors. \"Hey, up here!\" Kelos said, trying to simultaneously whisper and project her voice, something she recalled doing as a child to get her sister's attention late at night. She made a small wave with her hands, again trying not to attract too much attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure didn't seem to notice and continued their stealthy approach. Annoyed, Kelos searched the balcony, and found a small piece of stone that appeared to have broken off the wall. She picked it up and hurled it at the figure with all her strength. The stone flew true and hit the stranger square on the forehead. \"OWW!\" the figure called out. They looked around and finally spotted Kelos. \"Ya dumb bitch, ya coulda put my eye out!\" they shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh!\" Kelos replied, putting her finger to her lips to try to get this person to quiet down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't ya shush me!\" the indignant figure shouted back. \"Just because I'm in yer garden don't give ya the right to chuck rocks at me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not my garden!\" Kelos shouted back, figuring that by now her captors had heard the intruder. \"I was kidnapped!

Then she noticed the changes that Kelos had undergone. \"Did you put on the wig?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that Kelos ran to the balcony and leapt towards the figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are ya dumn an' crazy?\" the person shouted back as Kelos flew through the air. Despite protesting the mysterious person did position themselves to catch Kelos. This was made easier by Kelos' hair again stretching and spreading out to slow her fall. Rather than a thud, Kelos floated gently into the stranger's arms. \"Well ya coulda told me ya could do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know myself,\" Kelos said as the stranger put her down. She put on her heels. \"We need to go, now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOOO!\" the old woman screamed from the balcony as she watched the two figures below rush out of the garden. \"Don't think you can escape me that easily! I'll hunt you down before you can ever return home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's with yer hair?\" The stranger asked as the two of them ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Kelos said. \"I put on a wig that must have been cursed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems a useful curse,\" the stranger replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It isn't the worst curse I fell under today,\" Kelos replied. \"More importantly do you know of a place to hide until I can find a way back to Grovan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might know a place to lay low,\" the stranger said. \"But it'll cost ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have any money at the moment,\" Kelos said. \"However, I'm sure my parents will pay handsomely for my safe return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry yer pretty little head about it, girl,\" the stranger said. \"I know how ya can pay yer way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't do anything unseemly!\" Kelos insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ain't asking ya to work in a brothel if that's what yer thinkin'\" the stranger replied. \"Besides, can't ask a guy to stick it in crazy.\" Kelos huffed but didn't interrupt. \"Might be a wee bit unseemly though. How well can ya control that hair of yers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not very well,\" Kelos said. \"It can somewhat do what I want it to, but it seems to act mostly on its own. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I was thinkin' we go to a tavern,\" the stranger explained. \"Ya flirt with some guys who look like they got some money. While ya chattin' them up, yer hair takes their cash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to be a thief?\" Kelos replied. \"I'm a princess!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yer broke and ya need a place to stay,\" the stranger replied.</span></div></div>",

A warm, tingling sensation spread down the prince's throat and into his stomach.

Hair began to snake down his back. The prince looked for all the world like a woman now, but one last change was still coming. He felt a tightness in his crotch as his genitals retreated inward, completing her transformation. The new princess stood there in stunned silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go, sis,\" Orianna practically sang. \"Let's get you into more appropriate clothes for a princess, and begin your training.\"</span></div></div>",

It seemed Orianna was dead-set on having things <i>exactly</i> her way when it came to the wedding, and resisting wasn't much of an option on the table: the newly minted princess having been swept off quicker than a single 'eep!' could escape her lips!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't help that as a dozen or more thoughts shot through her head, Ori would just <i>not</i> stop talking! She was chipper as chipper could be: blabbing on about how they were going to have <i>so</i> much fun together, and how she was <i>so</i> glad to share such a 'momentous event' with her <i>sister.</i> Various servants and maids looked on in confusion and interest, as the older redhead, with a radiant smile on her face, spoke <i>quite</i> loudly: boldly proclaiming about Kelos' current gender preferences for any who'd listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for Kelos, several little things couldn't escape her attention: emphasis on 'little!' <i>Little</i>, like how she had to force herself not to stumble, since her boots were too big... Or <i>little!</i> Like how, as the magic settled, it appeared she'd found herself shrunken to a good head <i>shorter</i> than Ori! Or well, <i>little,</i> in how much frailer... <i>weaker</i> she was suddenly feeling. How years of training in strength and martial prowess had so easily melted away with a sip of a potion, to now where, even if she tried, she doubted she'd be able to pull herself free from her sister's grip! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe <i>easily</i> could've gotten herself lost in an overwhelming whirlwind, if it wasn't for the thunderous *<i>SLAM!</i>* of a door!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos blinked: breaking free from her head-space, and realizing she wasn't within the hustle and echo of a corridor any longer. \u201c...Your room, Ori?\u201d Goodness, she hadn't actually entered it in <i>years!</i> It'd been deemed 'improper' for a prince to regularly intrude on such a feminine space... Occasionally she wondered, <i>blushing mad</i>, if her secret 'Cally-time' had slipped its way on upward to someone, and that the mandate was made to prevent any 'odd habits' from developing further...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, Dear!\u201d The older girl beamed: welcoming her in. \u201cMother and Father might've raised a fuss a few minutes ago, but there's nothing wrong with two <i>sisters</i> sharing some private time alone together, is there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI... I suppose not?\u201d Kelos replied: taking it all in. Orianna's taste had refined a fair bit compared to when they were younger- in particular a decently sized alchemy table, with beakers, and vials, lined a corner, but her eyes couldn't help but rest on the giant walk-in closet. Still giant, even as an adult. As silly as it was, her heart was starting to thud. She... She was about to have some 'Cally-time' as a real gir-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent! Now be a doll and hold still while I help you strip!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha?... EEK~!\u201d Kelos was <i>completely</i> at the other girl's mercy, as she sputtered and mewled upon having every last vestige of her maleness flung through the air and left strewn across the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd across a nightstand... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd a chair...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This body would take a lot of getting used to. \"What have I gotten myself into?\" she asked herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Found it!\" a voice cried out from the closet. Orianna quickly emerged, hold a scarlet red dress. \"This will look darling on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos' heart raced as she looked at the dress her sister was holding. This was extremely embarrassing, but somehow exciting. A memory then flashed in her head. She saw herself, as a little boy, trying on dresses with Orianna. She was wearing a dress, the same shade of scarlet as the one Orianna was now holding, swishing from side to side. Orianna was also dressed up, wearing their mother's old wedding dress. Kelos remembered asking a question, \"Ori, can I be your bridesmaid when you get married for real?\" With that Kelos' jaw dropped in realization and a tear trickled down her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kelos?\" Orianna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did... Did you remember all this time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't forget a word my darling little sister said to me,\" Orianna replied. \"Now let's get you dressed and do your make up and hair. I'll help you for now, but you're going to have to learn to do this all yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos wiped her tear and smiled. \"Of course, if you teach me, I'll be a perfect princess in no time.\" Orianna wasted no time. She helped dress her new sister, showing Kelos the exact order to put everything on. Before long, she was fully dressed, standing in front of Ori's mirror.</span></div></div>",

Soft hands caressing against her soft skin: welcoming even softer fabric to makes its way home. This was the first time in well over a decade she got to be attired in something so delicate, and it rightly caused her heart thump like a pounding drum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her reflection only led to a greater welling of emotions. Kelos saw herself. <i>Her</i>self. As if she'd stepped into an alternate world. A world where the roll of a die landed different. A world where 'Cally-time' wasn't deemed 'wrong.' A world where she always <i>was</i> Cally. Raven hair now cascaded down the arch of her back, much like when she was a child. It'd been cut short to be more 'princely' when <i>he</i> grew older, but Orianna's potion swiftly rejected that silly posturing, with silken tresses offering gentle tickles against the new prince<i>ss'</i> cheeks. It created a bold contrast with the fiery gown Ori had selected. It wasn't extravagant- they weren't going to a ball this evening, after all! But it accented Kelos' curves in a way that proudly informed everyone that <i>yes,</i> she was a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos' demeanor however was <i>far</i> from bold in that moment. Eyes were wide, and her mouth was slightly agape: twitching, as if wanting to say something, but instead, only the tiniest gasps escaped. She felt pretty. Pretty in a way where words couldn't earnestly describe. It's the type of emotion where if she threw all caution to the wind- threw all worries and inhibitions, she'd be giggling, and swishing, and tittering on about every little frill. Every little aspect of the new <i>her</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut caution and worry were far from easy to expel, and the confidence she held mere moments ago about being 'a perfect princess,' faded- and the tears returned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetite sniffles and whimpers couldn't help but eek themselves out, as a trail of sobs wet her face. In that moment however, she found herself being wrapped in the arms of her taller, older sister: head guided warmly against her bosom. \u201cShh. Shhh~.\u201d Was all the redhead cooed, as she rested into the crown of Kelos' locks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI- I'm sorry, Ori.\u201d The transformee mewled: wiping away some of her droplets. She was thankful no cosmetics had yet been applied. \u201cIt's- it's a lot to take in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, Little Sister. I know.\u201d Orianna whispered sympathetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow will- what will I do about Mother and Father?\u201d The girl asked in concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd <i>that</i> was when a smile tilted its way up Ori's features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy~.\u201d With a flash, Kelos found herself twirled like a ballerina to look Ori in the eye! \u201cYou will do nothing but be a perfect princess, of course! And an even <i>more</i> perfect bridesmaid!\u201d She happily exclaimed: the two sisters' noses practically touching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning back as a dancer caught in a dip, Kelos couldn't help but blink. \u201cUm, Ori... I don't believe you can be 'more perfect' than something...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTut tut tut!\u201d Ori teased: putting a finger to Kelos' mouth in a 'shush.' \u201cI can assure you, Little Sister, with my help, and the time we'll be spending to prepare for the wedding, you <i>will.</i>\u201d The royal finished by releasing her companion in one final, almost choreographed flourish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut if we are to debut you to Mother and Father properly, we'll need you to be complete! And <i>no</i> proper princess is complete without makeup!\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Orianna squeezed Kelos' hand, gently, trying to reassure her. \"Don't worry, everything is going to be fine. Mother and father will just adore their new daughter, I'm sure of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so,\" Kelos replied with a shaky voice. She looked up at Orianna with uncertainty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just remember, be confident in your decision,\" the elder princess said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother, father,\" Orianna began. \"When I asked you for permission for Kelos to be a bridesmaid for my wedding, you told me you would allow it if Kelos agreed to it, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Reginald replied with a chuckle. \"But we both know there's no way my son would agree to prancing around in a dress for your wedding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kelos agreed,\" Orianna stated. \"It's time, little sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn that queue, Kelos walked into the room, heels clacking on the tile, revealing her new form to her parents. \"Mother, Father, it's true. I agreed to be a bridesmaid at Ori's wedding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What sort of prank is this, Orianna?\" Reginald shouted angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kelos, is that really you?\" Latissa asked in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is, mother. I have decided to accept Orianna's invitation. However, since I do not simply want to be prancing around in a dress, as father so eloquently put it, I have further agreed to be transformed into a woman so I might become accustom to this form and learn how to act properly for the wedding. To that end, please accept me as your daughter, not your son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has everyone taken leave of their senses?\" Reginald exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all father,\" Kelos replied. \"I simply could not refuse such a heartfelt request from my dear sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted Kelos by my side on my special day, and she wanted to be there,\" Orianna added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kelos, what of your engagement to Princess Fia?\" Reginald asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will write Fia explaining the situation,\" Kelos said. \"I'm sure she will be understanding. Our marriage wasn't scheduled until after Orianna's anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your birthday is before that,\" Latissa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I shall have a memorable and unique party this year,\" Kelos replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious about this, Kelos?\" Reginald asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am, father. I intend to be the perfect princess and bridesmaid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king sighed. \"If I cannot change your mind, I must allow this. However, I cannot have you allowing your combat skills lapse. Despite your present form, I insist you continue your sword training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, father,\" Kelos replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReginald looked at his other daughter with a fierce gaze. \"Further, Orianna, I trust you have an antidote to this spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do, father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, you shall give it to Kelos to keep.\" He looked back to Kelos. \"I shall treat you as a woman for now, my daughter. If for any reason you wish to change back, take the antidote.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you father, but that is unnecessary. I am a girl of her word.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReginald winced at Kelos referring to herself as a girl. \"Are you positive Orianna has not given you a mind altering potion as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely,\" Kelos replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. Though it pains me to allow this, if you are willing, you are an adult and can make your own decisions.\" Reginald paused for a moment and swallowed before continuing, \"my daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you father,\" Kelos and Orianna said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kelos, we need to have a mother... daughter talk a bit later,\" Latissa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, mother.\" Kelos replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mother and I have much to talk about,\" Reginald said. \"You two are excused for now.\" With that Kelos and Orianna curtsied and left the room.</span></div></div>",

She'd be sweating up a storm, if a part of her didn't innately feel that'd come off 'unprincess-like.' Just a few more steps and they'd be cleared to the hall. A few more... A few more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*CLACK*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door behind shuttered closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, <i>like a storm herself,</i> Orianna <i>swept</i> Kelos into a possessive hug! \u201cOh my <i>goodness!</i> You were <i>breathtaking</i> in there, Baby Sister!\u201d She gushed: rubbing her cheek proudly against the crown of the younger girl's head! \u201cI <i>knew</i> you could do it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the crush of her sibling's arms wrapped around her now much more delicate figure, the raven-haired royal's features blanched. \u201cBreathtaking... is one way... to point it... Hauuh~!\u201d Each phrase was strained by lung-crushing clutches, which <i>thankfully</i> relented before she got <i>too</i> woozy: gently pulling her out to look eye to eye. \u201cYou might not have not've seen, but I was a nervous <i>wreck</i> inside!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh pshaw!\u201d Ori shrugged in a happy dismissiveness. \u201cNo one could've come out better! Father was always going to be the toughest nut to crack, but you handled it <i>beautifully!</i> Like a <i>princess!</i> A thousand times more graceful than your former self. He called you his <i>daughter!</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe phrasing of 'coming out,' and 'former self,' were left at the wayside, as Kelos found herself awash in the pleasant buzz of compliments. \u201cYou... really think so?\u201d She asked with a timid blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know so!\u201d Ori answered without missing a beat. By now they were walking through the halls again. \u201cThis was always going to be the hardest part. Dealing with the rest is only going to be a matter of formalities. Then our fun can begin!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir <i>fun</i> could begin? Kelos raised a curious brow at that. \u201cWhat 'formalities' are you talking about, Big Sister?\u201d With the turns they were taking, it seemed their heels were clacking back to Ori's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing of <i>major</i> importance~.\u201d Again, a 'happy dismissiveness.' \u201cIt's just Father requested you have an antidote serum... So I should perhaps make one, right~?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos felt an involuntary shiver. You mean her sister <i>hadn't</i> already had one on hand? That she... <i>fibbed</i> to Father? That, <i>in this moment,</i> she couldn't <i>immediately</i> turn back? A squirminess started wriggling around in her tummy. But it wasn't the... <i>worst</i> squirminess? It was similar to that naughty feeling of 'misbehaving,' every time she and Orianna played together when they were younger. Quite hard to pinpoint and frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiguring out her inner psychological workings would have to wait, as it seems while getting lost in thought, her sister had guided her over to her private alchemy table! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would've <i>loved</i> to have shown you all this much sooner, Little Sister, but circumstances generally prevented us!\u201d Ori chirped. Beakers and bobs, with pouches of herbs, lined the old wooden bench, with some already filled with liquid of curious colors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new Princess would be lying if she said she wasn't vaguely interested. Alchemy was both frightening, <i>and</i> fascinating. It was here especially that she noticed a vial of some pink concoction staring right in front of her that seemed <i>vaguely</i> familiar. \u201cIs that... Is that what turned me into a girl?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy finest elixir!\u201d Orianna beamed from ear to ear: placing a sentimental hand on her sibling's shoulder. \u201cAlchemy is a <i>fabulous</i> art, Dear. It can work wonders!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI imagine...\u201d Kelos answered. There was probably enough liquid left to turn a few more men into <i>former</i> men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm no Xarlat or Marlin, but I <i>do</i> dabble! It's good fun learning transformations both physical, and mental!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMental?\u201d The shorter royal questioned, with some trepidation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh! Don't let Father's fuddy-duddiness get to you! Mental alchemy can be quite... <i>enjoyable,</i> depending on what you brew! Always in moderation, though. You've got to be responsible!\u201d Now it sounded like Ori was giving a lecture. \u201cBut that's neither here nor now! How about we make you that 'cure?'\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething inside was tugging at Kelos just then. A realization that some of her 'squirminess' might go away if she got an antidote. Did she <i>really</i> want that?</span></div></div>",

You know, the basics.\" Kelos wasn't sure just why she was stopping her sister from making that potion. After all, she should want it as soon as possible. Right now she was trapped as Princess Kelos, which should terrify her, yet somehow it didn't seem so terrifying. If anything it seemed... exciting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" Orianna exclaimed, as she one again embraced her new sister. \"I shall teach you everything you want to know about it! Let's start with something easy, a basic healing potion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like a good place to start,\" Kelos agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before we do, I must warn you, crafting a potion requires imbuing the brew with a bit of magic, which I can only do once a day,\" Orianna cautioned while still hugging Kelos. \"If we make this healing potion, I will not be able to make the reversal potion for your transformation today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos hesitated for a moment. If she agreed she would be trapped like this until tomorrow at the earliest. There would be plenty of time to learn alchemy, surely getting the antidote was the most pressing matter. Thus, she should tell Ori to just make the reversal potion after all. That would most definitely and assuredly be the logical, rational decision to make. Ori almost certainly thinks so to, or she wouldn't have even given that warning. \"I don't need the reversal potion. I said I would stay like this until your wedding and I intend to keep that promise.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrianna hugged Kelos even tighter. \"I have such an amazing little sister.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too tight...\" Kelos gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry,\" Orianna released Kelos. \"But the good news is we're making a healing potion. Two if you're a quick study.\" She turned and headed over to the alchemy table. Kelos caught her breath and followed. \"A healing potion is simple. You need three ingredients, dried sage buds, willow bark, and dried chamomile leaves.\" She reached up and grabbed three bottles. \"I have all of them prepared, so we can skip that step for now and go straight to the potion making if you like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to know how to prepare them, but I suppose that can wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent. So we start as if we were making tea from the willow bark. However, it's important to put the bark in the water before applying heat.\" She put some pieces of the bark into a beaker of water, then lit a flame under a metal holder, which she placed the beaker into. Then poured a bit of the sage buds and chamomile leaves into a mortar. \"While we're waiting, grind these up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right\" Kelos said, as she took the mortar and began to grind them. \"I thought you said we were skipping the preparation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They must be dried in a certain way, but to make the potion it's best not to grind them until you're ready to use them,\" Orianna explained. \"Now the important part isn't the ingredients themselves. If you just boil all these up it will not be a potion, though it still will be a nice tea to drink if you have a cold. In that case I'd recommend not using whole pieces of bark, and boiling the water before adding them. For a potion do it this way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand,\" Kelos said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once the water starts looking tan from the bark, we pour it into another container.\" Orianna picked the beaker up with a pair of metal tongs.\"Be careful, it will be very hot.\" She poured the water into another beaker. \"This next step I can't really tell you how, you have to feel it.\" She picked up a metal rod that appeared to be made of copper. \"So we're going to stir in the powdered buds and leaves while adding a touch of magic. I'll hold your hand while you stir. Try to feel the magic as it flows through your hand. Then try to match that. Though you might not feel anything at first. It took me three tries before I could feel it. Now we must hurry before this cools down.\" Orianna gave Kelos the rod and held her hand as they stirred together while Ori added magic.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kelos was doing her best to concentrate. Brow furrowed. Lips formed into a thoughtful pout. To any onlooker, she'd look <i>terribly</i> cute. Stirring, and stirring, wondering what exactly magic was supposed to 'feel' like. Was it the warmth of her sister's hand against her own, new and dainty one? Was it the massaging of her sister's (slightly more developed...) chest into her arching back? Was it the gentle puffs and coos whispered towards her ear, as she was encouraged to not stop?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's right, Little Sister. Almost!\u201d Ori seemed excited, as the beaker's contents began to shift from a muddy, earthy tone, to a brighter, vibrant red: the quintessential color of a healing potion! \u201cNow quickly! Pour it into those vials right next to you! There should be just enough for two!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger of the duo did as told: fumbling her hands and tipping the contents in: adding a capping of corks for good measure, to make sure nothing were to spill out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent, Little Sister, excellent!\u201d Orianna was just <i>beaming,</i> as she swiftly grabbed her sibling into another tight hug. She was growing quite fond of doing so. With Kelos being rather... 'compact' in terms of height, just lifting the girl up and smothering her was too easy. Too fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new princess did her best to brace herself, even as she held a potion in each palm. Being so much weaker, almost in a doll-like way, was another thing which <i>should</i> terrify her, but getting caught in her older sister's embrace, feeling her cheek nuzzle into her crown... There was something about it which was... <i>nice.</i> Very rarely was she treated with so much open affection and intimacy. Even compared to when she was around Fia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuick as those thoughts arrived, they were whisked away when Ori twirled her around to talk. \u201cSo, Little Sister, how have you liked your first taste of alchemy, hm~?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEying the two elixirs she was partially responsible for creating, Kelos answered earnestly. \u201cIt's... quite fascinating, Big Sister. Though I'm not sure if I felt the magic like how you said.\u201d A blush formed in her cheeks while saying that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, <i>pshaw!</i> It takes some time to develop, that's all, Little Sister. Don't worry about it! You might even begin to feel it by as soon as tomorrow's lesson!\u201d A silent confirmation that there would be more training to come... As well as a further delay in that gender reversal antidote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Kelos felt an excitement towards that. Like she was teetering into territory she <i>knew</i> she shouldn't be, but couldn't help but dare herself to step further in...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally, Little Sister, think of this as just your first step!\u201d Her big sister raised up a finger rather astutely. If she didn't know any better, she'd wonder if Ori could read her thoughts. \u201cYou've made a <i>lot</i> of first steps today, and I am <i>so</i> proud of you for taking them.\u201d A reassuring hand went to the shoulder of the recently transmogrified royal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Kelos thought her blush couldn't get much brighter, she certainly managed to prove herself wrong. \u201cThank you, Big Sister... Thank you, <i>Ori.</i>\u201d She added that last bit with additional emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTut tut! Now don't get all sentimental yet! There's still much for us to do!\u201d Ori gave a clap: seemingly in a constant state of giddiness. \u201cSince you're going to be my precious little sister for quite a while to come, we must get your affairs in order! A new wardrobe! Renovating your room! I'm not sure if we'll be able to do it all by nightfall, but never fret! If need be, we'll simply have a slumber party here, and you'll share a bed here with me!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Orianna tittered on and on, Kelos couldn't help but feel like she should take one of these health potions. She was beginning to worry she might be developing a headache.</span></div></div>",

I can't thank you enough. She may even be healthy enough to attend classes soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's wonderful to hear,\" Kelos said, beaming. While healing potions were still the only thing she had successfully made despite all the instruction from Orianna, at least one of them had been put to good use. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you don't want payment, Princess?\" Marie asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not, dear,\" Kelos replied. \"A princess must look after her people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, is it okay if I bring my sister to thank you in person?\" Marie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why that would be lovely,\" Kelos replied with a giggle. \"But certainly don't feel obligated to, and only if she's well enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, of course,\" Marie said. She then realized the time. \"Oh no, if you'll excuse me, Princess, I'm late for my shift!. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just tell Fredrika I had asked you to get me something, and you should be fine,\" Kelos said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, princess\" Marie said. She then curtsied, and left in a hurry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wouldn't do if I were late either,\" the former prince thought, as she continued on her way to meet Orianna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been nearly 4 weeks since Kelos had been transformed into a woman, and her life had settled in to a new routine. Mornings were devoted to sword practice, as she had promised her father. With her now weaker body, it had gone poorly at first, but Kelos had since adopted a new style, relying more on parries and agility, and she was beginning to look somewhat competent again. Her mid day alchemy training was, according to Orianna, going well. She had a good grasp of the basics, but still struggled with more than simple healing potions. The daily lessons also meant the reversal potion had yet to be made. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lack of a way to turn back didn't bother Kelos as much as it probably should have. She was becoming quite comfortable as a princess. She really enjoyed wearing elegant gowns, heels, jewelry, all the fineries of a woman of her station. When she was little she had loved pretending to be \"Princess Cally,\" but the reality of being Prince Kelos meant that had to stop. Now though, she didn't have to pretend to be Cally, she <i>was</i> Princess Kelos. She was also coming to appreciate and enjoy her new duties. Just last week she had hosted a luncheon to raise money to construct a new library, to be open not simply to nobles, but to everyone. Still, there was that voice in the back of her head that was telling her she shouldn't be enjoying this. Though, as time went on, it was getting pushed farther and farther back. She had even begun to wonder if she would want to turn back after the wedding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at her sister's room, Kelos knocked on the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kelos?\" Orianna called out. \"Come on in, sis!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos entered, and saw Ori still brushing her hair. \"Am I early? I thought I was running late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all, a princess is always on time,\" Orianna replied. \"We shall begin your lessons in but a moment.\"</span></div></div>",

Why do anything to risk ruining the mood? Especially not during alchemy lessons!

This time, seemingly already filled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI believe you've <i>already</i> shown me some of your 'intermediate and advanced potion-crafting,' Big Sister.\u201d Kelo gave a light giggle, as she waved a hand over her silhouette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I can tell you've grown fond of the results~.\u201d Ori quipped, walking over with a lilac tinted vial. \u201cA bit of a sister to sister secret though,\u201d Ori noted, voiced turning quieter. In the moment, she was wondering if this could be harder to sell than she initially thought. \u201cA fair number of people take up alchemy not simply for the betterment of others, or to become more powerful, but instead to learn of mixtures that can be quite... <i>enjoyable</i> to personally experience.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos' lips became more pert upon hearing that, especially as she was handed the glass. \u201cLike alcohol?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomewhat, but not quite!\u201d Ori quickly chimed: finger raised. \u201cIt's just us at the moment, and I know your schedule for the day is clear. If you're open to it, I'd be willing to help guide you with... <i>experimenting.</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA redness began to percolate on the younger girl's cheeks, as she turned her gaze to the liquid. \u201cE- experimenting?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI most <i>definitely</i> will not force you! If you like, I can put that away, and we'll instead move to try making a new brew! Maybe one that'd keep people more energized...\u201d A pause in Orianna, as her tone turned more playful. \u201cBut this <i>might</i> be rather fun for you~. I promise <i>nothing</i> bad will happen. This room has <i>always</i> been safe. Just the two of us~.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos truly didn't expect anything like this when she came in today... But at the same time, a part of her was excited. The same part of her that was excited at the prospect of not having a means to immediately turn back to 'normal.' Ori was offering something <i>ab</i>normal. That's what she'd been offering ever since she tipped that pink potion past her lips. And, well, her sister wasn't wrong when she said she'd been growing 'fond of the results.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoodness! Even asking what the potion was, and what it would do, seemed somewhat unappealing. She <i>liked</i> the idea of the surprise. The idea of allowing Ori to do something <i>to</i> her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI... Well... It would be rude of me to decline a precious gift from my Big Sister, wouldn't it?\u201d Turning her chin up, her voice was vaguely sardonic.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, <i>tremendously</i> so! <i>Very</i> un-princess-like!\u201d With Ori laying it on even further: tongue <i>firmly</i> in cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I promised I'd let you turn me into the perfect princess! So I should trust that I'm in your <i>capable</i> hands!\u201d Staring at the drink for a beat, she opted to throwing caution to the wind before better judgment sullied matters: sipping it clean in one fell swoop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNear <i>instantly</i> from that, Kelos began to feel tingly, and her mind growing foggy. \u201cO- oh! Oh...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost unprepared at the quick decision, Ori tried to mitigate. \u201cJust relax, Little Sister. It's okay. I'm here. I'm here and you can hear my voice.\u201d She assured: clasping her palm around the other girl's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInternally however, it's like Kelos was being pulled from the reigns of the horse, and left to sit in the back of the carriage. A lovely purple haze was clouding... <i>everything.</i> Her brain. Her thoughts. Was she standing up, or sitting down? Awake, or dreaming? The only thing she could make out was a voice. <i>Ori's</i> voice. Ori's voice who was telling her she was here. Safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's right, Little Sister. No need to be afraid. Just let yourself drift down, and down... <i>Down.</i> Big Sister is telling you to do it.\u201d Ori watched as the brightness faded in Kelos' eyes, becoming dim and blurred. A general listlessness told the older girl that her sibling was near fully under the effects of hypnosis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, to some aristocrats, this might seem like a precarious scene. A political figure using mind altering substances to turn another official highly suggestible and malleable? That could be horrendous! A scandal! And while true, peering at the tiny line of drool making its way down the new princess's otherwise immaculately touched up features, Kelos was as close as putty as could be at the moment, but there was nothing <i>outright</i> malicious in what Orianna was aiming to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was being honest when she said some people only brewed potions for kicks like these. If she was being <i>extra</i> honest, hearing whispered titters in the library during study sessions were partially what piqued <i>her</i> interest as well. And currently, this was some 'experimenting' unto her own. She'd never actually hypnotized a person before! So this was as much a learning experience for Kelos, as it was for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLittle Sister, can you hear me?\u201d She asked with mild hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMild hesitation was what she got in return. \u201cYes... Big Sister...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh. Oh! That drone in her Little Sister's voice was... certainly something, she noted with a blush. The first time in a long time <i>Ori</i> was on the receiving end of her skin turning scarlet. \u201cYes! Well... good! Ahem, <i>good girl,</i> I should say. H- how are you feeling?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFunnyyyy...\u201d The tranced figure hummed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat- That's fine! Good, even. Good to feel funny!\u201d A pause, as she tried to collect herself. \u201cLittle Sister... Kelos, I want today to be <i>very</i> special, and for you to feel <i>very</i> good and funny right now... But for that to happen, you have to do as Big Sister says, alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo... as Big Sister says...\u201d It wasn't that hard for Kelos to capitulate in that regard, she easily could be coerced into agreeing with those words, hypnosis or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, with a swirling sister, Orianna had a thousand opportunities laid out ahead.</span></div></div>",

Sure, she seemed to be enjoying herself, but Orianna couldn't help but worry it was for show, trying to make the best of a bad situation. Could it be that deep down her sweet little sister really didn't like it, worse resented her for this? She had to find out for sure. She took a deep breath and began. \"Kelos, you will tell me the truth to everything I ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... Tell truth...\" the hypnotized former prince replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you... Do you like being a princess?\" Orianna asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer was a huge relief to the elder sister. She had pretty much been forcing Kelos to do this, but it seemed like she really was enjoying herself. She took another breath and asked another question. \"Are you upset with me for anything I did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrianna breathed a sigh of relief. Apparently she hadn't actually pushed Kelos too far. She decided to move on to how Kelos felt about her current position. \"What do you like best about being a princess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos showed a bit of resistance, hesitating for a moment before answering. \"I like... being... pretty...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOri giggled at the response. She was pretty sure this was something her little sister wouldn't have answered honestly without the hypnosis, instead she would likely try to come up with a more flattering answer. The elder princess decided to push a little farther. \"Do like being a prince or a princess better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A... princess...\" Kelos said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it!\" Ori exclaimed. \"You've come to see how much better being a princess is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've... felt... that... since... I was...little...\" Kelos replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe response didn't surprise Orianna. Kelos certainly seemed to enjoy \"Cally time\" as a child, and while he was growing up, Ori had gotten the impression her little brother was trying just a little too hard. \"Would you like to stay as my little sister then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....\" Kelos hesitated before continuing, \"I... don't... know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there something you want to do that you feel you need to be a man for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... love... Fia...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you can't marry her if you're a woman,\" Ori finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrianna grinned mischievously. \"If I could arrange it so you can still be together with Princess Fia, would you want to stay like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave it to your big sister!\" Orianna proclaimed. \"Have you told her about your transformation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wrote... letters...\" Kelos said. \"But... no... response...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Orianna said. \"I shall think of something.

When exactly she fully returned was unclear, as she maintained a goofy, tranced smile for a long, long time after. For her, it was like being brought out from the pleasantest of pleasant dreams. A sweet, gentle voice, washing over her, and causing her to melt in submission. It didn't matter what exactly was being asked. Or who exactly was asking it. All that mattered were those few, fleeting moments, where it was like her very soul was being wrapped, and cradled, and made to feel <i>good.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was, until she realized everything she said, and felt her face slowly redden up, like a teakettle rising to a boil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO- Ori!\u201d She swiftly belted: head darting left, right, up and down. \u201cW- what I just told you... I didn't... I was... <i>I was...</i>\u201d Her figure was comically trembling: stuck in her seat, mortified, as if she just muttered the most embarrassing secret in the world. Truthfully, it might've been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShh, shh! It's okay, Little Sister, really!\u201d The older royal reassured: leaning in closer, and placing a hand on the other's shoulder. Silently, she was cursing how she didn't do anything to soften the the awakening. \u201cWe were just having a nice heart to heart chat, weren't we~?\u201d She asked, playing dumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raven-haired girl pursed her lips. Was that right? The further away from the magic of the potion, the harder it seemingly was to comprehend she was <i>under</i> the magic of the potion, and well, her very important and lovely Big Sister wouldn't lie, would she? \u201cI- I guess?\u201d She hesitantly stuttered. Maybe... Maybe she just let some things slip... accidentally. Being in this room... Being around Ori... It always made her drop so much of her guard... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore very suddenly, her eyes shot fully opening, and she began to stiffly speak. \u201cYou had me under hypnosis, and made me confess that I prefer being a princess.\u201d And then relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And then swiftly tensed up. \u201cWHAT?!\u201d She barked in complete confusion: jumping to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOri's mouth hung open, and then she remembered something from merely a few minutes ago: '<i>Kelos, you will tell me the truth to everything I ask.</i>' Oh dear... it seemed she accidentally placed a trigger in her Little Sister! She was feeling almost as embarrassed as Kelos was at her confession! \u201cWell. Um. I guess that... did... sort of happen...\u201d Her finger scratched at the side of her cheek, as she held back a cringe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOri, you're <i>unbelievable!</i>\u201d Kelos belted: shooting forward, and looking as incensed as her cutely feminine frame allowed her to look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, Little Sister, calm down!\u201d The redhead was doing her best to damage control: waving her arms back in a defensive manner, while having to stumble back. \u201cI just thought you needed an opportunity to let it all out... Can you blame me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Yes!</i>\u201d Her 'Little Sister' shouted: inching herself up closer in a frazzled aggression. It appeared she had no problem telling the truth to <i>this</i> question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh. Okay. Perhaps.\u201d Her  sibling stuttered: literally and figuratively being pushed up against the wall. \u201cBut was it really that bad?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich caused Kelos to then promptly freeze up again: arms dropping to her side. \u201cNo, actually. I quite enjoyed the loss of control, and the thrill of you having power over me. The risk and perceived danger is what drove me to drink the potion in the first place. Having no particular knowledge of what it would do was exciting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silence occupied that moment was deafening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Until Ori broke it. \u201cWell, that's a bit on the nose, Little Sister, but if you like, we can maybe try some more hypnosis! Or possibly some magic artifacts I so happen to have! We can make a day of it with you experimenting!\u201d She half-cheekily smiled: trying her hardest to lighten the mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos, however, didn't take it so well: promptly turning on her heels, and stomping as loudly as the delicate footwear allowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*SLAM*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCame the sound of Ori's door, as the younger princess promptly exited the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused Orianna to wilt somewhat. \u201cOh dear... Well that could've gone a tad better.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not only had she not come for any further alchemy lessons, she was completely avoiding her older sister. At this rate, Orianna feared things might even revert to their previous relationship before she had helped Kelos embrace her feminine side. That simply wasn't acceptable. Surely there must be a way to repair their new sisterly relationship! Ori poured herself a cup of tea, then walked over to her writing desk and sat down. She took a sip and placed the cup down. \"Perhaps I could drink the same potion?\" she thought. \"Though I don't suppose Kelos would be willing to do to me what she objects to me doing to her.\" She took another sip of tea and continued to think. Something Kelos had said during their last session jumped to the front of her mind. \"Princess Fia! Kelos hasn't heard from her since the transformation!\" She pulled out some paper and a quill. \"Now who in Treaven owes me a little favor...\" She dipped the tip of the quill in some ink. \"Ah yes, the finance minister's wife.\" She then began to compose her letter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dear Lady Sebile<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">It has been quite some time since we have corresponded.

While I am sure there are diplomatic channels that could be used, I am quite reluctant to use such for a personal matter, especially in light of the current tensions between our kingdoms.

She had most definitely not misread it, nor misinterpreted it. Her husband to be was in truth a revolutionary! One who fully intended to usurp the throne of Traevan for his own gain. If there was any usurping to do it would be her who did it! She raced out of her room with the letter. It was still morning, so her sister would likely be taking part in sword training, which their father had so boorishly insisted she still participate in. The elder princess rushed down to the training arena. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos stepped to the side, deftly avoiding the lunge from Jax. She then whipped her foil around and delivered a quick strike to his chest.<br>\r\n\"Point to the princess!\" one of the soldiers Orianna didn't recognize called out. \"Victory, three to zero!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is almost as bad as when you were a guy,\" Jax exclaimed, with frustration in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, I'm just paying you back for your victories before I became accustom to this body,\" Kelos replied, attempting to look innocent. She had her hair back in a pony tail, and was wearing what looked to be a feminine take on the standard padded training armor. While it offered protection, the way it hung on Kelos' hips left no doubt she was currently female. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kelos, this is important, you need to see something!\" Orianna called out. Kelos first turned with a look of annoyance. \"It's a letter from Fia!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fia?!\" Kelos exclaimed as Orianna now had her undivided attention. She bounded over to her sister, who handed over the letter. Kelos eagerly read the letter. This was soon replaced with anger as the younger princess absorbed the contents. \"We must tell mother and father of this immediately! The wedding must be called off at once! To think your future husband is such a vile man attempting to overthrow his king!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps,\" Orianna replied. It occurred to her that if the wedding were called off, Kelos would have no excuse to stay as a woman. Father would almost certainly demand Kelos change back immediately. \"But perhaps if we travel to Traeven and speak to him, he can be cured of his unfounded aspirations to higher station.

We'd be entering right into the middle of a political coup!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girl was swift to counter. \u201cA political coup where your favored Fia is at risk! Is it not the <i>duty</i> of a dashing prince to come to her rescue~?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos took the tease with an indignant pout. \u201cRight now, I'm a <i>princess.</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOri couldn't help but feel a fluttering in her heart. \u201cOh, yes.

She'd make sure to bring a portable alchemy set with her, too! Kelos was a week behind on practice, and it wouldn't do to allow her to keep slacking!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore and more thoughts of this caliber brewed, and as strange as it may sound, worries over the man she was supposed to marry weren't holding as much sway in her head.

The thought of her putting the potion in the wine at her wedding seemed almost plausible. Still, if she had been planning something like that, there would be no reason to transform Kelos first. \"It's unlikely she'd go that far, and if she did, Xarlet is more than capable of fixing the situation. But if it will ease your concerns, Minister, I will talk to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, your Majesty,\" Minister Benoit replied. \"If we know the Princess' plans, it will greatly ease the concerns of the court.\" He excused himself, leaving the king to confront his daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReginald took a deep breath. Of all the ministers, Benoit had proven the most irksome. His popularity with the lower nobility and the clergy meant he was difficult to simply dismiss, a status he used to speak his mind freely. Still, he had sense to do so in private rather than open court. As long as that remained true, he'd at least humor the man. The king left his study and headed to Orianna's room. He knocked on the door as he arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was the closest to the door, Kelos opened it. \"Ah father, what brings you here today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReginald stepped into the room and looked at the new bridesmaids. \"I need to speak to your sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your majesty,\" Jess, Melody, and Sandra said as they all curtsied in unison upon noticing the king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ori, father wishes to speak with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Orianna replied, as she turned. \"Do come in father. Would you care for a cup of tea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'll get straight to the point. The royal court is concerned about your latest actions. Turning Kelos into a woman was already... a questionable decision.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I chose to become a woman, father,\" Kelos interrupted. \"Ori provided me with the potion, but I was the one who drank it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reginald sighed and pinched his brow. \"Regardless of who decided, it left the court concerned. Now you have gone even further, and transformed several of our knights into women as well.\" He looked over at the three women he didn't recognize. Surely these were the ones in question. \"I have heard rumors you have even more doses of this feminizing potion as well. What are you planning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come now, father,\" Orianna replied. \"Must I have some sort of plan? Melody here was simply curious about being a woman after seeing how Kelos has become such a perfect princess. Jess and Sandra decided to try it with her. I shall of course supply the antidote if and when they decide to change back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess and Sandra tried to keep a blank expression as they watched the elder princess effortlessly lie to her father. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I want to change back,\" Melody blurted out. \"Being a girl is great!\" She happily twisted her hips from side to side, causing her dress to swish back and forth. \"You should try it too, your Majesty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An excellent idea, Melody,\" Orianna chirped. She rushed over to her desk and retrieved a pink vial, then presented it to her father. \"I believe you'll enjoy this father. After all, Kelos has not once objected, and look how happy Melody is. I think spending some time as 'Queen Regina' will help you experience a new perspective that will help you become an even greater king than you already are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos, Jess, and Sandra were left speechless at this development.</span></div></div>",

Plus, I believe father will be concerned with other matters than bookkeeping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it best if we go shopping before we hear any more of this conversation,\" Jess said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay! Let's go, girls!\" Melody said, grasping Jess and Sandra's hands and practically pulling them out of the room in her excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter watching them leave, Kelos turned to her sister. \"What exactly are you planning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said, a very, very special potion,\" Orianna replied as she headed over to her alchemy table. \"Father seems overly stressed about such a minor thing, so some 'Cally time' of his own might be just the thing he needs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'll disown us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense, at most he'll disown me,\" Orianna said, as she began searching for the ingredients she needed. \"Do you know if we have any succubus tears? I thought I had a vial, but I don't see it here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I put it over here,\" Kelos said as she approached the table and handed the vial to her sister. \"I am helping you make this potion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but I'm sure a few weeks as a little girl will relieve all his stress and she'll forgive us completely. If not though, she'll still need you to become queen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Xarlot will have him back to normal in a matter of minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normally, dear sister, you'd be correct. However, I know a little secret. Xarlot is going to be leaving to attend a wizard conference where he's to present his research on a new spell he developed.\" She looked at the array of bottles, vials, and jars she arrayed on the table. \"Now then, I believe I have all the ingredients. Let's get started.\"</span></div></div>",

Kelos too was becoming a surprisingly quick learner, as she kept up with most of her sister's beats. A dab of Cottontail Fluff here, an ounce of Youthful Peeps there, and soon enough the duo had themselves a downright <i>electrifying</i> potion that'd take 'years' of burden off any man's shoulders! ...Even if they might not be a man afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it came at a perfectly poignant time, too, as a small cavalcade of half a dozen guards soon marched themselves into Orianna's room without asking permission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOur apologies for the intrusion princesses, but we're here on His Highness's orders to...\u201d This was  apparently the leader of the troop, who was pulling out a scroll. \u201c'Do away with those blasted pink drinks.'\u201d He shuttered the paper, and glanced around, noticing the slightly disarray state of the area. \u201cHave a bit of a party, M'ladies?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCastle Grovan was a rather large estate, and those assigned to royalty like the king weren't necessarily totally involved of the goings on of others. Of course, Prince Kelos' transformation into a princess had spread quite rapidly through the rumor mill, but the <i>exact</i> specifics of how, why, and all of that hadn't simply become second-hand knowledge. Let along the desire to turn a gaggle of willing soldiers into bridesmaids for an upcoming scheme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of this, <i>already</i> gears were spinning in motion within the redhead's mind. \u201cSomething like that! My apologies men- I do hope my father didn't overreact by sending you all here! Kelos and I had a get together with a few girls, and were trying a few specialty drinks! Our lovely king decided to spare a moment of his time and join us, but it seems the brew wasn't to his taste!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it alcoholic?\u201d One of the men asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would figure. His Highness is a bit of a lightweight.\u201d Another chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShh.\u201d Came a third.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEither way, our party is well over at this point. Feel free to do with the drinks however you wish.\u201d Ori motioned for the corner with which they were kept. Several dozen of them in vials, all lined up and pristine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like they're made for shots.\u201d One of the soldiers commented, as each of them took several of the corked bottles by hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cApologies for any rowdiness, Princesses. My men are apparently <i>very</i> ready to retire for the night.\u201d The lieutenant of the squad eyed them with a serious glare. \u201cWe'll take these, and be on our way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFeel free to drink them!\u201d Kelos practically shouted: eyes widening at how quick and eager the words came out. She utterly surprised herself, to the point of where it made very confused inside.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men were already heading out however, but rabble of 'beer is beer,' and 'the guys in the barracks should get a kick from these,' could be heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the room cleared, there was a brief silence, as a fiery blush eeked its way up, and consumed Kelos' faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took all the royal decorum in Ori to not find herself rolling on the floor and laughing in that moment: instead just settling for a chirping giggle, as she placed a hand on Kelos' shoulder. \u201cPoints for eagerness, Little Sister! Though I might suggest something more subtle when we go for Father.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos' heart was thumping, as she put a hand to her chest. \u201cI'm... not sure what came over me, Big Sister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou and I both like pretty things, Little Sister, and we want to put more prettiness into the world. I think it's quite self-explanatory!\u201d Ori assured, as she reached over to the potion they concocted: electric blue, and practically charged with energy. \u201cThough our next target is going to be both pretty, <i>and</i> cute!\u201d</span></div></div>",

We must come up with a plan.\" In truth, Orianna already had several ideas, but thought including Kelos in planning would strengthen their <i>sisterly</i> bond, making it all the less likely she would even consider becoming a man again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need Father to trust us,\" Kelos said. \"It's likely the guards have yet to drink the potions they took.

Though I would like to see the results right away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe you may be disappointed if you want to see immediate results.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" the younger princess asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I did say this was a very, very special potion,\" Orianna replied, with a soft, confident smile. \"The first night it will indeed grant him more energy. Why, I'm sure father will spend the night exploring all sorts of pleasures with mother. The second night, however...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It has a delayed effect?\" Disappointment was visible on Kelos' face. This didn't last, as it was soon replaced my a mischievous grin. \"Ori, I just had an idea! You give father the potion, and ask him to come with us to Traeven. He'll transform along the way, and we can say she's our cousin who will be the flower girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How absolutely devious,\" Orianna said approvingly. \"Though we must hurry if we are to convince father we are attempting to stop the guards from drinking the potions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the two princesses hurried to their father's chambers. \"Father, it's me, I believe we have an urgent matter!\" Kelos called out as she pounded on the door as they arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want now, Kelos?\" Reginald asked as he opened the door. He was clearly annoyed at this intrusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We believe your instructions to the guards you sent to confiscate my potions were unclear,\" Orianna added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unclear? I was quite specific when I ordered them to dispose...\" Reginald's face turned white as he realized his mistake in wording.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They seemed to believe they were alcohol,\" Kelos added. \"Father, I do believe they intend to drink them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blasted fools!\" Reginald shouted as he rushed past his daughters in the direction of the guard barracks.

She'd been dealing with new feelings, new sensations, and new ideas that were difficult for her to understand in such a short time frame. However, it was as if the universe itself aligned, as she and her father rushed into the barracks that early evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome had already transformed. Wide-eyed, innocent looks of confusion on their features, as they found themselves draped in the over-sized clothes and attire that were ill fitting for their new, soft curves. Others were mid-way into the process, with Kelos getting to see first-hand the rough muscle, and chiseled strength, morph into figures much daintier. Much softer. Much prettier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were shrieks. There were cries. There were even a few coos. But by the good graces of whatever higher power looked over Grovan, every bottle of that wonderful pink elixir had found itself passing through the lips of the now former men occupying this station. Reginald of course had groans, and curses of exasperation, as he, like a ruler, tried to bring order to the bevy of new female subjects that were under his charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos though stood back watching all of this. Playing the role of a more passive observer, as her heart couldn't help but thud. Thud. And thud. As a blush couldn't help but burn. Burn. And burn across her cheeks. Every moment of this... <i>girlifying</i> seared itself into her vision. Into her mind. Into her very <i>being</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was somewhere between her father yelling at a very flustered brunette to 'put a shirt on,' and the Lieutenant of the keep doing her best to stutter out a status report, that the raven-haired princess felt a hand gently land on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA marked improvement, wouldn't you say, Little Sister~?\u201d Ori rhetorically asked, with a wink, and a hushed whisper.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tone might've been playful, but something in Kelos very much 'clicked' deep down, as she watched her sister strut forward: carrying a supply of blouses, and various feminine linens, that she acquired on her slower meander over. Kelos was the one responsible for suggesting the soldiers drink the potion. Kelos was the one responsible for all this... <i>girlifying</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd rather than feel shame, or be disturbed, the only thing crossing her thoughts was wondering just how each of these new lovely ladies were going to look in dresses and skirts!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-_-_-_-_-_-_-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy the Maker...\u201d Reginald sat slumped in his throne, with the past few hours having been utterly <i>exhausting</i> for the king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's... quite unfortunate Xarlat has already left for his Wizard's Conference.\u201d Kelos said through slightly stuttered words, and a shifty eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThankfully the maid quarters has plenty of room to house the new girls until he comes back!\u201d Ori clapped her hands, as she attempted to look on the 'bright' side of things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need a vacation...\u201d Reginald barely even registered his two daughters by his side, as he leaned his head back to quell the migraine that was surely brewing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That's</i> when a Cheshire grin couldn't help but form on Orianna's face. \u201cFather, I was actually wondering about that! Since you seem so adamant about me sorting out my engagement, how about you attend our trip to Traeven? It'd get you out of the castle for a few days!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king's hand went to his beard, as he fingered through it in thought. \u201cThat... might just do. If nothing else I could see that pompous oaf Arthras, and gloat over the sorry state of his land compared to Grovan.\u201d His shoulders however gave a tired slump. \u201cTo be honest though, I'm not quite sure if I'm in the state to travel, since I assume you're heading out tomorrow?\u201d His words were pointed, as if to say 'no dillydallying.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos looked to Orianna just then, who proceeded to pull an electric blue vial from behind her back. \u201cThen perhaps I could interest you in this, Father?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...And what is that?\u201d The king asked, dubiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt'll help bring back your youthful energy!\u201d Kelos parroted: intervening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI and my Little Sister conjured it up as an apology for any minor... trouble that we might've caused.\u201d A pause, as she slunk up close to his highness. \u201cIt'll do you wonders, I assure!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dower look appeared on the older man's face. \u201cDo you really expect me to drink a potion, after all the trouble they've caused today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat if I told you Mother especially would love it~?\u201d Orianna teased with an upturned brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's all it took for the ruler to chug it down in a single swig.</span></div></div>",

The former prince turned princess watched as Sandra quickly raced over to help her friend. \"I suppose you do have a point. Still, we will need an entire extra carriage just to carry our clothes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you shall have it!\" a man's voice bellowed from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos and Orianna turned to see their father walking up to the carriages. \"Good morning father,\" they said in uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good? No, it is a glorious morning!\" Reginald took a deep breath. \"After spending the night with my wife, the most beautiful woman in all the lands, I will be taking a trip with my two lovely daughters!\" He approached them. \"Orianna, I owe you an apology. The potion you crafted was simply marvelous, no, miraculous! I doubted the intentions of my own daughter because of a minister with delusions of grandeur. I will never doubt your words again, and you may make all the potions you see fit.\" He then turned to Kelos. \"I owe you an apology as well. I have spent my life imposing my vision of what you should be upon you, rather than letting you become your own person. Whether you wish to remain a woman, or change back into a man, you will have my full support from now on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two princesses glanced at each other nervously. \"My, father, you certainly sound much happier this morning,\" Orianna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Reginald replied. \"Last night was amazing and even though your mother and I did not sleep for even an instant, I feel like I'm a young man who had a full night's sleep!. Tell me, how long will this potion of yours last?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It should leave you feeling youthful for some time,\" Orianna replied. \"How long is up to the quality of the ingredients I used.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We used top quality,\" Kelos added. Seeing her father's sudden change in heart left her feeling somewhat guilty about the changes she knew awaited him later today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I would expect from my lovely and brilliant daughters.\" He then looked to the carriages which still had much to load. \"Now then, I shall show these lollygagging workers how to load a carriage.\" With that, he bounded forward, grabbed a massive create, lifting it effortlessly \"The big ones go on the bottom, not those little ones!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ori?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to say more, father's sudden acceptance is not what I expected. I fear we may have made a mistake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can it be stopped?\" Kelos asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not without removing the youthful vigor which had father so energized,\" Orianna said. \"Plus, I do not think I could make it in time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Perhaps we should just tell father now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose we could, but after all he said, I wouldn't want to crush his new view of us.

Key words being, <i>supposed to be.</i> Ori and Kelos tittering among themselves, as they watched their 'father' transform into something <i>so</i> much cuter, and <i>so</i> much prettier than the rude brute he was acting like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, however, it all got turned on its head: hours spent sitting in a carriage, brooding, and fidgeting, with questions of what to do about the situation. Right now, the two siblings' currently (still) older father was sitting amicably with the group, as they broke for an early evening camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy goodness! So you've known Melody for <i>how</i> long, Sandra?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was rapt with attention, as the blonde, Melody, wrapped <i>her</i> arms around Sandra, and smothered the brunette in a suffocating, 'boobs to the face' hug. \u201cLike, Sandy is my bestest, best friend since for<i>ever!</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmph! Mmph! You are <i>not</i> calling me <i>Sandy!</i>\u201d 'Sandy' protested in a deep bluster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Jess, who <i>technically</i> wasn't currently a 'Captain,' still took the reigns at handling the logistics of travel. \u201cWe should reach Traeven within the next day or so, Princess.\u201d She assured, marching (as best as she could in heels and a skirt) to the adjacent tree stump where Kelos stayed. In her hands, she carried with her a piping hot cup of tea: perfect for a chilly night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis snapped Kelos out of her thoughts, as she turned to her fellow bridesmaid, and offered a smile. \u201cAh, thank you Jess!\u201d But these facts, and the chill, were the furthest concern on her mind.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCareful. <i>Melody</i> brewed that. She insisted. Something about how she wanted to 'get good in the kitchen' now that she's a girl.\u201d Jess gave a playful warning at that. The blonde stumbled into a tea shop during their shopping trip earlier, and had just been wowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos offered a chipper smile at that. A smile that was soon drowned out by worry. \u201cJess... May I ask you something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former captain didn't seem surprised. Her princess had been distant all day, and as a knight, it was her duty to offer her assurance. \u201cOf course, your highness. Is something bothering you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf, perhaps, hypothetically... Ori and I had transformed you into your current state without asking... How bothered would you be?\u201d Even just asking that was making the young royal grimace: speaking her way through a strained voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made the raven-haired guard take pause to think. \u201cWell... It is my task as a knight to serve, Milady. While it would be... <i>surprising,</i> my time so far as 'Jess' hasn't been particularly<i> bad.</i>\u201d Her thoughts turned to earlier. To being with Melody and Sandra. It was oddly... <i>relaxing.</i> No need to put on a tough bravado in front of the others in the castle. They were just girls out on the town... Plus, Melody's optimism was strangely infectious. The whole affair was certainly more memorable than an average night out on the tavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos gave a small sigh of relief at this, as her words turned more hopeful. \u201cAnd what if also, instead of just turning you into a a girl, we turned you into an eight year old as well?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Princess?\u201d Jess deadpanned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAiiieeeeee~!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir words were interrupted by a high-pitched scream into the night. The scream not of a man. Not of an adult, but of a <i>child.</i> A child who suddenly, in practically a poof, materialized in a pile of loose clothing, where once Reginald fit so snugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh dear...\u201d Kelos palmed her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW- wha- what happened?\u201d Came the cry of a new little girl: surprisingly, she had red hair, just like Orianna. It was always assumed to be a trait from her mother's side, but apparently maybe something was in Reginald's blood, too. Though unlike Ori, the king's face was absolutely <i>dotted</i> with freckles. As if she had a permanent blush marring her features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose it's now or never.\u201d Kelos sighed, standing up. If anything, this was a bit late. Confessing <i>after</i> her father got transformed would <i>probably</i> not be too endearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then a twist of fate came into play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh nooooo! Like, did I screw up the tea?\u201d Gasped the vapid and innocent voice of Melody, as a potential out came into play. \u201cLike, nobody drink it, and stuff!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos' mouth hung slightly agape. Should she roll with it?</span></div></div>",

I'm sorry, Ori was upset because you ordered her potions confiscated and you wouldn't accept me as a woman, so I thought if we transformed you into a little girl it would get even!\" Tears were forming as she confessed to her scheme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kelos...\" Reginald said, seemingly angry. However, as a few moments passed without a word between them, a smile formed on her face. \"I see what you're trying to do here. Really, back when you were a man, you would have thrown your subordinates to the wolves to get ahead. Now though, you're trying to take the blame for them. Becoming a princess has made you a better leader, my daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos looked shocked. The idea of her father not even believing she was responsible had never even crossed her mind. \"B-But father, I'm not trying to take the blame, I'm really responsible! I mean how could even Melody mess up tea so badly that it could transform you? That would require a magic potion...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReginald simply shook her head and cut Kelos off. \"Tell me, if you don't put any magic into a potion what do you end up with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tea,\" Kelos replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. So if you can make tea while trying to craft a potion, you can also make a potion while crafting tea.\" Reginald explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess, I totally appreciate it and all, but this was so my mistake,\" Melody insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I really...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not worry, Kelos,\" Reginald interrupted. \"I'm well aware that Melody did not do this deliberately, and she was an idiot even before being transformed. Her punishment will be fair.\" the little girl who was once king looked at Melody. \"As punishment, I forbid you from changing back into a man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You mean I can stay like this forever?!\" the former knight asked, eyes wide in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sandy! The king said I can stay like this!\" Melody shouted in joy as she ran up to her friend and practically tackled her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father, I...\" Kelos began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReginald held up a hand. \"Let's leave this as it is. I choose to believe this version of events. Besides, even the other version, what I said about you remains true. Any anger I might have pales before the pride I have of my daughter trying to protect her sister.\" She then held out her arms, the oversized royal robes hung off loosely. \"In any event, I'll need some new clothes. Oh and a name. I can't have you calling me father and revealing who I am. Regina is too obvious and rejected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, Father?! Is that you? Whatever happened?\" Orianna asked as she walked up on the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melody accidentally brewed a potion,\" Reginald said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My how terrible!\" Orianna said with feigned shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ori,\" Kelos said sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need some new clothes. I'm sure you'll<i> just so happen to have</i> something suitable for a girl my age, correct?\" Reginald said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err, why yes, I just might. After all, once must be prepared for any eventuality,\" Orianna replied. She hurried off and retrieved a dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think of the name Linette?\" Reginald asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like it,\" Kelos replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrianna soon returned holding two dresses. \"Father, I found these two, but I'm not sure which one is better.\" She held up a white dress with decorated with pink lace trim, and a pink ribbon around the waist which then formed a large bow on the back. In her other hand was a purple dress, lacking the frilled trim, it made up for it by how billowy the skirt was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not father, call me Linette until we return to Grovan and fix this. Also I prefer...\" Linette stopped. \"I need to speak more like someone my apparent age. I like the one with the pink bow, it's so cute!\" The former king smiled smugly, satisfied with that performance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent choice, sweetie,\" Orianna said. She handed the dress to the former king. \"Let Auntie Kelos know if you need help putting it on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be okay, Aunt Ori,\" Linette replied. She then shuffled over to the carriage to get dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She seems to be taking this better than I expected,\" Orianna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but we probably shouldn't push things,\" Kelos replied. \"You can make an antidote for this when we get back home, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, have some faith, sis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinette emerged from the carriage wearing her new dress. \"Aunt Ori, Aunt Kel, how do I look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are so cute!\" Orianna exclaimed, clasping her hands to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That dress looks great on you!\" Kelos added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like some help with your hair?\" Orianna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I brushed and styled your hair since you were a ba...\" Linette paused. \"I mean, No thank you, Aunt Ori, I'm a big girl and can do it myself.\" She sighed. \"This will be a challenge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SO SO TOTALLY CYUUUTE!\" Melody shouted as she saw the former king fully dressed. She bounded over and hugged her. \"I'm sorry I turned you into a little girl, your majesty, but you're so cute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Linette for now. Just get this all out of your system before we get to Traeven, I can't have my identity exposed no matter what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll keep your secret, King Linette!\" Melody replied, causing everyone else to sigh.</span></div></div>",

With the burden of their father's potion-taking relieved upon them, the two sisters, and gaggle of other ladies, were free to enjoy themselves to their heart's content. 'Linette' even seemed to be adapting quite well!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean I get to be a flower girl, Aunt Ori?!\u201d Came the gasp of an <i>oh so excited</i> young girl: of whom one could never guess used to rule over a kingdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's right, Sweetheart! I couldn't ask for anyone better!\u201d Cheered 'Aunt Ori,' as she tenderly placed a delicately made flower crown atop the ginger hair of her former father. The mix of green and red proved quite complimentary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMelody, Melody! I getta be a flower girl!\u201d The regressed girl shouted: skipping over to the other carriage, of which were currently both parked, to tell the sugary bridesmaid. Melody had regularly begun to dote on her, after feeling 'soooo bad' about the 'transformation thingy.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sweatdrop formed on the back of Kelos' head, as she watched the scene fold out. \u201cHow much is she playing pretend, Ori?\u201d The younger princess asked with a whisper: leaning into her sibling's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm not sure, but I'm all for <i>every</i> moment of it~.\u201d The older of them gushed, as she watched Linette being cooed over by Melody, and an increasingly less reluctant 'Sandy.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour highness', they'll be ready to check us in shortly!\u201d Notified the ever stalwart Jess, as she had just finished talking to one of the guards at Traeven's gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey'd arrived at the castle a little over half an hour ago, and while no one had said anything, the more intellectually minded of the group were beginning to wonder if something was wrong. Despite all the fun and antics that'd gone on, there was a notable reminder that the reason for why they were visiting- at least known to Kelos and Ori, was that Princess Fia remarked of the troubles Duke Fenrir was causing. Duke Fenrir, who was Orianna <i>fiance.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blow of trumpets singled a change, as a knight from the above walls bellowed out. \u201cNow presenting, as an escort for the Grovan dignitaries, Duke Fenrir!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeak of the Devil, and he'll appear... Latches for the adjacent drawbridge buckled, and out came a greeting party of soldiers at either side, with a heavily regalia-donned brown-haired man at the center. Fenrir seemed quite pleased, with a smile piercing through his neatly trimmed beard. \u201cAha! Princess Orianna! My arranged bride to be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strained smile formed on Ori's lips, as they were worrisomely surrounded by armed figures. Almost equally worrisome was how quickly the Traeven noble went to kiss her hand. \u201cOh! How... wonderful to see you... Sire! I didn't expect you to come all this way just for our entrance.\u201d If anything, she was hoping it'd be Fia... Or <i>anyone</i> who wasn't supposedly aiming to cause a coup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, yes... Well, I wanted to make sure my fiancee and her companions were well taken care of!\u201d He magnanimously noted, before turning to the shorter, black-haired girl beside him. \u201cAnd this would be the former Prince Kelos, I take it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCurrent <i>Princess</i> Kelos.\u201d The current Princess Kelos noted rather firmly, before holding out her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuite charmed.\u201d He said, with a tone and look that made it just that frustratingly difficult to discern if he was being patronizing. But there was something behind his eyes that just didn't seem right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can get you all settled in and up to speed right away. Pleasure before business! I know we want to sort out the details for the wedding, but that can wait!\u201d At a snap of his fingers, the various guards began to guide the carriages to the stables, while simultaneously pouring out the various bits of luggage which would hopefully(?) be taken to their accommodations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all going rather fast, and the other bridesmaids could do little but hold still in the tizzy- keeping young Linette safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough this though, Kelos managed to break away from the chaos. \u201cHave you happened to see Princess Fia, Sir Duke? Is she well?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat caused Fenrir to smile.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The high tower containing Marlin's lab, was largely isolated from the rest of the palace. Both by design, and by coincidence. The magician's reputation was fiery, and fearsome, and nobody wanted to be risk offending him, nor risking his influence with the king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe times where an explosion would rock that tower to it's roots, or when billowing clouds of unnatural colours and odours would escape meant, that few visited the him, and fewer wanted to visit him. Even when he wandered the corridors and passages of the rest of the palace, he had a distant look to his eyes, and frequently spoke to himself. The chambermaids and cooks recognised the herbs he collected from the forest when they were poisonous. The guards heard the deafening roar of his magic, and upon investigation, would find mass destruction, or worse left behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his reputation, and abilities, the King considered him kindly and wise. Both men were fiercely loyal to each other. The gossip around the court told one particular story frequently, especially as it was so well witnessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day one of the sculllery boys, whose normal work left them buried in the kitchen scrubbing pots and pans. Little Jack was waiting to surprise his love, one of the palace maids. In his exuberance, he leapt out from behind one of the suits of armours, and groped his true love. His hands roaming her body, squeezing her breasts, and sliding between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shriek of outrage drew the guards, and as his true love turned around.... Well, it turned out to be Princess Fia, who landed a resounding slap on his startled face, and stuttering apology. When Fia drew a knife to defend herself, her honour, Jack twisted the knife from her hand and fled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, within a week, Fia had found a new Lady in Waiting, a youngish girl, though well-developed for her age. Initially she had a reputation for endless sobbing, and mournful looks. Even her clothes seemed to set her on edge, some dismissed it as the fickle emotions of youth. Jasmine however, positively flinched and cowered at the shuffling sound of the wizard's feet on the uneven stone floor of the castle. Not that rare a reaction, but there was a hint in her eyes, and from a certain angle, and in some lights, the vaguest hint of a scullery boy could be made out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Marlin's lab the glassware was clinking and chiming, as the wizard worked on a new infusion. It was a joyous opportunity, a chance to celebrate the upcoming meeting of Princess Fia and her suitor, Prince Kelos. The hope was this would secure the alliance between the two powers, and bring peace and prosperity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting down the beaker, he went over to the cauldron, the contents brewed and stewed with a heavy slow bubbling certainty. Cautiously sniffing the brew, he nodded approvingly. Soon the perfection potion would be ready, a chance to further cement their love, and bring an abiding peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a toast, both Fia and Kelos would take the potion, and their imperfections and past wounds be wiped away. Skin refreshed, features tweaked and improved. Not so much as to destroy their original proportions, but just to improve their pleasing symmetry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising one hand in an imaginary toast to the happy couple, he failed to spot when the sleeve caught one of the test-tubes on the nearby table. Only when it shattered on the floor did he notice. A swirling cloud of emerald green rising, as the contents evaporated. It danced in the air, at moments moving against the air. Sparkles lighting it from within. Even Marlin wasn't quick enough, before it darted, like an insect and rose towards his face, his nostrils before sinking deep into his lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlin fell to his knees, coughs racking his body. Each one scratchy, each one rising in pitch. Marlin's whole body rattled and rocked with each cough, as if trying to break his spine. He tried to talk, to mouth an incantation. He knew the potion he'd knocked over, knew it's consequences. Dread filled his heart, as he felt his clothes becoming baggier on his body, his hands retreating up his sleeves. He felt what few muscles he had winnowed away to softer, rounder flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKneeling on hands and knees, he coughed as if he were throwing up his lungs, and then stopped. The changes complete, finally able to breathe easily once more, he rocked back onto his heels. He felt his bum press against his feet, both wider and plusher than before. Marlin knew what this extra padding meant, he felt also the shifting weight on his chest. His spine was tickled by a long mane of hair, from his previously rather sparsely covered head. Dreading the discovery and the uncertainty, he explored his face. His hands discovering the extra plush lips, fixed in a permanent pout, not wide, but inviting, a mouth made for one thing, made for teasing and relieving men's aches and needs. Even the hand doing the exploring was slender and fine, long enough to encircle a man... where it matters most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer cheeks burning, she confirmed she truly was a woman, her elbows crashing against her wider hips, in the rush. She withdrew her hands just as quickly, as if afraid of catching something from her new delightfully feminine crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, shit, shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlin cursed high and sweetly, her voice perfected for seduction, rather than cursing, or expressions of outrage.</span></div></div>",

Though his stomp didn't convey much anger, as her hips pistoned, and her rear rolled. Carefully picking it up, she started cursing once again, her fingers shaking as she read the label.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt confirmed what he'd... she'd suspected, dreaded. It was an earlier draught of his perfection potion. It was intended partly as a joke, a present for the king as a punishment for a courtly lady... or even lord. It hadn't ... He hadn't ... it wasn't meant to actually be used, let alone with him as the lucky recipient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the warmth she was feeling... in the pit of stomach, an itching, need was building. She was feeling the first effects of female arousal. A squeak of surprise slipping out, it was more intoxicating than he'd imagined. She found her hands wandering unbidden to cover her crotch. Though, as they rested there, a further gasp slipped out, as she probed and confirmed she was fully functional.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfraid where those naughty fingers would lead she snatched them away, folding them awkwardly beneath her bust. A bust that bounced enticingly at the impact of her arms, at their folding. Every damned thing made them move, even stamping one foot in frustration. She tried focusing on remaining still. Her breathing was enough to keep her aware of the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wider, softer more sensitive nipples were brushing against the loose clothes. Combining with the potion, it was making them stiffen, and press against the baggy shirt, even now poking forward, their shape undeniable, their need unquenchable. She wanted to squeeze them, to roll them between her fingers, to caress them. A whimper of need slipping out, as she imagined the sensations. This whole thing was so damned distracting, she couldn't concentrate. A wave of jealousy flooded her, she tried to extinguish it. If this was how the courtly ladies could feel....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe told herself, it was down to the potion, all due to that cursed broken test-tube. But that didn't make the emotions any less intense, her needs any less powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer plain coarse wardrobe wasn't suitable for such tender flesh, such flesh needed proper care and attention, proper support.</span></div></div>",

His hope was that Kelos would soon spot her attending to her sister's need, and intervene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlin sighed as he thought about how Kelos likes his women. He cast the spell regardless, and felt his arms winnow down to practically nothing. His ass seemed to inflate without end, being countered by her shrinking waist. With a deep breath she prepared herself for the worst as her chest expanded until she was clearly feminine, but the growth was relentless. Finally grabbing her breasts Marlin found out how heavy EE-cup breasts were. Even as she waited at the servant's entrance she waited while the bell echoed through the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe house-keeper answered the door, and Marlin introduced herself \"I'm the new girl.\" she got no further because the house-keeper huffed loudly 'obviously'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlin continued \"My name is Marilyn, and I have been trained as a lady's maid.\" She waved Marilyn into the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe house-keeper outlined all her duties, and gave her a list of Princess Anya's favourite things, and pet hates, and finally a warning. \"Don't get too near, Kelos, he is a bit of a hound.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sent Marilyn off to start immediately.</span></div></div>",

With a grin on his face like he was about to get a nice treat he intercepted the new girl before she could even make it to his sister.  Kelos liked what he saw, she was proportioned well in all the places he liked, she even had a bit of a determination in her eye the he liked.  Yes, Kelos felt like this new girl was going to be a welcome addition.  And he let her know just how welcome she was by simply telling her, \"Come with me to my chambers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlin was pleased the mission was already going so well, but hadn't quite expected his opportunity to come so soon.  He hadn't been able to make all the preparations to make himself ready he'd planned for, but it may be now or never.  So he curtsied and followed Kelos dutifully to his bedroom.  As they walked Marlin made sure he was ready as he applied some red paint to his lips as subtly as he could.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the two entered Kelos' lavish room, the prince shut the door behind them, Kelos once again took a moment to look his new prize up and down before simply saying, \"Clothes off.\"  Knowing what was coming next Marlin did so with a brave face.  The old Traeven wizard thought to himself, <i>The things I do for my King and Kingdom,</i> before stripping down to nothing, and then as though wanting to just get it over with ran at a pleasantly surprised Kelos and kissed him on the lips.  The two kissed for a few seconds before something odd happened to Kelos, he just froze in place as though he'd fallen asleep.  Marlin backed away from the prince and admired his handiwork.  <i>\"The Hypnosis inducing lipstick does it's magic again.</i>  Marlin thought with a satisfied grin on his face as he wiped the last of the lipstick along with Kelos' saliva from his mouth.  \"Now to get some answers, Kelos!\"  Kelos sudden stood straighter at attention, \"Tell me of your intentions with marrying Princess Fia, and make it quick you're only hypnotized for a minute before I need to get out of here.\"</span></div></div>",

But Marlin couldn't spend too much time thinking about the answer, the hypnosis lipstick would only last less than a minute and he had more questions the King had ordered him to find answers to.  \"Kelos!  What are you're feelings toward Princess Fia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Kelos spoke in his determined monotone, \"I've loved her ever since I first laid eyes on her, she is beautiful, powerful, and capable.  She will be mine.\"  Marlin didn't like his tone, but again he would leave it to the King and Princess as to what to do about the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlin realizing he probably only had time for one answer before he had to escape, picked up the lady's maid cloths he had stripped off a minute ago and inched his way towards the window as he asked his last question the Princess had actually wanted answered, \"And do you intend to stay true to the Princess once married?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"  Kelos said, Marlin had been expecting this answer but had not expected what followed, \"I shall have my own harem, one in each kingdom comprised to the most beautiful women in the kingdom of which you will be one.  You will be one of my greatest prizes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlin blushed in spite of himself and muttered, \"Well good luck with that.\"  As he took his naked leg and put it out the window ready to jump out and make his escape back to Traeven.  At that moment the hypnosis spell wore off, luckily for Marlin, Kelos shouldn't remember the last minute.  On the bad side he still hadn't made his escape yet.  Marlin jumped from the window and floated to the ground as if he were a feather falling.

Not even bothering to put his clothes back on Marlin dug through his bag of magic tricks for what he needed.  The bag Marlin had wasn't your typical court wizards case, in fact to the average eye the bag would look like a ladies bag with typical things you would find for a woman, but each item had a distinct and useful purpose, he'd already used the hypnosis lipstick and now was the time for a grand escape so he grabbed a necklace of flight and was fumbling with the clasps behind his neck when out of nowhere a voice called out, \"Girl!  What are you doing?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a moment of shock Marlin dropped the necklace along with all his other belongings.  Marlin looked for the source of the voice and saw that the housekeeper who had greeted him upon his entrance less than half an hour ago was marching towards him.  Figuring it would be best not to put on the necklace and fly off in front of Grovan staff Marlin simply picked up his belongings and tried to cover up his nakedness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unbelievable, Marylin the one thing I tell you not to do and you've already done it in record time.  I can't believe you'd already let yourself get taken in by the prince, or maybe you're the one who went after him.  Well girl.  Speak up.  And put your damned clothes on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't do anything miss!\"  Marlin said as he began getting dressed.  It was a feeble respond, but then again how much could one expect from him.  He was a court wizard, not a trained spy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure you didn't, and I'm next in line to be queen.  And call me Miss Harken when you address me young lady.  What's that you've got there.\"  The housekeeper was looking at Marlin's bag of magical items, and with lighting fast reflexes the housekeeper grabbed the bag before Marlin could stop her.  She looked in the bag disapprovingly.  \"Makeup.  Jewelry.  Girl you are just a ladies maid.  You have no need for costly fripperies.  I'll be confiscating these.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you can't, you don't understand!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may get these back after you've proven that your not just some strumpet looking to have a bastard child.  Now go to the dungeons and give them a good scrub and be thankful I caught you and not the guards or else you may have been put behind bars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlin stood there in shame having been bested by the head housekeeper of Grovan.  He would most certainly leave this out of his report to the king when he made it back to castle Traeven.  He looked down at his massive chest that he was really starting to regret he had made so large.  As he walked back inside of the Grovan castle with a fresh determination in mind Marlin knew what he had to do in order to get back to Traeven.</span></div></div>",

And that didn't even consider what would happen if he'd been caught.  The ramifications for him and his homeland could be disastrous.  So Marlin put his pretty little head down and didn't say another word as he went to the dungeons to do his menial task.  Marlin with the body of beautiful and buxom woman went to work getting on his hands and knees and scrubbed every inch of the dungeons that he could until sun went down.  Miss Harken then proceeded to get him and escorted him under a watchful eye to the servants quarters where he shared a room with many beautiful young women.  The made the old man's heart skip with joy to be in the presence of so many attractive women who seemed very comfortable stripping down to next to nothing in the presence of their fellow lady servants.  And even though Marlin had a body that may have been crafted to be the most attractive of them all, he still preferred to see the female form on those besides himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd this was Marlin's life for quite a few days.  He wake up among the beauties and go clean and scrub under the watchful eye of Miss Harken, and when that was done he would be escorted back to servants quarters.  Although Marlin did notice that while cleaning that the Prince seemed to make many excuses to come down to the dungeons for seemingly no reason other than to lust over 'Marylin'.  It wasn't the ideal situation, but life could be worse for Marlin, he could be behind Grovan bars if they discovered the truth.  And soon he believed he'd have enough favor with Miss Harken to get his magic items back and get out of this place and inform the King of what he'd learned of Kelos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen one day, instead of being taken to the dungeons, Miss Harken took Marlin to the stables.  Marlin was curious but knew his role and kept his mouth shut until spoken to, finally Harken broke the silence.  \"You've done well in your tasks Marylin, so I'm giving you the special task of cleaning the Princes royal carriage.  It is to be spotless by tomorrow when the Prince will leave to go to Traeven and take the hand of Princess Fia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\"  Marlin couldn't help the outburst.  He thought he had much more time before Kelos made his move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Harken's eye's narrowed at Marlin but her voice stayed even, \"Yes, Kelos wishes to marry her before the winters come.  So start cleaning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarlin knew he had to ask, \"Miss Harken, if it's not to much trouble I was wondering if I could have my items back that you took from me.  Please mam.\"  Marlin added a bow at the end but he already knew the answer.  \"No girl you may not.  You may get them back when I feel you've proven yourself and that will take time.  Now do your job before I change my mind and give it to someone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Harken left Marlin with a racing mind as he began his task.  He had to get back to Traeven soon, but how?  Marlin weighed his options, he couldn't bet on getting his escape items back, he didn't know where they were and a search for them would take too long and be too suspicious.  Marlin did think he could whip up something in the Grovan alchemy lab in a matter of minutes that could get him back home.  But if he was caught by Grovan's wizard Xarlat it could mean doom for him and Traeven.  The other option Marlin thought of he did not like at all, but it may be safer.  He knew Kelos still fancied him and wanted him to be a centerpiece of a harem that Kelos had mentioned while hypnotized.  Even without the hypnosis lipstick Marlin knew he could get Kelos to take him along with him to Traeven by...other means.  Marlin looked sadly down at his huge chest at this thought.  Whatever he decided it would have to be done today.</span></div></div>",

He had never tried becoming another person's body part before, and was afraid he might have messed it up. However, his fears were soon allayed when he heard the princess's voice above him, distant and echoey. He reasoned that he couldn't see anything because he was in her panties; it made sense, after all. Experimentally, he tried opening and closing his mouth a bit; instead of going up and down, his \"lips\" seemed to open sideways, consistent with being a vagina.<br>\r\nWhat he hadn't counted on was that being a pussy could be so boring.

So Marlin had watched from afar, the closest he ever got to her was when she was giving birth to Fia. A few years later she died from a strange illness that despite all of Marlin's best efforts he couldn't cure. Marlin was grief stricken, he had allowed the love of his life to slip through his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his grief he looked for someone to blame and he found it in the evil magician Xarlat. Marlin become sure he had killed Queen Helena. So he set out to kill him, after an almighty battle between the two, Marlin just about won but he coulldn't kill Xarlat so instead he buried him under a mountain and left him there to rot. Over the years Marlin came to realised that Xarlat probably was not to blame for the Queen's death. He reassigned him self to a sad lonely death, till one day while walking in the gardens he saw Queen Helena picking flowers he quickly ran up to her \"Helena... h-how is it your a live?\" he wanted to kiss her out of sheer joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marlin your getting me confused with my mother, it me Fia.

Suddenly your left hand is groping her tits while the other is wanking off. She carries on sleeping, your so closes, you hear Princess Fia's maid's getting up in the other room and getting ready to start the day. Your running out of time but your so close. You cum harder than you ever have, the bed sheets and Princess Fia are covered in your cum. Looking at her still sleeping form you want to stick your dick in her but you hear the door to maid's rooms open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wave your hand and the cum is gone like it was never there. Then you do the only thing you can think of to escape without being see, you turn into an inanimate object and fall on to the bed. The two maids move over to the bed, one of the maids picks you up. \"How did this get here? Doesn't matter Fia will definitely be needing you today.\" The other maid uses very strong smelling salts to wake the Princess up. What have you turned into?               </span></div></div>",

The foolish humans were not aware of this and continually placed you into breeding pens until they were sure that you were pregnant. For the first eight months as a horse you were subjected to the strongest (and most sexually active) young males of the herd at least three times a week for hours at a time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis may sound like the worst part of your time as a horse but it turned out to be the most tolerable times. It prevented you from thinking too much about your situation. Your body was amazingly sensual and provided a exceedingly large amount of sexual energy during these times. Much more than you had ever felt as a man. The worst part, was when you were alone among the herd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were effectively mute. Communication with humans was all but impossible. Any signs of intelligence were passed off as mere coincidence by the humans (you stopped considering yourself human a few months into your new life.) You could communicate with the horses but they only spoke with emotions, a whinny could mean they are happy and pinned ears indicated aggression. The herd were beasts, but you were not. You had a human mind with a beast's body. You seemed to realize your own intelligence when you had this vast period of time to think while you were not being bred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't all bad though. You were the prime horse of the herd, you were as strong as any other horse and were much more beautiful. You had a pure, shiny black coat of fur that glistened like oil in the sun. Kelos would only have you bred with the most prime males available and would ride you exclusively to his important meetings with other kingdoms. Many measures were kept to keep you in supreme condition, this included: daily bathing, weekly trimming and constant access to the best food available.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe baby was coming, you scream in your new horse voice out in pain... and it was over. You suddenly felt 150 pounds lighter than you did a moment ago. You look down to see your new foal on the ground. Kelos entered and observes the care the humans surrounding you are giving your new foal.

He tried not to appear to obvious in his observation of Kelos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Xarlat felt a tremendous weight land on his back, and he snapped his head around to see the problem. A large stallion was perched on his back. But a quick thrust from the horse reminded Xarlat of his current status, as a filly. An enraged whinny escaped from his mouth as he felt the massive cock pierce him to the core. The stallion himself was also very vocal and soon it became the focus of all the people. Xarlat felt stimulated as never before, and couldn't find the experience entirely unpleasant although he hated it too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men in the party start comparing themselves with the excited stallion, while even the other horses are watching closely. The stallion increases his pace and his breathing becomes deeper. Xarlat soon finds himself panting too.</span></div></div>",

Soon, he feels a longer stallionhood filling her as even the previous stallion failed to stimulate her.

Gives a deafening neigh as he too comes, filling Xarlat's pussy to overflowing with hot semen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen a third stallion moves behind her, he turns and snaps at the horny horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelos smiles and claps his hands in approval at the display of resistance.</span></div></div>",

However he had never planned on this happening, and with all the attention focused on the rutting horses, she wouldn't have any chance to change back before further humiliation occurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time she simply stood still not resisting as the last stallion came with a whinny and slid off her back.

Some are a little envious, as Princess Fia, is a willowy blonde, who has the ear of Marlin the wizard. Her beauty has been magically enhanced and maintained. Thoughts of how he would enjoy bedding the princess make him smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the plan gives Xarlat a simple solution to interfere. He chuckles quietly to himself, as he considers how it will make the vain little prince suffer. He prepares to cast his spell. As he releases the magic, all the movement around the campfire slows down until it stops. Xarlat sees it going to work. He watches as Prince Kelos becomes Princess Keela, a stunningly beautiful brunette, with impressively large breasts, and counterbalanced by an equally magnificent ass. Two of her companions also change sex, it would be inappropriate for a princess to travel without a lady in waiting, and a chaperon. Xarlat feels like torturing the new Princess, and allows her to keep her old male memories, but leaves the rest of the world with the idea that she was always a head-strong princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sees subtle changes in some of the objects around the group, and realises that the magic has changed the saddle on his back. To a more demure side-saddle better designed to suit a princess. Xarlat walks over to rejoin the other horses, and watch the results as the flames start moving again until they are at normal speed. He watches as Keela suddenly starts groping her new breasts and panicking. Her male companions find an excuse to look away, although some are a little slow in turning their heads away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lady in waiting shakes her head in disapproval, while the chaperon tutts her disagreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeela wails to the sky, \"I'll never marry Fia, now.\"</span></div></div>",
