Acknowledging the fact that it was the morning, he sat up in his bed and stretched his arm out and yawned. It was days like this that reminded him why life was so great because he had so many options for how to  spend them. Getting out of bed Alex mad his way over to his dresser to pick out something to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Seeing how it was the middle of April, the base temperature of the day was roughly sixty-three degrees but other than that Alex would just have to guesstimate on how he should prepare for the day. Finally he put on a pair of jeans, and a T-shirt with a logo on it from one of his favorite games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    After getting his sneakers on Alex sat down in the chair next to his desk to think about what he wanted to do today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Finally he decided to...</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately they aren't actually at home right now but they will be soon. \"Better find a way to kill the time\" He thought to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    After taking off his shoes and leaving them by his desk, Alex lay back down on his bed and whip out his phone. He began by texting his mom that he would be home and then started looking through his texts and pictures. All of a sudden a dirty idea pops into Alex's head and he got online. Alex went to one of your favorite sites to read some stories about giantesses, and begin reading. After a while of that he found himself drifting off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Alex suddenly awoke to his world suddenly shaking and darts up, but as he gathers himself and wipes the tired from his eyes his vison is consumed with something very wrong. Alex looks around and sees that he has shrunk and is sitting on top of his pillow which now seemes to span out to the size of a parking lot. Given a look at his surroundings he guesses that he's about an inch tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    While thinking about all of this he hears voices in the distance, which he guesses belong to his family, which would mean that what woke him up was the vibrations from the front door closing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Suddenly he hears the sound of footprints coming from outside his door. Who could it be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    It was...</span></div></div>",

The door opened up and the giantess mother peeked her head inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny man watched as his mother walked into the room, rubbing her hands through her dark brown hair.  She was wearing a light coat that revealed her large D cup breasts as she moved her hands down her body and touched her short dark multicolored exercise shorts.  They were primarily black but with little strings of pink designed onto them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly started making his way towards the end of his bed.  Given how small he was, he wasn't sure if he'd be able to get to the ground without hurting himself.  He had to get her attention, it might be the only way for him to get safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he ran towards the end of the bed, he saw his mother bend down to pickup some trash he had not thrown away in his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex, when you get back here, you are going to get it for not picking up.\" she said, still bent over unknowingly giving her tiny son a nice view of her cleavage.  Alex started to feel somewhat aroused at his new size.  He had to shake his head and focus.  This was his own mother after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you left your phone here too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex watched as his mother sat on the bed, throwing him up and into the air.  He flew up until finally landing on his own mom's lap.  She had not even noticed as she picked up her son's phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwiping the phone, the phone immediately unlocked which was unusual because Alex had a password on it.  He realized that he must have shrank really quickly for it to still be unlocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. . \" Holly said looking at the phone. \"Alex, I can't believe you like the idea of being. . small.\" she said.  Oh no, she had seen the giantess sites!!! Alex felt terrified of the stories he had been reading.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex needed to get out of this situation and now.  Moving across his mother's shorts, he started to try and get down from his current location.  As he moved downward, he started to stir as he touched the bare thigh of his mom.  A sudden motion happened as his mother reached down and grabbed him in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wha. . what is. . A-Alex. . is. . is that you?  D-did you. . did you do this because of your website?  Is this what you really want?\" she said, a look of disgust on her face with your phone in hand still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-mom, no. . it. . I never wanted to be small!!\" Alex said fearfully as his mother looked down at him puzzled. \"P-please. you have to help me!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about it, which kind of story was the last thing he read before Alex passed out?  Who knew how bad the story was she was looking at?</span></div></div>",

It's not that she was disgusted by the situation, she was just lost for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n            She turned her gaze back to the phone and spoke. \"Please Alex, try and help me understand what I'm looking at here.\" Holly began scrolling through the story till she came to a particularly weird part. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n             Holly read the section aloud. \"Looks like it's time to put you where you belong, little bro\".  As she read the description of the sister in the story dropping her brother in her mouth and sending down her throat, Alex got more and more nervous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n              It might just be that because he's smaller so he may just be noticing things he couldn't before, but the way the corners of his mother's lips were rising to form a smirk was freaking him out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n               Or maybe he's just seeing things.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
