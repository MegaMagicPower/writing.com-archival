He had his pokemon safely tucked away inside their Pokeballs, and his bag slung over his shoulder.<br>\r\n\"Where are you going dear?\" His mom called from the kitchen, leaning back.<br>\r\n\"I'm off to travel around Johto some more! Maybe finally catch myself a Larvitar!\" You call back as you quickly head towards the door.<br>\r\n\"Well, alright!\" Your mother called, smiling, \"Just promise to be careful!\"<br>\r\n \"Aw mom, don't worry! I'l be fine, I've got my Pokemon with me!\" You call, quickly shutting the door behind you.<br>\r\n\"That boy...\" Your mother sighed, shaking her head side to side as she leaned back forward, returning to her dishes, \"Somtimes I wonder...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Larvitar hunting!\" You yell, punching your fist into the sky as you walk towards the dirt road leading out of New Bark Town.<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Ian!\" You hear someone call. You turn and glance behind you, and you spot your rivalhood friend, Lyra, running towards you, her mail bouncing along close behind her.<br>\r\n\"Oh, 'Sup Lyra?\" You ask, as she arrives next to you, leaning over and panting, slightly out of breath. You take a quick moment to admire her beauty, sure she was dressed like a Mario cosplayer, but she really was quiet a cute girl.<br>\r\n\"So...going off to catch Larvitar?\" She finnaly asked, stragitening herself back up.<br>\r\n\"Uh..Yeah!\" You quickly answer, glancing away, hoping she hadn't caught you staring.<br>\r\n\"Well, best of luck! I bet you'll do great! C'mon Marril!\" Lyra smiled, before her and her Marril quickly bounded off back towards the town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh!\" You smile happiply to yourself, glad that not only had Lyra not caught you staring, but had even complemented you as well. Looked like it was going to be a great start to your brand new...<br>\r\n\"Psst!\"<br>\r\n\"...Huh?\" You blinked, glancing around.<br>\r\n\"PSST!\" it came again, louder, from some bushes. You blink, and slowly walk over. suddenly, a cloaked man jumps out form the bushes.<br>\r\n\"Ah! Good day to you sir! Oh, I see you have a PokeGear! I'll give you a special application, free of charge!\" The cloaked man cackles.<br>\r\nYou blink, and tilt your to the side, peering at the strange cloaked man.<br>\r\n\"...Dad?\" You ask.<br>\r\n\"...Dangit!\" The claocked man groans, throwing off his cloak. Sure enough, it's your father, standing there with an application chip in his hand.<br>\r\n\"And here I was, trying to be cool, and simulate what happened when I got this thing!\" He groans, reaching forward and snatching your Pokegear.<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" You ask, bewildered as your Dad hands you your PokeGear back.<br>\r\n\"Well, I think I'll just leave you with the same instructions that were left to me!\" your father grins, before proudly proclaiming, \"The best way to learn, is to do!\" And with that, he quickly turns, and runs off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...So, what exactly did he install?\" You wonder, opening your Pokegear and flipping to the new Application. The instructions read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Possession Application. Once activated, simply phone the person you wish to possess, and you shall inhabit their body. The PokeGear will travel with you through possession, so that you are not stuck in that form. Once you have possesed a new body, you get 30 seconds to decided if your body will go on auto piolet, or allow the mind swapped to inhabit it.' Underneath the instructions is the word 'Apply' in a box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh...Another one of Dad's Pranks, no doubt!\" You think. Still, your curious, so you press the button. Instantly the screen changes into a little heart, with your name currently in the middle in a clear box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuh, so all I have to do is call someone, and I'll possess their bodies...yeah right...Still, maybe just a test...\" you murmer, looking around. There was no one around, so nobody would be asking questions if you suddenly began acting rather strangely. You  quickly select a name from your phonebook and dial it up, saying hello to...</span></div></div>",

He bent down and picked up a small red bow, and recognized it as Marill's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marill is gonna be upset that she's lost this thing,\" Ian thought. He turned around to look for Lyra, but she was already gone. \"Better call her\", he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan quickly looked up Lyra's number in his PokeGear, and called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" He heard Lyra answer. Before he could say anything, Ian felt his head spin, and he blacked out. He awoke what seemed like seconds later, but he was somewhere completely different. For one, he was sitting on a bed, legs under him. \"Wha...?\" he thought, rubbing his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large tuft of hair got in his way. This was strange - his hair was really short. \"What the...\" he said out loud, hearing a voice that wasn't his own. He looked around, disoriented. It was... it definitely wasn't outside, and looked like ... he had been here before. It was Lyra's room. \"Why am I... WHO am I? Ian wondered out loud, finally noticing that his voice was no longer his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe jumped off the bed and ran to the window. He could barely see his reflection. Except, it wasn't his. It was Lyra's. He waved his hands. Lyra did the same. Ian stuck his tongue out. So did Lyra. \"So... I'm Lyra now?\" he thought to himself. \"Maybe I can have some fun...\" Ian thought, running his... well, Lyra's hands over her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rill!\" Ian heard a sound from behind him. It was Marill. \"Oh, that's right. You don't have your ribbon!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he heard a beeping sound. It must have been coming from Lyra's PokeGear - a overly large, overly pink contraption. Were girls really that into pink? Ian looked at it, and saw two options: Swap and AutoPilot. He decided that it was safer to try AutoPilot for now, and tapped that option. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CONFIRMED\" came up on the screen, and Ian, in Lyra's body, pondered what his next move was.</span></div></div>",

Lyra's body could wait - he had had a small crush on her for a few years now, but he could never bring himself to do anything about it. After all, they were neighbors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Marill, I think I know where your ribbon is!\" Ian said to Marill. Marill jumped up and down excitedly. Ian heard a song playing from the bed he had just been sitting on - Lyra's favorite song. Someone was calling her. He looked at the phone, and was surprised - it was him calling!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" He answered. Now this would be entertaining, he would be talking to himself, like no one ever had before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lyra? Hi, it's Ian\" he heard his own voice on the other end of the line. Weird indeed. \"I was about to go after the Larvitar, and found Marill's ribbon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thanks! Yeah, She'd lost it somewhere, I was about to go look for it!\" Ian replies, imitating Lyra's cheerful attitude as best he could. He thought he did a pretty good job. Enough to convince himself, at least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll drop it off at your house, be there in a couple of minutes.\" his voice said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Ian! See you soon!\" Ian replied to himself, and hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... I'm about to get a visit from myself...\" Ian thought, not sure what to make of the situation. He'd have to cut the conversation short, since he didn't think he could keep up being Lyra for that long. The doorbell interrupted his thought, and he hurried down to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, his body was standing at the door, holding the ribbon he had found. Marill seemed very excited, and jumped up to Ian's body to get the ribbon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go... I have to run now Lyra. Bye!\" Ian's body said. Ian smiled, flashing one of Lyra's cute smiles at his body. With his body gone, Ian was now free to do what he pleased. He...</span></div></div>",

You get a good look at her - long blonde hair, short black dress trimmed with pink. The gear beeped, and Ian realized he was still holding it. Looking at the screen, he quickly realized what was going on, whacked 'Auto', then put it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm feeling dizzy...\" Ian complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need a rest, you've been going really hard these last couple of days.\" the girl said. \"Alright, I've decided. We're closing the gym for today, and you're going to rest. Now come with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl helps Ian up by grabbing his hand, then walks him slowly over to a door. Ian stumbles along with the girl, still half zoned out. The door opens, and Ian sees a very bright room, all pink and white, filled with a huge collection of stuffed animals. On one wall is a large very fluffy looking bed, which Ian is dropped onto. The young woman leaves, and Ian hears to door lock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll close up for the day, make sure to get some sleep!\" the young woman calls as Ian hears her footsteps move away from the door. Maybe a minute later, Ian hears another door close and lock. He sighs, and falls back onto the fluffy bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Ian takes stock of the situation. He is in a very pink room. He's already seen the socks he was wearing... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute.\" Ian says, noticing his voice is a lot more high pitched than usual. He looks down and sees a white button-up shirt holding in an almost disproportionately large set of breasts. Below that is the tiniest pair of shorts he had ever seen - they're basically a strip of fabric. \"Hello...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe jumps out of bed and looks around. Sure enough, he finds a mirror and runs up. Staring back at him is Whitney, the gym leader of Goldenrod City. Whitney, who acts like a spoiled child despite the fact that she's <i>at least</i> in her late teens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Whitney... \" Ian says, seeing Whitney's reflection move as he does. \"What do we have here...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan begins to unbutton the shirt he's wearing, revealing a frilly white bra covering those large breasts. He grins slyly, and cups the flesh on his chest. It feels so soft and inviting... Maybe he should go back to bed. Or maybe he had some more business in front of the mirror...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ian stood in front of the full-length mirror in Whitney's room staring lustily at his reflection.  He still couldn't quite believe the reflection he was seeing in the mirror!  Staring back at him was Whitney's body, currently HIS body, cupping her breasts with a less than innocent expression. Ian began to undress as he watched the Whitney reflection do the same.  Ian could feel his body starting to grow warm as he fully removed the pink and white top Whitney had been wearing. He brought his hands once again up to the frilly lace bra covering the large breasts attached to his chest and cupped the mounds, feeling their weight in his hands. Getting more excited, he moved his hands down, feeling Whitney's smooth, taut stomach and flipped his thumbs under the waistband of the matching white shorts. Slowly, Ian lowered the shorts down between his thighs, relishing the feeling of the material as it slid. He could feel Whitney's body growing even warmer. Standing back up, he looked in the mirror once again. Whitney's body was now clad in only the white lace bra and a pink lace embroidered thong.  \"Man, Whitney really loves her pink\" he chuckled, as he moved his hands around to his butt and cupped Whitney's ass cheeks. He smiled and let out a small moan as played with the lace thong, pulling on the elastic wedged in between his ass cheeks and letting it snap back snugly between them. His reflection now matched the way his body felt, Whitney's face was flushed and Ian could feel his body was hot and aroused by this point. He struck a few sexy poses in Whitney's underwear before fumbling to remove her bra. A minute later, Ian was staring at a reflection of Whitney in nothing but her thong. He brought his hands up once again to the globes of flesh attached to his chest and began to play with them, pinching and twisting the nipples, moaning with pleasure as he watched his reflection doing the same. Ian felt an intense heat coming from his crotch and felt it was time for the next step. Spinning around, he watched his reflection drop the lace thong between his legs, marveling at Whitney's tight ass in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to face the mirror, Ian concentrated on the mound and lips where his manhood would have been on his own body. Moving his hands to the edge of Whitney's pussy, Ian felt a shock run through his body and he whimpered. Whitney's body was so horny by this point Ian could hold back no longer, he moved his fingers into his inviting vagina and felt instant and intense pleasure as he explored. Having never fingered a girl in his life, Ian wasn't very graceful with his exploration. Mainly going off of how Whitney's body was responding to the pleasure, he eventually found her clitoris and almost passed out from the intense pleasure it sent through his body. Ian had retreated to Whitney's bed by this point and he was coming very close to climaxing in the beautiful body he was currently inhabiting. Ian let out a cry of pure ecstasy as he reached climax, arching his back and grinding the air as each wave of pleasure rode through his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards, Ian lay on Whitney's bed in a daze. Basking in the afterglow of the orgasm he had just experienced. His first orgasm in a female body, but definitely not his last. Ian smiled evilly as he rose from his bliss and walked over to Whitney's closet. He loved the feeling of his hips swaying as he walked several feet to the closet doors and opened them. He grabbed a loose-fitting t-shirt and slipped it over his head.  Despite the loose fit Whitney's breasts were still clearly defined through the cotton fabric, the nipples still hard from the body's recent state of arousal. Ian groped his stolen flesh as he sauntered over to Whitney's bureau and opened each drawer until he found her underwear drawer.  He selected a pure white thong from among the many undergarments and slid the skimpy material up between his thighs. Pulling it snug against his crotch and wedging the material between his ass cheeks, he made his way back over to the bed and lay on his back. He smiled and thought about what his plans were for the next day. With his hands lightly groping his stolen flesh, he faded into sleep.</span></div></div>",

He sat up and felt the weight on his chest, letting out a surprised gasp until he remembered the events of the day before. He thought of the pleasure he had experienced the night before and smile spread across his lips. He brought his hands up to his chest and tweaked his nipples as he cupped the beautiful fleshy globes he currently possessed. He had experienced an erotic pleasure previously unknown to him and he wasn't going to give it up any time soon. He rose from the bed and made his way back to Whitney's mirror, enjoying the soft bounce of his unrestrained breasts. He stared at his reflection, gave his beautiful backside a little pinch and laughed. He let out a sigh feeling reassured it had not all been a dream. He pulled the shirt back over his head and tossed it into the corner of the room as he moved towards the bureau. He selected a black cotton bra and worked to his encase his well-endowed chest into the cups. As Ian was finishing with the bra, he heard a knock on Whitney's door. He froze for a second but remembered that to everyone else he was the sexy Whitney, Gym Leader and guardian of the Plain Badge. \"Yes?\" he said towards the door. \"It's Emily, um...I figured after yesterday that you could use a day off...so I kept the gym closed today\" said a disembodied voice through the door. Ian smiled \"Thank you Emily, a day off is exactly what I needed\" he smoothly responded. Emily continued: \"Of course! Please try to get outside and enjoy the fresh air! I hear there's a pokemon catching contest in the park if you're interested and there's a sale going on at the Goldenrod department store as well\". \"I will definitely check those out!\" Ian said as he stood in front of the mirror again, very distracted by his scantily clad reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard Emily moving back towards the main floor of the gym and moved his trembling hands down towards his pussy. It had grown increasingly wetter throughout that quick conversation and Ian knew he had to feel another orgasm in Whitney's body before he left her room to explore Goldenrod City. Whitney's inviting pussy lips practically pulled his fingers inside as Ian collapsed back on the bed. He wasn't exactly sure when he would leave Whitney's body, but he knew he wasn't going to leave unless he saw another body worth taking for his own. Since the gym was closed, Ian didn't try to hold back his moans and cries as he worked his stolen flesh into an aroused state before climaxing again in Whitney's busty body. Afterwards, he stripped out of his freshly soiled thong and replaced it with a lacy pink g-string, also choosing to switch to a black sports bra for comfort. He then donned Whitney's usual white and pink outfit and prepared to head out into the city.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ian decided to head towards the department store in the middle of the city. After all, he wasn't sure how long he would be staying in Whitney's body and he thought she could use a few new additions to her current wardrobe. He felt his crotch getting a little damp as he thought about all of the different sexy clothing he could try on in Whitney's body. He groped his stolen tits under his shirt one more time before heading out into the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan was wondering the streets of Goldenrod City, trying to make his way to the department store he could see towering in the distance. He had grown up in another region and he wasn't familiar with the Johto region at all, but he couldn't ask for directions since he appeared to be the city's gym leader. Whitney would definitely know where she was going and he didn't want anyone to question why Whitney was acting so strange. His frustration soon dissipated as he continued walking through the city. Everyone kept giving him smiles and saying hello under the belief that they were greeting the actual Whitney and not some boy trainer who had hijacked her body. This deception pleased Ian and he felt his body becoming slightly aroused, it didn't hurt that the g-string he had put on that morning was grinding in between his ass cheeks and bringing a slight arousal to his pussy as well. Ian was enjoying the looks of attraction Whitney's body drew as well.  By the time he found his way to the department store, Ian was ready to try on some sexy clothes and play with Whitney's body in one of the changing rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis first stop was the lingerie department on the third floor. The only thing that ad kept him from running there was keeping up the proper appearance as Whitney. Once in the store however, he wasted no time trying to act the part of mature, proper gym leader. He grabbed six or seven different erotic and revealing pieces before locking himself in one of the changing rooms and commencing with his own private strip/fashion show. Whitney's hot body was literally a wet dream for Ian as he dressed his stolen flesh in teddies, see through negligees, skimpy thongs, and lacy push-up bras. After about an hour of this, he found his body was so hot and aroused he couldn't help but masturbate in the store. Ian had a huge smile on his face as he basked in the afterglow of a fresh orgasm and made his purchases using Whitney's credit card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ian walked out of the lingerie department he spied a familiar face, it was the ice queen Candice. Ian thought back to the day he had defeated Candice on his first journey towards the Pokemon League, the way her body moved as she directed her pokemon in battle. Ian was feeling that now familiar dampness in his crotch at this point and he was zoning out in his own thoughts as Candice approached him. \"Whitney!\" she exclaimed, \"I thought that was you! What brings you into this section?\" she asked and wryly winking towards Ian. \"Ohh..I just had the day off\" Ian fumbled, \"I needed a break so I closed the gym for the day and figured I could use some new clothes\". \"Yeah, I totally get that\" Candice said \"I needed a little break too, with the National Gym Leader Summit happening in three days I figured I had the time\". Ian perked up at that last bit, National Gym Leader Summit? He had to get more info out of Candice, but he didn't want her to be suspicious of him. \"Oh that's right!\" he said, \"I almost forgot about it, I've just been so busy training lately\" he looked towards Candice and saw her nodding in agreement.  Reassured that his cover wasn't blown, he continued \"Where is it being held again? I feel like I could use a few new outfits for it\" he said as he feigned embarrassment. \"Oh definitely! Since its going to take place in Olivine City this year I was planning to get a few new swimsuits for the beach\" Candice replied. \"That's a great idea\" Ian said to Candice \"I might meet you over in the bikini section later, good to see you!\" Ian waved and smiled as Candice turned and headed in the opposite direction. His gaze followed her beautiful figure as she left, he tried to imagine the black-haired beauty in a bikini. He felt his face grow warmer as his cheeks flushed. If anyone had been watching the apparent \"Whitney\" at that point, they would have felt a strong aura of lust as she studied Candice's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan had to control the building sense of excitement he was feeling. Olivine City? All of the gym leaders from around the world in one place? The best selection of sexy bodies he could choose to steal in place! He couldn't have possibly asked for a better opportunity and he already had the his ticket into the summit, the beautiful and busty body he was currently controlling. He smiled as he thought about all the possible bodies he could possess in the next few days. He felt the dampness in between his legs grow as he pictured the vast array of beautiful gym leaders that would be in attendance. He was already looking forward to the event and the potential for a new body. The question Ian needed to answer now was how to spend the next three days? He was very interested in possessing Candice to see what her body felt like, but he also knew that he would get another opportunity in Olivine City three days from now. He felt torn however, as he was reluctant to leave Whitney's body so soon...considering he had just made several purchases that would keep him busy in his free time over the next three days....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe eventually decided to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ian decided to stay in Whitney's body, at least until the Summit, but maybe for longer. He was starting to get comfortable in this body and life, after all, and he had also noticed something interesting that he wanted to see if he could learn more about: he had started to gain some of Whitney's memories. He first noticed it when he was at the department store: while shopping, he found that he instinctively knew all of Whitney's measurements. Upon learning about the Summit, he realized knew the entire event schedule, despite having just heard about it for the first time. These recollections continued throughout the next few days, and once it was time for the Summit, Ian was mostly ready to fill the role of Whitney. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first day of the Summit arrived, and Ian made his way to the beautiful Olivine City. He had quite the day ahead of him: The Normal type leader's panel, the seminar on Fairy types, and the lecture on Mega Evolution, but the end of the day was the most exciting part: the beach party. Upon arrival, Ian was greeted by a face he didn't recognize, and he wasn't getting anything from Whitney's memories, either. \"Oh my goodness, Whitney! I'm your biggest fan! I've read all about you! I've studied your tournament battles, amazing stuff! Oh, where are my manners? I'm Ilima, the Trial Captain of Melemele Island in the Alola region.\" A lot of factors were contributing to Ian's confusion here. First of all, what's a Trial Captain? And is this kid a boy or girl? \"Wow, I'm... flattered.\" was all Ian could muster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, from the corner of his eye, Ian spotted two leaders from the Hoenn region: Roxanne and Flannery. They were both much more familiar. Despite her somewhat plain appearance, Roxanne supposedly packed quite a body under her extremely modest clothing, and Flannery was practically a goddess, with a scorching hot body befitting of a Fire-type user. She was definitely a prime target; Ian wanted to get into her pants, whether it was figuratively or literally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, the question was simple: would Ian get acquainted with any the people he had just seen, or would he continue to explore the area?</span></div></div>",

She was here only for a short time, and he had to take advantage of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan pulled out Whitney's PokeGear and found a small blinking icon from his possession app. He clicked on it, popping up a larger button. He hit that too, and felt his head spin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found himself in a familiar room, sitting at a computer. He was in his room. A quick glance down told him that he was back in his body. Not wasting any time, he got up and ran to the box of his old stuff that he had carted over from his brief attempt at the Sinnoh League. He had gotten pretty far, collecting all the badges and making it to the tournament, but he had lost at the hands of Cynthia's Garchomp. Finding what he was looking for - his old Poketch - he poked around until he found his contacts, loaded Candice's number into his PokeGear, and dialed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe line rang, and a feminine voice answered. \"Hello? Hold on a...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe now familiar dizziness struck Ian as he blacked out again, and opened his eyes to find himself staring in a dressing room mirror with a <i>very</i> pleasant reflection looking back at him. Looking back was Candice, Sinnoh gym leader, wearing only a tiny bright blue bikini. Ian smiled at the reflection, watching the Candice in the mirror return the smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandice's PokeGear beeped, and Ian hit the obligatory 'Auto' button, and continued to stare at his reflection. Candice was a couple of years older than Whitney, and her body showed it. It felt more... sexy and refined. Her breasts, while still large and beautiful to admire, were more proportionate to her body. Her curves were more pronounced, with slightly wider hips and a smoother waistline. Her hairstyle was... still childish, with long black pigtails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh\" Ian whispered contentedly as he ran his borrowed hands over his borrowed body, feeling the velvety softness of Candice's skin. He grabbed her breasts and squeezed. It felt good, even through the bikini. He reached down to ...his bikini bottom - it was on <i>his</i> body right now, after all - and slipped a finger inside, tracing a line down Candice's waist along to her pussy. He could feel himself getting wet and turned on by the sight and the feelings coming from his new body, and it was definitely a more pleasant feeling than when he had been in Whitney a few minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot being able to resist, he pushed his hand further down and began to tease the pussy between his legs, biting his lip with pleasure. He caressed Candice's clitoris, having had enough practice in the last few days to get a much better effect for himself. Within minutes he was on the verge of orgasm, pleasure rising in his stomach as he plunged his borrowed fingers deep into his borrowed pussy. Ian let out a quiet moan as he felt the orgasm release, and stared again at Candice's reflection - thoroughly more flushed, with a hand in her bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan grinned. These last few days had been among the best of his life. And the best was still to come, with the gym leader summit - and the beach party - only a couple of days away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was pulled out of his lustful thoughts by a voice he recognized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Candice! You almost done? Can you help me pick out a bikini?\" It was Whitney, and she had clearly followed up on the words Ian had said from her body. So... it seemed the app was even smart enough to clean up after itself, so to speak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Yeah, coming!\" Ian replied, hearing Candice's voice coming from his own mouth for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After a moment, he quickly addded, \"Just to see if she's up for a rematch! It's not like any of my Dad's schemes work after all!\" He laughed, sweating slightly at the thought of what other Pokemon trainers, especially Lyra, might say if they knew what he was attempting to do at this very moment. Ian's finger hovered over the send key as he paused for a moment, quickly shutting his eyes.<br>\r\nIan jabbed his finger down, firmly pressing the send key, placing the call to Clair. He slowly lifted the PokeGear to his ear. One ring...<br>\r\n<i>\"I wonder if she's there...\"</i> Ian thought, as the second ring chimed...<br>\r\n<i>\"Maybe I should just hang up...\"</i> Ian sighed, his tense shoulders relaxing as the third ring began. All at once it was inturpted, as the phone on the other line was picked up. Ian opened his mouth to say hello, when  all at once he felt himself lurch forward. Wind roared in his ears, as a strange sensation ran down his body. It was if he was being pulled out of a warm, fleshy cacoon. Then, as quick as that sensation began, it vanished, and was replaced by a new feeling. Ian tried to yell out, as he felt himself being dragged through the air, the wind stinging against him. The feeling lasted for another brief moment, and then all at once, everything stopped. Slowly Ian peaked open an eye, only to find himself face to face with Clair herself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/f/fe/HeartGold_SoulSilver_Clair.png\">Clair</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"http://archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/f/fe/HeartGold_SoulSilver_Clair.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wo-Woah!\" Ian gasped out, backing up, surprised that Clair was doing the same.<br>\r\nI'm-I'm sorry I stumbled in on you, Clair ma'm!

His eyes grew even wider however, when he looked down.<br>\r\n\"Woah!\" Ian yelped out, almost jumping. He was wearing Clair's exact outfit, and his voice sounded alot like hers! He quickly glanced up at Clair once more, to apologize, when it hit him. Slowly he reached forward, and gently tapped the glass.<br>\r\n\"A Mirror...\" Clair murmered, before giving a small smile, which then turned to a large grin.<br>\r\n\"I'm Clair!\" Ian, inside Clair's body, shouted out. Suddenly, the PokeGear he held in her hands beeped. He glanced down quickly, and read the following screen:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Auto Piolet, or Body Swap?'</span></div></div>",

You walk through Blackthron City, the mountain wind blowing your amazingly well-kept ponytail around behind you, the purple and black cape following suit and billowing out behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite how scantly clad you were, you do not even feel the cold of the wind. Your leotard, cloves, boots and cape seem to keep you sufficiently warm despite how seemingly everyone else needed to wear plenty of layers to fend off the icy wind. Smiling, you knew you'd picked one of the best and hottest bodies you possibly could have. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know... She's a real bitch but, fuck, if Claire isn't the hottest chick I've ever seen...\" You say, but soon add to the comment, \"Or should I say that i'm the hottest bitch that I've ever seen!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh as you finally find Claire's home and walk up to it. A massive oriental mansion, complete with it's own Japanese garden that seems to be meticulously well kept. The driveway is made from light grey gravel and is lined by dark grey lights that illuminate the path. By the gate, a Torii arch, two large, stone statues of dragons stand with fearsome looks on their faces. They seem to proudly announce the presence of the most fearsome dragon of them all, the one who resides inside the house they guard. This brings a smile to your face, you felt beautiful but now you feel dangerous. You began to feel the power, not just the power of Claire's well trained body, but the power of being feared as seemingly everyone you knew, save for the champions and the elite four, could be crushed by your newly acquired Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you walk through the grand oak door and enter. Unlike the exterior, the interior of the grand house is fully modern with a grand, flat-screen TV proudly mounted on the wall, a large amount of trophies almost arrogantly displayed in a heavily decorated cabinet. The floor is a series of dark grey slabs of stone, smooth and glamorous to look at. In the center of the room is a large, blue leather sofa that looks suspiciously like dragonair leather, something that is very, very illegal now. Unless, you smile, you're as influential as the queen bitch you now are.</span></div></div>",

You plop yourself down on her sofa and put your feet up on an expensive looking coffee table, showing little to no care for anything around you under the philosophy that It's not your problem if I break it. You turn on the TV and see Cynthia's face pop up on the huge screen. You can't help but feel a slight pang of jealousy at her rank of champion. \"I'd be way better at begin champion than that dumb blonde!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grip for a few more minutes before you look down at your Pokegear and a thought crosses your mind as you search for her name in 'your' contacts... \"Surely these hotties have got each other's numbers!\"</span></div></div>",

A four posted bed, with light blue and ultramarine covers, sits in the center of the far wall, with a small bedside table on either side. The walls are decorated with large portraits of Claire in numerous poses, some showing off plenty of skin with her dressed in kimonos that are slipping away at the shoulders or haven't been tied up, revealing plenty of her midriff and chest. Your eyes eat up these soft-core images as if staved for days as a wide smile spreads over your face. \"Why the hell am I looking at these paintings when I've got the best view I can get by looking down?\" You smirk as you grope your chest, feeling a slightly moist feeling in your spandex covered crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think somebody is a bit of a narcissist...  By somebody I mean me of course!\" You laugh as you look back up at the images on the wall and feel the heat in your crotch spread and amplify. Without skipping a beat, you unclasp the cape and let the satin garment fall to the floor. You continue to strip as you walk to the bed, leaving a trail of clothes as you do: first the boots, then the gloves and finally the famous leotard and finally her underwear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you drop the silk bra and panties to the floor, you arrive at the bed and dive onto it closing your eyes as you do, gasping as your soft skin touches the even softer fabric. You squirm a little, loving the feeling of your bare ass rubbing the soft sheets. You open your eyes and gasp at the sight of a mirror on the 'roof' of the bed stretching from the top to the bottom, giving you a perfect view of a very naked Claire squirming a little on the shiny silk sheets you lie on. After recovering from the surprise, you see yourself begin to smile as you realize just what Claire was like. \"Who's a narcissistic bitch? Me... And who do I want to fuck my goddamn brains out?

You smirk, and give your butt a loud<b><i> *SMACK*</i></b> that leads into you holding it in a firm clasp. \"Ohh-ho, what a <i>lovely</i> body we have~\" A devilish grin forms on your cute new face, and quietly slip into the backroom of the Gym (thankfully it seemed that nobody had shown up during your exploration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, you finally get a good look at your new self for the very first time.

Your knees buck, and you find yourself laying on the floor, too rocked in a world of pleasure to keep focused on anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel the pleasure building to a climax, and drool streams down your cheek as your fingers work ravenously.

One confident walk out the Gym later (making sure to properly close up so that nobody would show up hoping to challenge the Leader), and you were officially home free.

You snapped a few pictures while you were at it, making a couple of cute or sexy faces to save for later if you decided to go back to your body. \"Yeah, if.\" You thought aloud with a devious grin.

You put your hands behind your head and pose, giving a wink. \"Not bad... not bad at all.\" Though the hair was getting a bit in the way, so you grab a hair tie and put your thick red mane back into something closely resembling what Misty's hair looked like as you remember seeing it a couple years back, though it was definitely a lot longer and thicker now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend at least a good two hours trying on various different clothes, eventually ending up on your new couch with just the panties and socks from before, but now you were also sporting a baggy shirt. Your hair was undone again, and you lounge there with one leg up on the back of the sofa as you surf through all of Misty's computer files to get a feeling of what else you had at your disposal. Or maybe you should say... your files? You let out a small chuckle at that thought.</span></div></div>",

You'd been expecting plenty of shots of her in Bikinis, lounging around on the beach but find nothing of the sort. As you open yet another folder full of pictures of \"Cute Water Pokemon\" you feel your eyes begin to get heavy and, without even closing the laptop, you all asleep in Misty's sexy form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up several hours later as the sun shines on your pretty face. You stand up and stretch, not remembering who's body you know occupied. Acting on muscle memory, you slowly shuffle across the room until you walk into the kitchen, failing to notice that you're not in your own house. You open the fridge and grab a glass bottle of milk and open the foil top and take a few swigs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow slightly more awake, you notice something odd. Your hand looks way to feminine, the arm connected to that hand doesn't have a single hair on it and the torso that the arm is attached to has a sizable rack, clad in a large T-shirt you definitely didn't own. You almost scream in surprise before it all comes back to you. With a chuckle at your own stupidity, you walk back into the living room with your bottle of milk as why the hell should you bother about saving some? It's Misty's money that'll be buying the replacement after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou plop yourself down on the large sofa and flick through a few channels before coming to some anime that you've never seen. As you watch it, you begin to realize two things: One, the Anime is already half way through the season and two,  you had fucking tits so why the hell were you bothering with watching some fictional ones bounce around for entertainment?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hand travels down to the blue panties you're wearing and lightly touches the now slightly moist lips underneath them. You coo in pleasure as your body reacts to the light stimulation, a familiar heat spreading over your body from head to toe. You begin to push down on the fabric clad pussy a little more, forcing the now damp silk into your warm folds. The lusty moans begin to get louder as you do this and you begin to push the finger down even more now on a aroused high, totally ignorant to the still world around you...</span></div></div>",

As the shirt is hurled across the room, you look down at the now bare rack and sigh happily at the sight. \"Fuck I love the tits...\" You giggle as You begin to grope and fondle them as the panties settle around your ankles only to be kicked away the second they do, they hit the wall and drop to the floor, rejected in your fit of lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your tits now free, you move your attention down to your crotch again and begin to tease the moist lips with a single finger, basking in the pleasurable feedback you receive from the act. You quickly quit the foreplay and begin to slide the finger into your pussy, kicking out with a powerful leg as you do. You begin to speed up the thrusting with the finger, groping your chest as you do, desperately craving more pleasure from Misty's strong and toned body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... Good!\" You moan and giggle in pleasure as you hand speeds up, the pleasure seemingly spreading from the tips of your toes to the top of your red head. You spread your muscled thighs wide as your hand pumps, adding another finger every few seconds until all four as being thrust in and out of once misty's now your soaking pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you pump your hand harder and faster, you feel an orgasm building up inside your strong core. You moan as it reaches it's peak and for a split second you're in a blissful moment and then you scream in pleasure as you cum. Your tight pussy sprays the floor in front of you, some even hitting the marvelous TV you'd been bored by. The spray of cum only lasts for about two seconds but goes everywhere and soaks the floor, carpet and sofa probably ruining them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-that was so good...\" You pant as you ride the orgasmic high, lightly rubbing your tender pussy as you do. Eventually, the high dies down but leaves a glorious afterglow that leaves you smiling like nobody's business. After a quick stretch and a little looking in the large mirror nearby, you pick up your pokegear and punch in Erika's number, still feeling a little miffed she'd run off as you really wanted a taste of those mangos of hers. You put the gear up to your ear and...</span></div></div>",

You blabber something about wanting to have a friendly battle to hone both of your skills. The voice on the other end quickly agrees, seemingly eager to clash with another Gym leader for once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hanging up, you smile and do a few poses in the mirror. You tried blowing kisses to yourself, putting a leg up on a chair and adopting the thinker pose (Taht ends up looking remarkably sexy) and after a few more you begin to get bored... Then you see the camera... A grin quickly replaces the bored scowl as you grab the hefty object and turn it on. You scroll through the numerous high quality images and find nothing but water Pokemon, this didn't surprise you. What did was the quality of the pictures as it seemed Misty had quite an eye for some incredible pictures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you remember why you'd taken the camera in the first place and exit the gallery. After a few tries, you get the camera to the state where the image wasn't blurry as shit and begin to take snaps, both directly of yourself and of your reflection in the mirror. You begin to laugh as you put Misty into increasingly more compromising positions as you pose your powerful, sexy and very naked body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorbell rang about ten minutes after you started. Panicking, you nearly drop the expensive camera and grab a nearby robe, quickly fastening the cloth belt so as to not flash your visitor and make them suspicious if why Misty is now a sexual degenerate who'll masturbate and then not even get dressed afterwards. You swing the door open to once again see the beautiful child of nature, Erika, for the second time on your doorstep in as many days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an exchange of greetings, she enters and sniffs, her nose twitching a little as she does. \"Misty... What is that... That sweet smell?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou freeze and turn to see the area of the room you'd soaked with your earlier appointment with Misty's pussy. \"I've... Been trying to cook a... Cake... Yeah, a cake!\" You quickly, and slightly defensively, declare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... It's either that or you've taken to growing large quantities of Razz berries, but considering the last thing you'd ever said to me about such a thing was that \"plants are yucky\" I expect that you're telling the truth.\" Erika rambles a little but eventually seems to believe you... Somehow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly escort her out of the house and towards the gym to avoid her asking any more questions.

You thought that maybe actually being a woman would give you an edge with getting into Erika's- er- pants, but apparently not. You put your hands on your hips and huff. \"Great. Waste of time.\" You say to yourself, before the chime of a ringtone catches your attention. You head over to Misty's bag and pull out her Pokegear, the number popping up with the name 'Tom'. \"Who the hell is <i>Tom?</i>\" You say to yourself, clicking the answer button. \"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Misty?\" The voice on the other end asks. \"Hey, it's me! We still on for tonight?\" You blinked in confusion. Tonight? Misty had a date before you hijacked her? You supposed that made sense, she seemed to have a different guy with her every time you caught her hanging around outside the city. \"...Uh. I guess. Where was that again?\" You could have just said no, but maybe you could find some sort of entertainment out of this guy, since Erika bailed on you. \"The Cape Brink area, like last time. You forgot?\" Tom asks you, confused. \"Oh- right. Yeah, sure thing. I was distracted for a moment, sorry Tom.\" You half heatedly attempt a sincere sounding apology, which Tom thankfully seems to buy. \"Awesome, see you then!\" He says before hanging up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Hm.\" Tom, huh? You didn't know anybody named Tom, so at least it wasn't a buddy of yours moving in on a Gym Leader. That would have been awkward for you, considering your current situation. You weren't particularly into guys, but if you had to keep up the Misty act, you may as well at least see if the guy isn't ugly. Hopefully Misty wasn't too <i>desperate</i> before you came around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went home, back to Misty's place, showered, had some more fun with yourself, and then entertained yourself any other way you could find before passing out and waking up the next day. When it finally came time to go on this date, you tossed on your regular Gym Leader swimsuit, undid your hair and tossed on Misty's usual throw over jacket. If you were gonna meet up with this dude, there was no reason you couldn't throw him a bone and at least let him see how great your ass looked in this baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you got to the Cape, the guy was already waiting, and waves at you. You give a light wave back as you head on over. Now that you got a good look at this Tom guy, he actually wasn't that bad looking. He was taller than Misty, had short black hair and a decent physique. Kinda reminded you of that Red guy you battled once. So, obviously Misty had an old hold up she hadn't quite got over. \"Hey there.\" You respond back, leaning on the railing overlooking the Cape. You can feel Tom's eyes dart back and ogle your butt, which earns a light smirk out of you. \"Uh-yeah hi! Thanks for the second date.\" He says in response. You put up a hand dismissively. \"No worries.\" You respond, your gaze still looking out over the water. Tom shuffles awkwardly as he notices how uninterested you seem. \"Sooo...\" He trails off. You glace up at him, and then turn around and lean back on the railing. \"So.\" You say in response. You weren't exactly used to dating a dude, to say the least, so you really had no idea what to do here. \"...Should I go?\" Tom finally asks.</span></div></div>",

Tom just nods slowly in understanding. \"Yeah, I totally get it Misty. Thanks for being honest with me.\" He tells you in response, at least Misty picked a polite one. You shrug. \"Again, no worries.\" You weren't mean enough to tell the guy to fuck off outright, not once you saw how sincere he seemed. Any plans of being the bitchy date flew right out the window on that one. Still though, without Erika, you were still down a partner in the bedroom... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll just head out then-\" Tom begins to say. \"Hold up.\" You interject, stopping him in his tracks. \"Lets not get too hasty, bud. We both know I'm a knockout, let's not kid ourselves.\" Tom gulps, confused but unable to admit you're wrong.

But that doesn't leave me... unavailable, you get my meaning~?\" You say as you stretch again, a moan slipping out of you as you do so. \"I...think I have the message, yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" You reply with a confident grin, arms crossed under your breasts. You gesture with your finger for him to come hither, which he does. \"Glad we're on the same page here, Thomas.\" Tom only gulps in response, having turned very red from this whole thing. Clearly this is not the side of Misty he expected to see, which only amused you. You turn around and slip off your jacket, giving him a good look at your rippling back muscles as your ass hovers dangerously close to his crotch. \"I hope you came... prepared.\" You say as you glance back at him with a sultry look, you may not be interested in dating this dude, but no way could you pass up a good fucktoy for your new body to play with. This was even further uncharted territory for men everywhere, and you were gonna report the hell out of your findings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom nods, obviously he'd prepared just in case. \"Heh. Dirty boy.\" You say in a mocking tone, letting your soft ass press up against his crotch. You could feel the stiffness of his member already, and leaned into it even further. Tom reached down and ran his hands down your back to grope your ass, which felt different somehow than when you did it yourself. He does that for a minute, and you entertain both of you by letting out a couple horny moans for good measure. Woman really did have all the power in these situations, and it felt good having that power for yourself. Tom quickly unbuckled his pants and quickly slipped a condom on, and you got a good look at what he was working with. The dude was even bigger than your original body, which gave you a twinge of jealousy. \"Heh, quite the firearm you're working with.\" You taunt, wiggling your ass a bit. Tom once again grabs a hold of your hips. \"I'm- are you sure about doing this here? Somebody could see...\" You just laugh at him. \"Like I care? Live your damn life, baby. Screw that shit... and me!\" You say as you lean over even farther, parting your legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom didn't need any more convincing, as he immediately parted the fabric of your swimsuit and went in raw and fast. The feeling hits you like a freight train. \"FUUUUUUUUUUUUCK~\" You moan out, the sensation of the man's dick filling your pussy knocking all sense out of you. This was next level than what you were doing to yourself with just your hands. Tom grunts, and starts to pound his member in and out of you. Every thrust making you squeak in a high pitch tone like the woman you now were, and your grip tightens on the railing bars as drool starts to drip from your slack-jawed mouth. \"Holy<i><b> SHIT</b></i>~!\" You manage to moan out loud, your faculties slowly evaporating as the man pounds your pussy into oblivion.</span></div></div>",

Erika's skin is sensitive, and you bite your lip. Misty shifts slightly, and you realize it would be tricky if you had to explain what was going on to her! After all, would she remember what was going on? Would she think she was doing it? Or would she remember nothing at all? You weren't sure, and aren't ready to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let your kimono fall down, covering your gorgeous form as you quickly shuffle yourself out of the area. You walk briskly for a few minutes before you can be sure Misty isn't nearby. Pulling up Erika's Pokegear, you go to the map function. \"Heheh, organized one, aren't you Erika?\" You coo in your gentle voice, as you notice a variety of locations marked on her map; including her house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, you make your way to the location, not being able to resist squeezing Erika's breasts a few times on the way there. Her house is a stark contrast to Misty's, not just because it is in Celadon City as opposed to Cerulean City. The area is surrounded by beautiful gardens that seem beautifully maintained and the house is at least twice as large as the apartment Misty was in. Not all gym leaders are paid equally, it seems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let yourself in using a key under a flower pot near the door, and look inside. The house is utterly immaculate. Not a speck of dirt everywhere, and several potted plants line the doorways and folding curtains guard some of the doorways. After some snooping around, you manage to find Erika's bedroom. As expected, the room is utterly pristine, but you find the prize your lustful mind was looking for: a full length mirror. Quickly, you take off the kimono and gently massage the melons you stole from the ungrateful girl. You had to admit, you did feel her back ache slightly after the walk to Celadon, but nowhere near as big as she was suggesting.

You run your hands aggressively over your nipples and twist and flick them, finding waves of pleasure run over your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also feel yourself getting slightly wet already. \"Erika...\" you say sternly, \"you don't fulfill your body's desires fully, do you?\" With that, you spank her ass a few times, moaning loudly each time. \"Good thing I'm here to help your body~ or should I say, my body?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you can't resist it any longer and clumsily unstrap her unrevealing bra and underwear, leaving her body completely naked for you.

You sit down in front of a tree, slipping the rest of Lyra's loosely hanging overalls off of you.

By now you were plenty familiar with the female sex from their perspective, but that didn't make Lyra's body any less amazing in it's sensations. \"Fuck~ Lyra- So cute~ God I love you~\" You moan out. \"Nmmm~ Love BEING you~\" As you continue, the pleasure starts to build and you can feel yourself reaching climax. Your stolen body tenses up and your thighs clamp around around your hands as you let out a girlish squeal and a shock of bliss runs up your spine and you weakly smile. \"God, Lyra... you're an even better body than I imagined.\"</span></div></div>",

However, this time you'd get to have some fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScanning the room, you notice her full length mirror.

Your hands frantically feel your face, was this really happening? You catch the pokegear beeping, and quickly tap 'auto.' If this was actually happening, you needed privacy. Speaking of, you glance around only to see you're the only one here. Though if memory serves, this Gym has an <i>only women allowed</i> policy unless you were a challenger. A smirk crosses your face, and you laugh (though it comes out a lot girlier than you would have expected). \"No way... I'm totally in the mother of all forbidden gardens.... as their BOSS!\" A perverted series of snickers escapes your lips as you pull the opening of the kimono apart to get a good look at what was underneath. A grass green bra with a pretty damn sizable chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well helllllooo hippie chick~\" You coo as you let the robes hang lose so that you could get your hands on your new assets. \"Damn, looks like I've found the forbidden fruits... heh.\" You give them a squeeze in response to your wisecrack, realizing that the Gym leader you had the least attraction towards previously had jumped ahead in your personal polls. \"These babies must be as big as that Cynthia chick's.... damn.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you hear the sound of something making its way through the foliage, and you scramble to put the kimono back into proper place as a rather <b><i>cute</i></b> younger girl emerges not a moment too soon. \"Ahh, Miss Erika?

You do not bother to cross your shapely legs and instead choose to give 'Ian' a wonderful view of your nice, green panties that thinly vale your newly acquired pussy. If the blush could get any brighter then it would've as 'Ian' squirms in his chair and quickly tries to look anywhere but his eyes always drift back to your body as you silently sit, watching and smiling at this little chumps predicament.</span></div></div>",

You snort. \"I know she was a hippie, but that's just playing into stereotype.

It wouldn\u2019t do to get interrupted, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwitching the gear to photo mode, you admire your image in the screen. A brunette beauty greeted you, and smiled as you did at the screen. You lick your lips, watching Cassie\u2019s image do the same. Mmm, she was wearing strawberry lip gloss. You lower the angle of the poke-gear slightly, catching sight of a low-cut purple dress and a generously exposed cleavage. Pushing in with your shoulders, you force Cassie\u2019s breasts out a little further, smiling in a way that might have looked perverted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at your borrowed form, seeing the exact same thing on your own body. Well, the body you were sitting in, at least. Seeing that made you a little excited, and you unconsciously rubbed your legs together. The sensation of smooth thighs rubbing together with nothing between them left you a little turned on, and you looked down to see the dress Cassie was wearing was tight around her legs and ended at mid-thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a slight gasp as you run a hand over your bare thigh. However, a voice soon snaps you out of your trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh.. are you alright?\u201d you look up to see a concerned young guy sitting opposite you. You blush a little. Even had you still been in your own body, you would have admitted that he was good-looking. From Cassie\u2019s body, however, you felt a strange sensation. Whatever it was about this guy, he made your borrowed lady parts rather excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm.. yeah. Hi\u201d you stutter, still blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man starts talking, but your mind is racing and you are only half listening. Cassie is on a date. And right now, you\u2019re Cassie. You could bail (again) and find a new body to try out\u2026 or you could take over Cassie\u2019s date, possibly having this young man show you a few very interesting things about your current body. That was both appealing and terrifying at the same time, and you weren\u2019t sure you had the nerve to go ahead with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ian looked at who he had dialed, but found his vision blurring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H... whoa\" said Ian as he felt his head spinning. His vision began to fade, and he stumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found himself on the ground, staring upward at the sky. So that app was a prank? Somehow made to make the user feel dizzy then collapse? He sighed. Just like his father to come up with something stupid like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan was roused from his stupor by a ringing sound coming from something in his hand. Opening his eyes, he saw that his Poke-gear was ringing. He looked at the screen and was greeted by a message:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Switch successful. Please select type\". Below that were two options - Auto and Normal. Not really thinking, Ian hit Auto (it was usually the easiest), the Pokegear beeped happily, then shut off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan sighed again, dropped the Pokegear next to him, and lay there. Then something hit him. That wasn't his Pokegear. It was a red one, while his was a gold one. That, and that he was lying on sand. There was no sand in New Bark Town!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around and saw a beach, ocean stretching for ages, with what looked to be a city in the distance. On the other side of him was a large cave, ocean breeze whistling through the entrance. He could see lights inside the cave - trainers loved to explore such places, and some helpful folks kept the place well-lit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So if I ended up somewhere else...\" Ian mumbled, pushing himself upright, and felt an odd jiggle on his chest. He looked down, only to be greeted by a rather full pair of breasts, snugly encased in a blue bikini top. \"Holy shit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan grabbed the tits on his chest and gave them a nice squeeze. Then, snapping out of it, he stood and glanced over the rest of his new body. Sure enough, he noticed he was wearing a matching bikini bottom to the top, and that there was a distinct lack of anything inside the bikini bottom. He tried to catch sight of his hair, but it was tied up. Then, he pulled out the girl's Pokegear and examined his reflection in its screen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring back at him was a girl named Kara. She was obviously a swimmer, with a bright blue bikini, brown hair, and a cute smile. According to the map, he was currently in the vicinity of the Whirl Islands near Cianwood. Kara likely lived there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Ian said, now realizing he was speaking with Kara's voice, \"Dad's thing really does work...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around, and saw that he was completely alone. No traces of anyone - human or Pokemon - as far as he could see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... what now?\" Ian pondered.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ian decided that now was a pretty good time to check out the cave. Firstly, he had never been inside before, since he had skipped over it on his last few visits to Cianwood. Secondly, with no one around, he could go deep in the cave in his new body, and find a secluded area for some privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood up, very aware of the unusual sensations he was feeling from his new anatomy, and walked into the cave. The soft sand got colder as he walked in, and grew a bit more damp. Ian, very aware of these sensations to his now bare feet, was getting more and more distracted. This wasn't his body, and the bouncing he felt from his chest was constantly reminding him of the fact that this body was <i>very</i> different from his normal one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Ian reached a large pool of water he couldn't walk across. Looking down, he saw Kara's reflection in the water. She was a cute girl, with a nice body - large breasts, slim waist, toned abs. A body that was currently in a rather revealing blue bikini. A body that Ian was currently in control of. He smiled at Kara's reflection in the water, and moved his hands up to her breasts. He watched as the Kara reflected in the pool did the same, her dainty hands sliding up her slim body to her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as he was enjoying the show, he was hoping to find a more private area if he was to have some play time. But he didn't know much about Kara other than her name, and he didn't know which of her Pokemon he would use to cross the water. He didn't even know if he could get them to listen to him. Then he realized that Kara was a swimmer. He didn't need to use her Pokemon, he could just cross the water himself. And probably have more fun doing so, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan lowered himself into the pool, feeling the surprisingly warm water on his legs. It was reasonably deep, the water being up to Ian's neck as he slipped himself fully into the pool. He looked to the other side and began to swim, using both the instinct of Kara's well-trained body and whatever he remembered from his swimming lessons years prior to propel her body forward. The water was warm, and created some pleasant sensations as it flowed between his body's breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kicked his legs, pushing himself further towards the other side - he could see a nice little alcove there, which would be perfect for him to take a quick break. Kicking only brought more awareness of his body as his feminine legs rubbed together, highlighting the lack of manhood between his legs. He began to feel a slight warmth coming from the gap between his legs, and he finally reached the shore on the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrambling up, he took a look around. The alcove was pretty roomy, with a torch hanging on the wall. The light danced on the walls, giving him a good view of his silhouette on the stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect.\" he whispered in Kara's voice, unable to contain his excitement.</span></div></div>",

For a hot-shot trainer, he had surprisingly few hot women in his contacts. Sure, he had gym leaders, but they were constantly busy and IF the app did work, he wouldn't be alone. Then, he saw the perfect candidate. \"Bingo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dialed, and waited for the other line to pick up. As he heard that click, Ian felt his head begin to spin, as if he had just been turned upside down very suddenly. Then, the world righted itself, and he found himself standing in a dark room, with flashing strobe lights, and very loud electronic music playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan looked around, and noticed that he was alone in the room. He also noticed that he was slightly sweaty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm? Did it work?\" he asked himself, out loud. Judging by the sound of his voice - distinctly feminine - it most certainly did. \"Oh yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan looked at his hands - as much as he could see in the dark room - and saw that they were quite slim. He took those slim hands and put them on his hips, noting his bare midriff. Rubbing his hands along his toned, bare stomach, Ian also caught feel of a bellybutton piercing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, hello,\" whispered Ian in his sexy, feminine voice, and rubbed his hands along his current body's legs. Turns out, he was wearing very tight, stretchy jeans. \"Mmmm, I have to see this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan walked over to the wall and tried to find a light switch. He found one eventually, and switched on the light. He looked around and saw he was in a studio of some sort, and that all the walls were mirrored. In the mirrors, he saw his reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring back was a tan-skinned beauty. Tall, with long strands of black hair tied back in many ribbons, bright blue eyes and a dazzling smile, wearing a low-cut, tight yellow top with frilly white trim that exposed her toned midriff and extremely tight stretch jeans that left nothing to the imagination, showing off perfectly sculpted legs and a taut ass. Her breasts were a modest B-cup, but were very perky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, I'm Dahlia...\" giggled Ian, imitating Arcade Star Dahlia's bubbly personality, winking at himself in the mirror. \"Care for a dance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan skipped over closer to the mirror, loving the reflection of Dahlia nimbly running towards him. He stopped himself at the mirror, and pressed his hands against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What shall I do now...?\" Ian thought. He was in a tremendously fit (and really sexy) body, and could think of at least a couple of things he wouldn't mind checking out. And although he was in decent shape himself, Dahlia was at the peak of physical fitness - being a professional dance instructor and all. He could just let loose and enjoy the sights of a sexy teacher dancing just for him, all while <i>being</i> said sexy teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around again - since there was no one here, and it was the middle of the day... was he inside Dahlia's private studio? He wouldn't mind having a nice look around... maybe find some other bodies he could save for later, seeing that the app most definitely worked.</span></div></div>",

After all, you remembered that old saying about Kantonian girls having more fun, or something like that. You were truthfully too satisfied with your dad's wacky invention and it's results to care about if you were accurate in your phrases or not. You check this girl's trainer card, and see that she's actually a friend of Red and Blue! \"Huh, what do you know?\" You say out loud. Those two gave you some of the toughest battles you'd ever had, so this girl must be really damn good to be a part of their little group. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. Red, Blue, and Green. Makes sense enough I guess.\" Pallet Town certainly had weird naming conventions, though you did remember that you were almost named Gold before your mom changed her mind, so maybe you had no right to talk. You shrug, and rummage through her bag some more. \"Let's see...\" Nothing too interesting, to your mild annoyance. You thought snooping through a girl's stuff would be a lot more exciting than this, but you were just getting more bored than anything else. \"Ugh, why am I bothering with this?\" You scowl in frustration, tossing the bag to the ground and instead grabbing your new chest once more. \"Ah, muh better~\" This was the real show right here, a free pair of funbags you could have all to yourself, and conveniently gift wrapped in a fully hot package too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach down and peel Green's black shirt off and get a look at your bra, holding your new assets in place quite nicely. It was a nice sexy black color too, a nice touch. \"Heh, who do I think I'm impressing here?\" You chuckle as you rub your hands over the cups. \"Can't a girl do something for herself?\" You say back to your own previous statement. Whatever weird roleplay you had going on here, you were having fun with it. You put a hand on your ass, noting how it's barely covered by these tiny blue shorts, they might as well be another set of underwear at this point. You reach up and give your ass a confident smack, enjoying how good it felt to have your hand meet that soft flesh. \"Hell yeah.\"</span></div></div>",

Ian opened his bag and shoved his head inside. Doing a quick count, he checked over his supplies. \"Potions, check. Dusk balls, check. This Larvitar is mine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummoning his Pidgeot, Ian flew to the Indigo League headquarters. If he remembered correctly, that was how he was meant to get to Mt. Silver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ian! Long time no see!\" called the guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Al!\" replied Ian. Al was one of the guards on rotation there, and Ian had gotten to know him pretty well through his numerous trips there when he had competed in the League. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where you headed this time, buddy?\" Al asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mt Silver. Heard there's Larvitar there\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's right through this way. It's normally off-limits, but you've shown yourself more than capable of taking care of yourself.\" Al  motioned to an inconspicuous door. Ian walked on through, thanking Al for his help, and after making his way through a long corridor, emerged in a rock wilderness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's ... something.\" Ian remarked. Mt. Silver was tall and imposing, and there was an air of raw power about it. No wonder they didn't let average trainers here, they would get eaten alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made his way through the brush and found a Pokemon Center. It seemed old, but the lights were on and everything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who put one of these here...? Then again, not like I'm going to complain.\" Ian thought, and made his way inside. The inside of the Pokemon Center was exactly what he expected, down to the nurse with her Chansey manning the desk. What he didn't expect, though, was the girl sitting on one of the couches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was tall and slim, with a pretty face framed by bright blue hair tied up in two very fluffy-looking ponytails, wearing an orange vest over a long-sleeve grey undershirt, which emphasized the size of her rather large breasts. She was also wearing a very short, very ruffled short grey miniskirt trimmed with the same orange of her vest, over tight grey leggings which showed the fit shape of her legs. Her boots, knee-high, were the same orange color as her vest. Upon seeing Ian, she walked over and introduced herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi! Are you from around here?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... yeah, sort of.\" Ian replied, caught slightly off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you're here you must be pretty good, the guard said they don't let just anyone come here.\" the girl said. She had a slight accent that Ian was unable to place. \"My name is Lucille.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Ian, nice to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ian? As in, reigning League Champion Ian?\" Lucille asked. Ian blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah, I did win the last League...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Champion. That's really cool!\" Lucille smiled. \"Hey, do you want to battle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love to, but I'm actually here to catch a Larvitar. Maybe after that?\" Ian stuttered. He hadn't been expecting a battle, and wasn't really that prepared. League had been a little while ago now, and he hadn't been doing much training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you what. How about I give you my number, and you call me when you're up for it?\" Lucille smiled again. Ian passed her his Pokegear, and she entered her number. \"Oh and let me know how you go with that Larvitar!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan smiled at Lucille, and left the Pokemon Center. He climbed over a nearby ledge and faced down the mountain, feeling confident. It wasn't every day an exotic beauty gave you her number, after all. Which reminded him, he still hadn't tested that app his dad had installed. What was the harm in testing it out? Or he could wait until he actually caught that Larvitar he was after. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He pulled out his Pok\u00e9Gear and called his most recently added contact: Lucille. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Ia-\" a voice came from Ian's Pok\u00e9Gear before being abruptly cut off. Suddenly, his vision began to blur, as the world around him spun. Upon waking up, he noticed a buzzing from his Pok\u00e9Gear asking to choose between \"Normal\" and \"Auto.\" Ian hit auto before snapping out of his drowsiness and realizing where he was. And who he was. Looking around, he noticed his hair was in long blue twintails, he was in a Pok\u00e9mon Center, and possibly most interesting of all - he now had large breasts. Seeing his reflection in the glass table that was next to the couches only further confirmed that he had indeed become Lucille. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave his new breasts a squeeze, and caressed his new, feminine body with his slim, manicured fingers. He was certain that the nurse had been staring at him confused, but he didn't care. This was all so new and so amazing! He looked to his Pok\u00e9Gear - or rather Lucille's, which was bright pink. Upon opening the device, information began rushing into his head; Lucille was an Ace Trainer from the Unova region, which explained her accent. Her friends called her Luci, her favorite color was purple, she grew up in Mistralton City... Ian was simply amazed by just how much he suddenly about her... or himself, as it were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just can't believe it worked...\" Ian said, noting his new, feminine voice.

And now he was in the body of a sexy foreign girl! Slamming the door and locking it, he admired his new form in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiiii....\" he whispered to himself, admiring Lucille's lips moving at his command. He pouted, and lifted his hands to his new breasts. They certainly did feel larger than they looked. He gave them another squeeze, and exhaled sharply. Ian then ran his borrowed hands down Lucille's slender body, past her skirt, and up the inside of her legs. Feeling the unfamiliar (but totally hot) void between his legs, he let out a small moan. Ian then grabbed himself by the ass, feeling Lucille's tight form as he did. \"Well Lucille, you do take good care of yourself, don't you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan was just about to start thinking about removing some of Lucille's... currently unneeded clothes when her Pokegear buzzed. Out of habit, he picked it up and saw a message from...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone he didn't recognize. The gear said it was someone named Mallory. He stared blankly at her name before suddenly remembering more. Mallory, or Mal for short, was a blonde girl, huge sports fan, and a cheerleader in Nimbasa Stadium. She had a very bubbly personality and was well-liked in the stadium, especially by the boys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan didn't read the text, but got a very interesting thought. He was currently in Lucille's body. She was cute, yes, but she was also a very accomplished trainer in her own right. And as an accomplished trainer, she had connections. He scrolled through her contacts list, their names triggering flashes of memory. Lucille's friends - lots of girls, most of them attractive. The gym leaders of the Unova region - one of the leaders was a supermodel. Ian definitely wouldn't mind getting to know <i>her</i>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as far as he could tell, the app only worked from his gear. He poked around in Lucille's gear, only finding a single button - Reverse. He wasn't quite ready to do that yet. So, he would have to find a way to get the numbers over to his original body. Maybe he could think on that later. Right now, he was Lucille, who was plenty attractive enough for Ian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan decided to...</span></div></div>",

Ian's borrowed virginal pussy had already gotten wet after simply running his hand over it... and it felt amazing. His smooth, slender legs were quivering just at the thought of feeling something like that again, and he hadn't even gotten to the main event! Ian began to slowly strip off Lucille's clothing, starting at the top with her orange vest. Upon removing it, her breasts already felt far less restricted, and that's before he had even removed the shirt; upon removing that, Ian finally fully realized just how large these breasts were. Removing the bra, Ian noticed a tag - 36DD. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving down, Ian removed the belt that carried Lucille's Pok\u00e9mon and her skirt immediately started sagging down, before the slightest amount of force sent it to the ground. He removed the boots (the leggings were too hot to get rid of) before finally directly meeting with his target; the panties. They were black lace and thoroughly soiled; these weren't just stains from your recent experience. You could tell there were many dried stains. And come on, black lace? Lucille was a naughty girl indeed, and you fully intended to live up to that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan slowly removed her panties, desperate to get to her dripping pussy. He used her delicate fingers to slightly open it up - it was extremely tight - and began rubbing her clitoris in a circular motion. He nearly wanted to cry, but not from pain. The opposite in fact! He was amazed by just how pleasurable something so simple was already! Loudly moaning in Lucille's sexy feminine voice, his heart beating like crazy, Ian guided his borrowed fingers to the vulva, applying light pressure and rubbing as more surges of pleasure went through Lucille's body before finally reaching orgasm, her vagina oozing with vaginal discharge. Ian's head was spinning, but he was ready for round two. After all, he had never felt something so amazing before! But then, suddenly, Ian heard footsteps, followed by a knock at the door, and a \"Are you alright in there?\" Still somewhat delirious, he couldn't tell if the voice was male or female, but either way, they could help him have some fun. So, who was it?</span></div></div>",

He returned to see her sheepishly standing at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up?\" Ian asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Lucille began. \"When I gave you my number, I saw something on your phone...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Ian kept a straight face, but couldn't help wondering what it was. He didn't think he had anything too weird on his phone... except the possession app his dad had installed. He didn't even know if it worked, but if that wasn't it, then he had no idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw you had a soul link on your gear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A what now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A soul link.

Oh, well my dad did do something to my Pokegear earlier this morning...\" Ian said. \"But I really don't know what you're talking about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" Lucille looked a bit disappointed. \"Well one of my friends back home had one - he only told a couple of people about it, but he said it was quite an experience. Anyway... if you don't know anything about it... mind if I try it out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...\" Ian said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, what's the worst that could happen?\" Lucille teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, Ian didn't know.

He unlocked it and handed it over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok... mind holding my gear then?\" Lucille asked, and handed him hers. It was a light blue one - almost the same color as her hair. \"So... I'm going to call my gear from yours, and you have to answer. That ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds fine.\" Ian said. \"Whenever you're ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucille stood for a few seconds, looking at his Pokegear, then started pushing buttons. The gear in Ian's hands - Lucille's rang, and he hit the answer button. Nothing happened. Then, a second later, he felt his head start to spin and, still standing, blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe came back to his senses what felt like a second later, spinning sensation gone. He looked around - the Pokemon Center was still in front of him, but... wasn't the door to his right before? It was to his left earlier. Plus, he was now sitting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Ian asked. Lucille, who was sitting next to him, had a huge grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It worked!\" she was positively ecstatic. \"I've never used one of those before, but it was so cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Ian asked. Now he was curious. He really had blacked out for a second, and ended up in another spot when he came to again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well after you answered the gear, I got a bit dizzy and then found myself looking back at... well, myself!\" Lucille said. \"I ended up in your body!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it works...?\" Ian asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! And it asked if I wanted to do a swap or just go auto... I didn't know what that meant so I just hit auto.\" Lucille continued, still very pleased. \"And I actually talked to myself! Well... my body. It was working on its own, as if I was still inside. This thing is really cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" Ian whispered. \"You're making me want to try it out now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it is yours...\" Lucille handed back his Pokegear, and Ian returned hers. He had only just noticed, but he was still holding it. \"So you want to try it on me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok\" Ian agreed. \"So do I just go into the app and call you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah pretty much,\" Lucille replied. Don't forget to hit the swap button afterward though, I want to see how that one works too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan went to the possession app, and opened it up. It had some text on the screen, and Lucille's number was already loaded in. How convenient. He wasn't sure what to expect from this, but it definitely seemed to work. About to hit call, Ian started getting nervous. Then, deciding to just do it, he hit the button. Lucille's gear rang, and she answered it, smiling at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan's vision began to blur, but not as badly as before. He saw Lucille's eyes close, then his own vision faded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found himself sitting on the bench, looking sideways at <i>himself</i>. His Pokegear beeped in his hand, displaying two options. Remembering what Lucille said, he hit the 'Swap' button. The app went silent, and he noticed out of the corner of his eye that his own body had woken up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... what do you think?\" 'Ian' said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...\" Ian said, realizing his voice was very different. He looked at his hands and realized they were a lot slimmer than usual, and that he was wearing a long-sleeve top. He looked down... and saw a large pair of breasts encased in an orange sleeveless vest. He let out a small squeal.\"Aaaaa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahahahah\" his own body began to laugh. \"Different, isn't it? Although I have to say you are being quite a girl about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A... girl?\" Ian blushed, still looking at his breasts and noticing the skirt and tight leggings under them. He shook his head and looked back at his own body. \"Right. Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First time and all... plus I.. uhh..\" Ian stumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never been a girl before?\" his body suggested, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well duh, but that's not what I meant.\" Ian said, legs fidgeting slightly, thighs rubbing together. He noticed the lack of certain... important equipment as he did so. He also became aware of a slight... warmth? coming from that general region. Nothing he had felt before. He sighed. \"What I meant was that I'm usually not good with girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Lucille asked from his body. \"You seemed fine to me...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean I can just talk, of course. I'm not that bad.\" Ian said, and coughed slightly. He felt his.. Lucille's breasts jiggle as he did, and he subconsciously brought his hands to his chest to steady them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucille, in his body, cleared her throat. \"Uhh... what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, didn't mean to.\" Ian blushed even harder, but then noticed that Lucille was grinning. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's just funny. Watching you get uncomfortable in my body.\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what, you're completely fine being me?\" Ian replied maybe a bit sharper than he should have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well no... it's very different. Just easier to hide.\" Lucille said and stood up. Ian noticed his body's jeans had a slight protrusion... right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see... \" Ian said, still a bit red. He also stood, and felt the tight fabric of the leggings he was now wearing caress his legs as he got up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucille had a curious and naughty expression on her face... Ian blushed. He wasn't sure where this was going, but if it was what he was thinking...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what now?\" Lucille asked. \"Want to have some <i>fun</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by fun?\" Ian asked cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm very curious about my current body, and I'd bet a <i>lot</i> you are too.\" Lucille said bluntly. Ian nodded slightly, and felt the warmth in his crotch increase. \"What do you say we take some private time? Or... we could do it together...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan gulped. That was a bit too far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too much? Sorry, your body does really seem to like mine.\" Lucille said. \"Up to you, I'm keen for anything...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ian could not believe his luck. Here he was, in the body of a sexy foreign girl. She was in his, and she was <i>offering</i> for them to try out each other's bodies! That was just insane! Although he was very keen to get to feel what Lucille's body had to offer, he didn't much want to have the 'full' woman experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe if we just go do our own thing for now?\" Ian suggested, trying to sound suggestive but failing. \"I don't want to do things with a guy... even if it is me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, alright.\" Lucille replied. \"If you say so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them walked back into the Pokemon Center, barely containing their excitement. Ian could feel the warmth in his crotch building as the anticipation for what he was about to do almost became too much for him. Smiling at each other with giddy expressions on their faces, Ian and Lucille each ran to their own bathroom and slammed the door with equal fervor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan entered, eyeing the vanity mirror. Staring back was a slightly blushing Lucille, blue hair tied up in huge twin ponytails. Ian moved his hands to the breasts at his chest and gave them a good squeeze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn...\" he whispered in Lucille's sexy voice, \"This is gonna be good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wasting any time, he undid Lucille's belt and removed her vest and dropped her skirt. He stared at his reflection - that of Lucille wearing her skintight undershirt and stockings, leaving nothing to the imagination as the fabric accented every inch of her fit body. Ian let out a slight moan as he slowly moved Lucille's hands over her luscious form. His hands moved slowly down below her waist and to her nether region, which was starting to feel quite moist. That was certainly a new feeling - he'd never had a pussy before. He was definitely going to enjoy this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverrun by lust for the new body he had found himself in, Ian quickly kicked off Lucille's boots and pulled off the undershirt and stockings, leaving only a black lace  bra and matching panties. The bra showed off Lucille's impressive chest, which Ian greedily squeezed again, tickling himself and letting out another sharp moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah...\" he whispered, as he moved his hands around his back and unclasped Lucille's bra and lifted it off himself. \"Whoa...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring back at him in the mirror was now a topless Lucille, large breasts free and demanding attention. Ian teased the nipples, becoming even more horny and letting out a less controlled moan. One of his hands began, almost by itself, making its way down Lucille's toned body and down into her underwear. Ian began gently rubbing at Lucille's pussy, feeling an increasing building of pleasure. After a few seconds he realized that as fun as it was, he wanted a bit more. So, he peeled her underwear right off, spread his lovely feminine legs a bit wider, and began more aggressively playing with Lucille's pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaves of pleasure rippled through his body, causing him to gasp and moan. He rubbed, teasing where he could, and plunged a finger deep into the sticky warmth of Lucile's pussy. That released a whole new level of pleasure Ian was not prepared for. He frantically thrust his hand back and forth, adding another finger when the feeling began to dull. The pressure from the buildup was becoming immense and his legs began to buckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fuck, oh fuck\" Ian moaned, unable to manage more as he continued to plunge his fingers deeper into his nethers. He was barely aware of the reflection in the mirror, a horny and masturbating Lucille. The pressure released, and a massive wave of pleasure hit Ian \"Aaaahhhhhhhh\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moaned as he orgasmed, the pressure releasing and giving way to a shaky feeling of pure bliss that went through his entire body. He sat on the floor, naked, hand still on Lucille's nethers and rather sticky, and panted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck that was amazing...\" Ian moaned. After a few more minutes he decided to get back to the real Lucille, who was no doubt also done playing with his body. He washed his hands, replaced her clothes as best he could - he thought he did pretty well - and walked outside, sheepish grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found Lucille sitting on a chair in his body, waiting for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? What did you think?\" she asked from his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. Just wow.\" Ian replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That good huh?\" Lucille replied, sounding pleased. \"I gotta admit, you were pretty fun too. Very different. We should make a habit of this, what do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan could only nod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you want to switch back now?\" Lucille asked. Ian kept nodding and pulled out Lucille's gear, hitting the swap button. He felt the vaguely familiar dizzy sensation he had felt before, and found himself sitting down, with a lingering feeling of sexual fulfillment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You weren't kidding...\" Lucille whispered, back in her own body, and came to sit next to him. \"You really did have a lot of fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... I was thinking.\" Lucille said. \"We could have a lot of fun with that thing, and not just with what we were doing just then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Ian said, intrigued. \"Do tell...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, instead of swapping bodies, one of us could jump into someone else and ... uhh... <i>play</i> with the other.\" Lucille said, leaning in so no one would hear. There was no one around but the nurse, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean I'd possess random guys for you to have fun with, or you possess a girl for me?\" Ian asked. \"Sounds fun, but since there's only one app it could get old pretty fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucille looked at him, smiled, then said something that made Ian very excited about this prospect of fun. \"I'm bi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan looked at Lucille again, gears slowly ticking in his head. Lucille laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're saying I could possess a girl, and ...\" Ian started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly.\" Lucille cut him off. \"I figure you aren't bi, so I'd only possess other guys for my own fun... that is if you'd let me use your app.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, sure.\" Ian said. This was getting good. \"So what now...? I'm a bit tired...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured. I did give you quite a workout in there.\" Lucille laughed. \"Could we still play with the app a bit? We don't have to jump to the fun stuff right away...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good. So who's gonna use it?\" Ian asked.</span></div></div>",

She specialized in dragons, and had the temperament to match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how is this going to work?\" Ian asked. Lucille explained her plan - she would walk in, get to Clair, and give Ian the signal to use the app. It sounded like a lot of fun, and Ian agreed. They leave the Pokemon Center, excited, and fly to Blackthorn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'll wait here?\" Ian asked when they arrived at the Pokemon Center. \"And wait for your message, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Lucille said, and proceeded to walk to the gym. Ian took a seat in the Pokemon Center, eyes following Lucille as she left, then began staring restlessly at the PokeGear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucille battled her way through the trainers in Blackthorn Gym, defeating them with little difficulty. She was, after all, very accomplished, having competed in the Unova League. The boulders fell to her Aerodactyl, raising the bridge for her to proceed to the next area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made her way to the final Chamber, where she saw her prize - Clair. Tall, with long light blue hair partially tied back in a ponytail, wearing a black cape and light blue, skintight short overalls that showed off her well-rounded curves and flat stomach. Lucille smiled. Hopefully Ian would do his thing soon, and she could have Clair all to herself. Oh, that's right. She sent Ian a quick text, \"2 minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd heard a new trainer was coming...\" Clair said, piercing blue eyes staring at Lucille. \"It isn't every day someone so easily runs my gauntlet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... \" Lucille started. \"I've got a lot of experience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can tell. I'm Clair, this city's and Johto's strongest Gym leader. I specialize in the Dragon type.\" Clair said, then her gear began to ring. \"Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead, I can wait.\" Lucille said, and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan received Lucille's message, and began counting down. He was looking forward to this. Swapping bodies with Lucille had been great... and this should be so much better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo minutes had passed, and he opened the app and dialed Clair's number. Hopefully Lucille would have stalled her - he knew Clair took her job seriously, and wouldn't answer her gear during a battle. The gear rang...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then someone answered it. Ian's head began to spin, and his vision faded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe came to, and the first thing he noticed was that it was warm. Very warm. He was slightly sweaty, and his clothes were rather tight. Especially around his chest and his groin. He brushed hair out of his eyes as he opened them. Everything was still a bit blurry. When his vision returned, he saw he was in the center of Blackthorn's gym, with Lucille looking expectantly at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...?\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's me...\" Ian said, noticing his voice. It was the voice of Clair, the gym leader. He looked down at himself and whispered. \"Oh, cool...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring back at him from his chest were a large pair of tits, tightly constricted in a light blue top. Ian immediately reached his hands to them, noticing they were slimmer and a lot more toned than his. The breasts were firm and slightly sensitive - he felt a tickle as he ran his hands down his sides. Clair's short-overalls were very tight, hugging her lovely curves - now, Ian's curves. He moved a hand down to his hip, pushing it out in a pose. His hands moved around to his ass - very round, very tight, very sexy. He let out a slight moan as he stepped forward, crossing his legs and feeling the nothingness between his thighs that the overalls were so graciously hugging. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Lucille said again, stepping forward and getting Ian's attention again. Clair's gear buzzed, and Ian hit the 'auto' button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, trainer,\" Ian said, roleplaying as Clair, feeling her body getting a bit aroused as he did so, \"shall we battle? Winner gets to punish the loser...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucille smiled, a devilishly cheeky look that Ian found very appealing. </span></div></div>",

She answered, and after a quick and very animated chat, she turned her attention back to Ian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I got it!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Ian asked,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was Skyla, one of my friends from back in Unova. She's a gym leader, a pilot, and a generally all-round badass. But that's not the point. The point is that she just landed in Johto and brought all the other Unova gym leaders with her.\" Lucille said excitedly. \"And there's one particular gym leader I'd really like to have some fun with...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Ian asked, intrigued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... \" Lucille smiled devilishly. \"Anyway, their hotel is in Goldenrod, so I'll meet you there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan agreed, and they took their Pokemon over to Goldenrod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what now?\" Ian asked after Lucille had landed next to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if I know this gym leader, she probably has her own private room set up. She's pretty antisocial. Anyway, mind if I go ahead?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan handed his Gear over to Lucille, she copied a number from her PokeGear and dialed. After a couple of seconds, her eyes slid out of focus and then returned to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucille?\" Ian asked, not knowing what to expect. Her body was technically supposed to go on autopilot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" Lucille responded. \"Hotel's this way, come on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucille dragged Ian to a fancy hotel in downtown Goldenrod, a few blocks from the gym. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on a sec, let me check if my friends are in there.\" Lucille said, and walked inside. As she did, a group of eight people of various ages walked out of the main elevator. One of them, a cute red-haired girl dressed in tight shorts, a long-sleeve top which exposed a large amount of midriff, giant gloves and what looked to be a skydiver's harness, let out an excited shriek and ran up to Lucille. They hugged and started chatting. That would be Skyla, then. Behind her were the other gym leaders, one of whom in particular Ian was drawn to. A tall, thin young woman with an <i>amazing</i> body, short blonde hair in skintight black leggings and a sleeveless yellow overcoat. She glanced at Ian, gave him a slight nod, then turned her attention back to whatever it had been on before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkyla and Lucille ran outside, and most of the other gym leaders followed. The blonde woman went back to the elevator. As the other gym leaders walked out, Lucille waving at Ian as they left, the blonde woman stepped out of the elevator and walked up to Ian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on.\" she said, and pulled Ian into the elevator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucille?\" Ian asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Technically Elesa, but yeah it's me in here.\" Elesa/Lucille replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" Ian said. Elesa was stunning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... she's a hot one. A supermodel and a gym leader.\" Elesa said. Then, with a grin, added. \"Or should I say, <i>I'm</i> a supermodel and a gym leader.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan just stared. Elesa did have the body of a supermodel - thin, very fit, with pleasant curves and an air of confidence that you couldn't fake. And now with Lucille behind the wheel of that body, he might even get a chance to get to know it in more detail... They arrived at what was likely Elesa's personal room - like Lucille had said, she was not particularly social - and Ian saw a luxurious bed and a bathroom with a huge tub. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElesa sauntered over, hips swaying as she did. \"Mmmm... I love this body...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Ian, tell me.\" she said, pulling him over to the bed, leaning in very close. \"Ever fucked a supermodel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan's jaw dropped slightly, unable to process any thoughts. Elesa pushed him onto the bed and unbuttoned his pants. Then, she threw her coat to the side, revealing a very fit, toned body wearing only a black bra. Her hands fiddled behind her and the bra dropped to the floor, exposing her very perky breasts. Her nipples were already stiff, evidently awaiting attention. Ian quickly discarded his shirt, feeling the bulge in his underwear growing as Elesa pulled his face into her bare chest. Ian smooshed his face into her breasts, caressing their soft surface with his nose and lips. Then, taking initiative, he took Elesa by the torso and lifted her. She responded by jumping up and wrapping her legs around his waist - over his now rock hard cock. She winked at him and pulled him into a deep kiss, which he wholeheartedly returned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned around, dropping Elesa onto the bed. He glanced down at her legs, still covered with the skin-tight black leggings. It looked hot, but they simply had to go. With one motion, he relieved her of both her pants and her underwear - a black lacy thong. As he threw her pants to the ground, she tugged off his underwear, and pulled him onto her. Ian felt her soft, warm body under his as he made his way up, spreading her legs with his own. He plunged his cock deep into her waiting pussy and began to thrust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt amazing. Such warmth, and a rapidly building feeling of pleasure in his groin. Elesa also seemed to be enjoying herself, as she had bit her lip and was moaning. Ian continued to thrust, as hard and as fast as he could until he finished. Elesa let out a scream of pleasure, then pulled him down on top of her again. Ian could feel her heart racing as his chest ended up right over her breasts. Ian caressed them slightly, tweaking her nipple. Elesa breathed heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck, that was fun...\" Elesa moaned. Ian nodded, not having much energy for anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter lying in the bed for another half hour entirely naked, Ian stroking Elesa's breasts, legs and whatever else he could reach while Elesa only smiled at him, they got up and put on some of their clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now?\" Ian asked.</span></div></div>",

He came to and found himself sitting at a table, surrounded by people he didn't really know. A vaguely familiar girl, redhead with a large blue flower-shaped headband, was looking over him with a concerned look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luci, are you ok? You just zoned out pretty hard...\" the girl said. Ian recognized her as Skyla, Lucille's gym leader friend from back home. And she had called him Luci... Did that mean...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan looked down and saw a familiar orange sleeveless top over a black long-sleeved undershirt and large breasts. Yep, looks like he had somehow ended up in Lucille.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...\" he moaned, holding his head. It was still spinning pretty bad, and he was quite disoriented. At least he knew who he was. \"My head...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Skyla asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dunno... just... head spinning...\" Ian mumbled. \"Need to rest...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe freshen up?\" Skyla suggested. \"C'mon, I'll walk you to the bathroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting Ian's hand over her shoulder, Skyla walked them to the bathrooms. They appeared to be in the food court of the Goldenrod Department Store. Ian just barely registered that Skyla had walked them both into the girl's bathroom... then remembered that right now, he technically <i>was</i> a girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan stumbled over to a sink, and splashed cold water over his face. It did pull him back into reality a bit more, and he stared into the vanity mirror at a reflection of Lucille, huge blue pigtails and all. He smiled unenthusiastically, and watched the reflection do the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling better?\" Skyla asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bit. yeah.\" Ian replied. Then, Skyla's poke-gear rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on a sec... Elesa's calling me.\" Skyla said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElesa... so Lucille. Ian wondered what was up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she's ok. Actually just nearly passed out at the table... Sure, I'll put her on.\" Skyla said into her gear, then passed it to Ian. \"Elesa for you, Luci.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" Ian said, still a bit groggy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ian?\" he heard Elesa's voice on the other line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\" Ian replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how...? Anyway, glad you're safe and sound.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks... what's up?\" he answered, intrigued and a little concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well after you hit that button and nothing happened to me... I figured I'd go check it out. Walked into the bathroom, saw your body passed out on the ground holding my poke-gear. Panicked, but then figured I'd try to get in contact with... well, myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... well, that's good. Thanks for checking in.\" Ian said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just happy to know you're safe. Your body is fine - breathing and all, just not doing anything. Anyway, see you soon...\" Elesa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan passed the gear back to Skyla, who briefly continued a conversation with Elesa before hanging up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you should get some rest... I know you were staying in Blackthorn, which is way too far right now. So you should stay with us.\" Skyla offered. \"We don't have much space in our room...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, ok.\" Ian said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Elesa managed to get a room all to herself, and offered to share.\" Skyla said. Ian tried to hide his excitement. He had a feeling he knew what that meant... \"Anyway, let's get you up there and rested. We can hang out tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkyla walked Ian back to the hotel, to find Elesa waiting in the lobby. She had put all her clothes back on, Ian noticed. Elesa and Skyla helped him up to Elesa's room, and Ian collapsed onto the bed. Skyla left, leaving him alone with Elesa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this <i>is</i> interesting...\" Elesa said. \"So you using the return put <i>you</i> back in my body...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-uh.\" Ian said, staring down at the breasts on his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on... don't be shy... I know you want to.\" Elesa smirked, seeing where Ian's attention was. \"I kind of want to as well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan looked at Elesa, who had a seductive smile forming on her face. He began to feel a slight warmth building in his nethers... he had never experienced any girl-on-girl before. At the same time, he was concerned about his original body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... what about my body?\" Ian asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry, it's fine. I checked on it earlier.\" Elesa said, moving closer and sliding a hand around Ian's back. She pulled him in until her small breasts pushed against Ian's larger ones. One of her hands made its way down and unclipped the belt around Ian's waist, dropping it to the floor. She then slid that hand into Ian's shirt and up his bare back, lifting both his top and his undershirt up slightly. Ian felt the light airconditioning in the room caress his now bare midriff as Elesa continued to take off his top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one smooth motion she removed it completely, leaving Ian standing with only Lucille's black lace bra covering the top half of his body. Elesa discarded his top and caressed his bare skin, causing the feeling in Ian's loins to only grow. If he still had his own body, he thought idly, he would be pretty damn hard right now. Instead, he had a light tickling sensation and a warm feeling of wetness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan decided to...</span></div></div>",

He stood, and felt Elesa's hand slip off his bare stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww... that's no fun.\" Elesa complained, and stood up as well. The two girls - Ian being in Lucille's body definitely qualified him for that - made their way to the bathroom, where Ian's regular body was lying, unmoving, on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan approached, putting one slim, feminine hand on his body's neck. Sure enough, there was a pulse. He also felt a light breath on his hand - his body was breathing. That was a good sign. Although he still wasn't sure how he would get back in there - not that he wanted to right this second, given his current position and what was most likely still on the table with Elesa...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See?

Who is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan looked at the flashing screen - in flashing dark blue letters, was spelled out 'IAN'. So, his phone was calling...? He felt around, running his hands over Lucille's clothing - or whatever of it he had left, so just the pants - and indeed, he did not have his gear. Could he have dropped it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gear kept ringing. Eventually, it was picked up and answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho answered it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A vaguely familiar feminine voice said something on the other end of the line, and Ian felt his head begin to spin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuuuuuu\" he sighed as his vision blacked out and he lost consciousness. The last thing he remembered was Elesa's concerned look, and her beginning to say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan came to in another room, sitting on a bed. His head was still spinning a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hnng\" he grunted, noticing that his voice was a bit brighter and higher pitched than before. Definitely feminine, and familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan looked around, seeing a mostly bare hotel room, with another bed and a cot, an unpacked luggage bag next to each one. Where was he? And <i>who </i>was he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down, seeing large breasts covered by a tight, light blue top and what looked like dark blue suspenders. Well, that narrowed it down. He only knew of one person who dressed anywhere near that... Lucille's friend, Skyla. Ian ran to the bathroom - it was easy to find, since the hotel room was pretty small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, when Ian got to the mirror he was greeted with the cheery reflection of Skyla - long red hair mostly tied up in a bun, decorated with flowers. A long sleeved light blue top which exposed a lot of midriff covered her sizable chest. A dark blue skydiver's harness - not suspenders, as he had thought - sat over her body, with tight light blue shorts, and tall well-padded boots. She wasn't wearing the massive gloves he had seen her in earlier in the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm Skyla?\" Ian asked himself, seeing Skyla's lips move in the mirror. He smiled, a much less innocent smile than he had seen on Skyla before. He grabbed the large breasts on his chest, giving them a brief squeeze as he watched his reflection do the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonder what happened to the real Skyla?\" Ian asked himself. Last he remembered, he had been in Lucille's body and answered the call from his own body. So... if he was correct about how the app worked, the real Skyla would be in Lucille's body, answering some very awkward questions about why she was half naked with Elesa... Come to think of it, that could be fun too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took one last glance in the mirror, running his hands along his borrowed body, feeling the smooth bare skin of Skyla's stomach under his small hands.

Elesa's body was indeed something else, and if Lucille was that insistent, it had to be good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how?\" Ian asked. \"My gear is on your real body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Ian had an idea. He got out Lucille's pokegear, which he was carrying, and called his number. The 'decoy' Lucille answered. They agreed to meet up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan put his clothes back on and left the room, leaving Elesa there by herself. They agreed to wait for Ian to send a message from Lucille's pokegearbefore she would send herself back. Leaving the hotel, Ian went to find Lucille - or at least, her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan met up with Lucille. She had been with the rest of the Unova gym leaders in the Goldenrod Department Store food court. Lucille quickly left, and Ian sent the message to Elesa's pokegear. A couple of seconds later, he saw the Lucille next to him blank out for a second. Then, she came to and grinned at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, you have to try that out. So good.\" Lucille, still grinning, said and exchanged his gear back for hers. Then she winked. \"Just let me come up there too, will ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan loaded up the app and found Elesa's number in the history. He dialed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" Elesa's voice came from the other line. Ian's head began to spin as he blacked out, and found himself lying on a luxurious hotel bed. One he had been in just half an hour ago, fucking a supermodel...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA familiar pokegear beeped, and Ian pressed a slim finger on the 'Auto' button. It had worked. He felt fantastic - light, comfortable, confident, <i>sexy</i>... He stood from the bed and walked over to a nearby full-length mirror. Staring back at him was the drop-dead gorgeous figure of Elesa, gym leader and supermodel. Her short blonde hair was slightly tousled, her yellow sleeveless top was completely unbuttoned, showing a thin black bra and an exposed, toned midriff. Very form-fitting black tights adorned her long, slim, perfect legs. Ian smiled at his reflection. Lucille was right. This body was <i>fantastic</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan took his new, slim hands and ran them over his borrowed torso. Elesa's skin was so soft, Ian felt a tickle and a rising pleasure in his crotch just from caressing his skin. He hadn't even gotten to the fun parts yet... He casually slipped off her top, exposing bare shoulders and leaving himself dressed only in a bra and tights. His busy hands made their way to his legs, rubbing the inside of Elesa's fit, toned thighs. He traced a line with one finger up her crotch and to the waistband of her tights, snapping the elastic. He felt his new body getting more and more wet as he teased himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let out a sensual moan, standing upright and bringing his hands slowly up his torso to his chest. The bra was quickly unhooked, leaving him staring at impossibly perky breasts. He thought he felt himself drool a little as he fiddled with a nipple, sending pulses of pleasure through his body. Lucille wasn't kidding, this body <i>was</i> sensitive. Maybe he should find out exactly how sensitive... A mischievous smile crossed Elesa's otherwise impassive face as he moved his hands to her tights, set on removing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he remembered Lucille. Maybe he should call her? She could show him a thing or two, he was sure... </span></div></div>",

She was out of sight by now, having dashed off in... not quite the right direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gear clicked, and a panicked voice answered on the other end of the line. Barely halfway though 'hello' her voice faded, and Ian felt a strong pull on his entire body. Moments later, with a slight headache, he looked up to find himself nowhere near New Bark Town. Ahead of him was a dusty plain with large rocks, some dead grass and what looked to be very worn walking trails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where... aaiiieee!!\" Ian's question turned into a high pitched squeal as he heard his voice. Rather, <i>not</i> his. He shook his head, and saw a blue police cap fall to the ground... so he looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, he saw the modest chest of a woman in her early twenties, wrapped in a dark blue police uniform, complete with pencil skirt, tights and uncomfortable shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... it works? I'm that officer lady?\" Ian mumbled to himself, admiring his gloved, unusually petite hands and checking his surroundings, hoping no one was around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was drawn out of his trance by a buzzing - the officer's pokegear. It wad blue like her uniform, and presented two options... hitting 'auto', Ian resumed his dumbfounded staring at his hands. \"This is unreal...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell, maybe I could be a better officer than this chick\", Ian thought, running back to New Bark. Maybe he could grab the Rocket pokegear from... himself? Sure. Then he could maybe track down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**CRASH**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot being used to tight skirts and uncomfortable shoes, Ian managed to trip over what might have been a small rock... or a Geodude... and his face very quickly said hi to the ground in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ughh...\" Ian groaned, lifting himself up onto his feet and dusting himself off, brushing against his chest in the process. \"Oh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking another look around to make sure no one saw, Ian gave his newfound assets a nice squeeze. They weren't as big as, say, Lyra's, but they were here, and they were his. Technically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Ian finally finished 'dusting himself off', he made his way back to where the officer he was now occupying had tried to cuff him. His body wasn't there, and neither was the Rocket pokegear. He looked at his own gear, seeing an option to switch himself back into his original body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" Ian thought.</span></div></div>",

Honestly, you didn't call that many random people on your gear, so it was surprising you had an unnamed number just sitting there. \"Eh, only one way to find out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hit call, curious about who was going to answer. If the app worked, you could potentially be in for a nice surprise.... whoa. Your head started spinning as the call connected. Coincidence? A beep sounds on the other end as the call was picked up, and your vision fades to black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...\" you moan as you come to, sporting a massive headache. In your hands is a black poke-gear with two flashing icons on the screen - 'Swap' and 'Auto'. You hit 'Auto', thinking it'd be less trouble. What would the 'Swap' mean, anyway? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gear beeps obediently, and you feel your headache fade, and your blurry vision turns back to normal. You were <i>definitely</i> no longer in New Bark Town. You were alone in what looked to be a giant warehouse. Makeshift walls were set up all over the place, with a giant metal door directly to your right. Large, heavy grey pipes were hung from the ceiling, maybe six feet from your head. Where the hell was this place? It smelled kind of funny, as if no one had dusted or washed it for months. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eww\" you say, and notice for the first time that your voice was very different. \"Huh? My voice...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hands move to your throat. You feel a distinct lack of an adam's apple, and your usually slightly unshaven stubble was not there either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" you say and look down. \"Holy shit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreeting your field of view was a black outfit with a large red R written across your chest. Not only that, your chest was a lot <i>larger</i> than usual. You grab the new globes on your chest and see that the top you're wearing is long-sleeved, and that you have grey gloves on. They don't stop you from squeezing your newfound assets, as you run around the room in panic looking for a mirror or something. There was nothing, and you find it particularly difficult to run. A quick check with your hands revealed you were wearing a rather tight skirt that seemed to stop at around knee level. No wonder you couldn't move very fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing your poke-gear, you switch it to camera mode and look at yourself. Sure enough, looking back at you was the picture of a cute, short, female Rocket grunt. You let out a gasp, watching the Rocket do the same on the screen. You stash the gear back in your pocket, and run your hands down your sides. It felt... different. You weren't used to having such wide hips... or breasts, come to think of it. Your hands returned to them and continued to play. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then remembered where you might have gotten that number from. It was on a piece of paper, inside one of the hideouts you had infiltrated. So now you were a member of Team Rocket - or at least, in the body of a member. You could gather all kinds of intelligence on their operation from this position... but then again they were rumoured to be closing up shop after you foiled them yet again. Clearly some stragglers remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head. Then a sinister smile creeps onto your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dear miss Rocket...\" you say in as sultry voice as you can manage. Your male mind is extremely turned on by these events, and hearing your own voice sound like that is very appealing. You pull off your gloves and run your bare hands over your bountiful chest - it feels nicer without gloves, as you had expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then decide to</span></div></div>",

You had your priorities, and Team Rocket went against nearly all of them, but in a way this was just insult to injury, right? You take them down, and now you steal one of their own for yourself. It was as solid enough logic as anything else, as far as it concerned you. You decide you've overcome that mental hurdle and take a look around, this base seemed largely abandoned. Only a couple of other grunts were wondering around, seemingly doing exactly what your dear little Miss Rocket was doing here, wondering what to do next. Thankfully nobody question you wandering around because of this, and you managed to find a private room fairly easily, locking the door behind you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis probably wasn't this woman's room in particular, but it would do. You find a mirror, and already you're loving the face that stared back at you. The serious eyes and pink hair were a combination you couldn't help but find attractive. The cap and gloves are tossed off without a second thought, and the rest of the Rocket uniform soon follows. Upon peeling off the shirt and getting a look at the black bra with a red \"R\" emblazoned on one of the cups, you smile. \"Oh yeah, I'm<i> stacked!</i>.\" These breasts looked nice before, but now that you got a sense of how much the tight uniforms held back, you were practically drooling. Hell, the bra alone seemed to be holding back quite a bit of your bust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop wasting time and reach back to unhook the bra, the sudden release of tension immediately evident to you. \"Geez.\" You hadn't realized how much pressure you'd felt up until that moment, these breasts really were big. You slide the bra off and let it hit the ground, cupping your naked tits with glee. \"Who says crime doesn't pay?\" You tell your reflection with a smile and a laugh, fondling your new assets happily. You could do this all day, and it was tempting to do so, but you'd have all the time in the world to play with your new tits whenever you wanted. Your fingers hook into the black panties around your waist, and you take a second to have fun pulling at and posing yourself in them before slipping a hand underneath. \"Team Rocket's new mission starts now!\" You joke to yourself as your delicate hand finds it's prize: your pussy. You actually had one of those now, and you were so excited to give it a try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, your fingers work at the lips and you moan, the sensation taking you off guard. \"Woah...\" You look down at yourself with astonishment, this was gonna be better than you imagined.</span></div></div>",

You hear the door start to unlock, and in your blind panic at the thought being caught, leap behind a couch to hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door swings open and in walks a tall, redheaded woman in a white Rocket Executive uniform. You recognized her from some of the fights you had with Team Rocket before, but didn't know her name. Of all the rooms you could have stumbled into to get down and dirty, you just had to end up in the one of one of the Rocket bosses. At the very least she doesn't seem to see you, yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike clockwork, the moment you think you might be out of the clear the woman leans over... and pulls the discarded Rocket bra off the ground and squints at it. \"What's this...?\"  In your rush, you must have forgotten to pick it up with the rest of your host's belongings. She glances around the room. \"Who's in here?! Show yourself! Now!\" The woman's cold tone puts fear in your heart, and you chastise yourself silently for your stupid mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance down at the pokegear you snatched up in your hands as you went to dive, and then it hits you. Duh! You could just un-possess this Rocket chick and get out of here! You boot it up to load the app, noticing that the Rocket grunt's contact list has the woman's picture there!

Immediately you find yourself on the other side of the room, standing up instead of being on the ground cowering. You glance down at the bra in your hand, and then to the absolutely MASSIVE pair of tits you'd just inherited. \"Holy fucking shit.\" You say out loud, lifting the gigantic tits from beneath. Apparently you just hadn't noticed from your angle behind the couch, but this woman was absolutely<b><i> stacked</i></b>. You remember to once again tap 'auto' on your Pokegear, before you forgot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your head at the sound of a woman groaning behind the couch, and you see the Rocket Grunt you'd just abandoned standing up and rub her head. \"What... what happened...?\" She mutters in confusion, looking around before seeing you, which makes her snap to attention. \"B-boss! What are you? What am I?\" She stammers out, before noticing her bra in your hand, and then notices her half naked form. \"Oh god!\" She yells out, making an attempt to cover herself with her arms. \"Why am I undressed? What am I doing in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smirk to yourself, but then drop it quickly as you get the idea to play in character to what you assumed this Boss lady was like for a bit. \"I found you passed out in MY office, grunt.\" You hold up the bra in your hand. \"De-uniformed. You care to explain yourself?\" You ask her in a threateningly cold tone, to which the grunt looks absolutely terrified. \"I-I- Ma'am- I was just in the storage section and-\" You put up a hand. \"Save it, girl. Tell me your name.\" You ask her, wanting to remember this grunt for later should you choose to take her body for another joyride down the line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grunt gulps. \"S-suki, ma'am.\" She manages to stammer out. You shoot her another cold look, and then motion with your head toward the door. \"We shall not speak another word of this, grunt. Go back to your duties. Dismissed.\" You order her. The Rocket named Suki had already started slipping her skirt back on. \"Yes ma'am!\" She looks at her bra currently in your hand and opens her mouth, presumably to ask for it, to which you shoot her another cold look and raise your voice. \"<b><i>DISMISSED!</i></b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tone and volume of your voice sends the grunt bolting out the door and down the hall, holding up her shirt to cover her front. You watch as she runs off, and then close the door. Alone again at last, and you burst out laughing. \"Ahahahaha! That was great!\" You couldn't believe how much fun that was! Being a Rocket Boss was awesome! You may have been panicked at first, but you ended up all the better for it. \"And a souvenir of my dear little first host...\" You say to yourself, smirking as you spin the bra on your finger by the strap. You'd consider trying it on this body, but obviously the size difference was far too great to even bother. \"Heh. Speaking of...\" You turn to the mirror and get a good look at yourself again, hands once again running over your massive bust upgrade. \"Now THIS is a body.\" You quickly go through the motions of undressing once again, finding a nametag with 'Ariana' on it. \"So that's my name now, huh?\" You ask yourself out loud, before looking back at the beautiful half-naked adult woman in the mirror and smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who says crime doesn't pay?\" You ask yourself with a chuckle. This woman looked to be about 30 years old, younger than your mom by a couple years. The signs of age hadn't even begun to show on this lady, and could easily pass for being in her 20's with how taut her skin felt. \"I think we've found ourselves a winner...\"</span></div></div>",

I almost regret kicking their asses so hard into the ground.\" You tell your reflection as you reach up and massage a tit. \"Stealing can be fun after all... heheheh~ Hahahaha~!\" You start to laugh to yourself as you reach back and undo your black lace Rocket branded bra, grunting as the release of tension relieves you somewhat. \"Hah, much better.\" You say as you let the bra slink to the ground, now getting a chance to see your perfect and massive breasts in full glory. Your hands waste no time fondling the massive fleshy things, pinching your nipples between delicate feminine fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hnnn~ God~\" You groan, smiling down at your body with delight. You could do just this all night, but where was the fun in that? You went over to the desk and rummaged around the drawers, pulling out a small fancy looking box. \"Hello~ What have we here?\" You pry it open and inside sits a high end and expensive dildo, and its positively massive. \"Ohohoho~ Nice...\" You say with a smile as you sit back in the fancy and comfortable luxury office chair, kicking your feet up on the desk and taking a moment to admire the garter and leggings running up your nice womanly legs. You cradle the dildo close to your face with a smirk. \"Oh, we're gonna have some fun, me and you.\" You say to it before running your tongue up from the base of it's shaft to the tip and slipping it into your mouth. You'd never done this sort of thing before, but when in Rome...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou moaned, sucking and sliding the dildo in and out of your throat. You loved the lack of a gag reflex on this body already. While you're busy deep throating your new toy, your other hand starts to rub at the fabric of your black lace panties, stimulating yourself even more and bringing you to moan. Your eyes roll back a bit and you rub your pussy even harder, coming to a climax shortly and pulling the dildo from your mouth and gasping for air. \"Oh...my god, that was... fucking amazing...\" You soon notice that despite your orgasm, you still felt ready to go. \"Holy shit... I get multiple orgasms now? Ahahahah- holy shit, I'm never going back to being a guy ever again!\" You laugh, reaching down and pulling your panties off at blinding speed. Thankfully, you were plenty wet already from that last round, and you shove the gigantic dildo straight in and moan the most whorish, titillated moan you'd ever heard in your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-fuuuuuck~\" You groan out, toes curling as pleasure grips your body. You pump the dildo as deep in as you could possibly manage, wanting your pussy to stay feeling nice and filled by your wonderful toy as long as it could. You flick a switch at the base and the vibration function turns on, and you let out another womanly yell as your body shakes and twitches with the new wave of intense euphoria. Your tits bounce and bounce as you keep pumping your toy in with both hands, almost hypnotic in it's rhythm, until you finally feel yourself hitting that familiar climax. Your back arches as you cum, and you let go of the dildo to grip the handles on your chair, which causes it to slide out of you and land on the floor. You flop back in the chair fully and start panting, having actually broke a bit of a sweat with all that action. \"Holy fuck.\" Is all you can say despite yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf this woman felt that good, how must it feel to do it as somebody else?</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Your an accomplished male Trainer in the Johto region! Your Mother and Father moved there shortly after you were born, and you grew up in New Bark town since! After receiving your first Pokemon, you went on to become a sucessful trainer, earing 8 gym badges, and even making it quiet a good ways into the Pokemon league! Today you are getting ready to start out on your journey once more, looking to catch some new Pokemon! However, before you go, your father gives you somthing! It's a brand new PokeGear, but it seems to have a special application attached to it! You're father tells you it's from the Sinnoh region, but he isn't quiet sure how it will work with your PokeGear. He winks and tells you, \"I'll give you the same advice I got when I recieved this gift...The best way to learn is to do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly possess pokemon characters, I have the right to edit your posts,this is based off the game, not the anime.<br>\r\nAll girls in this story have developed breasts, unlike the anime where they're much more wary when drawing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few main characters:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan (the second), short for 'Insert a name'<br>\r\nThis is you. Your normally a pretty decent guy, but with this new PokeGear, well, you figure out the rest. You're dressed as the HG/SS main male hero of course<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra: Your sexy female rival, she has no connections to the anime. Dressed as your female rival from HG/SS<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank: Your kinda emo red hair'd male rival. Bit of a loner, your not on very good terms with him. Your pretty sure he's got the hots for Lyra, but this doesn't limit his options if you know what I'm saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCathy: Your Mom. Looks like your Mom from the HG/SS. Brown hair, pink blouse, white apron, pink dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohto gym leaders: Consist of Whitney, Jasmine, and Claire. Go play the game to find out more about them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohto Elite 4: Karen <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanto gym leaders: Misty, Erika, Sabrina, Janine<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanto Elite 4: Agtha<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDont' be afriad to add ones where they're needed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you posses a girl, your body can either go on Auto Piolet, or have the person you swapped with in control. When on auto piolet, your body will remember nothing about the PokeGear, it's possession feature, or it's soul leaving. It's a one sided possession. If normal swap, the person should react how you think they would normally react to suddenly finding themselves in a different person's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo killing the main character, no ending the story<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon't be afraid to add some chapters folks! Seriously! I'm adding most of them! I mght even give you some gift points if it's a good chapter!<br>\r\n</td>",
