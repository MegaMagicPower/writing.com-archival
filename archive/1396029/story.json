When everyone got into position, several robots came out and went to each team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What're these?\" Lucario asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The newb doesn't even know what these robots are for!\" Kirby said, sounding clearly ticked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink gave him a stern look, and then said to Lucario, \"These are ROBs, which stands for Robotic Operating Buddy. They take care of almost everything for us. They act as scales, timekeepers, and alarms. They can do almost anything except cook, which is why we have to choose someone of our team to cook for the rest of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach individual ROB opened a small crevice in each of their heads and simultaneously said in a mechanical voice, \"All cooks please put their ID cards in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMario, Snake, Fox, Donkey Kong, Captain Falcon, Luigi, and Wario all stepped forward and placed their ID cards into the crevice on the top of their team's respective ROB. After a few seconds of scanning the ID cards, they spit them back out, and all said, \" Permit me to lead you to your room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach team split up to follow their ROB, each going down a different hallway. Lucario looked at each door that they passed. One read, \"Control Room.\" Another said, \"Training Grounds.\" Yet another one stated, \"Brawl Chamber.\" Finally, they got to this one door that read, \"Team 3's room.\" ROB opened this door, and allowed the rest to go inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight of this room made Lucario gasp. Everything from the furniture down to the wallpaper was extravagant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a 50\" Plasma screen on the opposite wall, equipped with a Nintendo Wii, and a giant couch in front of it, complete with a coffee table inbetween the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a large kitchen area, complete with a big Fridge, Stainless-steel oven, and pantry filled to the brim with food, along with a big dining area for meals and snacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were several doors that each had the name of whoever was going to be sleeping in there. One for Mario, one for Link, one for Kirby, one for Pikachu, and one last one for Lucario.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario had only a few seconds to look though, because Kirby said, \"Jeese newb, I can't believe it. You walk into a new room, and you think it's God's Bedchamber!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPikachu started to charge up electricity when Mario said, \"Pikachu, don't-a even think about it-a. We're all-a teammates here. And you-a don't hurt teammates-a.\" With that, Pikachu started to simmer down and turn off his attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nROB then went over to the center of the room. Then, the bottom part of his body started to come out from under him, and his eyes changed to look like some sort of number counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's he doing?\" Lucario asked. \"He's-a changing into a scale-a,\" Mario replied, \"You see-a, every week, ROB has to-a take the weight of the-a Brawlers who are-a gaining. Each Brawler has to gain a minimum of-a 35 pounds each week to stay-a in the tournament. Right-a now, he's-a taking your starting weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirby was first to get on the scale. He put his ID card in, and ROB said, \"Sir Kirby. Starting weight: 44 pounds.\" \"Wow,\" he said, \"I bulked up since last year.\" He hopped off, and Pikachu hopped on and put in his ID. And ROB said, \"Sir Pikachu. Starting weight: 35 pounds.\" Pikachu looked at the rest of the team, as if to say, \"That's going to change very soon.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink got on the scale, and put in his ID. ROB said, \"Sir Link, please take off your gear.\" \"Excuse me?\" Link asked. \"We go through this-a every year Link, I think he knows your-a gear makes you heavier.\" Link grumbled to himself, then took off his boots, put down his sword and shield, and put everything that he'd been carrying over on the coffee table, which consisted of bombs, a boomerang, several tunics, a few pairs of gloves, and many pairs of boots. He then got back on ROB, who said, \"Sir Link. Starting weight: 132 pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink got off the scale, and Lucario stepped on. He was a bit reluctant at first, but he put in his ID. ROB then said, \"Sir Lucario. Starting weight: 86 pounds.\" With that, Lucario stepped off, and ROB went over to a small door on the side of the wall. It closed up, and then Mario said, \"Well, who's-a hungry?\" Link, Kirby, and Pikachu all said at the same time, \"ME!\" Lucario said, \"Let me just go over and see my room. I want to get settled first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine-a,\" Mario said. Lucario went over to the door to his room, which opened by itself. He walked in, and saw that his room was just as fantastic as the living room. There was a huge bed, with blue sheets and pillows, showing that this was his bed. There was another television right in front of it, only not as huge as the one outside, but still pretty big. There were 2 more doors in there that each led to his own personal closet and bathroom. There was also a dresser in there for putting all of the stuff that he'd brought with him, with extra room for other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put his suitcase on the bed, and started to unpack all of his stuff. \"This is going to be the best 6 months of my life,\" he said to himself. Right when he finished, he heard Mario scream, \"Lucario! It's-a time for dinner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Lucario went out to have his first meal with his teammates.</span></div></div>",

He looked up as he heard the gate at the summit of the stairs rattle and open. Flying up the stairs, Lucario's world filled with brilliant white light as the roaring crowd blared in his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his eyes adjusted he took in the sight of the ocean of cheering spectators. He had to admit he wasn't much for exposure, yet even he could not deny the energy in the tremendous arena. Looking around he made his way along the narrow walkway up to the elevated platform when he noticed how oddly flat it was. Stranger still he saw his opponent had already entered the arena and was nodding casually as Ballyhoo jabbered at her. What could they possibly have to discuss. Lucario noticed just how beautiful the woman was. Samus was an imposing woman. With a strong jawline and strong features, she wore a toned, muscular build whilst somehow retaining a distinctly feminine body. Strangely enough she was neither in her power suit, nor her Zero suit. Instead she word a loose dark blue bra that seemed to be three sizes too large. That and a pair of, what seemed like a giant matching dark blue diaper. It was a large wrap around her waist, thick and far too big even for the mighty woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFoot slamming onto the open arena floor Samus and the announcer both turned. Samus looked at Lucario with a look of utter confidence, as if she just saw an ant enter her room. Lucario felt as if he were missing something important as he watched Ballyhoo scurry off of the arena. Samus held Lucario's attention as he expression of utter satisfaction seemed to glare right through him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did not like Samus, she was what many people would call... kind of a bitch. Being around her was much like being around a bear. She was imposing and did little to pay mind for those caught in her way. It seemed nobody truly seemed on the blonde woman's level. And yet whenever they stepped into the arena with her they found themselves again and again outdone. This puzzled Lucario all the more as he watched Samus cock her hip while trying to hike up her garments to remain decent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could ask what they hell she was thinking, BallyHoo's voice rang out on the speakers and the crowd cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boooys and giiiiirls! Do we have a match for you! Lucario, the cunning fox warrior going up against what might be his greatest foe yet. The as of yet undefeated Samus Aran.\" Lucario twitched a bit at the last comment, trying not to admit it was true. \"And we wish him the best because Samus rolled lucky this round!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario's heart skipped a beat as Samus smirked and pulled out a strange mushroom. Similar to one of Mario's mushrooms it had to large beady eyes on the stalk and a white cape save for a thick red 'T' over the top similar to the diaper Samus wore. Lucario's Eyes widened as he began to realize what he might go up against. The path behind him began to recede trapping him with what must be a very painful and slow demise. Samus on the other hand let her bright blue eyes glint as they took in Lucario's utter desperation. Her smile only grew sharper as she let him know how utterly mighty she was about to become. Ballyhoo rang in as the bounty hunter raised back her head and opened her mouth, the mushroom was tossed in the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With out further ado... Sumo match begins... Now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd roared with applause almost as if they were worshipping the blonde as she happily waited for the shroom fell to her pretty mouth. Lucario made a desperate leap towards his foe, hoping to take advantage of this. However the mushroom entered Samus' lips and with a gulp the mushroom defended into her stomach. Lucario ground to a halt in the center of the arena. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Bubah Bump!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamus began to cackle as the tremendously heavy arena began to quiver and shake around her form. Her body heaving back and forth as she seemed to be beginning to break a sweat. Doubling over in what seemed like a mix of exertion, laughter, and pleasure her body began to grow. However despite making her taller as mushrooms did, only when the shadow of the amazonian bounty hunter began to widen did Lucario realize the horrible truth. Samus' body began to thicken as she grew larger. Her arms and shoulders began to bulge and swell as they expanded with tremendous amount of hard muscle mass coated in a smooth, round layer of fat. Two round shoulders gave her a very broad look as those sitting in the stands behind her gained a full view of her enormous back. Her muscles began to grow but they defied huge. They were beyond what one could image a large human could be. Rippling muscles coated under smooth, soft flesh lay utterly massive and unattainable even unflexed to anyone but her. To support her Lucario watched as the woman's thighs exploded like massive pillars of steel coated in soft body fat. They seemed to not even need to tense to support her enormous size. Just then Samus' stomach began to wobble as she continued to cackle. With a mighty shove of her hips towards Lucario her belly burst outward. Her admirers behind her reeling slightly as her butt ballooned outward, engulfing the blue thong between her titanic buttcheeks, each one three times the size of lucario. In all the woman grew so large her belly almost reached lucario at the center of the arena. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHefting one mighty foot in the air, Lucario fell to his back as Samus slammed both feet dramatically on the ground. Chuckling at the apparent lack of effort. Her giant face hung over Lucario as the voice rang out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FIGHT!\"</span></div></div>",

A ball of steel that was the giant woman's belly hovering over him making him feel like an infant looking at an adult. Covered in a wobbling layer of fat Samus giggled to herself as the terrible realization of just how badly Lucario was to be pulverized became apparent. His feet shaking, all his courage before the beautiful big bodied beast before him. He took no time turing to run in the opposite direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grin of utter satisfaction Samus hefted her mass in slow, powerful stomps pursuing Lucario. She let her enormity take up more and more of the punch-meat's escape routes. Lucario reached the brink of the arena when he felt his world go dark. He turned only to see the giant sumo lift her chubby, but terrifyingly strong foot over his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a horrific slam, Lucario found himself struggling not to be smeared into paste under a wall of sweaty flesh. Samus smiled smugly over her prey, playing with him as she wriggled her toes over the helpless opponent. She rose her foot high in the air just long enough for the poor soul to open his eyes before her full crushing weight smashed into his helpless form. Her mass was tremendous and soon Lucario was nothing more than  a paper-thin strip. Regardless Samus continued to sadistically stomp and grind her foot over the helpless smaller smasher. She took great delight in seeing her foe sticking to her sole as she peeled her opponent off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne giant hand was all it took to hold the flattened Lucario in her clutches. The massive blue eyes of Samus glared into Lucario as he was entirely at her mercy. He tried to plead with his eyes, unable to speak for her to accept his surrender. But Samus simply crumpled him up in her hands like a note slip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think you can escape me that easily?\" Her cold, feminine tone boomed over the still flat Lucario. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you are my bitch, and you will suffer like one until I feel you can leave.\" With that Samus pursed her lush lips and pressed them against Lucario. The smaller victim's world became once again smothered by the gurthsome goddess's flesh. Her lips pressed him hard before her belly swelled and she gave a mighty blow into Lucario, filling him with air and making him solid once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever this was hardly a sign of mercy as Samus used her powerful arms to toss Lucario to the ground. Stuck in the sand, Lucario meregerly could only watch as the towering blonde patted her enormous stomach. A grim realization hit Lucario as he watched the massive bounty hunter squat herself low before leaping high in the air. Though Samus was now indeed massive, nothing compared to watching her grow larger as she defended upon you, her shadow covering more and more of the world around you. Lucario screamed before the mountain of tummy smashed into him, the entire arena shook with tremors as the woman's girth crushed poor Lucario. There was a moment of silence as Samus rose to her feet, The once again flat Lucario stuck to her belly. She raised her arm and the arena burst into cheering.</span></div></div>",

He knew it would be impossible to stop smelling like the giant woman's scent now. The weaker creature tried pitifully to pull himself free from the gigantic woman as she flexed and displayed her firm but massive body. With a loud laugh she patted her stomach letting the gigantic boulder of tummy wobble sending poor Lucario for a ride. Then out of no where a deep, dull rumble shook Lucario as Samus blushed, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach was growling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling of the girth some woman's belly sweat washing over him he felt a pang of utter dread as his Lumbering master peeled him off her smooth belly. Held tight within her iron grip he was held before her pretty, smiling face. He felt like he was being stared down by a shark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Lucario I hope you had as much fun as I did. I mean I don't care but I guess even a badass like me can be kind enough to give a token complement to her punch meat. Mmmm, meat.\" With a soft, womanly giggle amplified by her sheer mass the woman licked her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if not then don't worry, with you only adding to my size there is PLENTY more fun on the way!\" With that the crowd roared as the Terrified Lucario could only watch as the blonde lifted her head back and parted her soft lips. She sadistically let Lucario flail his arms in gains for a few moments before she finally released him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a hopeless yelp he smacked his waist into her soft lower lip and felt her powerful tongue smash into his head. The warm sticky appendage stuck to the side of his face and pulled him further into the maw as the lips sucked is helplessly struggling form into her mouth. Samus gave a cute hum of satisfaction as she sloshed Lucario around her mouth. She let herself stand before the stunned weaklings of the arena as she began to suck out the taste of her prey. She could not help but be reminded of some stories she had heard once long ago visiting a jungle planet about creatures who sadistically enjoy devouringing prey. Though she would never admit it, she began to see the appeal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Lucario was beginning to lose his flavor and soon he found the strong muscles of Samus' throat force him down her throat. The warm tunnel pushed and squeezed Lucario until he plummeted into a warm, wet, chamber. Samus let out an enormous burp of triumph as the crowd roared with cheers.</span></div></div>",

There were no gatherings of heroes and villains from all over the multiverse to do battle for fun and glory. Those that remained hid. However two figures soon emerged frantically but cautiously making their way down the hall and through the mansion as quickly and quietly as they could be. Princess' Peach and Zelda scurried as fast as their heeled-feet would allow. The arising of the new sumo class of fighters may have thrown a wrench into the machinations of the tournament, but they were royalty, not rats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll they same they had to scurry their small feet and cower behind anything they could find when a towering sumo made her way by. There was a match happening, thus they at least hoped there would be less to hide from. Peach looked frantically about her with a huff before slamming into Zelda who had stopped in front of her. She gave a quick \"eep!\" and instantly covered her mouth. \"You hear that?\" Zelda asked, Peach shook her head, still covering her mouth. Zelda pointed to the corner of the massive corridor. Moving through the house of giants Zelda hurried off with toadstool in tow. Zelda leaned up against the corner and told Peach to wait until she checked to see if anything was coming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmedietly a massive column of wobbling flesh stomped next to them. Zelda cursed Lucina's fat padded feet as the titanic girl towered over the mouse-sized princesses. Good for them they were so small the giant sumo-girl had not noticed them, but soon the massive legs spun the giant swords woman around as her wobbling tummy slid against the door to the laundry mat the royal duo were cast in the giantess sumo's shadow as she tossed her used underwear down right on top of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a powerful thoom the princess's were trapped under a pile of smelly used underwear. Lucina reached around her for a key only to realize she forgot it. With a tired sigh she stomped off as Zelda and Peach pushed their way out of the pile and gasped for a fresh smell. They watched as Luncina's massive butt wobbled away, her panties swallowed much like the ones they were covered in had been. Made slightly woozy from the overwhelming scent of Lucina the two made their way into the cafeteria finally. Slipping under the massive door Peach practically leaped for joy as they saw massive tables of food bigger than their castles! Given that any smasher not given the Sumo-shroom was either crushed or eaten on sight, neither of the princess had any power to get food for themselves lest they became some. The two water no time in scurrying very much like mice towards the nearest and lowest table of food. The sumo's may have been gluttons but they sure new how to have a good time. All round them were stacks of pancakes topped in syrup and berries, waffles smothered in whipped cream and chocolate. Steaming eggs, bacon, sausage, giant fruit and massive towers of butter and toast. Zelda dived straight into the gravy-coated mashed potatoes while Peach gorged herself on some ham. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever the duo began to reap the rewards of their risk, Zelda found her little patch of heaven raise into the air. Peach began to look about for her friend only to have the giant slice of ham lift into the air. \"Are you done? Honestly when I first saw you two ants scamper in here I thought I might enjoy watching you two try to get any food you could. But I think I get more pleasure burping then you did just now pests!.\" The massive, smirking face of Paultinia the goddess loomed over them as her fork mixed the ham with the mashed potatoes Zelda and Peach were stranded on. Without warning the green-haired goddess's bulbous cheeks let fourth a violent belch over the two and the goddess laughed. \"Then again it is pretty fun having you two around. Without another word the fork was shoved into her mouth and the morsels devoured not even stopping to savor the taste as the fat god scooped up more food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer massive doughy ass planted on the ground Paultinia hefted one of her buttcheeks up with her hand and grunted, her mouth and belly stuffed. With a grunt she released a tempest of foul wind strong enough to knock over hyrule castle. <br>\r\n'Whew! How did that one taste galaxy girl? I need to lay off these beans!\" Paultinia let out a laugh as the helpless Samus Aran, now stuck at her current size forever was only barely exposed from under the goddess's lifted buttcheeks. Paultinia smoked as she heard the Bounty hunter's whining before dropping her rump back down with a powerful thwomp, trapping her again with another fart of many to come. Letting out a great yawn of triumph, Paultinia flexed her immense and muscular back and arms. Yes despite being utterly gluttonous, her musculature and physical strength was greater than hurcules, as her massive biceps swelled with power, Paultinia thought of how much she will enjoy returning to being a goddess in her world, she couldn't even feel Samus kicking underneath her.</span></div></div>",
