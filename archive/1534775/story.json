He was to person who was responsible for Ken Kaneki's tranformation into an artificial One-Eyed Ghoul, and is a member of the mysterious underground ghoul organization Aogiri Tree. Working as their personal \"mad scientist\" he continues to create more artificial One-Eyed Ghoul as well as other devious innovations. One of those innovations was the project codenamed named \"Bodyjacker\". Bodyjacker was an artificial One-Eyed Ghoul that Kanou created to be the perfect spy and one of the most powerful ghouls due to his special ability to possess ghoul's bodies. Bodyjacker was a human named Jack. Jack was born into Kanou lab and was raised as a lab rat his whole life. Dr. Kanou created from Bodyjacker's kakuhou a device that will grant its user with Bodyjacker's body possession ability. The device was in the form of a Quinque suitcase. The suitcase was black with a purple design border with the word Jack printed on the side of the suitcase. Dr. Kanou being the \"mad scientist\" he is sent his newest innovation to ________ to be field tested. Where was the quinque sent to who?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"Jack\" Quinque ability:<br>\r\n <br>\r\nDr. Kanou has created a quinque, but this isn't just like any other quinque like the CCG's have been using, but a rather greater class of weapon. Using the RV cells of a ghoul \"Bodyjacker\" he has created the \"Jack\" a quinque that gives the user the power of body possession. The user is able to possess anybody human or ghoul. It works by turning into a bowie knife. Upon first look it seems like a any other bowie knife, but the Jack gives the user the ability to teleport anywhere at will and if used to stab somebody will transfer the users mind into the victim's body.

Siping on his coffee he read todays news in paper. \"Ghouls kill 23 in Tokyo's subways\" the paper read. Kaneki began to tighten his grip on the paper as he was anger that there are ghouls out there in Aogiri Tree that kill humans for the pure sport of it. \"I wish I was more powerful so I can protect the ones I love. Kaneki looked at the black nails and white hair he had revived thanks to Jason, ever since he had gained more powerful and his power got more dangerous after every fight and ghoul eaten, but he feels like he is powerless to even more powerful ghouls like the upper class Aogiri members and wished he possessed a greater power. Just then Kaneki noticed a black and purple suitcase in front of the shop. Kaneki looked around to see if anyone had forgotten it, but picked it up and gone to the back room of the shop. Kaneki looked at the suitcase and found a note taped on the side. It reads <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"Dear Kaneki, I have chose you as another one of my test subjects for this quinque.
