            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There\u2019s nothing like it. The wide open inner-city roads, the clear blue skies, the mighty eardrum numbing engine roaring at her feet as it thrusts the bike forward. Sam Puckett couldn\u2019t possibly feel more complacent than she does now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure the babysitting services does rile up a hoot every now and then with an adventure to some usually strange location in the town, but just getting out of earshot of Cat\u2019s blathering voice really helps clear her mind and let her be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing to a stop along the boardwalk, Sam parks her hog on the nearby wooden bench. She reclines, relaxed, soaking in the sun\u2019s UV rays and breathing in the fresh ocean air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll was right with the world\u2026until, \u201cHey!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled, Sam snaps her head to the source of the sudden noise. Within her sight, she saw a rather tall Latino girl, about the same age as Sam, angrily trudging towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam greeted with a simple, \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t \u2018WHAT\u2019 me! What are you doing riding on my turf?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour turf? I don\u2019t see your name all over the road.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl huffed, crossing her arms, \u201cDon\u2019t get smart with me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, don\u2019t get stupid with me,\u201d Sam retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk to me like that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t, don\u2019t, don\u2019t. Why don\u2019t you \u2018DO\u2019 something and bug somebody else, ya lanky-.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnraged, the girl\u2019s face turned as red as a tomato. Her fuse had been lit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one swift motion the girl kicked Sam in the chest and onto the wooden planks of the boardwalk. With the velocity she moved at Sam tumbled a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeave!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnger slowly rising within her being, Sam spat and brushed off her leather jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, Sister!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam bum rushed the girl and threw a flurry of right and left hooks only to be grappled and thrown right into her bike, knocking it over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam struggles to stand upright. The taller girl leers into her eyes, sending a look of evil intent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet out of my turf before it\u2019s too late, scrawny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDefeated, Sam hops onto her bike, mumbles, and zooms away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGasp, Sam! What happened to you?!?\u201d Cat questioned at Sam\u2019s roughed up appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam hobbles through the door and didn\u2019t make it far before she crashed on the couch groaning in pain, \u201cSome chick at the boardwalk threw me into my bike for riding on \u201cher turf\u201d.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s awful! \u2026wait. You didn\u2019t beat her up? She beat you up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could\u2019ve, but\u2026she was bigger\u2026than me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, you\u2019re Sam Puckett. You never lose a fight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t lose the fight. We\u2019re just in-between rounds right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! So is it not to late to see it on pay-per-view?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam grumbles at Cat\u2019s ignorance, \u201cI just need to make some adjustments to myself. Then I\u2019ll when.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, well, since the girl was taller than you, you could borrow you 3ft high heels I purchased from Skymart.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you go with the dumb ideas again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr\u2026you could\u2026maybe try to outweigh her? You know since making you taller hurt a lot. Those shoes are pretty uncomfortable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam\u2019s face brightened, \u201cCat that-that\u2026actually makes sense. I only lost because I was disadvantaged. All I need to do is just, but on a few pounds and then I\u2019ll crush her like the lanky, dirty, ugly-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSam. Mind your temper.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight. Right.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what are you going to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCat, I know what I NEED to do, but I first I want you to\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
