After all: that is where all the smart people go, right?<br>\r\nYou manage to squeeze through the door and find yourself surrounded by towers filled with books. A seating area lies just beyond the row you stand in, and a few people are currently occupying the space. Among them, one girl in particular stands out to you. She has long, black hair and a large similarly-coloured bow on top. Her yellow eyes are intently focused on whatever she is reading as her slender hand occassionally moves to the bag of snacks she has set out to retrieve a bite of food. You recognise her as Blake Belladonna, another new student to Beacon who is part of team RWBY. You've heard those girls are pretty good, so talking to Blake should be really useful. But first you have to decide how to approach her.<br>\r\nAt your size, yelling to her isn't loud enough, and physical interaction will probably go unnoticed. You could either climb her legs, which will be easy enough with her black stockings, but might send off the wrong signal to her. Or you could climb onto the table where she has her snacks, and have her pick you up. But, she might not see you, and you've heard digestion is pretty painful.</span></div></div>",

You approach the wooden table and find that the old thing has plenty of splinters that you can use as handholds. The journey is long, but you get to the top without a hitch. Slightly winded from you climb, you struggle to remember your task. Blake's giant hand comes into view, and jogs your memory. You watch closely, as her fingers gently feel around the bag unti they come in contact with something edible. Blake's digits close around the snack and lift it up to her lightly-coloured lips. Her mouth opens and accepts the treat brought to it by the hands, as Blake pushes the snack further into her mouth. You see strings of saliva and her glistening tongue as she finishes taking the food into her mouth by making a sucking motion with her lips.

With cat like reflexes she tossed the empty packet of snacks into a bin as she passed it, not caring or thinking about what she just ate. Her tongue passed over her dry lips as she entered a corridor, a sign that would of daggered in more fear had you of seen it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe corridor was nearly empty, most students were outside or in there dorms save the occasional stay student. There was no que or hassle for the old water fountain, conveniently it was quite close to the library making Blake's lazy day even better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout much thought, the bow wearing girl put down her book bag before towering over the small fountain.

Right when you felt safe, water rushed down upon you, washing you into Blakes stomach acid ready to be broken down.

When she finished, she wiped her moist lips and grabbed her book bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe never even knew you existed, to her it was a normal, mundane day away from the action which she later forgot.</span></div></div>",

The heat radiated from within, making you back away. \"Ok, ok... it's just a little jump\" You muttered to yourself, balancing on the constantly shifting ground as you prepared to dive onto Blake's stocking. Holding your breath, you made a dive for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake's fingers explored the empty bag of snacks, making her eyes slip away from the book for a second. With a small sigh she quickly finished her page and put the book open on the table. Without much effort she stood up, kicking her seat back casually before walking over towards a water cooler. Her sensitive ears not able to pick up your cry as you plummeted into the hot interior of her boot.<br>\r\n\"It's pretty hot today, wonder where everyone else is\" The reserved girl mused as she began to fill her cup with water. With a small sip, she wandered back towards her desk, noticing a small squishy feeling under her foot that seemed to be getting weaker and weaker. With another few steps, the feeling had vanished but it had made the black haired girl a tiny bit curious.</span></div></div>",

Her ass is already slightly sweaty and she still has to sit through her classes of the day.\u201d You buzz to get to try and get her attention but, she doesn\u2019t get the memo and goes on with her plan to use you as her ass cushion. Things get much worse when she takes a step and begins the grinding motion of her ass constantly rubbing against you. Up and down up and down you go as your follow her butts\u2019 movement. You feel your head get dragged into her ass crack slightly and nearly gag from the smell her inner depths bring. \u201cI\u2019m glad there\u2019s underwear in the way\u201d you think. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n                 Already Blake is enjoying her new stay as her ass cushioning. She purrs a bit from the feeling of power she is feeling over you. \u201cWho knew this would feel so invigorating\u201d Blake says to herself. Her casual steps turn to a more confident stride and her hips gain some sway in them. This of course makes your new prison even worse. Looking around Blake realizes she is in front of her class door. Seeing that no one is around she says to you. \u201cLooks like I\u2019m here early. Now listen bug if you don\u2019t comfort be adequately, then I\u2019ll make your stay in my ass even worse.\u201d Her role play as a demanding  sadist is eerily good for someone usually so reserved. \u201cDo you understand?\u201d She threatens. Not feeling a buzz from you she gives her ass a slap. This gives you a jarring feelings and makes you slightly jiggle with her ass. \u201cI said do you understand!\u201d This time with more force in her voice. You buzz to stop her from punishing you. \u201cThat\u2019s better\u201d she mocks with a smug grin. Blake heads inside the class and slams her ass in to her seat and thusly you along with it. Inside Blake\u2019s mind she worries if she\u2019s taking things a bit far. \u201cThat was really mean and cruel. It\u2019s part of the role play though and I think he likes this maybe? It doesn\u2019t matter if he doesn\u2019t I\u2019ll let him go and help him later on\u201d her mind stops racing when she notices other students funneling into the class. Eventually her team comes in as well and class starts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n             Things are wild for you too. When slammed her ass down your body went a tad bit more into her cheeks. Your heart rate has risen as a new fear for you situation settles in. This cat Faunus is scary and is really treating you like nothing more than an ass cushion. You settle in your prison as her ass presses into you. \u201cThis pressure is something else\u201d you think to yourself. You faintly hear muffled sounds as you can assume that other students are coming in. Seeing this as a chance to get out you try to yell but it\u2019s useless as Blake feels it as nothing more than stronger buzzes in her ass. Even still she gets worried and adjusts herself to slam her ass and again you into her seat again. Making it look like nothing more than her adjusting herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n           \u201cIs he trying to expose us\u201d Blake thinks to herself. \u201cHe chose this, I wanna even told him he might regret it. Just wait it out and let me have my fun.\u201d Blake starts sweating more both because of this situation and the hot day. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n        Down below you get the memo from Blake\u2019s ass smash jiggles you again and causes uncomfortable vibration across her ass and subsequently you. Being plastered to her rear is going to be one hell of a ride as the increased sweat is beginning to worsen. You decide to suffer through for now unless things get worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          Feeling nothing but Blake\u2019s warm ass you realize that her sweat is beginning to soak into sort of. It seems your body naturally works as a sort of absorbent for it. Blake notices this through out her class and begins to think about complimenting you later on for it. This temporary appeasement is cut short as you buzz again. This time it\u2019s because of how uncomfortable it is for you to soak up her ass sweat and heat. She gets irritated with you and adjusts once again, grunting slightly and grinding you into her ass. Sitting in the back no one seems to notice. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n         You notice as the friction of her grinding sends pain throughout you. You stop buzzing and let it happen. Blake continues with the grinding and eventually stops with a small slam into her seat. Satisfied Blake goes back to paying attention in class. <br>\r\n     At the end of class how does Blake feel about you.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blake decides to stay in her seat as other students rush out of the classroom. Blake's team ask her if she wants to hang out in their room during their free period. \"No, I'm gonna have some alone time.\" Blake responds. \"But you always have alone time.\" says Ruby. Weiss interrupts and tells Ruby, \"Let her be, she can do whatever she wants.\" \"Yeah and besides she can just make it up by coming with us to the city tonight. Right?\" Adds Yang, looking towards Blake. \"Sure\" says Blake with a light smile. Content with that answer the rest of team RWBY heads to their dorm room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around Blake see's that everyone has left the classroom. Heading off to an out of sight corner in the room, Blake begins to pull open the back of stockings. Inside, she see's your splattered form still in her ass. \"Hmm, you don't look so good\" she says with a mocking tone. \"My, has your role as my ass cushion really been so bad\" she adds. \"Oh, I wonder if I should take you out. I am about to head to the gym\" She asked aloud. Hearing this you try to make a sound and have her take you out. Feeling your buzz vibrate on her ass cheeks, she says with a giggle \"It seems you really want to get out. You <i>are</i> starting to get pulled into my crack like a wedgie. Hmmm,\" She fake ponders \"Too bad I wasn't asking you\" she says with a sadistic smirk \"I'm gonna keep you right there. In my ass, serving as my ass cushion.\" She adds. \"Now, the cushions on the workout machines are a little worn and I'm gonna focus on my legs today. So make you're gonna really have your work cut out for you.\" Done with her taunting she releases the back of stockings and they come crashing back into your prison with a loud smack. Your fate as this black haired, cat faunas butt cushion has been secured for a while longer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake starts her trek to the female gym locker rooms. \"I've really screwed up big time\" you think to yourself. Feeling Blake's already damp ass start its torturous sway you try to ready yourself. Blake's rhythmic sway jiggles you up and down along her ginormous ass cheeks. At least Blake seems to not be paying you any mind and is more so focused on getting to her destination instead of purposefully making your stay in her ass even worse. However, Blake was right earlier when she compared your descent into her ass crack to that of a wedgie. You feel yourself stick to her underwear as it rides in between her generous ass cheeks. It's not very much, but at your size the prospect terrifies you and brings you even further into the sweaty furnace that is inside her crack. This continues for about five minutes, until Blake reaches her destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening her gym locker Blake pulls out her workout attire. A black and white shirt along with black yoga pants and a pair of black athletic shoes. Blake clenches her ass and feels you're deep enough to not fall out of her ass. She then takes off her current clothes and puts on her workout attire; making sure to clench her ass so as to not let you fall out. A simple process for her, but such one for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel Blake's ass squeeze around you. Her damp panties and pale flesh pushing into you from all angles. You let out noise that Blake doesn't even acknowledge. \"Please, just let me out\" you try to say, but none of words can be understood by Blake. Not because of her hearing, Blake can hear you just fine with her faunas senses. No, it's because your body still hasn't reverted from your puddy like body. Blake steps into her tight yoga pants and then proceeds to pull them up over her fine legs. She has a small bit of trouble fitting them over her ample ass, but pulls them up without too much effort. Finally Blake stops clenching her ass cheeks; assured now that her tight pants are on. Suddenly the pressure around shifts from a more muscle based pressure to one that derived from doughy, plush ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinished with getting dressed, Blake talks to you again. \"Alright, I'm gonna go and start my workout. In all honesty you're probably not gonna make a difference in making my ass more comfortable, but I know you're pretty good at soaking up sweat.\" You feel a cold shiver and start to worry about what that entails. Blake grabs one of her ass cheeks and gives it a hard squeeze and starts rubbing it against her other one. This has the effect of rubbing you all around her large butt. \"Oh yeah, I noticed pretty much instantly. I told you I'd enjoy this, but you really wouldn't. I mean what kind of perv really thinks that being ass cushioning would be nice. So I'd say you're getting whats coming to you.\" Blake says with light mirth in her voice. You try to protest, but your attempt is met with Blake rearing up her hand and delivering a hard slap to her ass with the very hand that was squeezing it. Your prison jiggles heavily and causes you to finally slip fully into her ass crack. \"Don't do that unless asked\" Blake says with fury in her voice. \"You're practically apart of my ass right now and so I decide when you do that.\" Noticing your full descent into her ass crack Blake says with a sadistic giggle, \"See what you just did to yourself. Now I'm gonna go workout\" Blake begins her walk to her first exercise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore, Blake's ass cheeks would rub into you cause you to move up and down along with them. Now, Your puddy like body is constantly being molded and fills her ass crack. This has the effect of making the perfect absorber of sweat for both her panties and pale, damp butt flesh. Blake gets situated on the leg press and starts to pump her legs. The perfect exercise to workout her butt and thighs. Feeling both her butt fat and muscle push into you causes you to be stuck in your current puddy form. Blake does 20  sets of 10, necessary for her huntress level of strength. She pumps her legs upward on the machine. Her muscles working to their full capacity. this repeated motion causes you to get squeezed by torturous cheeks over and over. Blake's ass has produced loads of ass sweat that while your body accepts, your mind doesn't. You can't help you let out multiple groans that cause Blake to lose focus and get out of her \"workout zone\". Angry with you for making noise again, Blake thinks to herself with a blush on her face.\"I was gonna just stop with this, but he needs to face even further punishment for that. Even if no one else can possibly notice it, it's still kinda embarrassing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinished with her set, Blake takes note that her ass is surprisingly, pretty much free of the sweat and odor that would usually come with exercise. \"Man his body really works well as both a butt cushion and sweat absorber\". Blake lightly mutters to herself. \"I'm gonna run a bit and then that'll finish my workout.\" and with that she heads to a treadmill. Down below you swallow up all of Blake's heat and sweat. You try to make a move with your little battered body, but Blake doesn't have to even squeeze her ass cheeks as walking does the work for her. You're totally incapable of resitting this huntress, instead forced to submit to her ass and do whatever she wills you to do. Again Blake is right, you're pretty much apart of her ass at this point. Forced to do whatever her ass does. Getting on the treadmill she begins with a light pace that eventually works up to a full on sprint. Blake's ass cheeks grind into you with great speed. Her left cheek slams into you, drags you down and grinds you against her crack and right cheek. Then her right cheek moves and brings you back up to be brought back down again by her left. This cycle seems to go on forever with her sweating even more than the leg press. Wave after wave of sweat floods you and threatens to drown you. Unwillingly, you perform your task as ass sweat absorber for your mistress. Eventually Blake stops her run with both her and you panting out of breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a damn good slave\" she admits bent over with her hands on her knees.This position forces you right against her ass with only her panties in the way. \"You've impressed me, my ass is really only damp.\" This for some reason almost leaves you feeling a weird sense of pride. You start to question why you kind of feel proud, being a good ass cushion for this beautiful cat faunas, but are interrupted by Blake. \"Which is why-</span></div></div>",

When you tried to get up however, her foot moved as she walked over to the cooler, causing you to slide underneath her foot as she moved. But you managed to grab onto her toes before you slid too far, leaving only your legs trapped underneath them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she made it to the cooler, you could hear her talking about something, but couldn't understand it from inside her boot. While she wasn't moving, you decided to get a better grasp of your situation. Your legs were still underneath her foot, and moving them didn't seem to be an option right now. In addition, her feet seemed to be sweating a lot, as you could tell from the stench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it didn't bother you that much at all. In fact, you were kinda digging the smell as her foot sweat started leaking from her socks and onto your body. You were also enjoying the toe on dick action she was giving you unknowingly. Every time she flexed her toes your dick grew larger, and more pre started to form as well. It was enough to make you wish she never noticed you were in her boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came more movement. Her foot lifted up again, forcing you to hold into her toes tightly again as her foot came crashing down on top of your legs. But because she landed with her heel first followed by her toes, it didn't hurt nearly as bad as you thought it would. But the pain was still there nonetheless, and strangely enough, your dick was still rock hard even through the pain that was being inflicted on your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments of her walking, she soon came to a stop as you assumed she took a seat once again. Now she crossed her legs with the boot you were in, giving you enough room to move your legs out from underneath her toes. Unless you really were starting to enjoy your life inside her boot, then you could stay where you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr better yet, you could let go of her toes and just slide underneath her whole sweaty socked foot and become her personal insole for as long as she wouldn't notice you, or until she trampled you to death. Whichever happens first.</span></div></div>",

Eventually you couldn't take it anymore and began jerking off while rubbing your dick against her massive socked toes, until the time came when you finally shot your load all over the interior of her boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you could hear Blake saying something, followed by her taking her boot off as she inspected her foot for a moment, wondering why it felt so wet all of a sudden.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The overwhelming urge to become her new insole was too much to resist. You had decided that the unaware faunas could use a little more comfort in her life, even at the potential cost of your own well being. With that you wait for the perfect time slide under her massive socked sole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching her foot rise up about to take a step, you let your self slide down the boot's sole. You feel the shoe lowering and your sliding had stopped. Knowing what this meant, you looked up at her enormous sole to see it coming down on you. Your mind hiccups and is struck with a hint of fear of the unstoppable force that is her foot, and then her sole stomps your small frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were flattened almost entirely by the weight and pressure she gave off. You were spread eagle, face first, right-dead in the middle of her sole and could give no movements that would be significant in any way. Any pain that could of been felt had been smothered away by her footfall. You were ultimately squashed under her socked sole and couldn't feel anything more than excitement. After all, this was only her first step of what could be hundreds through the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer first step had settled, with all her weight and pressure focused on you, but only for it to be increased ten fold as she moves the weight from her other foot to the one you are under. If it were possible for you to flatten you out any more, you would have been paper thin. You were amazed that such a power was even possible. If she was a giant her simple walking cycle would flatten cities and towns, and all the people in them. She would never know because they would be so insignificant to her and casually walk her way through a country, not even aware to her own destruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Your fantasy of a giant Blake was interrupted by a sudden loss of the pressure, and you realized why. Her next step was starting and you were gonna be part of it all the way. As her other foot hit the ground, all the weight was transferred to her other foot as you gained a sense of controlled weightlessness. Just as soon you had re-adjusted, You felt her foot falling on you, she was putting her foot down on to the ground. Once again you felt the awesome power of her sole smash you into the inside of her boot. The same weight and pressure returned, but there was something different to this stomp, but you couldn't quite place your finger on it. Her walking continued, with you being crushed with every step she made, when you started to notice something odd. Whenever her foot landed on you, covering you in her heavy, socked sole, you felt an odd vibration. You pondered what it could be when you had a realization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was purring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were happy to see that your job of being an impromptu insole was not a failure. You were helping her feel more comfort in one of the most stressful times of her life. You were doing something that no one else could but you could help her feel, stress relief any time she takes a step, any time she runs, or even stomps in anger. You were here to comfort her whenever she felt was necessary. You were ecstatic to be helping her, even if she didn't know it. But you also realized that she was also helping you in this relationship. By her simply walking on you, you got to experience your inner most desires that no one else knew about. Her powerful steps brings you happiness and pleasure as you being her new cushion, brings her happiness and pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou even notice that the bottom of her foot feels like a heavy pillow compared to earlier. She was all tense before, but now after about ten minutes of walking, her foot felt soft and heavenly. As she steps on you, you notice that the way she walked changed, She had a bit of a kick to her step, and was putting more power into her walk. You were in pure bliss, and not quite sure how it could get better than this heaven. You were both having an awesome time with each other, even if she didn't know about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was full blown out purring and smiling like nothing could ruin her day, and you only hope that you could help it continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+++++++++++++<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake had no idea why she got so energized in the past few minutes. All she had done is walk for a little bit and she felt like she could take the world on. Earlier, her feet were aching from walking all day. She was getting cramps and was feeling a little grumpy, than she goes to the library and after leaving, her feeling of being tired went away with each step she took. She had this feeling in her boot that felt like a piece of gum had been placed in her there. She had just decided she would check on it later, noting of how it flattened out when she placed her foot on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was kinda nice actually. When she placed her full weight on it, it spread across her socked sole. Covering her arch next to the ball of her sole. It was like a small, squishy hug that was cheering her on. She continued to walk, expecting to get tired all over again. Her heavy steps utterly flattened and smoothed out the gum in her boot, squashing it between the boot's insole and her own sole. To her is was like stepping on clay with cinder blocks. To her surprise it was quite the opposite, she was being rejuvenated with every step. The aching in her feet dispersed and now she felt she was walking on a literal \"Cloud Nine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt so wonderful, her hips swaying as she walked with sublime. She wanted this feeling all the time, whatever was in her shoe was not coming out ever. She even wants another one for the other boot. It made her start purring in excitement at the thought of everyday could be like this. It was by far one of the best things to ever to happen to her. She was getting odd looks from people she walked by, but she didn't care. All she wanted was this feeling to last forever. She was full blown purring in pleasure, almost trilling in excitement in every step. She could only wonder is it could get better than this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThan she had an epiphany. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smile turned wicked. She was even partially scolding her self for not thinking of it sooner!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was she going to do?</span></div></div>",

Your eyes darted for a good vantage point, slowly fixating on the table that the girls kept returning to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gazed upwards as you saw the girls dipping crisps and such into some kind of creamy dip. You wet your lips, realizing food might be an issue for your new height. In the middle of their decorating, they had left a few miscellaneous bags of wall paper and paintings that would make the trip up fairly easy.

Just as you went to initiate the plan however, Ruby suddenly stomped ontop of the stool to return a book to a shelf she couldn't reach normally before hopping down, grabbing the pen and paper and sitting heavily down to write some more notes.

In your childhood, you had always relied on tables to be safe zones because people normally didn't step on or sit on them so you wouldn't be stomped on unaware. The problem, of course, was actually getting to the table. With your shrunken size, you were very fast, able to travel about as fast as you could if you were sized up. You had discovered as a child that being squished didn't necessarily hurt, it was just annoying sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had a confession to make. Using your size you had been a pervert to many people because they didn't know you were tiny. You were able to hide in the hot springs and watch naked ladies casually walk around. That was one of the reasons you had chose to contact RWBY. You had heard they were super attractive from the web, pictures of them already gone viral, posted by a person named <b>WAFFLELOVER</b>. You didn't know who that was, but you were thankful they posted those pictures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were hoping that when they find out about you they just accept you and let you live with them, like a pet. It was certainly much safer then just living in a house outside of vale, and if the Grimm had ever broken into Vale, the safest place would be next to a Hunter or Huntress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you reach the table (With a few close calls on the way) you started to climb the leg, noting another thing you had learned. Your strength had also been increased, just not to the same extreme as your speed. You were able to climb surfaces quickly but you couldn't push anyone back anytime soon. If you could do that, you'd make a great hunter, able to sneak behind Grimm and Criminals while killing them in an instant, before returning to the shadows. You, of course didn't want to do that as it was A, Dangerous and B, If you got caught you would probably be tortured by exploiting your small size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach the top of the table and stand near the middle of the desk, books and other things behind and beside you. You knew that the best choice would be to wait until the girls finished their decorating so you sat down and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: Successfully waited until the girls had finished and was found (They're generally nice, Weiss is probably gonna be keeping a close eye on you though)<br>\r\nB: Suddenly was squashed by a Textbook, leaving you to have to wait until class to be found<br>\r\nC: Had second thoughts, instead preferring to stay undercover so you could perv on the pretty girls. </span></div></div>",

You see her stop before you and a dread like one you\u2019ve never felt before sinks into your heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby doesn\u2019t see you and won\u2019t see you as she puts her legs around the stool, giving you a view right up her skirt. You see her leggings and panties and feel a guilty arousal. That is quickly snuffed however, as her ass makes contact with you and smushes you between her ass and the stool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   You see nothing but darkness and feel nothing but pressure as Ruby sits with her full weight on you. \u201cHow did it come to this?\u201d You garble to yourself. You take notice of the smell. It seems she\u2019s worked up quite the sweat today as her rear\u2019s smell permeates into your nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \u201cPlease notice me\u201d you pray to yourself. Those prays are heard by no one besides the rear above as you feel move in a grinding motion. You gets pushed over toward her crack and notice the wedgie she has. The grinding motion continues until you feel yourself drawn in her crack and get stuck between Ruby\u2019s ginormous cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll better. This stool is super uncomfortable\u201d Ruby thinks to herself. \u201cHey team I\u2019m gonna go grab a snack then I\u2019m going to go take a shower\u201d the rest of team RWBY each give their own notion of hearing her. Ruby gets up from the stool and walks out the dorm, you still firmly between her cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Feeling her get up you get excited as you think she either feels you or you\u2019ll at least be able to fall out. Both of those hopes are crushed, as are you, as she simply walks to her next location. The grinding of her cheeks gets several times worse as her merely walking can put so much trouble on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Your prison gets hotter the further she walks and the bad smell earlier becomes much worse because of her movement. You feel Ruby bend over and feel some of the pressure from her ass cheeks lessen. It seems you still can\u2019t fall out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby grabs the cookies from the school cafeteria and walks back to her dorm. She smirks to herself as she feels the tiny guy in her crack. \u201cBug probably doesn\u2019t even know I saw him.\u201d Her look becomes slightly more sadistic yet still holds the innocence that she is known for. \u201cPerhaps I\u2019ll let him join me in my shower and use \u201cunknowingly\u201d as my my bar of soap, or I could plant him the other girls.\u201d Ruby ponders to herself and clenches her butt to further torture the little guy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   You feel a squeeze and realize Ruby clenched her cheeks \u201cHey she might be feeling me\u201d you think to yourself  \u201cI just know this girl would help me out if she  found me\u201d you decide to wait and let her rest continue torturing you until she gets back to her dorm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby makes a decision \u201calright when I get back I\u2019ll\u2014</span></div></div>",

You reached the top of the bed and felt like you were gonna pass out. \"I was never good in gym class,\" you say, remembering the days you could barely do the morning routines before wanting to lay down for a breather.

After what seemed like hours you heard a loud yawn and the voice of Ruby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crud...I fell asleep. Ummm...maybe I can still make it to combat training!\" You heard her jump up and fall out of bed. With an \"Oww...\" she got up and ran off towards her shoes. You cursed under your breath as you saw her feet raising to cover your only means of escape. She pulled her boots on fast, and you had little time to react. You dived forward in an attempt to land under her heel so you wouldn't be crushed. Do you succeed?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You stumbled forward as the oblivious girl yanked her boot towards her foot. Without much time to think you push your back against the heel section of her boot, your hands desperately wrapping around some loose stitching to stop you from falling. With bated breath, you watched her toes carelessly ram into the worn insole before sliding down the length of the boot. Your eyes darted upwards as her heel came crashing down, it was obvious she was in a rush.<br>\r\n\"This isn't going to work...!\" You panic, tilting your head to the side as her soft heel brushes against your face, you wince at the up close smell and radiating heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waited for some form of crushing pain, as her foot settled. You could hear her panicking  while tying her laces before she set off. You gave a muffled gasp as her foot tilted,gravity and a small portion of weight from her shoe pushed you into her heel while she assumabley did her other laces. You blushed as the temperature increased, realizing you were effectively hugging her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis didn't last long though as she set off in a run. Your yell went unheard as you bounced and grinded against her heel, you thanked your past self for tying your hands down when you realized how easy it would of been to of slipped under the devastating footfalls without it. Ruby kept running without mercy, not paying you any mind as her heel toyed with you. The heat was really starting to build up, making you feel a bit light headed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe constant grinding wasn't too painful, but it was having an embarrassing effect. Blushing heavily as her foot continuously brushed against your privates. Soon, unwanted arousal flooded into you as she kept running.<br>\r\n\"Oh please don't find me...\" You whispered, embarrassment flooding your mind as your bulge was unintentionally toyed with until climax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby jogged into the training ground, apologizing profusely to everyone as she joined the briefing. She gave a confused glance down as she felt something warm and sticky slide down her heel.<br>\r\n\"Pay attention Ruby, your already late\" The instructor demanded, snapping the scythe wielders attention. Ruby blushed, passing it off as just sweat as she got ready for training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever had you felt so humiliated in your life. Strapped to your potential dream girls foot in a puddle of your own cum is not the kind of first impression you wanted to give her. You gazed up her nylon covered leg, hoping to see something that would get you out while she was standing still. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, she started moving, her motions became erratic and fast and her feet quickly produced sweat. It no longer felt like you were bouncing, it felt more like a light jab. Her soft nyloned feet soon felt hard and scratched you every so often. You tried to call out as the string you tied yourself to slid downward, forcing you to split your legs apart to stop them being demolished under her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer training went on for quite some time, leaving you weak, battered and soaked in her sweat and smell as she wandered over to the benches. You listened to the outside world, realizing this was only a quick break rather then the end of the session. You slowly slid down, the string slid from your grasp. There was no way you'd make it for the rest of the session, your body was already too battered to stand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby's foot slowly rose up, giving your body one final kick as it left. You lay still, unable to even move and now lying on her actual insole. You gazed up towards the light before Ruby's frowning face blocked it off. Your hope rose slightly as she reached her fingers down into the boot,<br>\r\n'Had she felt me?' you thought to yourself, too battered to really talk as her finger tips stroked over your body. You shuddered internally at her cold touch, your body was already used to the sauna like heat of the boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou worried for a bit as she passed over you a few times, but eventually she picked you up. Her grip was far from careful, almost flattening you out as she brought you out of the boot. Your heart skipped a beat as she lay you out in her palm overlooking her cute face.<br>\r\n\"I thought something was in my boot\" Ruby exclaimed, poking you roughly \"Didn't think it would be a... toy?\" Her face showed a bit of confusion as you tried to move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can recover relatively quickly over just about anything but her constant rough treatment was shattering all hope of movement. You shuddered as she started to smile,<br>\r\n\"Oh! This is one of Yangs toys...! Oh... ew... this is one of those toys\" Ruby stuck her tongue out, trying to looked overly grossed out. You shuddered as you watched her look around for her sister. You tried to move in her closing hand, not wanting to find out why she had that kind of reaction...</span></div></div>",

Her voice, calling for Yang, boomed over head, blissfully unaware of your struggles as she stormed over towards her sister. Your face twinged in disgust as you were flung from Ruby's nice scented hand to the sweat stained glove of a busty blonde. You gazed up at her huge rack and confused face in awe as she gazed down at you with pouty lips.<br>\r\n\"I didn't put a toy in your boot again\" Yang spoke, looking up to Ruby with puppy dog eyes, \"Maybe it fell in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind spun around as you realized you hadn't been recognized. You urged your body to move yet you could only manage a twitch, something that at least got Yangs attention. She gave you an investigatory poke before looking up at her sister once more, realizing she wasn't buying her story, \"I'm... sorry?\" Yang spoke, still unsure how one of her toys managed to escape her. With a sigh Ruby smiled,<br>\r\n\"It's fine, it's just... I know you too well\" she rolled her eyes in a playful manner as people around them started to pack up. Yang gave a dopey grin, wiping her forehead before sliding your screaming body into her soaking glove,<br>\r\n\"That should be safe and with as little perversion as possible\" Yang spoke happily, eyeing Ruby who gave mock approval. The blonde power house gave a quick glance around, unsure if she heard someone call out before following the rest of the crowd to their next lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to move again, more desperate then ever as you began to realize just how small you were. You probably didn't even form a visible lump on the palm of your captor. The heat, darkness and moisture battered down your will as the oblivious girl swung her hand casually back and forth, assuming you were one of her durable toys that had survived much worse then this. You felt as though you would melt into her skin as the heat kept increasing, your mind tumbled in confusion as you felt yourself finally start to black out. Something hit you hard as Yang went to grab something, finally knocking your durable body into unconsciousness as you flattened out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n============================================================================ ========================================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, you woke up. Your body was sore and bruised but had started to respond. The sound of a shower filled your ears as you slowly gathered your bearings. You rolled over, noticing Yangs discarded gloves beside you, still emanating a weird smell. The soft fabric that your assumed was the quilt of her bed filled your senses as you struggled to get up yet you suddenly realized that your legs were sewed to the ground. While you were worrying about your limits and what was going to happen the sound of the shower stopped. Panic rushed into your body as you confirmed that you were on Yangs bed but with worry you started to notice the 'floor' had a label attached to it. Unsure what to do in the situation you started to yank at the string that held you in place, right up until the door to the bathroom swung open lazily to reveal Yang with a towel rapped around her. You gasped, freezing in fear on the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang scuffed up her hair as she wandered out, keeping the door open with one foot as she expertly entered the room. She quickly scoped out the room for her room mates before sauntering over to her bed. She gave a smile as she noticed the tiny dot of a toy that was trapped in her underwear. Clearing her throat, she got in to the role,<br>\r\n\"Ah, so your awake? Trying to perv on my sisters feet and not mine?\" Yang boomed, unaware that she was talking to an actual person as she picked up her panties, prisoner and all. She grinned happily, giving the tiny naked toy a quick playful lick. She giggled cutely, not noticing your struggles as she tossed you onto the bed. With a happy sigh she slipped her bra onto her large breasts, smirking as she clipped it on. Her violet eyes locked onto your struggling form a few times, noticing a few movements but just assumed it was from her moving stuff around her bed. With a shrug she slipped a top on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n============================================================================ ========================================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched with embarrassment as Yang got dressed, her eyes kept perversely looking at you as you struggled.<br>\r\n\"She must know I'm not a toy right?\" You shuddered, she had so far treated you like an object but spoken to you like a human. Your mind reeled  as you saw her slipping socks on, realizing she's saving you till last. Panic replaced reason as you saw the tight shorts she planned to put on, your voice yelling out needlessly as she lent over to grab your prison.<br>\r\n\"Good luck little guy! I'll make sure to crush you lots!\" She gave a wink before blushing, \"How did this get in Ruby's boot any way? Wonder if Blake or Weiss would feel it\" she gave you a perverted look before unexpectedly sitting down, making you feel a weird sense of vertigo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour world stopped spinning as you hit the ground, your body slapping around the inside of the powerhouses underwear without mercy. As soon as you hit the ground you suddenly felt Yangs thin socked toes come down ontop of you, flexing and squeezing before dragging you into position,<br>\r\n\"Oh sorry! Didn't notice you!\" Yang joked to herself, checking the door once more, \"How do you like my thong?\" Her voice was quieter, but still audible. You screamed out as what she said registered, your thrashing did nothing to stop the assent towards her blushing smile.</span></div></div>",

Her red blushing face and clouded eyes not registering your thrashing as she started to pull down her shorts, sighing to herself, \"This is a pretty weird fetish- isn't it?\" She bit her lip, shrugging off her own words as she smiled back at you, \"Whatever- it's not like your real- if you were though... that would make for pretty interesting boyfriend material\" Her grin grew as she poked you, putting on a jokingly sexy voice as she spoke \"So, want to be my boyfriend?\" she blinked, snickering to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had begun blushing at this point, who would of guessed such a cute girl could be so weird? You felt slightly freaked out as she poked your chest, before realising this could be the last chance you had.

Her finger recoiled before her shimmering purple iris came into view.<br>\r\n\"HEY!\" You screamed, watching the shock register on the girls face as she slowly started to register your movements. You felt a sudden drop as she let go of you, letting you bounce on the floor, trapped to her underwear.<br>\r\n\"Oh my- god\" Yang gazed down, \"Your alive?!\" her voice cracked up slightly in the moment \"Y-you heard all that?\" her mind reeled as she gazed downwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallowed hard as the huge girl bent down, laughing awkwardly like she heard a bad joke- \"Oh- wow- I...\"</span></div></div>",

Especially with how comfortable you felt across her chest. You on the other hand, we're feeling miserable. It was bad enough having to hold up breasts as huge as Yang's, but the running she did and the heat of the day left you absorbing all of the moisture and sweat her girls produced.

You groaned, were you ever going to get your normal shape regained?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn almost no time at all, Yang held in her hands not a bra, but what appeared to be a tan washcloth.

Though the cold water she rinsed you under felt nice, admittedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe buxom blonde quickly got to work rubbing you over her sweaty body, your absorbent, gummy form easily absorbing Yang's body sweat for the day. She ran you over her arms and thighs, dabbed you across her face, and scrubbed you over her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn no time at all, Yang had ran you across almost her entire body. She beamed down at your washcloth form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and I are going to have so much fun together.\" She happily said. You weren't sure if what she had just put you through was fun, but you couldn't really object without a mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock suddenly came from the bathroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yang?\" Blake called, \"Can you hurry up? I really need a shower soon.\" She stated. This statement gave Yang an idea as she looked at the rack for washcloths in the shower, and down at you...</span></div></div>",

It might help me think of some other ways to use you.\" Yang grabbed your legs and tied them in a tight knot to her bed post, giving you a quick tug to see if you were secure. \"Alright little guy, here we go \" Yang gave you a quick wink before pulling your body across the room. The blonde powerhouse was still unsure of your capabilities, and only pulled you to the opposite bed post of her teammates bed. The feeling was torture as your whole lower body was stretched across the room, and Yang didn't seem to notice or truly care. \"I think you can do more, I'm going to go around the room and you just yell out when you can't take anymore alright.\" Yang couldn't see it, but the look on your face was one of fear. You wouldn't be able to bring yourself to yell while stretched out more, let alone loud enough for her to hear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang waisted no time and began pulling on your body once more. She started to weave you in and out between table legs, wrapping you around the top bunks, and finally tied your hands to the post where she started. You felt like you had been run over by a parade of steamrollers; your body was tightly strung around the entire room, and in the center was Yang admiring her work. \"I guess you really don't have a limit. The ladies must love you.\" Yang teased as she poked part of your body. \"I'll have to think of some fun ways to use you now that I know you don't have a limit. But for now, let's move on to the next game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was enjoying using you for her own ideas and little games. Yang seemed like she was nice, but who knows how she would treat you if she keeps toying with you like this. Yang untied your arms and legs, watching as your body quickly pulled itself back a decent length. Yang stared at you with a big grin on her face, and a look of mischief as your body took its time to get you back in shape. As you regained control of your body, you saw Yang had grabbed what looked like a gauntlet of some kind. The grin she gave made you worried about what's to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time for our next game little dude. I want to see how much of an impact you can take. Now, I have a pretty strong punch and  could easily break something. But, with a nonlethal round,\" Yang gave you a wink, \"I should be able to fire without breaking anything.\" Before you had a chance to say anything you were grabbed and stuffed into an open slot of Yang's gauntlet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark confined space filled you with fear. You haven't experienced anything like this before, thoughts went rushing through your head about the danger that could come from this. Suddenly, your cell began to move and you felt Yang get into position. \"Here we go!\" Yang's movements increased, and in a flash you felt yourself flying at lighting speed; only to be met with a instant moment of immense pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had made a loud thud against the wall, and were left splattered against it. From your pained state, you saw Yang standing still from her punch with a look of shock on her face. \"Oh my god....i killed him.\" Yang came over and gently peeled your splatter off the wall. She looked like she had just found out she lost her family. Yang set you down on a table and watched in fear, waiting to see if you would reform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body was beaten, it needed time to reform, and it looked like Yang was with you for the long run. You knew your body would reform, but Yang didn't. So what happens when you do reform?</span></div></div>",

Yang grew a wicked smile, planning something, \"Oh really? Then you should have no problem with my last Yang game of the night.\" The look on her face worried you, but you really didn't have a choice in this. You let out a sigh before looking up at Yang, \"Alright, bring it on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit!\" Yang beamed. She then grabbed you and placed you in her mouth. Her tongue covering you in saliva and moving you inside her mouth. She shoved you against her cheek and licked you up and down. \"You actually taste pretty good. This will make the next part even better.\" Yang said. You felt yourself resting on her teeth, looking up to see her massive molar looming over you. Her jaw came crashing down, and Yang started to chew you like a piece of gum. You crushed and molded to her teeth, tossed around by her tongue, as Yang sat on her bed enjoying your flavor <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You make really good gum, I bet it's fun for you too.\" Yang laughed as she pressed your crushed body to her lips. She gently blew air into your body, and you slowly pushed past her soft lips as a bubble. Yang's face lit up seeing you as a bubble, she keeping owing air into you and you could feel your body reaching its limits. With one final breath, your body popped and stuck to Yang's face. You were as surprised as Yang that your body popped, no one has ever tried using you as gum before. Yang's tongue quickly licked you back into her mouth, she then chewed you back into a little glob before spitting you out into her hand <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was awesome, you're a pretty lucky to have found me little guy.

You took a deep breath as you stared into the blonde billboard size, beautiful face, prepping to tell her about your condition. \" I was born like this, I come from a remote part of Vale where this sort of thing has happened before; but I'm the only one in my town like this now.

How?!\" The powerhouse asked. \" My body is just durable. I can flatten and stretch out to avoid fatal danger.\" You replied.

Man I feel bad for you.\" You were not amused, you felt a desire to curse out her name.....but you weren't sure why. \"I'm sorry, I just can't believe that happened to you.\" She gave you an apologetic look as she calmed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why are you at Beacon if you can't even fight off a girls boot?\" Yang asked. You weren't sure if you could put your full trust in her. Telling someone you cheated your way in here might get you expelled, or a one way ticket to being abused by every student. You thought it be best to get to know Yang before telling her the truth. \"I just wanted to be able to prove I'm strong, discover my semblance, and become a huntsmen.\" Yang stared in silent respect. The look on her face was the one of encouragement and friendliness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang began to blush, pushing out the words she wanted to tell you, \"I'm sorry you had to see all that stuff earlier... I'm not that bad, and you are kinda cute.\" You both blushed at this. \" But I think that's a great cause, and I would be willing to help you out.  I still think we should get a teachers advice on you, maybe we can make you normal size!\" You had never thought about that before. You dreamed about being a regular person as you were lifted down to the valley of Yang's cleavage. \"For tonight though, you get to sleep with me and the girls. That way you don't get lost or end up on some crazy misadventure.\" You were pushed deep enough between Yang's giant breasts where you wouldn't be able to slide out. Your legs flattened a bit to the deeper part of her cleavage. \"Sleep tight.....i just realized I never asked you your name.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" My full name is Chrysanthemum, but people usually call me Chrys.\" You replied, still wedged in Yang's cleavage. \"That's a real nice name Chrys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you lay comfortable as you prepared to finally get some sleep after a long day.

Your attempts had become so weak that Weiss no longer even thought about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay still on your back, peeking through Weiss's toes to the ceiling as she stood still ontop of you. Your body looking closer to gum then toy or sticker. Unable to bare teeth, you gently licked the foot with tears in your eyes, hoping to be felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother step. Again and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a long time before you were caught inbetween the moving toes, ground up between them as she walked. You choked on the sweat and smell as you were pressed and released by the flexing toes as the giant girl walked. It almost didn't seem real as the foot slowly retracted from the boot, taking you with it between her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang tried not to look worried as she saw Weiss take her boot off. Taking sneaky glances over to her friend as the guilt of using her friend like this settled in, Weiss and Yang were surprised to see what looked like gum.<br>\r\n\"Gross-\" Weiss winced, tugging the 'gum' from between her toes. She looked a little sick as the little thing stretched out, like it wanted to stay, before snapping upwards with a wet slap. The ice queen shuddered, hopping over to the bin before dumping you in. \"I should not of taken my shoes off back there-\" Weiss shuddered. sliding her shoe back on and heading to another section of the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang cautiously wandered over, glancing in at the object that Weiss had pulled from her foot. A surprised smile slowly settled over Yang's face as she noticed you reforming back to human form,<br>\r\n\"That- I mean- I'm totally leaving that in the spank bank-\" Yang mumbled, snatching you up again. </span></div></div>",

The hard rocks and never-ending steps smeared your body beyond recognition, turning you into a discoloration on the gradually dirtying boot. You couldn't even manage to twitch as the giant foot broke twigs and crossed hot cement without a care. You felt your lower half being picked up, a truly weird feeling if you had a moment where Weiss wasn't stomping on your skull. You almost managed to ignore it, before a slightly heavier weight crushed them. You yelped to yourself in pain as you felt whoever it was grind down upon you before following the same motions as Weiss- feeling noticeably less graceful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang stomped down on your lower half, blushing heavily. Not wanting to add more risk to someone finding out about her 'hobby' she opted to just step on the other half herself. Her imagination running wild with the idea of there being two tinies, or just one that was getting royally messed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiding her blush, she opted to just think about it later. Looking back every so often to make sure you were still in place as she did her best to blend in with dumb jokes. Her foot occasionally twisted upon its victim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the ten minute walk, you were reduced to less then a splatter. Weiss's graceful twists had demolished your upper half entirely, while Yangs playful but lazy stomps plastered you to the perverts sole. You were too weak to sigh in relief as concrete was replaced by wood and carpet. The giant weight that was on you finally lifted as the girls took off their shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before you could see the light of day, you internally groaned as you saw Yangs face looking back at you- your other half in hand.<br>\r\n\"Man- I can barely see you-\" Yang spoke to herself, slowly scraping you off the shoe \"Lucky us ey? They left us with the food while they setup some TV, do the dishes all that jazz-\" Her smile turned hazy as you began to peel off, \"I wonder... if you would work for vore...?

Heading straight for the canyon known as the buxom brawlers\u2019 crack. It was well known in Beacon that Yang had a dazzling derriere, extremely round and well-shaped from years of exercise it was still one of the larger backsides among Beacons students. At normal size the Yangs' behind was large, at yours it is a behemoth. Each cheek a heavenly body and her ass crack a seemingly endless divide. A mix of shock and the force of Yang, seemingly very excited at the prospect of having her \"toy\" in a much more intimate spot, quickly pulling up her panties kept you in place as you were dragged deep into the confines of her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang lets out a moan of pleasure as you slip between her giant globes of ass flesh, for a moment she thinks how amazing it would be to have an actual tiny person instead of her toy, but soon she is focused back on her pleasure. On the thrill and excitement of the feeling of complete control and domination, the thought of using someone so much smaller in such intimate yet humiliating way all for her own pleasure really getting her going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n============================================================================ ==<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor you the experience is much less pleasurable, you thought being trapped in a giant girls\u2019 ass would be bad, mainly due to how much it would hurt your pride, but this was MUCH worse than you imagined. As you enter each of your senses are immediately bombarded. Everything is much darker with only tiny amounts of light able to slip between the sides of the thong. The pressure is much more intense than you would have imagined, as even though the outer layer of her cheeks are soft and her skin is satiny smooth. Under the fat layer are rock hard muscles compressing you and the string of the thong. This means you are being compressed and smothered at the same time as the fatty flesh fills every crevice around you. It\u2019s also way hotter than you thought it would be. At least the smell wasn't too bad, perhaps a bit musty, but mainly it just smelled like the soap she used. So at least you knew she cleaned herself well. Unfortunately for you things were only going to be getting worse for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n============================================================================ ==<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang yanked on the sides of her tiny panties, pulling the sides over her wide hips and ensuring the string of her thong, and by extension you, were lodged as deep in as she could get you. She walked the few steps to the mirror and checked herself out, giving a cocky grin as she wiggled her hips and gave her ass a quick slap. The thought of tormenting you giving her all sorts of feelings and ideas. \"Super hot day out little guy!\" Yang chirped \"I'm sure you won't mind the heat or the sweat right? In fact, why don't you help me and be my little ass rag to absorb all of my booty sweat!\" she snickered as she slowly started putting on her tight shorts. Yang swore she could feel a pleasant vibration near her butt hole, butt chalked it up to her imagination and excitement. She was drawing out and exaggerating each movement to cause the maximum movement of her hips and glutes. As a wet spot started to form Yang battled with her priorities for the rest of the day, eventually disappointingly sighing and mumbling \"I've got stuff to do today\" she stopped pulling up her shorts, just under her large cheeks, causing them to hang over the waist band slightly, to  wiggle her hips back and forth once more to ensure you were pressed right up against her \u2018cave\u2019. Yang decided to tease you one last time as she finished pulling up her shorts and sealed you in. \u201cNo one but me knows you\u2019re in there, and absolutely no one is going to care to get you out.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Showers free lil' sis!\" Yang chirped, passing by a very tired looking Ruby, who may have muttered something resembling a 'Thanks'. With a pep in her step and a bit more of a sway in hips than normal Yang got ready for the rest of a busy day with her new 'traveller'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n============================================================================ ==<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou barely had any time to get situated in Yangs' behind before things started changing for the worst. you felt some movement before suddenly the strip of racy fabric behind you started rocketing forward, dragging you along to plunder the depths of the blondes\u2019 booty. As you moved in deeper you noticed the air becoming staler and the smell growing more musky and earthy as the scent of the soap she used starts to fade. It reached the peak just as you made contact with a wrinkled and greasy surface, even with the lack of light you knew exactly what it was you had just made contact with. Her hole seemed to twitch and contract slightly at the stimulation, before relaxing again, it was slightly harder than the squishy walls around you and seemed to radiate heat and a smell that can only be described as ass. You weren\u2019t sure if the moisture was due to her just having showered or\u2026 other another less pleasant source. Just as you thought your life had hit the ultimate low she started to walk, and you learned just how powerless you were compared to her rump. It was only a few steps, but from your perspective it was pure devastation. Each step raised one cheek and ground against the other, only to once again come down as the opposite cheek mirrored the others previous movements.  The pressure and heat increased as her glutes worked and the moving cheeks seemed to try to pull you apart and then chew you up, on top of that the sudden increased friction started to make you sweat, adding to the already swampy environment. Her short walk felt like a marathon to you, you couldn\u2019t imagine surviving an extended period down here, you had to get her attention to get you out of here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she stopped walking you could feel some vague movements and turning until she started wiggling her hips, it wasn\u2019t as bad as the walking, but the moments further smeared you into her crack as you were pretty sure at this point your face had be \u2018acquainted\u2019 with each square inch of her asshole and the ass flesh around it. Then she found another way to degrade you even further, the force of the slap shocked you enough to gasp, big mistake. You had your mouth wide open as you shot to one side getting a mouthful of her backdoor and butt cheek, you could faintly taste the soap, but a salty and\u2026 wrong was all you could think to describe it, taste confirmed one of you fears, she was already starting to get sweaty this deep in her crack..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt her voice more than heard it a strong and dominating, rumble making you feel even smaller and weaker, yet somehow still feminine and playful. You managed to make out how she was teasing you about how hot it was going to be today and how she planned to use you as nothing more than a sweat absorber for her ass. Surely, she was only being this cruel because she didn\u2019t know you were alive, even if she did get off by being cruel and abusive, if she knew you were an actual tiny human, she would be kind and helpful. Right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she bent over to get her shorts, the sides of your prison started to part faintly and the smallest amount of light started to seep in, this gave you the hope you needed as you started to struggle and try and make noise. Unfortunately, every time you opened your mouth to try and make a sound some ass meat would fill your mouth muffling you and leaving behind a foul taste. This seemed to be the wrong choice as suddenly her glutes started to smear you around her crack again and pulverise you into dust. As the friction and heat became too much to bear you made a startling discovery instead of being crushed like you would expect your body was starting to become soft and mailable. Flattening and folding over itself, you started getting afraid of what would happen if you didn\u2019t get out soon and receive help, would you become stuck like this? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was with this fear that the movement stopped, and you became hopeful that maybe she had noticed you. Only to hear; \u201cNo one but me knows you\u2019re in there, and absolutely no one is going to care to get you out.\u201d Suddenly all light disappeared, and the pressure became even worse as her TIGHT booty shorts managed to just barley crest over her hips and hugged every inch of the little bit of flesh it covered. You almost gave up after that, even more so when she started walking and smearing you into the dirtiest crevice of her body and speaking to others as if it was just another day. But you were determined not to spend the rest of the day as some girl\u2019s ass toy, even if she was extremely hot, you continued to thrash and move. Unfortunately, with each step she took you were you were further reduced to putty, and it became harder and harder to move, if she didn\u2019t release you soon, you may not be able to get her attention at all.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With a look of confusion she scrunched her toes, feeling an object press into her nylons.<br>\r\n\"Right!

With a worried look, she ignored the irregular insole and ran out of the door, flattening out the irregularity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to yell out as she passed you off as a torn insole, yet her merciless foot started to slam down onto you, quickly ironing your body down.

You gagged silently as she prepared for her long training session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't do anything as her foot used you as it's insole. Her sweaty toes pressed down on you as she trained, forcing your body to absorb everything her foot crammed into you. Each break she had would give her a chance to toy around with you. Hope filled you once when she slid off her boot and tried to look in. Not able to see you however, she assumed you were a fold in her insole and reached in to flatten it down. Your worry was quickly replaced by dread as her fingers pressed you down before slipping her foot back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the training session was a cruel and painful experience for your little body. Stretched, smeared, battered and used, you almost kissed her foot out of joy as she left the training grounds to take a shower. As her foot began to leave the boot you tried desperately to grab on, anywhere was better then under her stinking foot. Your attempts doubled as you realized this was only the beginning of the day and she only had one pair of nylons with her...</span></div></div>",

You felt your arm wrap around her foot and cried out in joy. As her foot began to rise from the boot, you could feel yourself being peeled off of the worn insole. Her foot fully came out of the boot, and you were greeted with fresh air for the first time in a long while. You took a huge breath and attempted to scan your surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could see nothing but white walls around, and inside the room were tons of similar sized girls. You gulped as you realized just how small you were to these people. You wondered how you would ever survive long enough to be found, let alone actually succeed in the academy. You blushed slightly as you noticed a lot of the girls were standing naked, but then you gasped as you realized why. You were in a shower room, holding on to a foot that was about to be washed! You noticed Ruby standing there watching as some of the other girls were taking showers. Thankfully, it seemed there wasn't enough open space for her to take one right this second. using the opportunity you leap to the top of her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully her foot was still, so you used that opportunity to attempt to climb her socks that had been causing you troubles for a while. The smell hit you, but you preserved anyway. As you reached the top of her sock, her hand reached down to take them off. You jumped over and managed to cling onto her hand. You were thrown for a loop when she proceeded to start taking her other clothes off. You struggled to stay onto her hand, but fell as she pulled her shirt over her head. Knowing you didn't want to land in her chest, you attempted to grab a strand of her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou successfully grabbed her hair and breathed a sigh of relief. However, your victory was short lived when you heard the water turn on. The water pelted her body, attempting to clean off all the dirt and grime that had accumulated from the morning's exercises. You gripped her hair with all your might, hoping to stay on and not fall to your possible death. Do you succeed? </span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, you felt movement and before long say a soap covered hand slam right into you and begin to rub you into the young girl's hair. You were completely blinded by the substance, but you knew letting go meant certain death, even with your enhanced endurance. Whether through sheer will, or dumb luck, you were safe. For the time being. As she let the shampoo settle in her hair and began to wash the rest of your body you began to think about your situation. Here you were, blinded by shampoo, stuck on the head of a girl you only knew the name of, and you were in no position to get her help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometimes you cursed your small body, but it was no time to feel sorry for yourself, as you had to hang on again! Water filled your vision as she cleaned the shampoo out of her hair, and almost you at the same time. From Ruby's perspective she had just finished her shower and began to dry herself off, feeling really good despite her partner's attitude with her earlier. As she dried off and began to put her clothes back on, she couldn't help but notice her boots seemed to feel normal again. \"Hey! my boot feels normal now. Guess I finally flattened out whatever was wrong with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile with you, you were still dazed from her ferocious drying of her hair. As you sat there, you began to formulate a plan. Since you were in her hair, if you fell down the side of her head you would be able to land in her ear, but as good as that was the plan had a counterpoint as well. If you missed her ear, even if you survived, you could very well end up alone in the shower room with no one there to help you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided the plan was for the best however, and proceeded towards the side of her head. It was difficult, as she kept moving her head as she walked, but you made it. As you slowly slided down her hair towards her ear, you unfortunately looked down. You panicked as you saw the floor so far below you and began to lose your grip. You cursed and rapidly began to try to readjust yourself but it was too late, you tumbled downward. As you began to fall, you saw her ear, and tried to aim yourself for it. Thankfully, Ruby had stopped to take a drink from a drinking fountain, so it was your perfect opportunity. However, as you were about to reach it...she began to pick up her head! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you make it in the ear in time? Or do you fall down towards the floor? </span></div></div>",

You could even become a spy with it-\" Ruby smirked, slowly moving her nyloned foot over you, the warmth from being cooped up in a boot radiated downwards as clenched her toes, \"I need to see how noticable you are when your stepped on barefoot though- or- nyloned.\" The giantess shrugged, slowly pressing down onto your helpless body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gagged as the musky smell of Ruby's foot filled your world, her previously booted feet gently crushed you down into the hard floor of the RWBY dorm room as she slowly applied more pressure. You barely heard her laughter and comments on relating you to playdoe. It didn't take long for the impatient red to press down with enough weight to flatten you to the ball of her foot.<br>\r\n\"Wow- I barely feel anything-!\" Ruby stated, hopping ontop of you briefly before raising her foot up. She smirked as you came up with it briefly, the sweat holding you to her foot for a second before releasing you. \"Hey- I think I can get you to stick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't even open your mouth to complain as the seemingly innocent girl rose her foot into the air once more, her cheerful smile was the last thing you saw before her foot slammed into you once more, smushing you into her soft sole once more. You whined quietly to yourself as she slowly twisted, ensuring you were well and truely flat. The pressure soon let up, a feeling a nausia briefly swept over you as your tiny body came up with her foot.<br>\r\n\"Awesome! Oh- who should we prank first?\" Her smile grew as she quickly ripped you off like a bandaid. \"Woo- how about Weiss? If I hide you in her underpants you could make a 'lump' after reforming- wait- how about you steal her underwear in gym class? Is that going to far? Oh- we could also spy on Blake- she shoulders waaay too much by herself, oh- Yang is super ticklish! Wait- we could put you in Nora's shoes then-\" You gulped as Ruby suddenly nodded her head- \"Ok! Lets-\"</span></div></div>",

You only managed to get her name, so you had no idea what this girl was actually like. from what you could tell, she was messy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her sleep she had managed to kick her covers into  an awequard hug. One of her arms and one of her legs dangled from the giant mattress, just out of reach. You could just barely see a perverted smile creep across her face as she slept. You hoped that wouldn't mean any trouble for you. Luckily her quilt was mostly on the floor, giving you easy access to the top of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cracked your fingers, ready for the climb up.

Not noticing the tiny figure climbing the sheets, she unconsciously righted herself in her bed, tucking the covers between her thighs while pulling the sheets into a tighter embrace.

Your mind reeled as you felt yourself slowly flatten out in the pressure and heat of the blondes thighs.<br>\r\n\"I need... to get out\" You wheezed, giving a desperate yank on the fabric in front of you. Panic clouded your vision as you scrambled to escape, not realizing that you were sealing your own fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to you, your  actions had slowly peeled the big breasted woman's shorts down. A musky wave of heat mixed with the smell of sex and sweat assaulted your entire body as you tumbled onto Yang's 'sweet spot'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour voice reached deaf ears as your saw Yang's hand subconsciously yank her shorts back up, pinning you down against her woman hood as she groggily woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang rolled over half awake, her eyes staring vacantly upwards at the bed above. She wiped away her drool lazily as her mind registered a tingling sensation in her pants. Her face flushed as she gazed over towards Blakes bed.<br>\r\nYang yawned \"I guess it wouldn't hurt\" Her voice was kept low as she glanced around the room. \"Psst! Anyone awake?\" Yang hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen no responce came, a perverted smile slipped over her face as she rolled onto her stomach. Her crotch twitched as she lay down on her stomach. Not realizing that she had just smoothed out a tiny person trying to get her attention she ignored the feeling as she dragged a box out from beneath her bed. \"I so missed this\" Yang purred, drawing out her favorite dildo. Her face flushing crimson as she checked around the room once more. \"I'll be quick... yup yup\" The blond assured herself, yanking her shorts down a reasonable degree, ready to pull them up again if anyone woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did the yellow power house know was that she had just plastered a tiny person across her opening. Not given the chance to scream you saw the dildo clumsily ram against you, attempting to stimulate its owner. You tried to reach out for something desperately before the slick toy dragged you up and down the wet landscape. Every part of your body hurt as the oblivious girl prepared herself for fun. You barely heard Yang excitedly hold her breath before you were roughly jammed into her. You screamed in horror as the walls flexed over you, crushing you flat against the dildo as Yang slowly increased her speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForgetting where she was, lost in a long lost feeling, Yang let out a quiet moan. She bit her bottom lip as she rhythmically pumped the toy in and out, unaware of the extra lube as she felt herself come to a climax. <br>\r\n\"T-too quick\" Yang whined, opening her mouth as she orgasmed. Her hot juices splashed over your body as she held the dildo in, her walls tightened as she came. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pressure increased as Yang's fluids flooded over you, covering your body with Yang's cum as she released her frustrations on your durable body. Her walls grasped you tighter then ever before eventually relaxing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt; br /&gt;\r\nYang smiled in the afterglow before finally taking you out. Her heavy breath fell over the dildo as she slowly went to lick it clean,<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" A voice piped up, making Yang jump in panic as she saw Weiss entering the room with a glass of water.<br>\r\n\"I... it's not whhat it llooks llike\" Yang cringed, still out of breath from her fresh ejaculation. She quickly yanked up her shorts before hiding her soaked toy behind her back.<br>\r\n\"I left the room for 10 minutes and this is what I come back to?\" Weiss shook her head, unsure what to do. The White haired girl turned to look at Blake and Ruby who had just woken up.<br>\r\n\"N...no!\" Yang spoke slowly, her cheeks turning red as Ruby popped her head in, looking minorly shocked. Realizing she needed another tactic, she decided to flip it around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, Yang gave a weak smile \"Everyone does it once in a while, it's... healthy\" She smiled up to Weiss who just looked disgusted. \"You know, we're all still young, and I heard alot of girls experimenting at this time\" Yangs words only made Weiss back away slightly, her face becoming flushed,<br>\r\n\"W- what are you trying to say Yang?\" Her voice shook as Yang drew out the dildo. Not a single person saw your body plastered to the hardened cum.<br>\r\n\"Nothing! It's just that I don't think this should be a big deal!\" Yang smiled, \"I'll even let you borrow it\" Yangs smile grew and grew as Weiss rolled her eyes. Feeling that she had embarrassed Weiss enough she went to put the toy away. \"Just jokei--\" Yang started, before Blake leaned forward in her bed.<br>\r\n\"Ok\" Blake spoke, drawing everyone's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could barely hear anything through Yangs excitement. It looked like Yang was trying to make it into a joke You tried to get someones attention as you thought you might be getting put away, but then, why are you getting handed to Blake? Were they not all embarrassed?. Your mind recoiled as you managed to see everyone's curious faces. The disgust on Weiss's face was replaced by a blush, Yang looked puffed out and unsure while Ruby showed an embarrassed curiosity. Your tired efforts were renewed as your view finally came to the blushing face of Blake who seemed to be getting nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake swallowed hard as she looked around the room<br>\r\n\"I'm just curious\" Blake murmured, her blush lit up her reserved face.<br>\r\n\"Surely we aren't going to... to...\" Weiss stuttered, unsure if she should leave,<br>\r\n\"A-are we all going to be doing this?\" Ruby finally blurted, her head poking out of the safety of the custom curtain around her bed \"N-nothing leaves the room, right?\" Ruby's voice broke slightly as Yang started to smile,<br>\r\n\"I guess there's no harm in experimenting\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh how wrong she is.</span></div></div>",

The two girls didn't even register Ruby and Weiss stepping out of the room to wait in the bathroom as they locked tongues.<br>\r\n\"W..wait\" Blake pushed away, her face was flustered, \"I'm not into girls, I..I'm just curious\" Her bow twitched as the dildo rolled under her sweaty feet.

You tried to wiggle away as you were slowly inserted by the teams powerhouse as Blakes body fought against the foreign intruder. Her walls squeezed hard against you as the smell and heat increased. Just as you thought you would pass out from the pressure, you were dragged forcefully out for a breath of stale air before being plunged clumsily into the tight confines of the cat girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MFF! %^\"!\" You tried to yell as Yangs cum was slowly replaced by Blakes. Her walls were erratic and the smell of sex was much stronger than Yangs. You didn't have much time to compare though as the pumping became faster with Yangs growing confidence. You drowned Blakes happy moaning with your struggles as more and more of Blakes liquid lured you deeper. You eventually gave up, begging it to be quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings didn't go your way though as Yang teased the poor girl, edging her slowly to orgasm much to your dismay. You gargled Blakes foul sex as she was lulled to ecstacy before Yang slowed down, teasing the orgasm back. It felt like eternity before you were released. It didn't come easy though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweat dripped down from Blakes forehead as she slowly reached ecstasy, she rolled her head onto her pillow as she let Yang pound her. Orgasm slowly approached as she curled her toes. She couldn't even hear Yang as she contracted her muscles, embarrassment came with orgasm as she flooded over her friends toy, adding another coat to your prison as Yang used your body to interrupt the flow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Wow, you had a lot built up\" Yang spoke slowly, yanking you out before watching her flustered friend hurriedly yank up her pants without cleaning up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls slowly eased up as Ruby slowly edged into the room, relieved to see everyone was dressed.<br>\r\n\"How was it?\" Ruby asked as Weiss slowly wandered out of the bathroom, her stance more composed then before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt abused, smeared onto a sex toy at a very unfortunate time. Your flattened form locked with Blakes dazed eyes as she examined the toy, you begged that she would see you before you were put away for Yangs eternal pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither would happen though as your view spun around to the blushing face of the red team member. Her eye's kept shifting over your area on the toy, unable to pick you up from the cum of the earlier 'experiment'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing you should of listened to the conversation, your body was slammed into the hands of the hyperactive leader.

I said I would do it in the bathroom didn't I?\" Weiss stormed, her face looked flushed as she watched Ruby dangle the toy infront of her. \"After all, experimentation is normal... at this age and... do we have to use a toy that's THAT used?\" Her finger wagged at the soaked dildo in Ruby's hand in disgust before taking it from her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly twirled it in her hands with a look of disgust and curiosity. Her mind still not entirely sure about the idea even after a discussion with Ruby, <br>\r\n\"This... doesn't leave the room...\" Weiss murmured, awkwardly examining the abused toy.</span></div></div>",

Your prison slowly rolled from the playful shifting of Ruby to the graceful stance of Weiss. Unsure what was happening, but noticing that you got your arm free, you desperately tried to rip yourself free. You managed to get some gunk off of you before noticing Weiss stepping out of a pair of light yellow panties with a frilly pink bow. You blushed, almost forgetting your position as you looked up her bare leg to the darkness beneath her short blue night gown. You watched her walk towards her bed before suddenly realising they were going to go through with it. You tried to move quickly but realised it was too late, your sky was replaced by Ruby's hand before her finger tip re-plastered you once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to scream as Ruby's fingers were replaced by the dust users serious pout, her legs not fully opening to the idea of being used by Ruby but her blushing face allowing it. <br>\r\n\"Ok so, you first then me? Or do we switch inbetween...? I'm not sure how this works\" Ruby boomed over head. You let out a silent sob, wishing for it to just be over already.<br>\r\n\"I've never done this before either! J-Just do it\" Weiss snapped, having the same mindset as you. Her legs slowly spread apart as you felt Ruby clumsily getting into position, crushing you against the floor for good measure before lining you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallowed hard, looking at Weiss's tight hole. Unlike the others, Weiss had lost most of the eroticism of the situation from the embarrassment. Her entrance was closed and dry, harshly enforcing the act of lube upon you. Obliviously Ruby edged you closer, she gave a nervous yet playful smile up to Weiss as she spoke, <br>\r\n\"I'm going in ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed the giant wall ahead clench, you felt a feeling of dread as you realized there was going to be foreplay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n============================================================================ ===========================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss leaned back, watching the cum dried dildo flutter between her friends hands. She frowned as the thought of cleaning it popped into her head, she strangely felt like it was too late to suggest it though. Her sky blue eyes shakily watched Ruby get uncomfortably close, her lips twitching as Ruby's invasive hand accidentally bumped into her inner thigh. Weiss felt confusion and disbelief well up within her as she felt her own team leader roughly jam the toy against her closed lips, not managing to penetrate the closed passage. The white haired girl bit her lip as Ruby tried to loosen her up, grinding pushing and jamming, oblivious to her toys plight. She felt her heart skip a beat as she looked down at Ruby as she fumbled around, her toes curled up with this new confusing emotion, her blush expanding exponentially as the dildo started to gain ground from the wetting walls. Weiss found her hand coming up to Ruby's head, eliciting a cute yelp that caused her to jump, tightening her self brutally around the toy before forcing herself to calm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby bit her tongue after her yelp, she was embarrassed to be enjoying herself a bit more then she expected. She blushed as she twisted the toy against her close friend, hoping to loosen the hole a bit with your battered body, flicking the slowly swelling clit with her finger. Not remembering seeing any lube around she remembered how dirty the toy was in the first place, deciding Weiss wasn't too fussy in this situation she dragged the toy away from the harsh terrain between Weiss's nervous legs, bringing you up to her lips while building up saliva. Without being able to move or yell Ruby didn't notice you once again as she slowly drooled over the used toy, slathering you from head to toe in thick spit. <br>\r\nWith the new lube applied she mercilessly jammed you back into Weiss, slowly making progress before the tight walls suddenly contracted again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling Ruby continued to batter your body, unaware that she had crushed you flat with her playful twisting. She brushed a hair out of the way as Weiss finally loosened up enough. Without warning she started to pump, finding it much easier to navigate the now wet cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n============================================================================ ===========================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in a living hell, Weiss's nervous contractions mixed with Ruby's carelessness brought you into a new world of pain. As the friction eased up on you Ruby sped up, twisting your world constantly. You mentally screamed as Weiss's slick tight walls gripped you, her voice vibrating through them as she spoke. You couldn't make out any words, it was probably noises out of shock at the over hyper girls rapid pumps. You felt your world shatter as Ruby carelessly slipped, scrapping you off inside of Weiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggled, floundering around in the well of Weiss's juice, barely hearing Ruby apologize before the dildo clumsily returned. You cried out in anguish as you were pumped deep within your new prison. Your mind going crazy in Weiss's mess as you desperately tried to reform within the thick pulsating liquid around you. As bad as being trapped on a dildo that everyone is using you realize that it's a lot better then being trapped inside the up tight girl for the rest of your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarely managing to reform in the constantly moving prison you slowly began to realize how impossible getting out on your own would be. Every step you took would send you tumbling down, her folds fully pinned you until a lucky spasm, lost in her new found orgasm you could do nothing about your new found position. The rapid pumping got closer and harder as Weiss closed in on her orgasm, unable to take Ruby's brutal assault much longer. You gave a cry as you were churned up, slamming hard into the toy as the air headed leader continued unaware. You flattened onto Weiss's brutal clenching walls before being scraped off by Ruby in a seemingly endless loop. You gargled a yell as the orgasm shook over you, drowning out your new existence in her own selfish pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n============================================================================ ===========================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss came hard, she had never tried to go that deep on her own before. Her beet red face gazed hazilly down at Ruby with confused feelings as she let Ruby ride her orgasm out. Sweat dribbled down from both girls faces as Ruby realised what had happened. While she was dragging the toy out, Weiss gave one last loving squeeze to the soaked cum toy before realising it into the open air. Weiss gave a happy sigh, unsure as to what she should feel in this situation as she slowly recovered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes widened as Ruby nervously sat down next to her, looking rigid. Weiss gulped silently as she realized it was her turn. She slowly reached out with her toes, pinching her panties close to her before quickly sealing her flooded pussy within it's fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n============================================================================ ===========================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't find the energy to reform after getting the most brutal battering of your life. You looked blankly upwards in fear as....</span></div></div>",

Weiss felt her own heart flutter, a weird feeling that she never thought she would have for another girl as she swirled your body around the tip of the sex toy absentmindedly. \"Alright then-\" She muttered, edging closer to red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo weak to yell, you watched the white haired girl lick Ruby's lower lips, her tongue flicking up and down the surprised folds as Ruby gasped,<br>\r\n\"W-Weiss? What are y-you doing?\" Ruby quivered, her toes curling at the older girls tongue play. Her muscles contracted as she felt a tongue enter into her, without thinking, she gripped the back of Weiss's head, the mixture of feelings confusing her as she felt the toy drag along her inner thigh. She bit her lip as your body replaced Weiss's tongue, the saliva and your body working as lube for the girls fun.<br>\r\n\"-I-can't-\" You try to speak up, but your body doesn't let you say or do anything as you slip into the tight tunnel of Ruby's vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep inside, you essentially liquefied in the compact area, at the mercy of the swordswoman wielding the toy. The friction increased with the heat as your body mixed with another girls juices. You couldn't even yell out as the toy ram rodded you up against the walls, your body sloshing around without control. You almost celebrated the toy leaving, even when you knew you would most likely stay stuck inside the hyperactive girl. That was, until a slimy member wrapped around you, tasting your body before flicking out. Before you could register what happened, you felt it happen again, this time it swirled you round, dragging you towards the outside world where you could see Weiss's panting maw. You gulped as you watched her lips peck around your prison before going in once more to finish the job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby buckled, her body selfishly arching to try and get more of Weiss in her. Weiss felt red hot as she opened her mouth, sucking up all the juices out of pure thrill of the moment. Her taste-buds disagreed with her minds thinking but the forced the load down her neck either way.<br>\r\n\"-W-Weiss\" Ruby shivered, her jaw lay open in shock as she road the after effects of her orgasm. Shocked at her own actions, Weiss wiped her lips, sliding the dildo out from under Ruby as she felt embarrisment flush through her body.<br>\r\n\"L-lets never talk about this again\" Weiss blushed, glancing at the now sleeping Ruby as her heart beat faster again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awoke to a pulsating cavern- your mind fuzzy as you sloshed around-</span></div></div>",

But as time passed you came to a horrifying realization. It wasn't coming back! The experiment was over and you were essentially trapped. This was the worst possible scenario you could've been in. Who knew when Weiss would decide to indulge again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to find some way to escape! You couldn't stay here. You'd die in here! But there was nothing you could do until your body reformed, if it reformed. Honestly you've never been hurt this badly before.

You had been forced to lay in god knows what for days, unable to do anything but listen and stare at the light changes and shifts in Yangs matruss. Knowing you couldn't make a sound and that it was pitch black you simply whimpered as the hand dragged you under the covers, not even giving you a chance to see the girls face one last time before she lined you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard a shakey sigh somewhere in the darkness of the covers as you felt your self touch something hot and slimey. Knowing you couldn't make a noise, you simply couldn't help but try as you were slowly dragged up and down the length of Yangs womanhood. The collosal girl slowly curled into a ball, facing the wall as she tried to hide her actions, prolonging your torment as she simply tried to get off. Your human like sticker form was soon wiped off onto the slick surface without mercy, making you a flesh colored stain on the edge of her entrance. The smell was overpowering, but the fear of the looming object really set in the fear factor as it slowly came down towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang gasped, holding her breath as she slowly ramrodded your body into her, her eyes drifted shut as she let her imagination do the work, her hand slowly and quietly pumping you in and out as she thought perverted thoughts. Each 'shlick' or bedspring made her pause, drawing out her orgasm even further as she tried to sneakily work herself up.<br>\r\n\"Come... on...\" She muttered, grinding down your body faster with twisting motions as she got wetter and wetter. She caught her breath once more as her release finally came, her hand held it in to avoid staining the bed as she happily orgazmed over your decimated form. She didn't notice anything different as she lay back in bed, slick with sweat. Her eyes slowly gazed at the clock with surprise.<br>\r\n\"Wow- that was way longer then I expected...\" Yang slowly murmered, pulling up her tight shorts while keeping her favorite toy trapped inside. She slowly hopped up, waddling over to the bathroom with a hint of shame. \"I'll just start doing it in the bathroom...\" She muttered to herself, stepping in and locking the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe soon yanked the toy out over the toilet, a small sigh of relief flooded her lips as she dripped into the toilet, her hand reaching for toilet paper to clean up her mess- your poor looking forn went unnoticed as Yang cleaned herself.

Before you could be thankful for your narrow escape, your tiny body crashed into the warm toilet seat, still wet from Blakes fun. <br>\r\n\"N-no!\" You cried out, skidding towards the edge. Without so much as a glance back, you saw the cat girl washing her hands as you slid over the edge, splashing down in to the toilet.Your slide eventually stopped as the thick excrement hardened, plastering you to the edge of the bowl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot knowing when you passed out, you awoke to the sound of movement. Unaware of your predicament, the girls who owned this bathroom were preparing for their day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang smirked to her sleepy younger sister as she nimbly blundered past her, a doofy smile spread on her face,<br>\r\n\"Dibs!\" The powerhouse laughed, her feel slapping on the tiled floor as she closed the door to the bathroom. <br>\r\n\"No fair!\" Ruby yelled behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScreaming didn't seem to effect the titaness in-front of you as she lathered up her toothbrush, your body aching from holding the same position all night. Horror seeped into your very core as the blonde girl vanished from view, only to be replaced by her huge ass cheeks slamming harshly on the seat above. You struggled harder then ever before, your lungs struggling to keep up with your yelling as you gazed up through the daunting figures legs, her boobs blocking out her face as she scrubbed her teeth. With little warning, a stream of hot piss quickly obliterated your prison, smearing you to the wall like a stain as the oblivious girl hummed a tune while brushing her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang bit down on her toothbrush without remorse as she pushed her load out, Her fire hydrant like stream slowed down it's onslaught as she leaned back on her throne, not paying much attention to the splashes occurring underneath her as she accidentally coated the tiny person below her. Wanting to hurry up for her team-mates to use the bathroom, she pushed down harshly, unleashing her fowl wrath on the world below. Yang managed to glance down into the bowl as the awful stream stopped, silently impressed with her achievement as she spat her mouthful of frothy toothpaste into the abyss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay in shock under a mountain of urine and excretion, your body flattened and stretched across the bowl from the sheer weight of Yangs waste. You couldn't even yell out as your unaware captor continued to spit mouthfuls of mouthwash produncts down onto you, something that you were minorly thankful for as it cleared up a part of your smeared face. The giant girl eventually stopped, dropping down some tissue paper before reaching for the handle, you made the mistake of opening your mouth to cry out in panic as tons of water smashed into you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang gave her self and the flushing toilet a quick spray of deoderant, before leaving the bathroom.<br>\r\n\"All yours little sister-!\" Yang smiled to her pouting sibling as the pajama clad girl skipped past her-<br>\r\n\"Thanks-\" Ruby winced, grateful for the spray of deoderant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay in stunned silence as the horrendous load was washed from your body. The torrent of water smashed you into your prison walls, smearing you around a the entrance of the drain, A few lucky body parts had made it out of the water in the bowl, thankfully your head was one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearful of what was to come, you struggled to reform without any luck as you listened to the shower run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 10 minutes of struggling, you realised you needed help or a lot of time to get off after your traumatic ordeal with Yang. A silent beg for mercy came from your battered body as you listened to the girl get dressed and watched her brush her teeth. Her name eventually popped into your head as you struggled to make contact-<br>\r\n\"Ru-by, don't use-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby, now fully dressed, checked the time. Her smile widened slightly as she realised she was running early for once. Without thought for the tiny man in the toilet, she casually slipped on her headphones, took down her nylons and underwear and sat down on the toilet seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swore under your breath as you watched the girl scroll through her songs from between her legs, Your tiny body unable to attract her attention as a light yellow stream trickled down into the water you were under. You couldn't even scream as the girl bobbed her head to a tune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby lay her device on the side before pre-emptively grabbing some toilet paper. She didn't even hear the first spash as she clenched up to the cold splash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in hell as log after log piled down ontop of you from the oblivious music lover above. The tiny rosebud above you flexed as it slowly unloaded down upon you, filling the entire bowl with her last meal before unleashing another steam of piss to wash it down with. Unable to comprehend your new existance, you silently whined at the horrors of being a toilet bowl as both Yang's and Ruby's bathroom trip seeped into your very being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't even notice the short girl get up as a few pieces of toilet paper fell into the toilet. Another load of water washed over you gracefully as the girl flushed, her sprightly form pausing her music before pulling up her panties, nylons and skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt numb as Ruby washed her hands and left, only to be replaced with Weiss who was waiting for the bathroom. Thankfully she just had a shower and brushed her teeth. You imagined your fingers crossing as she left, letting Blake use the bathroom, her wide hips  bumped past the toilet as she went to the sink to brush her teeth. She glanced down at you briefly before hoping into the shower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were only given a few minutes to recover before the fast girl hopped out of the shower, slowly sauntering into your view with neutral eyes. Droplets from the shower splashed down on you before she turned around to sit down. Your dirty mind slowly remembered your situation as you tried to ignore the naked girl before you, Her giant, wet, ass crashed into the toilet seat with a squeak, making you finally come to your senses and yell-<br>\r\n\"Wait- B\"<br>\r\n\"Blake-! We're leaving without you!\" Weiss's voice drilled through the door, overriding your own cry as the cat like titaness hopped up off the toilet, her stomach grumbled in protest as she thankfully held it in, prioritizing getting dressed and rushing after her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay like a skid mark in the toilet, watching the natural light increase as the day went. The house was quiet, giving you time to reform- thankful to Weiss for preventing another awful incident.</span></div></div>",

Toilet stuff&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven a day of struggling you slowly began to lose hope, the boring white porcelain wouldn't let you up from it's shallow water. Eventually- you just switched off, hoping that you would be flushed in vein hope of reforming somewhere else or being found in the water treatment plant. A sliver of dread crept in as you heard the girls enter the house after a long day, muffled bangs and chatter kept you occupied for a few hours as you waited for someone to use the toilet with a tiny amount of hope. Your mouth had thankfully reformed so you hoped among hope that someone would come in without the background sounds of music or teeth-brushing. The door suddenly slammed shut and the light flicked on as the dull clack of heels hit the tiled floor. Your hope sky rocketed as you saw the icy blue eyes of Weiss enter your view, her face one of disgust as she looked down on you.<br>\r\n\"HEY!\" you called out as loud as your battered mouth could, but the giantess didn't react. Your hope ebbed slightly as you mustered up another yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss looked down at the stain on the toilet with disgust, her ears barely picking up your voice but she couldn't make out the origin or words. Her mind automatically ignoring it as background noise.<br>\r\n\"Gross-\" Weiss winced, not noticing your panic as she flushed the toilet, giving you a stern look as she attempted to wash you away without much luck. The cold current swiftly smoothed over your mouth, forcing it to stay open, your position shifted with the water but your stubborn body refused to go down. You shuddered as the taste of toilet water touched your tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss attempted to flush you a few times without success, eventually giving up on removing you so easily. Grabbing a few pieces of toilet paper, she gracefully wiped the toilet seat with care before dumping the paper into the water beside you. Her frilly underwear soon slid down to her boots before presenting you with her dainty rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou silently moped as the ice queen sat down, her face just barely viable as she looked down upon you., her glare not directly meeting yours as she started to hose you down with urine, the salty substance slipping down into the water below after rolling down your tongue. You teared up slightly from the force and taste as the dominating girl tried to hose you off. Your unlucky positioning felt like a curse had been placed upon you as she continued to urinate into the toilet, turning the water yellow with her strong stream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour vision of her face was soon blocked as the stream increased in pressure. You could just barely make out her folding toilet paper in her lap as she prepared for the end. Gurgling down, you felt yourself slowly coming free from the strong current bearing down on you. After what felt like an eternity, the stream eased up, splashing into the water rather then directly onto you. You watched it for a few seconds as it trickled into nothing before a foul smelling sheet of wet toilet paper landed on you, swiftly followed be another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl above stood up after padding herself down, her panties and skirt quickly found their place before reaching for the flush, not realising what she had just done to a person. The tiny stain felt a small amount of releaf as Wiess forced the toilet to swallow before washing her hands. Unaware of the tiny person judging her drinking habits with bias as she sipped the water from the tap before leaving. The light flicked off, leaving you to wallow in your prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had thankfully shrunk a bit back to your original form, your were still stained and splattered but the water and -hosing- down seemed to of loosened you enough to not cover the entire toilet bowl. Feeling like this was your only chance, you panicked everytime someone came in to prepare for bed, Thankfully, everyone avoided the toilet, using the shower out of vision and brushing their teeth beside you before turning off the light for the night. You had a fearful moment as Blake hovered around for too long before jumping her shower and leaving in her dress like PJ's. After a little while, you felt the fatigue taking over you, you tried desperately to stay awake but your adrenaline was low, and a dark white bowl didn't give you much to keep yourself up. Eventually, you dozed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awoke at midnight to the sound of movement, the light soon turned on and the door gently closed shut as someone padded into the bathroom. Still half asleep, you aimlessly tried getting up, before remembering your situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake sat down on the toilet seat heavily, her eyes hazily gazing forward as she idly listened to your small yells before squeezing out her first log. Her eyes slowly shut as she relaxed her bowels, unleashing hell upon your small form as she dazilly mixed in your previous cries to the dream she had just been having. Unaware of the real life micro she was currently crushing with her waste as she continued destroying the toilet bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo you, this was by far the worst of all the girls previous, unable to reform enough to pull your tongue in from Weiss's assault, you were thrown into turmoil as the fowl taste flooded your system. The weight of the waste above you continued to increase as Blake semi snoozed above you- the fowl smell slowly flooding the bathroom above as she burried the water in the bowl. Even though you knew it was pointless, you couldn't take this torment, you tried to move again, kicking out with all your might before the sounds of bowel movement erupted out, The weight increased unbearably high, smashing your tiny form down and undoing all of your reforming work, you couldn't even muster a whimper as you were compact into a tiny mark on the bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake slowly stood up, lazily wiping herself and dumping the paper into the toilet bowl. Briefly looking down at her handy work, she quickly flushed down her waste before going to wash her hands. She hardly even thought about it as her waste slowly slid past you. Too worn out and beatup to say anything, you could only watch as the more awake Blake looked down with a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great- I clogged it again..\" Blake mumbled, flushing again, the torrent of water washing you down gratefully before rising up from a clear blockage. Thankfully the water didn't reach you. Your tired body gazed up as Blake vanished, only to return holding the long handle of a toilet scrub. Your eyes widened at the potentially dangerous situation before Blakes eyes fell on you, bringing the harsh bristles towards you, mistaking your splattered form as a skid mark. Without any care, she harshly scrubbed you down, quickly obliterating all thoughts before dragging your battered body to the blockage, whisking you around the fowl drain while flushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake pumped back and forward as she flushed, glad to see the blockage go down easily. With another flush, the cat eared giantess attempted to remove the waste from the brush, getting most of it off yet ignoring you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlad to be out of the toilet, even if it was from hitching a ride on a toilet brush, you tried to call out once more as Blake went to put the brush in it's disgusting container. Amazingly- you actually managed to garble some kind of noise that the cat eared girl managed to pick up on. The giant Blake paused briefly-</span></div></div>",

You weren't on there anymore! Blake sets the brush down with a shrug and turns away, her left foot just missing you as she exits the bathroom. The light switches off, and in the darkness the door quietly shuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were upset at how close you were, but to be honest, you were just happy to be out of the toilet. Still, you weren't in the clear yet. In just a few hours the girls would be waking up, and this peaceful bathroom would be filled with massive footsteps. Most of yourself was a puddle, but with some effort, maybe you could shift to somewhere safer?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, you began to inch your way over the tiles. In the pitch black, however, you were traveling blind. There was a wall in every direction, though, and if you got close enough you could take shelter by the baseboard. At least until you had completely reformed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd sure enough, a couple hours later you smashed into a solid surface; with luck, it'd be a safe haven. The crawling sucked more than you'd expected; the floor was surprisingly filthy for a dorm housing entirely women, and you felt chunks of grime stuck all about your skin. You probably looked disgusting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bright flash interrupted your thoughts as one of the girls flicked on the light.

Fear vibrated through you as you began to yell out- watching her hand reach out for the nob to turn the shower on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot noticing your cries- the oblivious blonde turned on the water, the pressure shower instantly flattened out your body. Cold quickly became hot- searing your body onto the floor of the walk in shower while Yang obliviously sang the song Ruby was humming to earlier- having gotten it stuck in her head. You were so distracted by the pressure that only noticed Yangs approaching foot as it crashed into the floor of the wet room, landing close to you. Her large chest soon acted as a makeshift umbrella as she slid under the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYangs singing became garbled as she let the water crash into her face, enjoying the powerful shower head to it's fullest before spluttering outwards. Her feet dangerously padded around the floor while she grabbed her shampoo- squirting a genorous amount into her hand before rubbing it into her long, tangled, hair. The suds from her scrubbing quickly slid down the drain as she worked.<br>\r\n\"Ah-\" The powerhouse winced, feeling some get in her eye.

Your flattened body sloshed harshly against her skin as she scrubbed. Her smile grew as she felt the sweat from the previous day leave her body- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Yang experienced bliss, you felt you were in hell as the hot water cascaded down your battered body. Her hands lathered you up once more before knocking you into her chest, her collar bone jabbing at you  harshly before being replaced by the softness of her cheek. You wanted to cry out as you passed Yangs closed eyes a few times, the life of a soap nothing like you imagined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Yang scrubbed her armpits and lathered up under her boobs she drifted back to thought as she remembered her times sleeping together with all the first years. She wiped away some drool as she remembered all the hot guys she had seen that day.<br>\r\n\"That was awesome-\" She spoke happily to herself, absentmindedly jabbing her nipples with the soap as her free hand slid down her tone stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang felt a twang within her, while she loved her team mates like family, she didn't really get alone time like this. Her yawn slipped out as she mentally pattered herself on the back for getting up so early. She knew it wouldn't be long before the rest of her team showed up however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou screamed into Yangs ass as she picked up speed, her fingers jamming you deep into her cheeks before retreating, scrubbing you harshly against the devastating weapons. Your past trauma with them was fresh in your mind as you were grinded down towards her legs. Her strong hands made quick work of you before switching to her toned stomach. Desperate to get her attention- you wiggled hopelessly as she guided your body over her clitoris- your vibrating screams easily helped it swell before you were pulled away. Your mind went hazy as she uncaringly bent over and scrubbed her feet down- rushing to give her more time to masturbate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost cried as your face hit the soap dish- while you weren't a pervert, you had thought getting used and abused in the shower as a bar of soap would of been better. You mentally kicked yourself as you heard the slick sounds from outside, the sound of the shower head altered, dimming down quite a bit and changing tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before Yang came, as another slap to the face, the cooling down teen weakly put the showerhead back before grabbing the soap again. The sweat from her forhead glistened as she started to lather your body up again, this time grinding your sobbing mess into her inner thighs. The smell of sex overwhelmed you as she mopped your body around, her body still shivered from the aftermath. You tried desperately grabbing at her thin pubic hairs to pull yourself free but it was hopeless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter lazilly giving her body another once over, she dropped you back into the soap dish before hopping out- feeling refreshed as she slipped into her underwear.

Every death, she would press her foot harder into you, her toes clenching over your horrified head as it forced your tongue out and flattened your mouth open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eventually broke down into begging, hoping that she would stand- it had been hours but you finally saw a smile on her face as she put away the game and stood up. Your body flattened out with a weak whimper under her weight as she wiped, flushed and pulled up her underwear and shorts.

You mostly just caught Nora yelling that she would be right back before appologising a few times, slipping past Yang into the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door shut, kicking your brain into gear as you noticed her turning towards your direction. You struggled for a moment, but it only took three steps for the bouncy girl to step on you. She was sweatier then Yang, her toes wiggling over your tortured body before she spun around- futher smearing your body on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no break, the oblivious girl hummed a weird tune up above as she attempted to grind you out of existence. Her toes tried to force themselved into your mouth, scrubbing across happily. Unpredictible stomps seemed common, followed by the feet sliding back and forwards over your body. Toes, ball, arch, heel, stomp, heel, arch, ball, toes, clench. You felt like you were losing your mind, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith tears forming, you gazed up, making eye contact with Nora who moved her feet away from you.<br>\r\n\"Oh-\" She paused, looking at you for a moment. Was this, potentially freedom? You studied her eyes, unable to move as Nora pursed her lips. You winced as you suddenly recognised what she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora gazed down at the weird mark on the floor, wondering if it was a stain or if it was just part of the floor. With a coy smile and a plan to get into Weiss's goodside somehow, she casually spit down, unaware that the stain was actually a person as she purposefully scrubbed her big toe over the stain.<br>\r\n\"Scrub scrub scrub! Clean clean clean! Nora you are a good friend, no Weiss- I'm the best friend!\" Nora spoke up above, moving her foot to spit again before using her heel to scrape you away \"Nora- here's the key to the city! No no, you are too kind! Waffles would be appreciated! Scrubby scrubby scrubby!\" Nora happily worked, watching the stain slowly fade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in absolute hell. The idle movements had been enough, now that she was purposefully trying to scrub you out of existence things were so much worse. You tried to call up to her as she moved her foot again, only to drown in her spit again before getting stomped on. Grossed out, stretched out and feeling like you were going to pass out, you felt a blessing as Nora finally moved her foot away- flushing the toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat had happened?</span></div></div>",

Fearful, you could only look at her as she made her own decision about you.<br>\r\n\"Weird, some kinda sticker of... a dude with his tongue out?\" Nora spoke, you tried to wiggle but you just couldn't move. The girl quickly peeled you off the floor with ease, a smirk coming across her face as she rubbed her finger over your tongue, \"Super weird place for you to be little guy-! Oh, unless someone stuck you there to see how long it would take someone to find you...?\" She plodded over, to the door, crumpling your body into her pocket as she went. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was waiting outside as Nora popped out. <br>\r\n\"Finally-\" Blake stated, rushing into the bathroom as Ruby gave a sigh<br>\r\n\"Come ooooon- they're going to run out of cookies!\" She whined, <br>\r\n\"They won't run out of cookies- relax sis...\" Yang sighed, sliding her socks on as she saw Nora wander over to Blakes boots. The hyperactive girl tossed something inside before hiding Blakes socks under the matress. \"Uh... Nora, what are you doing?\" Yang asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orange haired girl gave a wink, not noticing you choking on the terribly boot feet smell as she pressed you down into the heel section-<br>\r\n\"Check it oooouuut!\" She announced, showing you to the world. Gazing out of the boot at the majority of the RWBY team, you found yourself feeling the past trauma with them kicking in. This was doubled as Nora continued talking \"Someone stuck this to the floor for me to step on, I noticed it so now it's my turn to hide it until Blake finds it- those are the rules after all\" She announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No... w-wait, I'm not a sticker!' You tried to yell, watching in horror as Ruby smirked,<br>\r\n\"Ohh- I like it. So when Blake finds out she needs to slip it on one of us? Sounds fun!\" The innocent girl was backed up with her sister who simply shrugged,<br>\r\n\"Sure- I'm game\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a little push from Weiss, but she too gave in.<br>\r\n\"But why hide the socks...?\" Weiss sighed, looking a annoyed that they hadn't already left. <br>\r\n\"More likely to find the sticker? Duh! It'd be boring if it goes missing too long!\" Nora stated, placing your prison down on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthud<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHUD<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>THUD</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls continued to talk to each other, Blakes voice joining in on the talks above as you tried to unflatten yourself. Your eyes strained up the boots entrance, hoping Blake would find you and end the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you only got a brief glance up at Blakes face before her plump toes started to slide in. Panicking, you struggled to get further into the shoe- but as her black painted toes slid over you, you knew it was pointless. Her heel soon rested ontop, before squeezing you into the hardening insole, the heat already rising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake simply stood up, giving the boots a little tap with a frown.<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you haven't seen my socks? I don't want my feet to rub on the boots too much-\" She asked again, but was waved off \"It's fine! I've gone sockless before, it's not that bad! Plus, we aren't walking that much, mostly just standing or sitting- come on!\" Ruby smiled, pushing Blake towards the door, winking at Nora as you were obliterated under Blakes heel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery step was torment as the sweat and heat increased immensely. Her foot lifted slightly every step, before crashing down again. You didn't loose hope though, your tiny body slowly slid towards the slope in her boot- aiming to get under the arch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a slow process though, your body getting obliterated every foot fall. It was a long journey, but you eventually just barely managed to press your face into her arch. Panting and semi drowning as you were pressed against the sweaty arch, you couldn't help but feel this was way more preferable. <br>\r\n\"D-ang it-\" you choked, desperately throwing your body under her arch on the next step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the foot continued to tilt, further then the previous foot falls. You panicked as you felt your head tickle by the ball of her foot- sliding slightly under it as the foot lifted again but with the same weird tilt. \"Wait, why-\" You cried out, before slowly getting fed to the ball over her feet- where all of her weight would settle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside of the boot, the group of girls started to step down the stairs- everyone forgetting (Or unaware of) your current position for the moment as they focused on the food they were going to grab. Blakes foot clunked down the steps, tilting far more and throwing you further under the ball as she checked the menu on her scroll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until they had reached the cafeteria that Blake started to notice something between her toes. Wiggling at the annoyance as she chewed, the cat girl eventually decided to slip off her boot- squeezing her toes over your form as she dragged you out into the light. The sweaty sticker's twitches went unnoticed as she peeled you away.<br>\r\n\"Ew... what is this...?\" Blake spoke, looking grossed out as Ruby quickly pushed her hand down while looking around,<br>\r\n\"Sshhhhh! Oh man, you found that way too fast- haha. Um- so- we're playing a game Nora made-\" Ruby started, but Nora interupted, <br>\r\n\"Oh- I didn't make it, someone planted it on me! So- you've got to slip it on someone once you find it- then we see how long it takes them to find it. When they find it, they do the same-\" Nora stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss stood over them both with a tray, giving a sigh,<br>\r\n\"It doesn't make sense, how would they know to pass it on...? Pass it here-\" She plucked it from Blakes hand, your body pretty much absorbing all the sweat before being slammed down by the ice queen. She pulled out a pen of some sort as you looked up to her with pleading eyes- but she was looking at your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pen glowed with obvious dust modifications. The edge scratched into your skin, forming tears in your eyes as Weiss wrote a message. You could only gaze at the girl as she tatooed your body like she was writing a paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There- 'You found me!' on the back 'Pass me on' on the front, that should be a clue.\" She stated, passing you back to Blake. You wished to curl up and cry as Blake blushed, looking around. </span></div></div>",

Weiss began to crumble a little, but Nora snapped her back to it. <br>\r\n\"No Weiss- don't fall for it\" she stated, glaring at the puppy dog eyes herself for a moment.

Phew- you've done it again Nora, good plan!\" Nora pumped the air, leaving Ruby looking slightly upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake just chuckled above you.

Your eyes focused on each of their movement, picturing the horrors you would go through being stuck to that part of the body now knowing what that felt like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fear raised higher as all three girls turned away- covering their ears and closing their eyes.<br>\r\n\"You had better not pick me-\" Weiss warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake wandered over, happily patting the girls occasionally as Yang wandered over to watch, snickering as the three girls looked slightly uncomfortable as Blake made sure they didn't know who you would be on. </span></div></div>",

Well, colossal compared to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe excitedly kicked her boots off, oblivious to how they almost landed on you, revealing her socked feet. She contemplated pulling those off too before deciding it didn't matter as she stretched her legs out and wiggled her toes in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a bit less fun from your side as feet the size of buildings smashed down only metres, millimetres to be more accurate, in front of you. Her socks were white, but it was clear they weren't clean, as the dirty copy of her footprint had be painted onto the sole of the sock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feet briefly stopped wiggling and split apart allowing the gase of the redhead to fall upon you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoops, sorry! Just a little excited! I always knew you guys were real so I just can't wait to have some fun with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact that she still seemed so cheerful despite nearly reducing you to a tiny red splatter on the bottom of her sock made you somewhat... nervous, to say the least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, first order of business!\" She started \"Just how big ARE you anyways?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned back, supporting herself on her arms as she lifted her right foot right above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... you look about the size of my pinky toe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could see her toes spread inside the sock as she tilted her head to the side and stuck out her tongue  in an attempt to get a better view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm not too sure... here get a closer look for me, will ya?\" She requested and, whithout waiting for a response, spread out her pinky toe and pressed it down on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe toe smacked into you, knocking you unto your back and pressed you into the ground. The pressure was immense, all you you could feel and see was the fabric of her sock pushing you down into the floor, and all you could smell was the faint aroma of Nora's stale foot sweat stuck in the sock fabric after not being washed for a few days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise, her estimate was pretty close, but her pinky toe was slightly bigger.<br>\r\nThat's when it really sunk in just how small you are, so small that this girl's pinky toe was enough to smother and smush you. And you couldn't even offer any kind of resistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, I can feel you! You're tickling my toes!\" Nora giggled at your attempts to squirm free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe unknowingly began to lightly grind you into the ground beneath her toe. \"Mmm! That felt pretty good, but I still don't know quite how big you are, did you figure it out lil' guy?\" She slowly peeled her pinky toe off you slightly flattened body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried you call out but after that experience you had a hard enough time thinking straight, let alone talking.<br>\r\n\"I'll take your silence as a no then...\" she trailed off, crossing her legs and holding her chin as she went into thought.<br>\r\nHer eyes suddenly focused on her foot, more specifically the sock surrounding it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if it was because of my sock that I couldn't figure it out, as I couldn't see you? That's must be it, I'll just take them off! They do stink a little I suppose!\" Nora chuckled at her own joke, although there was a truth to those words.<br>\r\nShe slid her fingers into her sock to slip it off before stopping.</span></div></div>",

Did you know what it was I said?\" she yells to you with excitement in her voice. You muster up your courage and tell her \"Yeah, you said it was something t-to do with your uh butt\" nervousness obviously apparent. Nora stares at you for a second and then her eyes grow even bigger and get filled with more crazed excitement.\"OH YEAH\" she yells as she picks you up and starts swinging you around. \"I remember now, I'm going to stick you in the back of underwear and take you with me to my classes.\" Breathing a sigh of relief you calm down and do an internal celebration for your successful deceit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora then brings you close to her face and says with barely contained glee \"It gets soooo boring in classes and having MY very own tiny to entertain me will make the time go by wayyy faster.\" Her hot breath washes over you with a scent that smells oddly familiar to pancakes. Nora continues \"OH and the seats can be so uncomfortable on my tushy. All that sitting down and not enough movement is seriously bad for a huntress in training\" She nods along to her statement \"Combat is soooo much fun though since I can move all I want AND I can break people legs while doing it. OH I can't wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will have to wait for tomorrow though. Today I'm going to break you in and have some fun with Pyrrha.\" You begin to feel slightly restless and just want her to put you in her generous butt already. Just as you think that Nora flips up the back of her skirt and swings you around to present her rear to you. You stare at her pantie clad butt in awe.\"Hehe I see you like the merchandise. How about you get a closer look so we can get on with our day\" Nora says rubbing her fingers together acting like she's a dealer with better things to do. You try to restrain yourself, but your desire for Nora's ass is too great and you shout out \"Yes! I'm ready.\" Nora with crazed excitement pulls her panties back and shows off her ginormous pale globes. \"Be a good butt boy and entertain me\" She says with a smile and drops you inside her ass crack. \"Have fun\" she says with a smirk and wink as she lets her panties snap back into place and puts her skirt back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour descent was quickly halted as you meet with the flesh Nora's ass. Sinking in between her pale cheeks you are assured in your choice to deceive her. Nora's butt a soft wonderland. \"I shouldn't be so happy, but just the idea is driving me wild\" you think to yourself as you drive yourself as close you possibly can to Nora's butt fat. Nora feels this and laughs. Not one intended to mock you, but one that is filled with joy and triumph over her new butt boy. \"Yes, you're doing so good, butt boy. I can tell our relationship is going to go great. Nora begins to walk over to a chair in the room. \"BUTT BOY, I'm going to do all sorts of things through out the day that will test your ability to be the best butt boy for me. NO COMPLAINTS, now am I understood!\" Nora says with a mock authoritative tone. \"Yes, ma'am!\" you answer back. This has the effect of making a buzzing feeling in her ass. \"I take it back. If your complaints feel like that then complain as much as possible\" Nora doesn't give you a chance to respond as she then drops her ass into the hard surface of the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smash causes Nora's ass to spread all around you. Filling in any empty space that may have been there before. \"Oh Yes! Pressure from Nora's butt is the best!\" You say aloud. Nora, wide smile on her face gets up from the chair and stands for a second. She then lightly bends her legs and lets all her weight fall back into the chair and consequently on your tiny form in her ass. Ass flesh compresses you again as Nora's ass settles into her chair. \"One last time\" Nora says aloud as she then jump into the air and lets her ass plummet into her chair. This time with so much force that your body lightly sticks to Nora's ass for second before your face peels off of her flesh. \"This is the best.\" you say aloud giving another buzz to Nora. Nora, having felt you, jumps up in joy. Yay! I have the best butt boy ever\" she says aloud as Pyrrah knocks on the door. \"Oh yeah, I forgot about you P-money, one moment. Nora quickly moves over the door, her ass moving wildly along wither and causing you to be rubbed vigorously agianst her ass cheeks and crack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrah immediately asks about you when she's let in. \"Where's the tiny guy at\" she asks with mild concern. \"He is no longer a mere tiny\" Nora says with full seriousness. \"He has been promoted to\" Nora pauses for dramatic effect \" BUTT BOY.\" Pyrrah responds with confusion then slight horror as she takes in Nora's words. W-what, no, Nora you can't do that to someone just because they're tiny\" Nora responds by turning around and presenting her rear to Pyrrah. \"Why not? He seemed happy about it and besides, he's SUPER durable.\" Pyrrah just takes a look at her butt and see's a faint outline of tiny you bunched up between Nora's huge ass cheeks. dejected, she look  away and says. \"Never mind, I just think you should take him out.\" \"Oh, are your jealous that he's not your butt buddy?\" Nora asks with genuine questioning. \"What!? NO!\" Pyrrah yells back with a crimson blush on her face. \"lets just go do what we going to do before\" Pyrrah says. \"Oh yeah and butt boy can come along and entertain me while doing so now. Nora says giving her ass a hard slap. This causes her ass to jiggle all around you. You let a moan of pure ecstasy which buzzes Nora's rear. \"Oh yeah, that's the stuff\" Nora says with apparent joy as well. \"Anyways, lets go Pyrrah and butt buddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere are they going?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You were still trying to decide what to say as she unclipped the clip and slowly slid it through your shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a little nauseous as she pulled you upwards, dangling from the clip- you gazed at her smiling face as she proudly presented you towards Pyrrha who smiled politely.<br>\r\n\"Tah dah!

Your tiny body bounced against her chest a few times as she happily twisted, flicking you back and forth a few times. \"Alright!

You smiled ear to ear at your luck, if anyone would be able to help a fellow 'student' out it would be that her. Here you were, standing inside of her room after a 'minor slip up' with the roommate. You silently vowed to never go under that punishing heel again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiving up to her legend, sharp green eyes fell on you after only a few steps into her room. Your eyes widened in shock as the best student in the school registered your small body on the expansive carpet with ease, making direct eye contact with you. You felt a huge weight lift off your shoulders as one of the best students the academy had to offer alerted her friend of your plight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Nora... it's just... I'm not a fan of bugs\" Pyrrha softly spoke to her friend, her feet curled up onto her bed to avoid the nasty bug. Nora was busy massaging her socked feet, freshly released from it's boot prison while Pyrrha pointed you out.<br>\r\n\"Aw... I just took my shoes off!\" Nora cried out, before laughing \"Oh well! Where is it? I'll smash it barefoot if I have to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart fluttered for a moment as your mind tried to comprehend the conversation. Before you can run, the hyperactive team member had bounced over to you, her  bare feet pounding the floor mercilessly as she looked down. You could barely move as she laughed down at you,<br>\r\n\"Goddess Nora on the case!\" her voice was laced with happiness, unable to hear you cry out as she dropped her sock down ontop of you. The soaking wet material slapped you harshly into the ground as a musky scent attacked your senses. \"Like I would step on a bug bare foot\" Nora boomed above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanicking, you quickly scrambled for an exit, ignoring the heat wave that came with the sock you tried to push through. Not given 20 seconds, you started to feel a sudden harsh pressure press you into the sock. The smell and the heat increased as the pressure steamed you onto the wet spot on the sock. You couldn't even whimper as Nora finished you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith minor curiousity, Nora watched her sock twitch for a second before her short attention span got the best of her. With her hands on her hips, the bright eyed girl brought her foot down, stepping down harshly on the 'bug'. Her foot twisted a few times to ensure the insect had been completely plastered to her filthy sock before she stepped off, picking it up carefully between two fingers. Her smile undaunted by her playful cruelty,<br>\r\n\"Hope you had a foot fetish or something!\" Nora beamed, looking for the insect on her sock as Pyrrha wandered over.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Thankfully, Pyrrha's concerned face came into view, she looked apologetic before registering shock.<br>\r\n\"Uh- Nora- are you sure that's a bug?\" Pyrrha pursed her lips as Nora yanked a tissue from a table nearby. You tried desperatly to show your human as you tried to get free from the frayed sock fibers that held you in place. Sky blue eyes filled your vision as the hyperactive girl squinted at you, widening as she realized what you are.<br>\r\n\"No way!\" She yelled, carefully peeling you off. Her rough handling wearing down your body as she ripped you off the damp sock, the smell, pressure and the energy you used to try and wiggle free finally got to you as you passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awoke later on your back, surrounded by soft bedding.<br>\r\n\"What happened-?\" You muttered, sitting up. To your side lay a bottle cap filled with water and one filled with something that resembled a finely chopped roast dinner. Glad for the food, you couldn't help but worry as you gazed around the glass panels that surrounded you. Looking out, you saw the girl whose sock you were stuck to, bobbing her feet to some tune. The door opened soon after, letting in the amazon woman from before.<br>\r\n\"How's he doing?\" Pyrrha asked Nora, whose headphones were now dangling from her neck. <br>\r\n\"Gave it some food and water, I don't think he's awake yet though-\" Nora glanced down, \"Guess these little guys are more powerful then I gave them credit for!\" She giggled, wiggling her toes. The amazon shook her head slightly before wandering over to your 'cage', Nora followed behind with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they made your way over, you nervously readied yourself to talk to the giant girls before you.<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" You yelled as they drew close, they both didn't respond, talking among themselves about your health. \"Hey! Can you hear me?\" You called up, waving your arm's back and forth. <br>\r\n\"It's fine! Look- it's jumping around all happy and such!\" Nora grinned, her hand shadowing your light before her finger crashed into you. Surprised by her actions, you yelled out, unable to resist the finger as it pinned you on your back, petting you roughly into the ground before ascending back to the ceiling-less roof of your cage. \"Aw- it's super cute- can we keep it?!\" Nora asked, watching you hop back up.<br>\r\n\"It's a human- plus the dorm doesn't allow pets\" Pyrrha stated, looking down at you with an unsure face. \"At least- it looks human. Perhaps it's a creature of grim- it's rather small...\" You swallowed hard at Pyrrha's words, backing up slightly as Nora slammed her hands on the edge of your prison,<br>\r\n\"This little buggy? A creature of grimm? No way would it look this adorable- look look!\" Her gleaming smile flashed your way as her hand came back down, faster then you could react.<br>\r\n\"H-hey!\" You yelled out, the girls quick moving fingers pinching your tiny body to pick you up. Closing your eyes from the vertigo and wind, you felt your self drop a small distance until you landed on a soft surface. Opening your eyes again, you gazed upon Pyrrha and Nora's face up close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't say that's a creature of grimm!\" Nora beamed, holding your tiny form in her palm as Pyrrha examined you. The tough amazon girl sighed, nodding her head in agreement before gentlely scooping you up.<br>\r\n\"You are right- what are we going to do with him though? We can't let him run around at that size.\" She sighed, cupping her hands over you to seal you in. While she was being more gentle then the other girl, you weren't sure you liked the claustrophobic carrying method. Your transport opened up, dumping you back in your cage. \"It's a good job you owned this fish tank-\" The amazon girl gave you a kind smile as you tried to communicate again-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped as you noticed the girls moving away from your prison to talk- your hand touched the glass as you listened in. Pyrrha seemed concerned- she thought you could communicate with them while Nora just thought you'd make a neat pet, talking about training and toys she would get you.

You were slightly disheartened at the detail in the map. Shaking off the feeling you stepped back against the wall as students passed by, they talked about some kind of tour that perked your interest. You nervously bit your lip before putting your map away and giving chase, a tour sounded kind of interesting albeit dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSticking to the walls, you managed to join the tour group. A student seemed to be giving the tour, a polite looking girl who you overheard as being called Pyrra.  She stood out in the crowd and was quite easy to follow, her voice seemed a bit soft though, forcing you to get closer in order to hear. Luckly the majority of the tour had a wall you could hang onto, letting you stick close to the amazon woman as she gave her tour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were following, the tour started to head away from the wall. Holding your breath to stop your nerves, you quickly looked around the near empty ground before running after the group. Your mind suddenly registered Pyrras movements, her blush and apologies came out as she slowly turned the tour group around. You gasped at the group of giggling girls as they walked towards you, not giving you any chance as you were pounded into the ground. The chatter muffled out your cries as the new students walked over you, sticking your flattened body to some shoes, while others mercylessly crushed you into the dirt or simply kicked you forward. Unable to yell you simply took the weight of the future hunters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay in the dirt, your body flat and aching as the final girl stepped over you. A pair of brown boots slowly stomped towards your unmoving body as you tried to get out of the way.<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" A soft voice called out. You tried to turn around as harsh gloved fingers crushed your body further, \"What a cute sticker, I wonder if it still sticks\" Pyrrha's smiling face came into view as she fiddled with your body, not able to detect your desperate beg for attention.</span></div></div>",

The noodles were pretty thick, thick enough for you to stand up on one of them with both feet at your size, but slippery. In your rush to get found, you quickly found yourself sliding inbetween the noodles, Weiss's face vanishing from sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slid a couple of layers, your attempts to grab the slick food only slowing your decent rather then stopping it completely. With a panicked flail, you just about managed to stick to one of the noodles fairly close to the surface. The boiling heat messed with your head as you glanced down- just barely able to see a pool of boiling liquid at the very bottom of the bowl where the food was hotter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to fall lower, you carefully ajusted yourself before everything shifted slightly. You felt the piece you were on sink lower for a moment before settling. You held on, not wanting to fall into the soup down below as you tried to call out- but there was no way she could hear.<br>\r\n\"Th-there's someone in here!\" You cried out, before something pushed past you- knocking you from your noodle onto another one. The black column lifted up, dragging the foot out of the steamy pit and making more room for noodles to fall into. A small yelp crossed over you as you tumbled down- this time feeling the weight as noodles fell over you. A shudder ran through as you quickly realised in this small time frame that the girl had started eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the food fell around you as more noodles were taken out of the bowl. Again, your yell was unheard. For Weiss, it must of been a normal meal, oblivious to your plight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a drop in your stomach as the black column came close, before slowly pushing you into the doughy texture of one of the noodles. Unable to call out as the greasy food was forced into your mouth- you decided to try to slip out of the iron grip of the chopsticks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing out of the small slit, adrenaline started to pump through you as you just barely saw Weiss's lips as she blew on the strands. Her air warmed by the hot food as it washed over you.<br>\r\n\"W-wait- no no no\" You managed to stutter, pushing your way to freedom as the unaware maw opened up.</span></div></div>",

She swallowed her latest load before her tongue mopped up the food left on her lips like it was nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour tiny body easily stuck to the monolithic tongue as it swept across you. A simple act for her had sealed your fate as she dragged you into the hot wet cave of her mouth. The light cut off as the gentle girl deposited you inside her mouth, your flattened body mistaken for a herb or spice of some kind as she gently swished you around in her cheeks, sucking all the grease from your body and replacing it with saliva. You choked slightly as her tongue forced saliva into your mouth before slamming you into the roof. You shuddered as you felt suction around you, realising you had just survived the first swallow of many.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the tongue peeled away from the roof, you slowly realised you were stuck, flatted to the powerful muscle as light started to flood in. You shuddered slightly as the huge chopsticks entered your prison, dropping a few strands of noodles off before retreating. You waited a few seconds before the air pressure shifted, sucking in more and more of the greasy food. You couldn't even yell out as the noodles dragged and crushed you into the tongue, splattering grease into you before the light was completely cut off. Your prison bounced up and down as her powerful jaw moved, mashing up the loose strands into an easy to swallow form, you were whipped around, used carelessly to jam the food into the oncoming teeth. The unusual torture lasted longer then you thought it would as the mushed up meal was slowly devoured with a few swallows, the tongue thankfully slammed you down onto the roof again and again, oddly saving you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-stop\" You tried to speak as the mouth opened again. The giant chopsticks dumping more and more food over your body. Your eyes widened as you noticed your leg had stuck to one of the noodles. When Pyrrha was ready, you were quickly ripped from the safety of the tongue, straight into her cheeks. You could only whimper as the chewing started, each bite slowly dragged you closer to the teeth, it wasn't long until-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*MASH* Pyrrha bit down, *MASH* her teeth repeately battering your body into the clump of chewed noodles *SHLICK* your body stuck to the upper row of teeth *MASH* before slamming down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha didn't notice a thing as she chewed, she simple examined her food, chopsticks poking through it to check how much was left while she ate. Her stomach growled as it told her she was full, but the few strands that remained tempted her too much. She brought the mushed up ball to the back of her throat before swallowing, her chopsticks already ready for another round. She licked her lips once more before glancing towards the glass of water she had ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay between her two molers along with a few scraps of forgotten food. Your body resembling the mashed up food you were stuck in. You didn't even bother trying to unstick this time as the mouth slowly filled with water. You were easily washed from cheek to cheek before finally getting sent down her throat. All light cut off as you decended, unable to stop your fate as you were easily deposited into the over packed stomach. You tried to wobbly stand up as the food shifted, digesting quickly beneath you, thankfully you managed to crawl out of the way of the rest of the food slipping into your prison. You tried to reform as the stomach started to bounce around violently, the sound of muffled cheering reminded you of her fight. With renewed vigor, you quickly tried to reform as the stomach started to try and fuel your over working host.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a while to reform to a point where you could actually shout, her stomach was already half empty. By this time, the fight seemed to have stopped.<br>\r\n\"Pyrrha! Help!\" You yelled, your weak body bashed against the walls as you desperately tried to get the big girls attention. You noticed the walls secreting more stomach acid as she started to relax after her battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha was none to wiser to your plight as she rubbed her grumbling stomach. The cheers of the crowd a distant murmer as she headed towards her current bed. <br>\r\n\"Perhaps it wasn't a good idea to eat so much before a fight-\" She spoke jokingly as she wandered around outside with her friends.

As usual Nora was happily skipping ahead of her teammates, ready to return to her room, before classes started again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That meal was SO good, i can't belive you let me have yours Jaune\" She gleefully exlaimed, still skipping along<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Nora, you just took it without ask...\" Jaune said, but was cut off by Nora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, my but is really itchy today, first it was the chair in the cafeteria, and now here\" She annoyingly said, while reaching down to scratch her behind<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Your POV*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Nora had mercilessly and unknowingly slammed her rather generous posterior, at least it seemed relative to your size, you had wound up stuck right inbetween her two titanic cheeks. The smell that eminated from underneath her bright pink panties, with her symbol, was a foul scent that could only be described as Nora not being very cleanly, or it was the underwear itself. In any event, the smell so close to her colon, was foul to say the very least, and with each step you were being brought slightly closer to the center, as the panties were riding up. The situation was not made any better, by the fact that Noras imposingly large cheeks, were jiggling with each step, causing them to slam together, which on top of the foul smell, was giving you a severe beating at your size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the fabric of her skirt which was only covering her tush, was moving ever so closer to you. Trough the fabric you could see the shape of a giant hand, and you gulped in terror, knowing what was coming. One of the fingers pushed against you, and was pushing you around, edging you ever close to the dead center of the massive rear, exposing you to the foul smell eminating from deep withing. You took comfort in knowing that you were still on the outside of the panties, dreading what might happen if you were on the inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Nora\u00b4s POV*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora was furiously scratching at her behind, causing the skirt to slightly glide up, exposing her larger than average behind. The fondness for Ren\u00b4s pancakes, coupled together with her intense training, had given the bubbly girl, a rather sizable behind, which was hidden beneath the loose skirt. With each step she took, the bit of her butt that was exposed, was now jiggling around, thanks to her furious scratching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehrm Nora? You are aware that people are looking?\" Ren exclaimed calmly, to his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I DONT CARE. Ren i have an itch in my butt, and i need it out.\" Nora responded agressively<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe few bystander in the hallways, either giggled or gakwed at the girls exposed behind, The rest of team JNPR, quickly caught up with the exposed redhead, covering her, so she could finish her buisness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OOH. I THINK I GOT IT\" She exlaimed triumphantly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Your POV*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nora had been pushing you deeper and deeper with her giant ass, you were now nearing the dead center. Your face was stuck flap up against a surface, and as you moved your hands around what small amount you could, you could feel various wrinkles. The horrid smell invaded your nostril, and you knew exactly where you were. You were pushed straight up against Noras asshole, and your face was up close and personal. The giant finger was not stopping its relentless quest, and you could barely hear the chattering of the owner outside, as the giant cheeks were blocking the sound. With each second, you were experiencing more and more force from the finger, fearing what might happen next. You took a deep breath and braced for it, when suddenly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The smell was horrible. Your nostrils were being burned by the invading stench that didn\u2019t even seem possible to be man made. If the smell wasn\u2019t bad enough, the pain of her constricting walls caused you to scream in anguish. You soon realized your mistake as the second you opened your mouth it was filled with her foul tasting flesh. Your taste buds were assaulted with the taste of dried shit and stale farts. You tried to shut your mouth to no avail. You then felt a frightening rumble. You hoped she was just hungry but deep down inside you knew what was about to happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Nora\u2019s POV* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora holds her stomach as she was suddenly hit with a massive stomach. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d Ren asked in concern. \u201cIt\u2019s alright I just got a massive stomach ache.\u201d \u201cIt should get better with time, I just feel really gassy.\u201d Nora replies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren\u2019t able to understand much but were terrified as you were about to find out. <br>\r\nPfffffff. You felt a rumble then within seconds a horrid cloud of stenched washed across your face. Normally it would be pretty bad but due to being trapped in her asshole, it was the worst stench you have ever smelt in your life. With your mouth forced opened by her walls of flesh, you couldn\u2019t do anything as you were forced to taste every last bit of her silent but deadly fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Nora\u2019s POV* <br>\r\n\u201cHmm, that didn\u2019t smell at all, I guess I\u2019ll just let them all loose now.\u201d Nora said in confusion not knowing the reason why her farts didn\u2019t stink was because you just absorbed all of it. <br>\r\nPffffff.pfffff.

Panic slowly filled your body as you focused on turning 3D again, it was pointless though, Nora's body heat hadn't even left your body as the green haired girl dragged your open prison backwards. You shivered in fear as she indicated for a bowl before her huge rear end blocked out your view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for the tight white pants to fill your view, slowly coming down over you. You couldn't even turn your head as she covered you completely in the fabric of her clothes. You whimpered as you felt her body heat radiate from her before she finally sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmerald exhaled, her aching feet dangled as she let the chair hold all her weight. She hadn't a clue you even existed, she just wanted to relax and eat while she waited for the next important match. A bowl of greasy noodles appeared infront of her, much to her dismay. Her growling stomach quickly overrode her pallet as she starts to slowly nibble through her meal, paying the shopkeep with money she stole from him earlier. Bored and unsatisfied, she slowly shuffled about in her chair as she slurped a few noodles with her pouting lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Nora had pounded you into paste, this girl was grinding you into dust. Her huge rear end sadistically moved you around the chair in an effort to get comfortable, putting you in some of the worst spots where all her weight would be focused on you. Instinct told you to scream, or crawl away, yet was an impossible task. You were at the mercy of the red eyed girl until she finished her meal. Just when you thought it couldn't get much worse, she hopped off of you. You gasped the available air as the huge amount of pressure let up, before she came down again. The pressure was the worst you had ever experienced, just as quick as it started, the pressure stopped. You looked up in fear as you saw her hovering over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinder watched from afar as her team mate slammed down on the poor chair repeatedly, Emeralds face showed hints of annoyance before she gave up.<br>\r\n\"My- my, what did the chair ever do you you?\" Cinder chided, wandering behind her darker skinned friend, making her jump slightly.<br>\r\n\"Oh- it's you. It's just- really uncomfortable-\" Emerald pounted, standing up. \"I'm done eating- this\" She turned her nose up, ignoring the annoyed shopkeeper as she wandered off with Cinder.</span></div></div>",

Her slamming ass smashing you into a dangerous situation as a muffled voice rang out above. You couldn't hear what was being discussed up above, due to the wall of flesh currently pressing your beaten body down with hydraulic force. A moment later, it seemed you were finally save...or so you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Emeralds voice echoed above, you were able to get a good look at the stool you had been crushed into for so long. That's when it dawned upon your flat mind you were plastered to Emeralds back jean pocket like a cute little design. Her gun holsters somewhat blocked your view as each step shook your new prison. Thankfully you were no longer being smashed into the hard seat, especially after seeing a bunny Faunus girl sit down in the stool once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They really need to get better stools here, that seat was so uncomfortable.\" Emerald grumbled, her hips slightly swaying as she walked along with Cinder. \"It won't be much longer untill no one will be around here, that stool is the least if your worries. Head back to the room and wait for further instructions. We have some strategies to talk over before moving forward.\" The conversation above made little sense to you, but it didn't matter as Emerald shift paths. Each cheek bouncing in rhythm as the other figure, you assumed she was talking to, walked out of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your green haired captor walking back alone, this gave you the perfect chance to try and free yourself from any further squishing. The jiggling force managed to help further your progress, allowing you to free most of your upper body as Emerald reached her room. \"Ugghh...what a day. Thank God classes aren't going on right now.\" She groaned, jiggling her butt towards her bed. You had a few moments to act or end up a design on the white pants once more. The comfy bed entered your view, and with one final push you ripped yourself off Emeralds booty just as she sat down. Even with the time you used to reform your body was still somewhat flat. Laying beside the girl, fate seemed to step in and make things worse for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smooth palm shifted through the air, coming to rest right atop of your crushed form. However, Emerald was now able to feel you. Her hand withdrew out of confusion, slowly sitting up to look at the thing her hand brushed over. When she saw your tiny form though, her face turned into a purely devilish glance. \"Well, what do we have here. Trying to sneak around and spy on me little guy?\" Emerald said, her fingers wrapping around you as she lifted you up to her red eyes. \"You better tell me what you're doing in here before I crush the life out of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your hands pinned you frantically tried to save yourself, \"N-no please wait! I wasn't spying on you, I promise! I-i was on the stool back at the noodle bar; and after you sat down I ended up getting plastered to your pants. That's the truth!\" You plead, managing to yank your arms out of her grip to show them off in a flattened state. At first Emerald thought you were bluffing, untill she watched your paper hands pop back into shape. \"Oooh, so YOU were what made the seat so uncomfortable...I think you need to make up for being such a horrible cushion. Seeing as your body can take a beating...you're going to be staying right here with me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll color on your face dissappeared at Emeralds final words. Right before you could say anything, her fist closed in around your body, letting it ooze out of the little cracks. Emerald smiled down at her new toy, her mind racing with what to do with you. As she let her fingers massage and squish your body more, she finally came to a decision.</span></div></div>",

She looks to be a rabbit Faunus and is wearing a primarily brown themed outfit. She takes a seat on you without any thought of your current prison being anything other than a seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Her rear comes down on you swift and smushes you right into her crack and the seat below. The pressure of her sitting on you is just as unbearable as the prior two girls. It was about to get worse as the girl has taken notice of the peculiar feeling the chair has. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cWeird, this stool feels different than before\u201d She says while grinding her ass down on you. She asks the shopkeeper \u201c Mam, did the school get different seats, becaus this one is way more comfortable than usual?\u201d She proceeds to hop up and down on you while saying this. Your already crumpled body is getting worse and worse from her grinding and thumping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, which is odd because the the girls before kept moving around in them as well\u201d said the shopkeeper before walking off into the back. \u201cHmm, perhaps I\u2019ll start getting here early for lunch because this stool is working wonders for my rear.\u201d Velvet muses to herself. You just try your hardest to struggle beneath her and make an attempt to scream into her butt. She doesn\u2019t even feel and just unconsciously registers the buzz as something pleasant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish I could have a cushion like this at the dorms or when I\u2019m in the gym.\u201d She mumbles to herself. You hear this and freak out. Surely if she found you she wouldn\u2019t abuse you for her own comfort. Her constant grinding proves you other wise as you feel yourself slowly adhering to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Velvet finishes her meal and stands up. \u201c That was a great meal\u201d she says to herself with a smile \u201c it was made even better by this great stool\u201d she looks down on it to see what could\u2019ve made it feel so good when she spots you. \u201cIs that a little guy?\u201d She whispers to herself. \u201cSo you\u2019re what made that stool feel great\u201d She then realized something \u201cYou\u2019ve been there for a while now haven\u2019t you, because that shopkeeper said two girls before kept moving on this stool\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to feel a mix of emotions.

If you somehow manage to win, I'll let you stay in my dorm.\"<br>\r\n\"Why would I want that?\"<br>\r\n\"Because, since you probably lied a billion things to get into the academy, they're not going to have a room for you.\" Knocking you down with a finger, she gave you a sly grin as she made her second point. \"Plus, Yang Xiao Long sleeps in the nude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs confident as you were before, you weren't quite sure if you could do it now.<br>\r\nWould the risk of losing really be worth the gain?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you decide...</span></div></div>",

The Schnee heiress was quite pleased by your answer. She half expected you to try and renege on your 'little' agreement or be difficult. It was nice to know some people's word still meant something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then hop to it. I'm starting to loose my patience.\" She teased. You felt a small smile make it's way to your face. At least she wasn't teasing you about your pitiful defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked up to the Schnee heiress' sexy foot and marveled at their beauty. Now that you weren't engaged in mortal combat you could make out the perfectly manicured nails and clean pale skin. You were also grateful for the lack of odor. Sure their was a small smell but it was mostly smothered by the scent of coconut lotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem. Any day now.\" came the heiress' voice from above. You'd been staring for too long. It was wrong to keep a lady waiting. She wanted her prize now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was time to give it to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a deep breath and stood in front of her big toe. It was far bigger than you were and the perfect place to plant a kiss. You puckered lips... And planted a long wet kiss on the heiress' foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss giggled in contentment as she felt the small kiss you planted on her big toe. What made it all the more sweet was the fact that you kissed it with all your might. You wanted to make sure she felt it. You wanted her to know you weren't going to half ass it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like a full minute, you finally remove your lips for her foot. You were blushing madly at what you've just done and could feel your pants growing tighter.

Truly a job well done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you my lady.\" You bowed.

The only question is where will I keep you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wondered what the Schnee heiress had in mind for you. You didn't mind traveling with her as it made getting around a whole lot easier.

It makes sense that she\u2019s an heiress, no normal person would have such refined looking feet. It was almost unnatural as to how well maintained flawless they looked. Then again most women on Remnant are beautiful, but even still just staring at her feet, it would seem your new \u201cmistress\u201d was ahead of the others. Her skin looked almost milky and smooth as silk. Her toenails painted with a light blue polish that  accentuated her elegance. Even just standing there her feet exuded a sense of power and absoluteness that made feel awe towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n           Breaking you free from your state of reverie, Weiss looked down at with a face that held no particular emotion and said, \u201cYou\u2019ve been staring at my feet with such passion.\u201d She gives a light hum and continues, \u201cThey are quite beautiful aren\u2019t they.\u201d She looks down at you expectingly. A moment of silence which is followed with a light stomp by Weiss, which was all but soft for you. \u201cI said, they\u2019re quite beautiful aren\u2019t they.\u201d Weiss says with much more force than the last time. You stammer out \u201cY-yes mistress.\u201d Her expression changes toward a more pleased one and she say, \u201cOh, it seems I don\u2019t need to remind you to call me that anymore. From now on I won\u2019t be as merciful when you forget to address me as such.\u201d She let\u2019s her words settle in to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       \u201cNow I want you to stare at my feet. Gaze at their perfection, until I tell you to stop.\u201d She commands with her calm, relaxed tone. \u201cYes mistress.\u201d You answer and begin staring at her feet once again. You stare at her feet as she lightly wiggles her toes. They seem almost sensual with how deliberate and slow she taps against the floor. You stare as she brings her heel up and down. You stare as she raises her sole up. You stare as she takes a step toward you. Her feet all the while enrapturing you in their glory. You stare as she stops in front of you and you continue staring as she raises her foot above you. \u201cM-mistress, please don\u2019t do this I\u2019m sorry for staring I won\u2019t do it again.\u201d She hover her sole above and respond to your plea, \u201cOh, I\u2019m not mad. I\u2019m pleased with your initiative. My feet are the pinnacle of perfection, but at the end of the day, they\u2019re feet. And you should learn the reality and limits of perfection.\u201d Giving you no time to respond she brings her foot down and slams it against your body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n          You were instantly flattened against her sole. She had positioned it to where you were crushed against part that was between her arch and the ball of her foot. \u201cNow we know where I\u2019ll be carrying you\u201d Weiss says with a sigh above you. You can taste her bare foot flesh and thank Weiss for being cleanly. Of course to you self as you can\u2019t even produce a sound with said foot being shoved in your mouth. While her foot is clean now, you know she will soon sweat and make your situation much worse.  You can just barely move your eyes and see the bottom of  her toes. You feel your mistress take a step and are overcome with a sense of weightlessness. That feeling ends when you are carried along with her foot as she places on the ground. She just took her first step with you adhered to the sole of her foot and it\u2019s the first of many to come. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n         Unceremoniously and seemingly giving you no thought, Weiss puts her socks back on. You feel them slide over you and this is when it finally hits you. You\u2019re going to be stuck with those beautiful feet you admired earlier. Not just for a short bit, but at the very least the whole day. Dread and resignation falls over you as you feel Weiss slips her boots on. The temperature instantly takes on a warmer more humid feel. You try to moan, but Weiss has already taken a step that prevents you doing so. Step after step she walks, seemingly uncaring of you position. Already the clean taste of her foot from earlier has changed to a lightly salty taste. She\u2019s sweating, you realize. Having no choice you lap on whatever enters your mouth. Not much now, but you know it has the potential to be horrific. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n       And so you will spend your time today licking the perfect feet of Weiss Schnee. Weiss up above enjoys the idea of you being tormented so and will go on with the rest of her day with you down below. Licking and suffering from the pressure that her refined feet exude. Feeling content she takes heavy steps and goes to\u2014</span></div></div>",

You landed on her insole with a light splat.<br>\r\nYou haven't thought about it given her regal attitude, but the combat boots had obviously built up a fair bit a sweat, and the insole was uncomfortably moist. And that's when the smell hit you.<br>\r\nAt the opening of the boot, the heiress' perfume blocked any bad smells, but the constant use in combat had left a strong smell of foot sweat deep inside, and you were in the thick of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had more pressing matters, however, as you felt the boot being lowered down to the floor. <br>\r\nYou looked up an the bright outside of the boot to see the gigantic Weiss smirking in at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, see you back the dorm~!\" <br>\r\nShe teased, raising her pale foot.<br>\r\n\"W-wait! I'll die!\" You cried up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe froze and considered this for as second before grinning down at you and chuckling,<br>\r\n\"You know, you <i>almost</i> had me little guy, but if you can survive being turned to gum under my boot, then being the insole of my soft, delicate, little foot should be like a dream for you, now lay down, I want to get comfortable...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could say another word she started to lower her foot into the boot, you quickly ran to the time of the boot to avoid the actual toes chasing behind you. <br>\r\nBut the moist insole was tough to get a grip on and you tripped over, quickly turning over to face upwards the foot rolled over you, pushing you into the slimy insole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heiress' warm toes rolled over your face, followed by the ball of her foot. Finally the foot stopped and the weighted settled on you, and your current situation truly dawned on you.<br>\r\nYou were stuck face-up, under the ball of her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pressure was incredible, as you felt yourself flatten into a gum-like sticky substance under her sole. The heat seemingly melting you as all your senses where overtaken by her foot, the only thing you could smell or taste was her sweat, the only thing you could feel was her soft sole and it's heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to move, scream or anything, but her foot was completely dominating you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss, however, was thoroughly enjoying this. The feeling of your squished body under her sole felt delightful, and it sent shivers down her spine. She wiggled her toes in excitement and anticipation of the walk to her dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grinned wide as the raised her foot, and stepped forward, almost audibly squeaking with enjoyment as she felt you squishing further.<br>\r\nAnd again.<br>\r\nAnd again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirked and she <i>slowly</i> walked back to dorm.

Her toes curled up as pressure transferred into the ball of her foot to continue her walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe torment of walking was humiliating and painful. The oblivious girl continued to pound you into her daily cycle as she walked from place to place. When she sat down, she would constantly toy with you, pulling on your body absentmindedly with her toes. When she wasn't sitting, she was storming around, her feet only able to stand still for a few minutes before grinding against you once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thanked every god you could think of as she removed her foot from your warm, moist confounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh Ruby fell on her bed, airing her tired tootsies out before getting dressed into her Pajamas.

Your hands squished the sweaty foot covering the softness of them allows you hands to sink into them a bit and drip a big drop of sweat right into your face. You had to spit and sputter from the taste, you shook the wetness off and sat on the squishy insole to think of a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou figured that the only way to get out was going to be to fuse with the Nylons as much as it disgusted you, there was no way that a girl would stand to wear such a sweaty garment for another day, you could just reform after she tossed them into the hamper.

I'll get to it after the end of the day.\" You thought you had to get out of this situation it didn't matter if you got caught at this point but you were to late her feet were inside you now, toes wiggling to separate the different parts that were stuck together. She pulled you all the way onto herself, now you felt stretched beyond belief, the hyper active girl wiggling her toes to loosen the stiffness. You whimpered as her foot slid back into the boot putting her full weight onto you again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe starts her day, you feel every muscle in her legs as you could still smell her feet as she walked down the hall, this was worse in every way to being an insole and it was only just starting.</span></div></div>",

However, the moment you came out the lights turned on and the next thing you knew your small body was being surrounded by red petals and lifted into the air. Without even looking at the face of who caught you you knew it was Ruby, shown by her signature red petals caused by her semblance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up expecting a creeped out or disgusted face but instead you see a face reserved for kids seeing Mickey Mouse, as if you were the most interesting person in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"Woaaaaah how'd you transform that was awesome!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stayed gobsmacked at how little she seemed to care that you emerged from her clothes.

You can be just like my darling Crescent Rose!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving enough of her constant questions you raise your hands.

Did ya Did ya Did ya!?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reply to the affirmative, making sure to complement her as well.

You were probably one of my clothes for the day!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that doesn't creep you out at all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"I mean, it should I guess, but I know alot about fetishes and I've seen alot weirder on Yang's scroll when she wasn't looking. Also, Dad said I should never judge someone based on what they like so if you like being my clothes then I don't really care. Also, I see the uses of someone who can transform into things! If I run out of clothes like today I'll be able to ask you to become something and If I need Crescent Rose but she isn't here I can use you! So, do you wanna be my partner for Beacon? It would beat Weiss's nagging atitude.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reply to the affirmitive and almost instantly Ruby starts hugging the life out of your small body.

Yang could bench-press a car and though not quite as strong Blake was nevertheless still physically tougher than most of the academy\u2019s students and was extremely agile as well. And Ruby, somehow in defiance of her small frame, was not only strong enough to swing around that monstrosity of a weapon of hers but had a semblance that radically increased the speed and, by virtue of the momentum behind them, power of her physical attacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heiress on the other hand relied more on finesse to win her battles. Combat skills gained from hours of practice, combined with an extremely versatile semblance and an encyclopaedic knowledge of dust and its applications. Not to mention a steady supply of the latest in dust products.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was why, while the rest of her team were out wasting time, or \u2018team building\u2019 as Ruby called it, Weiss was busy mixing powdered dust into complex compounds for use in battle. It was a fairly dangerous task, since dust was dangerous at the best of times, and even more so if mixed incorrectly, but she\u2019d done this a hundred times and she had a meticulous system for storing her dust that ensured she wouldn\u2019t get the vials mixed up. Which was why she could only stare in confusion for a moment as the mixture in her mortar turned a colour it definitely should not have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill holding the now luminescent concoction, Weiss\u2019s eyes shifted to her dust supply only to belatedly realise that they were not, in fact, in the order they should have been but had been haphazardly rearranged by person\u2019s unknown or, more likely, by Ruby after the klutz knocked them over or something. For a split second she considered just throwing the mixture out the window, but then she\u2019d just get in trouble if someone else was hurt. It didn\u2019t matter in the end anyway as no sooner had the thought crossed her mind then the dust evaporated with a violent hissing noise, the resulting smoke bellowing around her face and leaving Weiss coughing and wheezing as she involuntarily breathed it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll at once the heiress was overcome with an intense bout of dizziness and fatigue, barely having the presence of mind to set down the now empty mortar before stumbling to her bed and collapsing in an undignified heap. Her body felt like it was on fire, yet at the same time she was freezing cold. The juxtaposition of sensations were making her sick and her head was spinning in a way she\u2019d never felt before. With a final weak shudder she closed her eyes and allowed unconsciousness to claim her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Weiss awoke, everything had changed. She no longer felt particularly unwell, though there was still some lingering dizziness and a general sense of wrongness. Her eyes took a moment to come into focus as she gazed at the impossible sight before her. This was, her bed, but\u2026 not at the scale she had seen it before. With dread, the shrunken student realised she had been reduced to\u2026</span></div></div>",

In the distance, her pillow loomed even larger and beyond the edge of her bed the rest of the room was an impossibly vast expanse. Her gaze travelled upwards to Ruby\u2019s bed, which now hung above her with the appearance of some massive structure just waiting for a chance to crush her into paste. All at once the sheer magnitude of her situation crashed down upon her and Weiss wanted to curl up into ball and just pretend that all of this wasn\u2019t happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClutching her hands to her head the fencer felt tears forming in the corner of her eyes as she underwent a mild panic attack. She couldn\u2019t understand how this had happened. Even the most volatile of dust mixtures shouldn\u2019t have this kind of effect. Yet she couldn\u2019t deny the reality that was unfolding before her eyes, the changed world that now towered above her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud bang echoed through the room and Weiss immediately whirled around to see what had happened, her instincts expecting some form of attack. What she saw instead was the dorm room\u2019s door swinging open and the rest of her team piling in, now impossibly huge colossi that literally towered over her. They may as well have been moving mountains from Weiss\u2019s perspective, each of them hundreds of times her height and able to shake the earth with their booming footsteps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was used to being smaller than her teammates. Even Ruby was taller than her when she wasn\u2019t wearing her heels (not that she ever took them off if she could avoid it), but this was on a whole different level. Every part of them was bigger than her whole body, and she had no doubt that they could snuff out her life without even noticing if she wasn\u2019t careful. After all, did most people even notice when they crushed a bug beneath their uncaring feet. Heading towards the edge of her bed, Weiss could tell her friends were chatting casually but the cacophony of noise was so much that it took the shrunken student a moment to properly comprehend their speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDumping her backpack beside the door, Ruby quickly scanned the room and noticed the absence of her partner, taking no notice at all of the tiny white bug scrambling across the heiress\u2019s sheets. \u201cThat\u2019s weird. Didn\u2019t Weiss say she was staying behind to study or something?\u201d She was sure it had been something like that. She remembered her disappointment that the girl wouldn\u2019t join them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging, Yang threw her own backpack up onto her bed as Blake more carefully laid hers at the foot of her own. \u201cWho knows? Maybe she went to the library or something. She had to know we\u2019d come back here eventually, so maybe she just wanted to make sure she wasn\u2019t disturbed.\u201d Her Faunus partner nodded in agreement as she absently brushed a few stray hairs from her vest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt any other time Weiss would probably had been pleased by Yang reaching a fairly logical conclusion like that, but as it was she wished they\u2019d all put a bit more thought into her absence. Standing as close to the edge of her mattress as she dared, the tiny girl waved her arms and attempted to call out to her teammates. Unfortunately at her scale the vocalisations weren\u2019t even tiny squeaks to the other girls and her movements remained beneath their notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConceding that her sister was probably right, Ruby turned back to her and Weiss\u2019s side of the room and headed to her bed, casually kicking off her boots in the process and lifting her stocking-clad foot to step down on the edge of her partner\u2019s bed and lever herself up to her bunk. Not even sparing a glance for the little white bug that stood in the path of her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens to Weiss?</span></div></div>",

However, as the team leader slipped off her boots and kicked them to the side Weiss realised with a surge of adrenaline just what was about to happen. Leaping to the side she just barely managed to get out of the road as Ruby\u2019s stocking-clad foot came down on the bed, sinking deeply into the mattress as the brunette levered her entire weight onto the appendage and reached up for her hanging bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving avoided being caught under the foot by barely an inch, Weiss had to scramble to try to avoid being sucked down into the depression caused by her leader\u2019s weight. For a frantic second she griped tightly onto the sheets before Ruby\u2019s weight lifted away once again and the younger girl swung herself up fully onto her bed. With the sudden shift in weight, the heiress lost her grip and found herself lying in the residual crater left behind by her friend\u2019s careless footfall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing deeply and staring up at the now slightly swaying bed of her teammate, Weiss did her best not to descend into another panic attack, but it was hard when all she could think about was how close she had just come to being crushed beneath Ruby. And that no one would have ever known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompletely unaware of their friend\u2019s distress, Blake and Yang grabbed their gym bags from beneath their bunk bed and casually strolled over to the heiress\u2019s bed, their colossal shadows falling over the frightened girl as they looked up at Ruby. The blonde met her sister\u2019s silver eyes and shot her a quick grin. \u201cMe and Blake are going to head to the gym for a bit Rubes. We\u2019ll let you know if we see Weiss.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss didn\u2019t bother listening to Ruby\u2019s response. It didn\u2019t matter right now. She had to make a choice. She could stay here and try to get Ruby\u2019s attention\u2026 somehow. Or she could try and make the jump to Blake and Yang and get their attention instead. Her leader would, presumably, remain relatively still for the time being, but the heiress didn\u2019t exactly have overwhelming confidence in the younger girl\u2019s ability to deal with this situation. Blake and Yang would probably be better bets for getting help, but she may have more difficulty getting their attention in these circumstances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing she didn\u2019t have time to ponder her options for long, Weiss\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shaking off her fear and springing to her feet, Weiss took a running start and leapt from the edge of the bed. She aimed for Blake\u2019s leggings over Yang\u2019s bare legs, feeling that the sheer material would be easier to climb. Though the Faunus was standing right in front of the bed, the tiny girl was so small that she wouldn\u2019t have made it if it wasn\u2019t for her glyphs. Summoning several beneath her feet, she used them as stepping stones to bridge the gap, jumping off the last to land just above Blake\u2019s left knee. Oddly the heiress felt much more drained from the experience than she had suspected, glumly realising that her ability to use her semblance had been drastically reduced in this state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Weiss lamented her lack of energy, the unaware Blake turned to leave the room with Yang and the little heiress remembered that she had much bigger things to worry about. The speed and momentum of her friend\u2019s leg lifting through the air was nearly enough to make her loose her grip and she probably would have thrown up if her entire body wasn\u2019t stiff with fear. The jarring impact that followed as the Faunus stepped down was even worse and Weiss was extremely glad she had not chosen Yang to climb, as it was only her grip on Blake\u2019s leggings that kept her in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe motion and the impacts repeated again and again as the two partners exited the dorm room and headed down the hallway towards the gym, hefting their gym bags over their shoulders in the process. Fortunately for Weiss, Blake had chosen to carry her bag on the opposite side from the leg the heiress now clung to but even without the added danger the tiny girl was starting to wonder if this had been the right choice after all. The hallway blurred pass at what seemed to her an impossible speed but was truly little more than a casual stroll and even as the duo made their way past other students, no-one so much as spared a glance for the tiny bug slinging to the Faunus\u2019s legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, knowing that staying where she was would do little to help her, and fearing what might happen when the partners reached the gym, Weiss swallowed her fear and struggled to make her way up the seemingly infinite fabric, nearly losing her grip several times but eventually making it to the larger girl\u2019s white shorts. She was aware that the colour of the garment would make her even harder to see, but it wasn\u2019t like anyone had noticed her up to now anyway. Seeing one of the tails of Blake\u2019s vest hanging just to her right, she quickly shimmied across the shorts and reached out to grab it, temporarily loosening her otherwise iron grip as she struggled to reach the shifting garment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in focusing on her goal, Weiss had failed to keep track of the conversation between her two giant friends. Of the playful tone in Yang\u2019s voice as she teased her partner. Of the blonde\u2019s proximity to her. And of the mischievous glint in the brawler\u2019s eyes as she closed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking as her partner turned her attention away for a moment to slip past another student, Yang pounced. The two had been engaging in their usual playful banter and Blake had made a comment to the effect that the curvy blonde could stand to lose a few pounds. That could not go unanswered, so with a quick skip she closed the distance between them and swung her own hips into Blake\u2019s, happily hip checking the Faunus and nearly knocking her completely off balance in the process. \u201cHah, don\u2019t pretend you don\u2019t have some curves of your own their Blakey. We\u2019ve all seen that Bellabooty.\u201d Dancing forward a couple of steps to escape any immediate retaliation, she playfully whipped her friend with her hair for good measure but also shot her a small wink to ensure it was all in good fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStumbling slightly, Blake shot Yang a glare as she briefly rubbed her hip but ultimately let the matter drop. It wasn\u2019t worth anyone getting hurt over after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did Blake know that Weiss had already gotten caught up in their game, and was now\u2026</span></div></div>",

She\u2019d just barely managed to grab onto Blake\u2019s vest when the shadow of the blonde\u2019s body fell over her and in the next instance a massive pair of hips slammed into the spot she had just been. The flesh of both girls\u2019 hips compacted together as the force of the blow was transferred to the Faunus, a slight ripple running through her buttocks as she stumbled from the impact. The sudden and violent movement sent Weiss swinging on the tail of her friend\u2019s vest, her head spinning as she frantically struggled to keep her hold. As desperately as she held on however, it was ultimately in vain and with her heart in her throat the fencer\u2019s fingers slipped and she began to fall towards the floor below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the next instant however she was suddenly swept up by a sea of gold that came seemingly out of nowhere, violently swung around as she was tangled in golden threads and sent flying through the air before colliding solidly with an unfamiliar surface. For a few seconds Weiss thought that she may have died and ended up in some strange other world, but as Yang\u2019s jubilant laughter boomed above and her entire world shook in time with the exhalations, she realised where she was. Someone she had been scooped up by Yang\u2019s hair as the blonde girl skipped past Blake, inadvertently saved by the same girl who had nearly crushed her seconds earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral strands of the long golden hair had tangled themselves around Weiss, getting caught around her limbs and through the loose threads of her clothes. Her first instinct was to untangle herself immediately but as she continued to bounce along with her capture\u2019s rhythmic steps, she realised that that wouldn\u2019t be a very good idea. Rather, she freed herself just enough to allow use of her arms and then started the long process of climbing up through her teammate\u2019s hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang\u2019s movements were more erratic than Blake\u2019s and her hair was less secure, so Weiss found herself being thrown every which way as the blonde practically skipped down the hall, but on the other hand she found the hair easier to climb than she had suspected. At her scale the small knots that the brawler had allowed to form deep within her locks made excellent footholds, turning what should have been more of a rope climb into a steep but manageable ascent. Weiss\u2019s stamina was running low, but even as her arms burned from the exertion she knew that she had to do this, less a casual hand or brush tear her from her perch and to the unforgiving ground below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpitting out a stray hair from her mouth, the heiress finally found herself within reach of Yang\u2019s shoulder, peering out from the dense forest of hair at the back of the girl\u2019s neck. Making sure that several strands were still wrapped around her waist for safety, she waited for a moment of relative stillness before swinging out across the small gap and landing with exceptional grace on the brown fabric of her friend\u2019s jacket. After such a marathon climb, the tiny girl was glad for the chance to rest, crouching down and gripping the edge of the jacket where it met her teammate\u2019s neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA part of Weiss had hoped that now that she had reached an elevated position she would be noticed by her friends, but Yang wasn\u2019t in the habit of looking at her own shoulder and Blake had other things on her mind than any stray bugs crawling on her partner. The two had finally reached the gym, swinging open the large doors and looking out over the expansive space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeacon\u2019s gym was large, large enough to cater to an academy full of trained combatants, and was full of a mix of exercise equipment and large open training areas. From her perch on Yang\u2019s shoulder Weiss took in the many other students, both Beacon-based and visiting, and gripped down a little harder on the fabric under her fingers. The last thing she wanted was to get lost away from her teammates, especially with people she didn\u2019t even know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Weiss, Yang remained unaware of her presence and, as such, unconcerned with her safety. She\u2019d turned her head to look over to the left of the gym, before suddenly turning back to face Blake, swinging her head around and allowing her hair to swing wildly behind her as a broad grin bedecked her face. \u201cAlright partner, let\u2019s go show off a little!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake shot her a sly grin in response. \u201cIf you count exercising as showing off I guess.\u201d As usual, the Faunus couldn\u2019t help but get dragged along by her partner\u2019s enthusiasm, too focused on the mischievous grin of the girl before her to take note of the tiny Weiss as the heiress\u2026</span></div></div>",

But in her panic over the chance of falling she\u2019d failed to think ahead to what those strands would mean if the blonde made any sudden movements. While the brawler\u2019s movements had remained relatively sedate the heiress\u2019s weight, though tiny, was enough to keep the strands still, but as the whole mass of hair shifted with Yang\u2019s enthusiastic turn of her head Weiss found herself ripped from her perch in a single violent movement that saw her do a complete 180 degree arc in less than a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sheer shock of the inertia very nearly rendered the little heiress unconsciousness and sent black dots swimming across her vision. Even then, she retained enough of her senses to feel a deep dread as the hairs momentarily pulled tight at the apex of their arc and then unravelled, snapping back towards their owner as Weiss herself continued on. With next to no weight to speak of and a significant boost to start her off, she sailed high over the gym below in an uncontrollable tumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her body spinning around and around it was difficult for the heiress to get any impression of her current location, though she did catch a few blurry glances of her fellows students milling around the gym, none of them so much as sparing a glance for the unfortunate student as she reached the height of her tumble and quickly began falling. Fully believing that a fall from this height would kill her in an instant, Weiss summoned what little strength she had yet to summon a series of glyphs in a vain attempt to control her descent, but ending up just crashing through most of them as she continued to tumble wildly. They did slow her slightly but she was nevertheless sure that she was going to die as the ground came up to meet her with a crushing finality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the last moment before impact, the heiress glumly noted that she was heading towards\u2026</span></div></div>",

She hit the ground with a force that didn\u2019t even register to anyone else in the gym but which to her felt distinctly like being hit by a truck, even against the relatively cushioned surface of the mats. And yet, much to her own surprise she felt winded but surprisingly very much still alive, not even really that sore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllowing her eyes to creep open and slowly catching her breath, Weiss turned her head to the side and noted that she had fallen quite close to the edge of the mat, with the entrance of the gym to her right and the remainder of the mats expanding out behind her. What she couldn\u2019t see is that the impact with the ground had caused part of her body, particularly her chest and legs, to flatten slightly against the mat. Far from two dimensionally but enough to be noticed if she had taken to time to look down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer flattened parts popping back to shape without protest, Weiss rolled onto her back to catch her breath, sighing in relief for a second before her eyes went wide with fear and shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHigh above her, hanging ominously in the air like the looming spectre of death, the bare right foot of Pyrrha Nikos began its silent but deadly descent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Pyrrha it was just a simple step on her way to the rest of her team on the other side of gym, but for Weiss the image of that descending foot was burned into her mind as what might very well be the last thing she would ever see in her life. The red hair of the amazon\u2019s ponytail and the swell of her breasts faded into obscurity, and all she could see was the bare sole, interposed with still shots of her own life flashing before her eyes as she found herself frozen in abject terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the last possible second, the heiress found her voice and screamed in complete and utter despair only to be brutally silenced as Pyrrha completed her step and buried Weiss under an endless wall of flesh. The slightly sweaty foot, made moist from several hours already spent at the gym, sunk deep into the cushioned surface of the mat, the body of the tiny fencer offering no resistance whatsoever as she disappeared completely under the ball of Pyrrha\u2019s foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss had expected a lot of things in this instant. She had expected pain, and there was certainly no absence of that, her entire body experiencing a sense of agony like nothing she had ever felt before. She had expected the darkness and the heat that surrounded her as she was buried in a steamy hell. She had even expected the sweat that clung to her like a second skin and the smell that violently assaulted her nostrils. Yet, she had expected to experience all of these things for a fraction of a second at most, only to have them replaced by the sweet, if undesired, release of death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than end however, the torment just continued as her tortured body failed to burst into the red mess she had expected but instead flattened out under the pressure of Pyrrha\u2019s unrelenting weight, her chest, arms, legs and head quickly compacted into a two dimensional shape that defied reason. The sensations she was feeling were impossible to describe, her body transfigured into putty yet remaining biologically, if not structurally, functional. A blob of putty that somehow was able to be crushed even flatter as Pyrrha\u2019s left foot lifted for her next step, instantly doubling the weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this was experienced in little more than a second as the foot dug in and then started to lift again, the heel lifting off first as the ball twisted down, smearing Weiss into a tortured lump of flesh and torn clothes before lifting off and moving on for another step. Still completely unaware of the agony she had inflicted on her friend, Pyrrha stepped off the mat and walked the remaining distance to her team, greeting the enthusiastic Nora with a casual fist bump as she idly lifted her left foot to scratch an itch half way up her right thigh, absentmindedly grinding the sole of her right foot into the hard wooden timbers of the gym\u2019s main floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Pyrrha and her team headed back towards their gym bags and a change of clothes, Weiss was\u2026</span></div></div>",

It had been a close battle between the spongy mat and the redhead\u2019s moist foot, but in the end Pyrrha\u2019s sole had won out and claimed the shrunken girl as its own, slamming her down again and again into the mat and the hard wooden floor as Weiss was engrained ever deeper into the sweaty flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling pleasantly as she returned Nora\u2019s offered fist bump, Pyrrha remained blissfully oblivious to the torment she was inflicting on her friend as she followed the rest of her team towards the locker rooms. Weiss meanwhile was barely able to comprehend what was happening as she was smashed beneath the towering redhead. Just a few moments ago she\u2019d been under the impression that, while tiny, her body functioned much the same as it had always done. Yet now she found herself twisted into a tormented gooey mass and inexplicably flattened to a nearly two dimensional shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApproaching the entry to the locker room, Pyrrha passed Yang and Blake heading out, raising a hand in greeting and receiving a smile from the Faunus and a wave and \u201cGood hustle Pyrrha!\u201d from the blonde. For some strange reason the brawler followed the comment by going to take a step towards her only to be stopped by an arm and a small glare from her partner as the two headed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaving off Jaune and Ren to the men\u2019s side, Pyrrha followed Nora towards her locker and started to peel off her sweat-soaked clothing, allowing first her shirt and then her shorts to fall to the nearby bench with a wet slap. Opening the locker door, she retrieved a towel and began to wipe off the excess sweat, frowning slightly at the sheer quantity of moisture that was released. Her shorter friend struck up a conversation, and the two happily chatted as they cleaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss meanwhile was nowhere near as happy with this situation. Even the quick walk to the lockers had smeared her into an unrecognisable mass across the ball of Pyrrha\u2019s massive foot, her head stretched out into a flat disc while the rest of her body was twisted all over the place. Facing the sole, the tiny heiress could see nothing but darkness and her other senses were dominated entirely by the sheer agony of her body and the horrendous smells emanating from her sweaty prison. Even the smallest movements of the redhead continued to twist the sole above her, reducing Weiss to a sobbing broken mess, wondering if there was any end in sight to this torment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling on another loose shirt and some comfortable shorts, Pyrrha sat back on the bench, temporarily providing some relief to the squished fencer, but instantly making things a hundred times worse as she tugged on a worn pair of socks and shoved her feet into her sneakers, sealing Weiss inside. From the heiress\u2019s perspective there was a noticeable rise in heat accompanied by the coarse feeling of cloth against her skin. All of which was totally overwhelmed by the massive spike in the horrific stench that rose up around her, the musky scent of dried sweat assaulting her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill unaware of the effect of her actions, Pyrrha hopped up from the bench and gave a few good stomps to make sure her shoes were secured, feeling no irritation whatsoever as she smashed her tiny friend into oblivion beneath her weight. Giving her right foot a good twist to make sure the sneaker was on as tightly as possible, she turned to Nora and announced that\u2026</span></div></div>",

Pyrrha, after taking off her socks and throwing on her sleepwear, hopped into her respective bed just as the light went out, falling fast asleep. Luckily for the bug-sized heiress, Pyrrha slept barefoot, giving her a chance at escape. Slowly reforming, Weiss was able to get her still somewhat flattened head unstuck from the sole of Pyrrha's foot, although the rest of her body was still reforming, she could at least see now. The massive toes of Pyrrha\u2019s foot clenched and unclenched subtly, slowly wiggling in her sleep, Weiss had gotten a singular arm free and was trying hard to push herself off of the foot, unaware that the movement of the huntress\u2019s feet was slowly speeding up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nstill unconscious, Pyrrha\u2019s body had felt a disturbance on her foot, like a bug crawling up it, subtly tickling her, slowly moving the opposite foot over to try and scratch at it, which of course, Weiss was unaware of, until it was already too late, the heiress screamed as Pyrrha\u2019s opposite foot came from behind her, the huntresses toes squishing Weiss even more into the foot, undoing some of her progress, before retreating slowly, satisfied with its itch. With what just happened still in mind, Weiss knew she would have to be more subtle with her escape, even Pyrrha's unconscious body was out to get her, so she continued to try to reform off the foot, but did so slowly, so that she would not disturb the giant huntress once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what had felt like ages, the bug-sized girl had gotten the majority of her body reformed, and some of her body unstuck from the sweaty foot.  With only her waist and legs to go, Weiss tried her best to reform as slowly as possible, as to not impede all her progress once more by causing another itch or tickle sensation for Pyrrha. Although, this choice of Weiss\u2019 to take her time meant that\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn\u2019t disturbed the giant huntress, and would unstick from the sole safely (has to now escape the dorm)<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sure you don\u2019t want to join?\u201d Slinging her towel over her shoulder and wearing an easy smile, Pyrrha raised one eyebrow at her teammate in question as she slowly shifted her weight from foot to foot. The workout in the gym had done a good job of getting her adrenaline going, and now she was ready to really begin her workout. Classes had kept her from getting through her usual routine as of late, and she was looking forward to rectifying that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora meanwhile just laughed at the offer, waving off her friend with a lazy movement of her hand. \u201cNo no, the track\u2019s all yours. Seriously Pyrrha, your stamina is super crazy.\u201d The smaller redhead was known as being a near endless ball of energy but this was one area in which her teammate definitely surpassed her. Really, she was pretty sure she and the guys could run a relay of the track while Pyrrha did the whole thing solo and she\u2019d still have the most energy left at the end of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar below, Weiss had no idea what was going on. All she knew was that she was stuck in a hot and musky world of pressure and sweat, which only got worse as Pyrrha left the locker room and headed outside. Each time the redhead\u2019s right foot came down the heiress was smashed into paste beneath the relentless sole, pressed deeply into the moist flesh as all of the girl\u2019s considerable weight shifted to that foot, and twisted tortuously each time she went to step off. The fibres of the sock at her back felt like they were already adhering to her body as sweat soaked through anything and everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet all of that was only the preview as Pyrrha wandered outside and broke into a jog. For Weiss there was no warning as her friend\u2019s foot rose into the air once more, only to crash down with much greater force. If the force of the redhead\u2019s footsteps had been enough to reduce her to paste before, the force of the jog was enough to smash her into a truly two dimensional object. As Pyrrha picked up speed the sole bombardment became a near constant wave of crushing feet, one step blurring into the next until the smeared fencer could no longer even tell if there were any gaps at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to get in as good a workout as possible, Pyrrha quickly headed to the edge of the academy grounds, coming dangerously close to the edge of the cliff before pivoting on the ball of her right foot and starting a complete circuit of the grounds. The path around the edge of the academy was not entirely cleared, but that just gave her a chance to practice her footing as she side-stepped or leapt over the occasional obstacle, never stumbling even as her sweaty feet slid around within the increasingly spongy interior of her shoes. In no time at all Beacon\u2019s buildings came back into view, as she skirted around the exterior and headed towards the docks on the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the redhead reached the docks and started on the second half of her circuit the tiny heiress beneath her right foot had been reduced to a barely distinguishable smear of tortured flesh practically ironed into the sole. The rough texture of the soaked sock at her back ensured that Weiss was constantly covered in a thick coating of sweat and grime, even as more sweat flowed from the pours of Pyrrha\u2019s feet, soaking directly into her flattened body. The heat of the foot was enough to burn her sensitive skin, turning the tiny girl the same pinkish red as the flesh of the overexerted feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery one of Weiss\u2019s senses was dominated by the entirety of Pyrrha. Her vision was utterly obscured by the massive foot above. Her hearing was consumed by booming explosions. All she could feel was the agony of each crushing step and all she could taste was the horrid texture of the sweat being forced inexorably down her crushed throat. Perhaps worse of all, the combined stench of the foot, sock and shoe had engrained itself so deeply in her nostrils she was sure it would never leave even if, by some miracle, she was eventually able to escape this endless hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis constant torment continued for over two hours as Pyrrha returned to her starting position and kept going, feeling like she could get in a few good laps before calling it a day. She was in the zone now, her legs moving in a constant even rhythm and her feet pounding away, driving her forward with impressive speed as her powerful aura boosted the strength of her well-muscled legs. Had she any idea what she was doing to Weiss she would have stopped long ago, but as it was her only clue to the crushed girl\u2019s presence was that her right foot felt slightly more comfortable than her left. Like there was a little more springiness to the insole of that shoe. Subconsciously, she shifted more of her weight to that side each time she turned, the ball of her right foot digging into the moist insole just a little bit deeper each time she took a step, wearing down the thin fabric of the well-used sock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree full laps later, the redhead finally redirected her course to take her back to the courtyard, doing a few quick cool down stretches before dropping heavily onto a stone bench and pulling out her scroll to check the time. Frowning slightly at the burning sensation in her feet, Pyrrha set her scroll aside momentarily to reach down and remove her shoes, smiling in contentment as her feet started to cool off while pointedly keeping her nose as far away from them as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggling for a moment to catch her breath, Pyrrha glanced down at her socked feet before\u2026</span></div></div>",

Her entire body was tired and sore at this point, but her feet were a particular point of concern, having taken a majority of the beating dished out by her workout. Not counting Weiss of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContemplating for a moment, and admittedly somewhat concerned at the potential smell and feel of the utterly soaked socks, the amazonian beauty eventually decided to bite the bullet and reached down to grab her own feet, pulling them up onto the bench and resting them on their heels as she started to massage the aching soles. Pushing through the socks, her powerful fingers dug deeply into her flesh, travelling across the moist feet yet paying the most attention to a few spots of tension and pleasure both. The ball of her right foot in particular giving her a pleasant sensation as she dug her fingers into the tender flesh, pressing as deeply as possible as she rubbed soothing circles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no means of defending herself from the unexpected and invisible assault, Weiss\u2019s short reprieve from the crushing weight of her friend\u2019s jog was ended with a new wave of pain as the redhead\u2019s fingers compressed her between the moist sock at her back and the somehow even sweatier foot at her front. One finger in particular found the back of the heiress\u2019s head with an unerring accuracy, pressing her face deeper against Pyrrha\u2019s sole and shifting it around all across the sole, smearing the already completely flattened girl all the worse across the sweaty expanse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHigh above, Pyrrha sighed in bliss as the soreness in her feet finally began to dissipate, allowing her more time to focus on the more pleasurable aspects of the massage. That pleasant little kink on her right sole in particular drove her to really try to knead it into her flesh, neither knowing nor caring what the source of the feeling was, only that it was making her feel nice and refreshed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to get both feet at once, Pyrrha retracted her fingers and opted to bring her feet together directly, rubbing her soles against each other as she slid them back and forth. For Weiss this meant being entombed between both sweaty soles and being instantly bombarded with the full force of her unintentional torturer\u2019s foot stench. The friction of the shifting feet quickly multiplied the heat surrounding her and ensured that if she wasn\u2019t ironed on before, she definitely was now. To make matters worse, it seemed that Pyrrha still hadn\u2019t forgotten that sweat spot on her sole, and the toes on her left foot began to forcibly scrub against the heiress\u2019s location with each pass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point any hope Weiss may once have had was thoroughly scrubbed out of her, flowing away into the redhead\u2019s sweat and soaking into the soiled sock below. Body and mind utterly broken she couldn\u2019t even muster the energy to weep anymore, her only possible salvation that she would be given the opportunity to drift into blissful unconsciousness. Yet as Pyrrha\u2019s big toe ground into her back and another wave of sweat was forced down her throat, the searing pain and horrid taste was enough to keep her trapped in the waking nightmare that her life had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes passed as Pyrrha tended to her soles, alternating between rubbing them together and directly massaging with her fingers and toes. Really she could have kept doing this forever, but she was starting to get some concerned looks from passing students and her team were probably waiting for her to return, so with a heavy sigh she reluctantly returned her feet to the warm embrace of her shoes and headed back towards the dorms with her tiny friend in tow.</span></div></div>",

Weiss\u2019 eyes were burning from what seems to be the endless source of sweat that is Pyrrha\u2019s foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha finally made it to the dorms and stripped down in preparation to take a long hot bath. As Pyrrha peeled her sock off the foot that Weiss was stuck to. After awhile of soaking, Pyrrha got the surprise of a life time as Weiss immediately grew back to her normal size and joined her in the bathtub. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god, Weiss where did you come from, and why do you smell so bad\u201d??!!! Pyrrha yelled in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long story but since you asked. I was working on experimental dust. When I was shrunk to the size of a bug. Then I was almost stepped on by Ruby. Then when I tried to get Yangs attention, I got stuck in her hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I was flung off her hair across the gym and onto the yoga mats where I was stepped on by you and was stuck to the bottom of your foot. I was force to drink your foot sweat while you were crushing me under your sweaty foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was stuck in your shoes for your run and was absolutely obliterated by your sweaty foot. Then you massaged me even deeper in your foot. And now I\u2019m in a bathtub with you and both of us are naked\u201d. Weiss said with one breath after spending a few minutes greedily sucking in the first fresh air she had for a while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god, I\u2019m so so so fucking sorry\u201d. Pyrrha said on the verge of tears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuiet, if you want me to forgive you, let me finish taking this bath with you, help me get this stench off of me, and never speak a word of this to anyone\u201d. Weiss said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk\u201d. Pyrrha said, she wouldn\u2019t want to say what she unknowingly did to Weiss to anyone anyway.</span></div></div>",

The logical part of her mind told her that a human body squishing like that was impossible, even as she could feel the intensely odd sensation of her body slowing popping back into shape. But then again, humans weren\u2019t meant to shrink like this either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot being dead was a blessing, yet Weiss couldn\u2019t help but tremble slightly as she forced herself back up to her feet, still staring vacantly ahead. If she could be crushed so easily, reduced to nothing more than a smear in an instant, how could she ever hope to get help from these uncaring giants?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, at the heiress\u2019s greatly reduced size, standing still while staring vacantly ahead was not without its consequences. From Weiss\u2019s perspective she had just barely noticed the darkening of her surroundings when a colossal force collided with her back, tipping her forward and face down on the mat as the unknown foot came crashing down upon her. In an instant the tiny girl was returned to the same hell she had just experienced under Pyrrha, forced deep into the surface of the mat by the sweaty foot of her new tormentor, then twisted and smeared as the foot lifted off again, leaving her face down and squashed in a temporary footprint and a small puddle of sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHigh above, Arslan took her next step without a care, completely oblivious to Weiss\u2019s crushed form as her teammate Reese followed in her footsteps, the skater girl raising her own foot over the tiny heiress and casually bringing it down to crush her even further into the mat, leaving behind a new footprint and another pool of sweat. Like most of the visiting students the girls of team ABRN were looking to keep themselves in top shape for the upcoming Vytal Tournament, and had little time to concern themselves with some insignificant bug beneath their feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning as her body slowly started to pop back, Weiss tried her best to ignore the foot sweat soaking into her skin and the smell now deeply ingrained in her nostrils. Limbs partially reformed, she started to crawl towards the edge of the mat and a hopeful reprieve from yet more footsteps. If nothing else, the successive footfalls of Team ABRN had broken her from her stupor and reminded her that there may well be worse things awaiting her than she had yet experienced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMotivation alone though, was not enough to secure her safety. The shrunken student hadn\u2019t even managed to move a foot before the next foot fell upon her, catching her beneath the crushing heel and giving her a good twist as the unseen owner stepped off. Trembling in pain, she tried to crawl forward once again, desperately seeking salvation only to be crushed beneath the big toe of yet another oblivious girl, a tiny squishable bug in a thoroughly uncaring world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat followed was a successive wave of crushing steps as student after student stomped down on the defenceless heiress, allowing her barely any opportunities to escape as dozens of girls trampled her into oblivion. Though most were barefoot on the mats, some donned socks or tights and others were still wearing their shoes as they squished the little heiress. On several occasions Weiss was almost taken along for the ride with one girl or another, nearly caught in the fibres of a sock or the treads of a boot, or just partially adhered to a particularly sweaty sole. A couple of times she actually did get taken along for a step or two, only to get left behind in a further footprint, undoing any progress she had made towards the edge of the mat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow utterly soaked in sweat and a twisted broken wreck, Weiss sobbed openly as she dragged her malleable body forward with a single partially reformed arm. Weakly lifting her head as she finally started to near the questionable safety of the mat\u2019s edge, two distant but rapidly closing figures appeared before her unfocused vision, gradually resolving into the approaching forms of her teammates, having now changed into their gym clothes and ready to begin their exercise routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever the least bit shy about her body or afraid to flaunt it, Yang had opted for a bright yellow sports bra and dark grey bike shorts that left nothing to the imagination. The more conservative Blake had donned an all black outfit of skin-tight yoga pants and loose exercise singlet, the straps of her own sports bra visible under the singlet\u2019s straps. Ready to hit the mats, both girls were barefoot, and still blissfully unaware of the torment they had accidentally left their teammate to suffer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her part, Weiss did her best to signal for help, peeling her upper body from the mat and waving with both arms while yelling with a voice course from tears. Yet from the get-go she knew it would be hopeless, and as Yang\u2019s right heel filled the sky above her all she could give was a soft sigh of resignation as she braced for the inevitable impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver playful, the massive blonde didn\u2019t disappoint, the slight skip to her step bringing her heel down with the greatest force Weiss had yet experienced and instantly flattening the heiress into a gummy lump of what was now thoroughly grimy and sweat-soaked flesh adorned only in the tattered rags of her formerly immaculate clothes. As the brawler stepped off, the tiny girl\u2019s body was momentarily stretched between the mat and the rising heel, the sweat and grime of Yang\u2019s foot attempting to claim her as its own but losing the battle at the last moment as Weiss snapped back to the mat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere would be no chance to catch her breath for Weiss however, as Blake\u2019s left foot instantly replaced Yang\u2019s, the heel landing behind the heiress as the rest of the foot descended rapidly. For a moment she had a slim hope that the foot would fall short but instead the Faunus\u2019s toes fell upon her, her tiny body squeezed into the gap between the second and third toe and thoroughly smeared with hours of accumulated toejam. As the heel lifted away the toes pressed down with greater force, the larger girl\u2019s catlike grace leading her to push her toes deeply into the mat as she propelled herself forward after her rambunctious partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally lifting her foot completely, Blake continued on towards the center of the mat, looking for a good spot to do some stretches and basic workouts with Yang before moving on to the rest of the gym, all the while unaware of the cruel fate she had inflicted upon Weiss, who had been\u2026</span></div></div>",

Barely a second later the foot came down again with punishing force, firmly cementing the unfortunate heiress into her giant teammate\u2019s toe crevice as the slender digits happily ate her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp above Blake just kept walking, paying no mind to what to her was nothing more than another piece of dirt or lint added to the already substantial collection of detritus between her toes. Subconsciously she allowed her toes to shift around their new playmate, rolling her friend\u2019s defenceless body into a small ball utterly covered in toejam and other grime that was being rhythmically squeezed and flattened between its unforgiving captors. Each new step flattened Weiss further, smearing her tortured body across the crevice of the Faunus\u2019 toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter nearly a dozen torturous footfalls the partners finally stopped near the center of the mat, Yang quickly moving to stretch her arms as Blake worked out a kink in her back, mewling lightly at the pleasant sensation and casually shifting her toes against the mat. The mat here was spongy enough to fill the gaps between the girl\u2019s toes as she scrapped them against the cushioned surface, unmindful of the slight smudges of sweat and grime she left in their wake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Weiss, her experience between Blake\u2019s toes had seemed like it lasted an eternity, her body reduced to a mangled mess scrapped from between her friend\u2019s toes and left twitching on the mat. The Faunus\u2019 toejam was now caked over her entire body, obscuring her porcelain skin, and the smell of the bigger girl\u2019s feet felt like it would never leave her. Whereas previously her body had started to reform as soon as the pressure released, this time it needed time to recover first and the shrunken student was left completely defenceless as a shadow once again fell upon her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a step closer to her partner, Yang was blissfully oblivious to her tiny teammate as the poor girl disappeared beneath her weight, trapped right at the centre of the blonde\u2019s sole. Under ordinary circumstances this position would have been an improvement over some of Weiss\u2019s previous torments, but unfortunately her curvaceous teammate chose this moment to start warming up the muscles of her thighs, lifted one leg high into the air while grinding the other down deeper into the mat. Of course, it wasn\u2019t the foot over Weiss that had lifted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow compressed under Yang\u2019s entire weight, the tiny girl wanted to scream but couldn\u2019t even summon the strength to do that. Though she had experienced the full weight of her crushers before when they had stepped upon her that had lasted only a moment, whereas now the weight of the blonde continued to press down on her with an unrelenting fury. The sweat and the heat of the giant foot bore down upon her, functioning much like an iron as it pressed her ever deeper into the mat. Eventually the mat could sink no further and there was nothing left to lessen the force that seemed intent on reducing Weiss to nothing more than a two dimensional sticker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis torture continued for a full ten seconds before Yang finally took a step back and switched legs, leaving behind an imprint that would take several moments to reform and a now entirely indistinguishable smear of sweat and toejam that had once been a fellow member of team RWBY.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point Weiss fully expected to be crushed once more underfoot as the partners shifted above her, and as a new shadow obscured her vision she resigned herself to her fate, only to feel confusion as the shape of a hand, not a foot, came into focus. For a moment, hope blossomed in the heiress\u2019s flattened chest. Hope that she had been seen, that she would be rescued. But that hope was destroyed along with her body as the hand failed to slow and came down on her with crushing force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly bending backwards to place her hands flat on the mat, Blake gradually, carefully, propelled herself up into a slow-motion handstand, stretching out every link kink in her back and sides as she did so. The muscles of her core protested as one leg and then the other lifted, leaving her abdominal muscles to carry the full weight of her lower body as her hands clenched down hard and she straightened her now completely upside body so that her feet pointed at the ceiling. Next to her Yang gave a low whistle, complementing the Faunus\u2019 impressive flexibility and strength as she lifted one hand and held it behind her back, now supported entirely on the strength of one splayed hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding herself for the first time under something other than a foot, Weiss glumly noted that there really wasn\u2019t much of a difference. Blake\u2019s hand was cleaner than her foot had been but was still unpleasantly moist with perspiration and the weight of her body was cramming the tiny student into the lines of the palm with tremendous force. The weight momentarily decreased as the larger girl returned her other hand to the mat only to immediately multiply as Blake pushed down and then propelled herself into the air. Mostly obscured with toejam and grime, Weiss could only look on in horror as her teammate performed a half-somersault and crashed down upon her with both feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClapping merrily at her partner\u2019s display Yang stepped forward with a happy laugh and playfully lifted the Faunus into the air, ignoring Blake\u2019s grumbled protests. Neither girl noticed the now thoroughly smeared Weiss revealed in the chasm left by the brunette\u2019s feet as she was lifted, who promptly disappeared once again as the blonde took a half-step forward and caught the thoroughly unfortunate heiress beneath her toes. Still holding her partner aloft, the brawler casually shifted her weight forward on her feet and hoisted Blake up to shoulder height, unknowingly driving the defenceless body of her friend deep between the digits of her right foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough somewhat annoyed at the exuberant girl\u2019s actions, Blake still spared her partner a small fond smile. \u201cI appreciate your enthusiasm Yang. But if you wouldn\u2019t mind I\u2019d prefer to be on the ground.\u201d The taller girl laughed in response and spun her friend around for good measure, pivoting on the toes of her right foot before stepping forward and obediently returning her to her own two feet. \u201cHeh, sorry about that partner. You were so awesome though. I\u2019ll never be that flexible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two partners continued their playful banter Weiss was left behind, now more squished than ever thanks to being twisted around beneath Yang\u2019s toes as the larger girl had spun around. Her clothes had been all but destroyed, she was covered from head to toe in sweat and grime and every part of her body had been mangled beyond human recognition. The smell of her teammate\u2019s feet had not only invaded her nostrils but seemingly her whole body as well. She could taste their feet at this point, even when they were no longer standing on her and her entire body was unpleasantly warm from the residual heat. Worse of all though was the excruciating agony as her thoroughly mashed body struggle desperately to reform, to escape from the oblivious titans above her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point Weiss just wanted it all to end. Even if it meant her death she just wanted to be released from this torment. And yet, staring up at the ceiling, her view was inevitably filled by\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was as if the whole of the sky was falling upon her, or perhaps as if the moon, shattered as it may be, was falling from orbit. Yang\u2019s amble posterior was straining at the tight confines of her bike shorts as it raced towards the ground, zeroing in on the tiny heiress with pin-point accuracy. Despite the torment she had already been through this new massive threat made Weiss want to scream, to run, to get away more than anything, but there was nothing her twisted form could do as the ass came down with colossal force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Yang she was merely taking a seat to continue her stretches, her broken teammate offering no resistance as her left ass cheek claimed the poor girl as nothing more than a bit of extra padding for its seat. Behind her Blake took a seat as well, pressing her back up against the blonde\u2019s and bringing their buttocks together so that they could use each other as support. The feeling of her partner pressing up against her caused Yang to instinctively squirm slightly in place, unknowingly smearing Weiss further beneath her rear as it twisted around and grinded into the mat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeneath the brawler, a part of Weiss was trying to work out if this was better or worse than being crushed underfoot, though the rest of her was more focused on the excruciating pain and burning heat as she was crushed beneath her teammate\u2019s butt. It was certainly a softer kind of hell than the one she had experienced underfoot, but that just meant she was being suffocated as well as being squished into oblivion. The pain only became worse as Yang began to stretch in earnest, twisting her hips all over the place as she worked her muscles over. Beneath her shifting mass the tiny fencer was being rolled around like a lost piece of gum, sliding all over the massive ass cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn several occasions Weiss felt as if she was about to become permanently adhered to her friend\u2019s bulbous butt, small parts of her body becoming adhered to the sweaty shorts or pinched between the loose fibres. But in each instance a further shift saw her grinded off onto the mat again, only to be picked up by yet another part of the rear that was quickly becoming her entire world. To make matters worse the friction of Yang\u2019s movements was raising the heat to a truly unbearable level, to the point where her tiny roommate felt almost like she was going to melt away into nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt one point Yang slide far enough forward that the little heiress was temporarily freed, rolling out from beneath the blonde. Her freedom was short-lived however, as the sudden movement of her partner saw Blake shift back as well, and Weiss quickly disappeared beneath the Faunus\u2019s right buttock in nearly the same instant that she had appeared. The skin tight yoga pants containing the girl\u2019s firm buttocks did nothing to reduce the heat and sweat that poured onto the already thoroughly soaked Weiss. As the two partners shifted back to their original position, the tiny heiress was brought along under Blake\u2019s ass, now nearly completely flattened to the girl\u2019s pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinished with her starting stretches, the Faunus casually leaned forward at the waist to touch her toes, shifting her body into a nearly ninety degree bend. This movement shifted her butt upwards so that the part that Weiss was currently stuck to lifted off the ground, rubbing along the upper part of Yang\u2019s buttocks instead and effectively sandwiching her friend between their cheeks. The pressure only became worse as the brawler bent down to copy her partner\u2019s movements, rubbing her own butt against Blake\u2019s and in the process subjecting the shrunken student to the worse force she had yet experienced. Playful as ever Yang couldn\u2019t resist vibrating her hips slightly in the process and laughed happily as the other girl responded with little more than a teasing rebuke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss would have screamed if her mouth wasn\u2019t crammed shut by the weight of one booty or another. Stuck between Yang\u2019s left buttock and Blake\u2019s right she was being pummelled into oblivion as slight shifts in her teammates\u2019 saw her being twisted around and rubbed face first against each cheek in turn, coating her completely in their accumulated ass sweat before rolling and crushing her so thoroughly that she could no longer even tell what way she was facing anymore. The force imposed by each cheek would vary depending on which way the partners were stretching, but that just left her to be buried ever deeper into the pillowy masses as the opposing cheek would inevitably push its advantage over its temporarily weakened foe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInevitably the two girls eventually returned to an upright position, but by then Weiss had been thoroughly ground up between their rears, now nothing more than a grimy smear still trapped between their sweaty posteriors. The heiress no longer even had the presence of mind to protest as another shift in her captors saw her rolled into Blake\u2019s crack, the stale stench of sweat magnified several times over within the dark expanse. At first the pressure here was relatively light, but then the Faunus clenched up as she leaned back across Yang to stretch her back and the tiny fencer was introduced to a whole new concept of force as the mighty buttocks clamped down on her with what should easily have been a bone-crushing embrace but instead reduced her to a flat gummy disk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove, Blake held her position for several long seconds before dropping back to the floor and unclenching her butt, not noticing as Weiss\u2019s paper thin form drifted free and back between her and Yang. For the next few minutes the two partners continued their stretches, neither noticing as the tiny heiress was continually squashed, squished and mashed between their shifting buttocks. On more than a few occasions Weiss continued to come within moments of being permanently stuck to one girl or the other, disappearing under an ass cheek or into a sweaty crack only to emerge just in time to be introduced to yet another potential prison. In one instance she was almost tipped over the lip of Yang\u2019s shorts and between her bare cheeks, only to be saved at the very last moment by yet another shift from the blonde herself that saw her smashed beneath an ass cheek instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, however, the teammates had exhausted their warmup and were ready to hit the gym in earnest for what promised to be a long and tiring exercise routine. Climbing back to their feet, the two girls took a moment to work out their last few sore spots before striding off towards the aerobic equipment on the other side of the gym, still blissfully unaware of the tiny heiress\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The tiny ice queen weakly sighed as Yang slowly stood up, the tiny 'sticker' on her shorts barely held on in her accent. Weiss almost thanked her unaware friend until she saw Blake doing the same, her tight yoga pants stretched outwards as the cat girl started to stand, sending a wave of heat over the flattened sticker just as she fell loose from Yangs grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to struggle or even yell, Weiss uncerimoniously tumbled into the exposed the exposed crack before Blake tugged the tight legware back into position. The Faunus  large cheeks quickly clamped down on the unfortunate tiny- embedding her in the swampy hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummoning up all her energy, Weiss tried to yell, complain or even wiggle, but she was too battered and there was no room to reform. She could only grimace as one wall slid upwards, the other down, stretching her thin before moving the other way, almost folding her up. The musky smell rose up as the walls quickly moved faster, grinding her against eachother- the cheeks too sweaty for her to stick to one of them as she was maneuvered deeper into the abyss, her fingers unable to grab anything to stop her decent as she floundered in the larger girls pants. <br>\r\n\"B-Blake-!\" Weiss just barely managed to squeeze out after some miraculous reforming before being rechewed once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake followed her bouncy friend cautiously through the busy gym, trying her best to ignore her frictionless cheeks sliding effortlessly together with every step before locking onto Yangs voice.<br>\r\n\"Yo- hows the oxygen over there?\" Yang jabbed, taking Blake back into her comfort zone, \"...beeecaaause- you seem to be really 'spacing' out over there! Eh--? Ehh-?\" The blond girl smirked as she saw a cringe induced smile from Blake before hopping onto a stair climber.<br>\r\n\"That's... not your worst joke-\" Blake spoke, rolling her eyes as she stepped onto her own machine, pushing buttons casually without realising what she was about to do to Weiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss slopped down into the tight crevice as the movement finally stopped, her body felt like it had melted with the overwhelming heat and friction- with everything going on she could almost ignore the smell. 'Positive thoughts-' Weiss growled in her mind, almost managing to role her eyes in sarcasm towards her own mind before attempting to bite, naw or wriggle in an attempt to get the giant girls attention. Knowing she didn't have the strength to escape her tight prison and not knowing how long she would be trapped, it was the best that she could do. The tiny prisoner was certain she wasn't just trapped in the tight yoga pants, but also in the owners panties. She shuddered as she thought about being stuck here forever- bringing up a well of new found strength that was about to be destroyed in a press of a button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boop-!\" Yang spoke, starting her own machine, catching a quick grin from Blake before Blake herself pressed her own button,<br>\r\n\"Boop...\" The black cat spoke- rolling her eyes towards her ever joking friend. Not wanting to get her underwear in the way and not bothering to wear a thong, Blake casually tugged her underwear into a comfortable wedgie before taking her first step of many. She exhaled slowly as she pulverized her teammate between her large cheeks in an attempt to keep in shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExpecting movement, the tiny girl braced herself only to feel herself get rocketed forward into a new space. Her body contorted to tighter space right when the walls began its grinding motion again, this time going for longer and harder strides. Weiss couldn't even moan as she was stretched, compacted and rolled between the abrasive cheeks, the abnormal heat quickly increasing as fresh sweat started to come in to replace the old. Unable to do anything she simply accepted her fate under Blakes rear- weakly hoping for a chance to escape after this torment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 10 minutes on the exercise machine, the two girls clicked cooldown- barely panting yet still sweating as they slowed down their strides to a grind.<br>\r\n\"Bikes after this?\" Blake asked, glancing towards Yang who gave a shrug,<br>\r\n\"Eh- I was going to to bicep curls, these bad boys don't get this buff themself- whoo shaaa-!\" The blond power house mocked a bodybuilder pose with her arms as her legs continued to slow. \"I'll do them next to you though if you want to do the bike- there's a bike free near to the mats from the look of it-\" Yang nodded towards the mats right as the cooldown finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the movement changed, the tiny splatter felt relief but also fear as the walking began again. It was still a welcome break from the previous endeavour, she could only hope that was the end of the gym session but she knew in her heart it had just started. Her fears were realised as the cheeks parted completely, letting her fall slightly towards freedom before the bike seat compacted the cheeks harshly together once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake rode harshly on her bike after setting her time for 20 minutes, her cheeks obliterating the unrecognisable mess that was originally Weiss as she went through her routine. Chatting casually to eachother, the two huntresses enjoyed the gym session trying out different machines that mashed up their unwilling sweat rag more and more before eventually calling it a day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweat dripped from Blakes face as she drank the last of her water before patting down the sweat with her gym towel. She barely panted as her well trained body quickly started to recover from its usual session.<br>\r\n\"Good hustle-!\" Yang chirped- slapping Blakes rear without thinking about what could of lay inside the swamped out hell hole, <br>\r\n\"Every gym session?\" Blake sighed, giving a weak smile as Yang winked back,<br>\r\n\"Every gym session requires a butt slap and 'Good hustle-!'\" Chirped the powerhouse, before she lead the way into the changing rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake hung back for a second, wiggling her hips back and forth with discomfort as it felt like they were sliding together more easily then usual.<br>\r\n\"Gross-\" The faunus winced, coming to the wrong conclusion before pounding after her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChewed up, grossed out and spirit beaten, the puddle in the brunettes tight underwear sloshed around without fight- miraculously regaining conciousness again after blacking out for a few minutes. Her seemingly indestructible body yanking her back to reality as she felt the girl move again- a tiny flair of hope entering her ironed out body as she imagined the gym session being over- before slowly fearing another section of the routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckly for Weiss- light eventually shone through as Blake began to remove her clothes. The mashed up ice queen flooded with relief before struggling to escape-</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Unfortunately for Weiss her nearly liquefied body failed to slip free as Blake quickly rid herself of her clothing and stepped into the shower. It was hard for the heiress to get her head around how things had ended up like this, or how she was even still alive in this situation. Just a few hours ago she\u2019d been perfectly fine, and now she\u2019d been reduced to nothing more than a tortured smear of flesh buried deep within the ass of one of her best friends. Her world had been reduced to one of blind darkness, endless pain, overflowing sweat and the atrocious smell of the brunette\u2019s ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to Weiss\u2019s fate, Blake glanced around for a moment to make sure she and Yang were by themselves before reaching up and removing her bow, setting it down with her clothes as she stepped into the nearest shower stall and reached to turn on the water. The semi-opaque walls allowed her to see just enough of her partner\u2019s outline to know the blonde was in the stall beside hers and already starting to wring the sweat from her long hair. Smirking slightly at the predictable behaviour, the brunette took a moment herself to just enjoy the feeling of the warm water running across her lithe form before reaching out to grab a nearby bar of soap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe problem with having such a great posterior was that sweat and grime had a habit of being drawn into the endless abyss of Blake\u2019s crack, pooling between the cheeks to produce a truly horrid concoction that left the Faunus grimacing deeply at the slick feeling of her buttocks sliding against one another. For some reason today it felt even worse than usual, her substantial booty sliding all over the place as she shifted her hips in a futile attempt to gain some form of traction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to take it any longer, Blake figured there was only one thing to do and plunged both the soap and her own hand between her firm buttocks, shuddering at the feeling but pushing through it to thoroughly lather the entirety of her crack with an enthusiasm that she usually reserved for combat. Not wanting to miss anything, she made sure to massage every inch, oblivious to her unwilling passenger as she subjected the tiny heiress to another round of hellish torment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Weiss\u2019s perspective a sliver of light had pierced her tomb, only to be replaced by an unseen crushing force as Blake rammed the soap directly into the fencer\u2019s body. Though she could not see what it was that was attacking her she could feel a burning sensation as the suds soaked into her exposed skin, which quickly faded into obscurity as she was faced with the far worse experience of being rubbed all across the Faunus\u2019s crack as she was carried along with the soap. The sweat and grime that had previously surrounded her was now being scrubbed into her very body, soaking into her hair and skin alike as she sank deeper and deeper into the increasingly soiled soap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake spent a good couple of minutes thoroughly lathering her ass before finally pulling the soap free, sighing in relief as she noted that the odd slickness had finally disappeared. To the heiress her first direct exposure to light in over an hour left her momentarily disoriented, struggling to think of where she was and what could have happened. She could barely see through the grime and suds that caked her body but the white texture of her surroundings was a clear enough clue to reveal her fate. Not that that knowledge did her any good as her friend\u2019s armpit loomed large in her vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlad to have rid herself of her earlier unpleasantness, Blake dutifully returned to cleaning the rest of her body, taking a few moments to ensure that the build-up of sweat in her armpits was properly cleaned out before proceeding to rub her soap and its unfortunate passenger all over her form. Her legs and arms were simple enough and just a bit of scrubbing was enough to free the grime from between her toes. Her abs, back and the exterior of her rear were similarly easy jobs, allowing the Faunus girl to take a bit of extra time to focus on cleaning her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrushed worse than ever and covered in a fresh layer of sweat and suds, Weiss could only wonder at the symbolism of Blake quite literally, if unintentionally, shoving her larger chest in the tiny girl\u2019s face as she was rubbed over, under and between the brunette\u2019s boobs. Sweat and grime had built up across the cleavage and underboobs throughout the Faunus\u2019s intense workout and was now being obliviously transferred to Weiss\u2019s already thoroughly soiled and twisted body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally decided she had spread a sufficient amount of suds, Blake went to return the soap to its holder, giving the shrunken heiress her first chance of freedom in far too long before that chance was threatened by the voice of the devil in the next stall. \u201cHey Blakey. I\u2019ve run out of soap, can I borrow yours?\u201d And then crushed entirely by the response of her captor. \u201cSure. Here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was nothing Weiss could do as her prison was casually tossed across the shower divide, her swimming vision allowing only scant view of the naked blonde as the flying soap was snatched from the air and plunged straight into her teammate\u2019s rank armpits. Having focused more on her upper body than Blake, the brawler\u2019s armpits were on a whole different level than her partner\u2019s, smearing a thick layer of sweat and grime over the defenceless heiress. Wanting to make sure she was properly clean, the massive girl spent far longer cleaning her armpits than the Faunus had, though she had much more in store than just that for her newly acquired victim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompletely oblivious to her crushed companion, Yang casually moved the soap down across her hard abs and around to clean her toned butt, thankfully taking only a moment or two to dip the soap between the cheeks before moving on to give her limbs a quick and relatively painless lather. All that was just the lead up however, as Weiss\u2019s vision was utterly dominated by the endless expanse of the blonde\u2019s boobs, a pitiful whimper escaping her throat as she was plunged into their sweaty embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing used to clean Yang\u2019s chest was so much worse than Blake\u2019s. Not only were they significantly bigger but the brawler\u2019s focus on upper body exercises had ensured that in a similar manner to her partner\u2019s ass, the bodacious girl\u2019s cleavage had become a magnet for the sweat and grime now being generously lathered across Weiss\u2019s already thoroughly soiled form. Like the Faunus before her, Yang took her time cleaning absolutely every inch of her sweatiest body part, giggling happily as her hand, the soap, and its unfortunate passenger, were swallowed up completely by her breasts as she rubbed her underboobs and scrubbed her cleavage with boundless enthusiasm. Unable to resist, she took the chance to tweak her nipples as well, shuddering as she ground the soap against her areola.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several more minutes of torment, the blonde finally felt she was sufficiently clean and pulled the now greatly reduced soap from her cleavage with a wet slurp, tossing it back over the divide to Blake. Despite having no warning of the soap\u2019s arrival, the Faunus\u2019s reflexes were good enough to snatch it out of the air, grimacing at the fresh layer of sweat before shrugging and plunging it back into her ass for one last scrub, feeling that she still wasn\u2019t quite as clean as she could be. Clenching her cheeks and nearly flattened the soap in the process, the brunette freed her hands to finish cleaning her hair and turn off the water before reaching back and retrieving her booty passenger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no further use for the mangled bar of milk and fat, Blake went to return it to the dish from which it had come, sparing only a casual glance at its disfigured surface as she did so.</span></div></div>",

Blake had intended it to just be a casual glance, fuelled only by a passing curiosity, and indeed her eyes had already begun to roam elsewhere before the tan smear she had seen finally registered and brought her gaze snapping back to the well-used soap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smear of Weiss\u2019s body didn\u2019t really look much like anything specific, certainly not the squished form of a human being praying desperately for salvation, but it also looked distinctly unlike something you would expect to see on a bar of soap. If it had just been some random bit of soap then Blake would not have bothered to investigate further, but she was distinctly aware that she\u2019d just rubbed this particular piece of soap all over her body, not to mention her partner\u2019s, and she was more than a little concerned about what may have joined it on its journey or, perhaps even worse, what may have been left behind. Neither scenario filled her with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Yang\u2019s shower shut off as well, Blake raised the soap closer to her face, noting that the tan smear looked pretty much exactly like the colour of flesh, which only made her more confused, since she figured she\u2019d have felt it if she dislodged a chunk of her own skin. A few bits of it looked kind of white as well, but she suspected that it was just bits of the soap itself seeping through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was with no small degree of effort that the Faunus girl managed to work one of her nails under the corner of Weiss\u2019s flattened body, having difficulty differentiating her from the grimy soap below. When she did finally get a grip, she wasted no time ripping the whole thing off like a wet band aid, letting the now useless soap drop to the floor as she lifted this\u2026 thing, whatever it was, to the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Weiss\u2019s perspective, the sight of her teammate\u2019s eyes looking down at her had been like a gift from heaven. Thoroughly drained and traumatised from all that she had been through, she couldn\u2019t even produce the tiniest movement in response, but for the first time in a long time she had hope that she would be saved. Unfortunately, things took a turn for the worse when, by apparently sheer coincidence, Blake started her rescue by peeling off the heiress\u2019s flattened head, and then proceeded to pinch her tortured face between her fingers as she tore the rest of her free, now holding her in the air entirely through the force of her fingers crushing Weiss\u2019s skull. Needless to say, this didn\u2019t do wonders for the tiny girl\u2019s ability to focus or communicate her circumstances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Blake stared at the now slightly quivering mass, Yang stepped over to see what her partner was looking at, unconcerned with her own lack of clothing as she set a hand on the other girl\u2019s shoulder. \u201cFound something?\u201d It didn\u2019t look like much to the blonde, just a bit of gunk squeezed between Blake\u2019s fingers that she could only presume the cat Faunus had pulled from the drain or something. Certainly not something that was worth this kind of attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raven-haired girl shrugged, partially in response, and partially to remove her partner\u2019s hand from her shoulder. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I found it on the soap so I wanted to find out what it was. It kind of seems like its\u2026 moving.\u201d Sure enough, even after such a sustained beating, Weiss\u2019s tortured body was starting to slowly pull itself back together, gradually becoming more three dimensional, though still far from resembling a human as limbs struggled to differentiate themselves from the mass. The fact that what should have been her head was still being crushed flat certainly didn\u2019t help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEqual parts concerned and fascinated, the two larger girls leaned in to get a closer look, Blake\u2019s early attempt at creating distance seemingly forgotten as Yang pressed against her back. Eventually their observation came to an end as [Name] suddenly exclaimed that\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cHey Yang, don\u2019t you think this kind of looks like a tiny person.\u201d She hadn\u2019t really seen it at first, but the longer she watched, the more Blake was able to see the distinct shape of limbs starting to emerge from the original mass of putty that Weiss had been reduced to. The central glob was also starting to become more defined, with hips and shoulders starting to emerge, and what may have been a neck leading to\u2026 ah. Suddenly realising her mistake, the Faunus girl shifted her grip to one of the partially reformed arms, holding it more loosely and allowing the heiress to dangle as the thoroughly squished remains of her head were finally given a chance to reform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Yang leaned in for a closer inspection, Weiss\u2019s senses slowly started to return, her sight and hearing both still blurry as she tried to centre herself, but good enough at least to make out both of her teammates now leaning in extremely close. She was still unable to talk, but she could at least keep her eyes focused on her potential saviours as she willed herself to reform as quickly as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t until the squished head began to gain some definition that Blake finally gasped in recognition, her eyes narrowing to tiny slits as she focused all of her attention on the face that was starting to make itself known, and the slightly-soiled white hair gradually emerging from the mixed gunk. Yang raised an eyebrow at the explanation, and opened her mouth to speak, but was cut off by her partner\u2019s own words. \u201cWait wait, look closely\u2026 doesn\u2019t this remind you of Weiss?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeiss?\u201d Somehow managing to push even closer, and ignoring the low grunt from Blake as her sizeable assets flattened against her partner\u2019s back, Yang peered at the now mostly reformed heiress. She had to admit that, grime and muck notwithstanding, it did look remarkably like their teammate. \u201cI guess, though the Ice Queen would never be caught dead looking like that.\u201d It was rare enough to see the girl with her hair loose, and downright unknown to see her naked like this, even if they did live together. After all, the heiress had always been keen to stay away from any group showers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe static that persisted in her head prevented Weiss from figuring out exactly what the relative giants were talking about, but she could tell that they were discussing her, and knew that now was the best chance she\u2019d had all day to get their attention. Her body was painfully weak after everything she had been through, but she retained enough strength to slowly raise the hand of her unrestrained arm and reach it up to touch Blake\u2019s fingers in a silent plea to be released, moving her head at the same time to face as best she could towards the blurry figures of her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake\u2019s reaction was immediate, gasping loudly as she released the heiress\u2019s arm and quickly reached out to catch her with her other hand, cupping the tiny naked girl in her palm while she looked down in horror. Finally coming around to stand beside her partner, Yang looked equally surprised, though there was an unmistakable glint of interest in her eyes at this new discovery. Mouths opened and closed as words failed to come, both girls lost in their own thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith safety within her reach, Weiss willed herself to sit up and wave her arms in a tired greeting while she forced some air through her crushed throat. \u201cHe-hey. Thanks for finding me.\u201d She really was thankful. Beyond thankful. Despite everything these two had unknowingly put her through, it was nice to know that she could still rely on them to come through for her when she needed them. That said, the barrage of questions that instantly assaulted her was not helpful, and she quickly covered her ears with her hands while curling into a ball for protection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully her companions caught on quickly and quieted down, giving Weiss the chance to uncurl in time for Yang to lean down to get eye to eye with her and quietly ask the most important questions. \u201cWeiss, is that really you? What happened to you? Are you okay? How\u2019d you end up on the soap?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, the tiny girl looked up to meet two pairs of worried eyes, blushing slightly as she realised for the first time that all three of them were naked. If the circumstances were a bit different see would probably have screeched and tried to cover herself, but as it was she quite literally had bigger things to worry about. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s really me Yang, and to be honest I don\u2019t know what happened. I was experimenting with some dust when, well\u2026 this happened.\u201d Weiss gestured to herself vaguely, still unsure of what exactly had gone wrong. \u201cAs for how I am, I\u2019ve been better obviously. But I\u2019m at least thankful to be alive, especially after\u2026 after everything that\u2019s happened so far.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this moment that the white-haired girl found herself at a crossroads. A sudden upwell of anger threatened to cloud her judgement as she remembered everything that had happened to her, and just how much had been caused by these two, accidental or not. They\u2019d made her life hell and she desperately wanted to give them a piece of her mind. But, even then they were still her friends, and she didn\u2019t want to hurt them, not to mention risk angering them at her new tiny scale.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With some degree of effort, Weiss managed to swallow her anger, and commence a calmer explanation of the events that had brought her to this place. She tried as best as she could to explain the dust tests that had led to her shrinking, but she herself still didn\u2019t know exactly what had happened so it was a flawed explanation at best. Her explanation of hitching a ride on Blake\u2019s leg was met with a raised eyebrow from the Faunus in question, subconsciously reaching down to stroke the relevant limb, as if she would find some clue there attached to her bare flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe part of the story covering their trip to the gym resulted in mild amusement, although Yang did at least shoot her a small smile in apology for the troubles caused by her antics. The amusement faded however when she got to the part about being squished by Pyrrha, and expressions shifted to shock as Weiss explained the manner in which she had been trampled by countless girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time their own part in the story came again, the guilt was clearly written across both girls\u2019 faces. They took no joy in hearing of the manner in which they had crushed the tiny girl over and over again beneath their bodies, and Blake looked downright devastated as she learned of the time that Weiss had spent between her cheeks, and the true origin of the slickness she had felt before. The Faunus girl felt horrible for being concerned with her own discomfort as her cheeks had slid together, not knowing that her dear friend was suffering terribly between them the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang felt absolutely shitty as well, realising full well that it was her own rambunctious nature that had seen Weiss thrown to the mats to begin with, and that everything that followed was arguably a direct result of her actions. Not to mention that she had been the first one to sit on the heiress, and had very nearly claimed her for her own ass before she\u2019d slipped into the abyss of Blake\u2019s crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf anything the remorse only became stronger as Weiss got to her experiences with the soap, explaining in excruciating detail her round trip to every significant and sweaty location on her teammate\u2019s bodies and the sheer amount of grime she\u2019s accumulated throughout. Not that they\u2019d really needed a reminder on that last part, since the heiress was still pulling gunk from her hair and arms even as she spoke. By the time she finished the two were visibly on the verge of tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaster than Weiss could react she was scooped up by Yang, and found herself faced with the blonde\u2019s prominent chest just moments before being pressed into the bare flesh. The pressure was soft, and the warmth almost comforting, but the tiny girl couldn\u2019t stop the scarlet blush that covered her face and wanted out of here as soon as possible. Sadly for her, her friends had other ideas as Blake joined the hug as well and Weiss suddenly found herself squished between the chests of the two larger girls. She appreciated the clear intent behind the embrace, but not only was she now embarrassed enough to die, but the pressure and heat were starting to mount as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter nearly a minute of effort, Weiss\u2019s struggles were enough to convince the two partners to separate, with the Faunus reaching up again to secure the tiny heiress and raise her to her face. The look in those yellow eyes was one of apology and guilt, though there were other things swimming in that expression as well, just beyond the grasp of her perception. After taking a moment to consider her next words, Blake eventually spoke, exchanging a look with Yang before advising\u2026</span></div></div>",

Let\u2019s go back to the dorms.\u201d Blake smiled sadly at her friend, trying to express through her eyes just how sorry she really was. Yang was right there behind her, wiping a tear from her eyes as she reached forward to run a finger down her teammate\u2019s back, and while she shivered a bit at the contact on her bare skin, Weiss did appreciate the gesture. Not trusting herself to speak right now, the heiress nodded, in agreement with the Faunus\u2019 plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercifully, the two partners did take the time to get dressed now that a course of action had been decided, the tiny girl being temporarily transferred to the top of one of the lockers while the larger girls pulled on their clothes. The issue of Weiss\u2019s own nakedness was addressed as Yang casually tore a piece of cloth from one of her spare workout shirts and handed it up to her teammate. It wasn\u2019t ideal but the heiress was able to work it into a somewhat functional toga to cover the important bits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce all three were dressed, Weiss was returned to the gentle embrace of Blake\u2019s hands, brought protectively close to her teammate\u2019s body as they headed out into the halls. Wanting to be of help as well, Yang positioned herself to block her shrunken teammate from any wayward eyes, gently advising the traumatised girl that they weren\u2019t going to let anything happen to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Weiss the trip was the most comfortable she\u2019d been ever since this whole fiasco began, though she still couldn\u2019t help but shudder each time they passed another female in the halls. She\u2019d been crushed by so many that she couldn\u2019t help but wonder if these girls were among them, or if fate would be so cruel as to see her beneath them once again. Given everything that had happened so far, it seemed like it was her destiny to suffer at the convenience of other women, those who now sought to protect her included. If they couldn\u2019t find a way to fix this she feared what would become of her? If such torment was to be her fate it would almost be better to just fade away entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sour thoughts of the heiress were only broken when they finally arrived back at their own dorm, the three of them immediately confronted by their young leader, who practically crash tackled Yang as they entered. \u201cYou\u2019re back!\u201d Enthusiastic arms wrapped around the blonde\u2019s waist, pushing her back slightly to bump into Blake and nearly dislodging Weiss from her safe haven. \u201cUgh, you guys\u2026 Weiss never came back the whole time you were gone, and it turns out she left her scroll here as well.\u201d Earnest eyes peered up at her sister. \u201cI\u2019m starting to get worried.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang chuckled, ruffling the younger girl\u2019s hair as she extracted herself from her hold and pushed her back a step. \u201cDon\u2019t worry Ruby. Weiss is fine. We\u2019ve got her right here.\u201d Heeding her partner\u2019s cue, Blake obediently extended out her hands to present the heiress to her leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat neither girl had expected, however, was for Ruby to immediately snatch her partner from their hands with a little giggle, moving too fast for any explanation to be offered. \u201cOhhh, what\u2019s this? It kind of looks like Weiss, but it\u2019s all tiny and squishy.\u201d Before the tiny girl could muster any resistance playful fingers descended, pinching at her skin and stretching her limbs as they probed her body. The bumblebee duo were frozen still with shock, so it was only when Weiss finally managed to struggle enough to be felt that Ruby gasped and dropped her to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing in exasperation, Yang bent down to retrieve the winded and cranky, but otherwise unharmed heiress, this time purposely keeping a more protective grip as Weiss was once again presented to their team leader. \u201cRuby, listen okay. This is really Weiss. We don\u2019t know how but she got shrunk somehow. She\u2019s been through a lot so be nice to her okay.\u201d The younger girl still looked confused but nodded slowly, eyeing her partner up for a moment before muttering an apology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to get into an argument, Weiss just sighed, adjusting her slightly ruffled toga as she did so. \u201cIt\u2019s fine Ruby, just\u2026 be more careful in the future please. I don\u2019t like getting squished.\u201d As the scythe-wielder hadn\u2019t been directly involved in the day\u2019s events she decided a full explanation could wait until later. Right now she just wanted a chance to get some rest. \u201cNow if you all don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d really like a chance to get in some recuperation before we find a way to deal with\u2026 this situation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girls all exchanged a glance, thinking her request over before\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Splattered and beaten, Weiss could only watch her giant friend walk out of the stall with a small hint of relief. Her mashed up body stewed in the sweat and dirt that her teammates had dumped on her for a moment before she heard excited voices approaching. From the open door, she spotted Nora and Pyrrha getting undressed.<br>\r\n\"Wait-\" Weiss tried to speak, her voice not carrying her forward as Pyrrha stepped into the stall. Unlike Blake and Yang- it looked like they had a practice battle, dread filled the tiny 'soaps' mind as she watched the giant red head pick a small twig from her hair before starting the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha happily shifted her glutes from side to side as she waited for the shower to heat up a bit, the enthusiastic voice of Nora chirping over the stall about battling and victory pancakes. Weiss couldn't pay too much attention to the conversation as the giant red heads hand encompassed her vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even thinking about it, the giant warrior rubbed Weiss into the soap, hiding her in suds before dropping the soap back into the dish. Mistaking the stretched out girl as a wash cloth, she was quick to scrub her poor friend into her armpit, giving a satisfied sigh as she felt instant relief. Unaware of Weiss retching in disgust, she moved onto the other armpit to continue the deep clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Weiss- this had managed to become far worse then when she was showering with her friends. Her body would be flossed and stretched around her curvy friends hips before getting plunged into the abyss between her cheeks. The powerful glutes threatened to chew her up as the powerful muscles flexed around her mushy form. The giant girl made sure to go deep, smashing the surprised Weiss up and down until froth from the soap started to drip down her leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss got a moment reprieve as the oblivious girl yanked her free to scrub a bit more soap upon her, Weiss weakly tried to make contact from the girl, seeing that Pyrrha still had a long way to go before she was clean brought new strength to the towel. A voice in the other stall suddenly picked up, breaking Weiss's last chance of getting noticed as her new owner turned away. Weiss just about managed to see the bouncy teammate Nora hop onto the top of the stall, her arms lazily swinging into Pyrrha's stall as her chest compacted against the wall before her vision was blocked out by Pyrrha's sweaty boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Nora beamed a smile towards her showering teammate, \"Mind if I borrow that after you- Nora's got squat over here-\" she almost sang her words while Pyrrha rubbed her underboob with the 'rag'<br>\r\n\"Of course\" Pyrrha spoke, her helpfulness causing a small groan from between her boobs as she threaded Weiss through her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss gave a slight whimper as the grip on her tightened, squeezing out some more soap before scrubbing her into paste, flattening the girl paper thin into the Pyrrha's nipples before slipping over and down through the cleavage once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStretched and battered, the tiny towel could do nothing more as she was slid over the larger girls abs before being battered between her thighs. Her small body acting as a perfect sponge to clean the giant girl as she was worked downwards towards the previously booted feet. Unable to hear the gaggling, Pyrrha hummed a little tune as she slipped her friend between each toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you are-\" Pyrrha called out, scrubbing her neck and face briskly before slapping the 'rag' over the stall. Weiss weakly looked at the excited face of the hammer wielder for a moment before being compacted in her iron grip.<br>\r\n\"Thaaank you~\" Nora called out, instantly noticing the stretchyness of Weiss as she gave a playful yank. As much as it hurt, Weiss had a vague hope that she wouldn't be used, however, Nora simply smiled \"Neat-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remnant's of soap slid under the stall which the hyperactive girl quickly scooped up before using the rest of it on Weiss. Unable to avoid her fate, the white haired girl soon found herself threaded between the powerhouses legs, a hand either side pulled her taunt against the taint. The rich girl shuddered for a moment before Nora raised her hands upwards, cruelly testing the stretchyness while cleaning herself. Nora grinned for a moment as her stretchy toy was pulled taunt over her, her arms struggled to stay up as she admired Weiss's durability before flossing herself down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss was in hell, she was pulled so tight that she made a clear outline of the much bigger girls lower lips, her tastebuds were on fire as she felt her tongue get trapped inside the hyper girl. It was only made worse as she was yanked backwards, tugged through the smaller cheeks and pulled taunt over her puckered anus before sliding back to the front. It seemed to last for an eternity as Nora kept adjusting her floss technique to clean every part of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss felt lightheaded as Nora finally released her, letting her battered body slowly shrink back down as she was dropped onto the floor. Gazing upwards with a shudder, Weiss weakly glared upwards as Nora raised her foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora happily stomped down on her stretchy rag, pinching the parts that were visible and stretching them upwards. Weiss soon found herself pulled taunt against the foot that was ontop her, her cries going unheard as she was once again flossed around the sweaty soles. They were by far the worst feet she had been with today, and that was saying something. She could do nothing about it however as Nora playfully scrubbed her sole before bunching Weiss up again to slid between her constantly wiggling toes. Each toe playfully tugged at Weiss, depositing the day's hard work on her while Nora openly complimented the towels sponginess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost a relief when Nora worked on her legs, abs and arms. Her chest, while still quite large, was thankfully the smallest Weiss had experienced- while the cleavage wasn't there, Nora still managed to make a bad situation worse as she grinded the tiny Weiss into her nipple, admiring the size that it could shrink to compaired to it before stretching Weiss out between them both. <br>\r\n\"This stuff is so cool!\" The hyper hammer girl laughed, treating Weiss like a bra as her hard nipples poked through. Her hands kept Weiss taunt as they went behind her back, shaking her chest slightly before letting the rag go back towards it's 'original' size to scrub her armpits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shower in the other stall turned off as Pyrrha finished with her shower, Nora quickly mashed Weiss into both armpits, sloshing her around while yelling over,<br>\r\n\"This things awesome! We should totally keep it!\" The hammer wielder couldn't hear the screams of disapproval as she rinsed off the Weiss cloth, splashing and scrubbing down her face before turning off the shower. Stretching Weiss over her cheeks, Nora slowly sauntered out with a grin- wandering towards a towel she had laid out for herself to dry off. Weiss would of scrunched her nose if she had the strength to as the oblivious girl dangled her battered body over a bag packed with dirty gear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss's only hope was that Pyrrha would object-</span></div></div>",

Besides it wasn\u2019t like they would be taking it off school grounds, just acquiring it for the use of one team in particular. With that in mind the redhead didn\u2019t voice an objection as Nora dropped the thoroughly squished Weiss into the gym bag, unknowingly dooming her friend to another wave of undeserved torment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heiress didn\u2019t have the strength to do anything as she fell listlessly into the bag, her sodden form landing on top of Nora\u2019s sweaty workout gear. Covered head to toe in grime and struggling to even move, she could already feel the filth of the clothes below soaking into her body. The accumulated sweat of her teammates and friends felt like it had formed a seal around her, and for a long moment Weiss wondered if she would ever be able to reform. The moment passed, however, when her extremities began to twitch, and she almost sighed in relief when the reformation began, only to swallow that thought as the sky turned black and a fresh weight fell upon her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to Weiss\u2019s torment, Pyrrha casually dumped her used clothing into the gym bag she was sharing with Nora, not sparing a single thought for the rag her shorter teammate had procured. The extra set of sweat-soaked clothes fell upon the white-haired girl as a single congealed mass, pushing her down into the equally sweaty clothing below, and surrounding her with the stench of her friend\u2019s bodily emissions. Any chance of reforming was lost as she was pressed flat between two sets of smelly, dirty workout gear, the distinction between different garments lost in the hellish mix. The lingering heat was suffocating and only rose higher as seconds started to drag into eternity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArms free of their previous burdens the unknowing kidnappers quickly donned fresh clothing from another bag, chatting easily as their friend slowly baked in the scent of their bodies. Possible activities for the rest of the day were discussed as underwear slipped over curves and casual clothing went on over that. Jaune and Ren had already departed in search of some new sword polish for their illustrious leader, leaving the two girls to fend for themselves, and while Pyrrha tried to suggest getting some work done, Nora insisted on a \u2018girls night\u2019 of movies and other fun activities. The suggestion was made of inviting Team RWBY, but the risk of being nagged by Weiss was judged too high, neither girl knowing that the heiress may well be joining them regardless of their choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the bag now full Nora zipped it closed, and in a single movement lifted and swung it over her shoulder, causing the contents to roll around freely. Weiss found herself shifting deeper into the bag as the mass moved around her, losing both her sense of direction and her sense of hope as she quickly drowned in a smelly sea of sweat and grime. One moment she was being pressed flat beneath the cup of Pyrrha\u2019s sports bra, the next she was ground against the seat of Nora\u2019s discarded panties. Another second passed and she was wrapped up within one of Pyrrha\u2019s ankle socks, only to then be released and rubbed down the entire length of Nora\u2019s sweaty tank top until being forced into Pyrrha\u2019s stinking booty shorts below. This contact and more repeated itself in a constant cycle that left Weiss a delirious broken mess by the time her tormentors reached the dorms, no longer even able to determine where her body ended and the mass of clothing began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at the lower levels of the dorm, the two females of team JNPR entered the student laundry near the main entrance, wandering over to one of the machines and keying it up for use. Never one for subtlety, Nora simply flipped open the machine\u2019s lid, unzipped her bag, and upended it over the open maw, allowing most of the clothes within to fall out in one wet mass that slapped wetly against the base of the machine. The few remaining items were stuck to the insides and the redhead reached in to retrieve them, peering within to make sure she got everything and seeing\u2026</span></div></div>",

But as a tunnel of light came into her vision, she realized that she was staring up at the giant face of Nora at the end of a large dark tunnel. Nora absentmindedly picked clothes out of the bag that had been Weiss' prison, dropping them into the machine and on top of the heiress' rag body. A lead ball dropped in Weiss' stomach as she realized just where she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gods no!\" Weiss tried to scream, but her cries went unheard and unacknowledged as Nora finished dropping the last of her and Pyrrha's clothes into the washing machine, shutting the door. In an instant, Weiss was left in the dark, as wiring and the running of water hit her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperately trying to move, or even scream for help, the heiress felt dread rise within her as she felt the cold almost soapy water run over her form, soaking into her now very absorbent body. Weiss couldn't deny that at least the smell was better than the sweaty garments she had been forced to endure with. But soon the heiress' world started spinning as she was tossed and turned within the water and clothes, she'd have thrown up, but she had no discernible mouth for anything to exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Weiss was put through all of the washing cycles and the washing machine had come to a close, she was absolutely soaked along with the rest of the clothes of Nora and Pyrrha, and could barely feel her own body, much less move an inch. She felt damp and miserable, the nicer smell barely accommodating for the misery she had endured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her misery and dread only increased as she heard the popping of the door above her, and she felt herself being lifted up with the ball of damp clothes. But just as soon as it had happened, she felt a drop, and was plopped somewhere else, but she knew exactly where she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fears were confirmed as she heard the clamp of a door shutting, and suddenly the heiress was tossed and turned once again, but this time, instead of water, she was bombarded with unimaginable heat, drying her soaked, rag shape out, if she was still a rag, and not melted into one of the gym clothes she had been stuck with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, though it still felt like an eternity, the heat and turning eventually subsided, and Weiss was finally left in silent, feeling completely exhausted, unable to move, and miserable. After some more time in blissful silence, Weiss heard the popping of a door, and was greeted with the sight of Pyrrha's face. Her giant hand enclosing around the small girl's form as she was lifted out of the dryer along with other clothes, all nice and dry for use...</span></div></div>",

Utterly soaked in sweat and covered in grime she was barely distinguishable from the mat, even if someone had been specifically looking for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeakly, the heiress watched her friends depart with mixed feelings. On the one hand she was closer to these two (and to Ruby) than she was to anyone else, other than maybe her sister. On the other, they had just obliviously annihilated her with their bodies, subjecting her to a torment that she didn\u2019t want to experience ever again, so she was understandably somewhat happy to see them leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss watched as Blake and Yang stepped of the mat and headed for the aerobic equipment on the other side of the gym but had her vision of them obscured as a small group of students moved across the mat between them. The sight of those students reminded the little fencer that her teammates were far from the only threat to her health and she desperately started to wriggle in an attempt to free herself, concerned that perhaps she had become permanently adhered to the mat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly but surely she felt her body begin to separate from the mat and start to form back into its original shape. There were a couple of near misses as one student or another stepped down threateningly close to her position but after several minutes she had managed to free her now mostly reformed upper body and was working on freeing her legs with an increasing sense of hope and desperation. She was still soaked in sweat and grime and she still smelled like a pile of day old socks but if she could just get her legs free then maybe she could finally escape this hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019d made it all the way to the gym in the first place without being crushed.

Lately some of the equipment had been damaged by some overly-enthusiastic students and she was here to ensure that it didn\u2019t happen again. In doing so, she tried not to dwell on the fact that the damage had only started when the visiting students had arrived, or more specifically when the rambunctious students from Vacuo had come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a long day on her feet for Glynda as she ran a seemingly endless stream of errands for Ozpin and the professor was more than happy to remove her heels as she approached the mat. She grimaced as her nylon-clad feet slipped from the heels with a wet slurp and had to turn her head away to avoid breathing in her own putrid foot stench. She determined against removing her thoroughly sweat-soaked nylons, neither wanting to touch the filthy fabric nor expose herself and others to the even worse smells that were invariably trapped within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking her first couple of steps onto the mat, Glynda shuddered as she felt her nylons sticking slightly to the cushioned surface with each step, heedless to the sweaty footprints she was leaving in her wake. Any follower would be easily able to track her progress by following the footprints alone, each leaving a distinctly moist and discoloured impression in the mat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping her eyes out for any problematic students, the curvaceous woman didn\u2019t even notice the shrunken heiress as her left nylon fell upon the unfortunate girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Weiss all her hopes were crushed into a smelly oblivion as her progress towards safety was instantly undo by a single footfall. The horrendous nylons were the sweatiest surface the tiny girl had yet encountered and her own grime-encased form thoroughly adhered to them in seconds as they forced her down deep into the mat, grinding her beneath the ball of Glynda\u2019s mature feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, impossibly the force of the step squeezed even more sweat from the already overflowing nylons, threatening to drown Weiss before her new capture could even take another step. When the foot lifted again the thoroughly squished heiress was brought along for the ride, only to be plunged into another sweaty smelly hell as the foot fell again, and again, and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReduced to a sobbing broken mess, Weiss could do nothing to save herself as she was driven into the ground over and over again beneath the overwhelming mass of her professor. At first she had hoped that she would be scrapped off after a step or two, as she had before with other students, but the soaked fabric of the nylons had adhered to her like cement. She hadn\u2019t even gotten the chance to see who it was that was crushing her, but whoever they were desperately needed to do something about the smell of their feet, preferably before she died from the stench alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove, Glynda stopped for a moment to check on a few students, absently rubbing the balls of her feet around in the process, before returning to the edge of the mat and reluctantly reaching for her heels. Unable to face the smell that wafted from the shoes, the professor had to put them on by feel alone, shuddering at the feeling of the pool of sweat that flowed out from the insoles as her feet settled. It felt distinctly like she was standing in the middle of a swamp, like her nylons were sinking into a smelly pit of mud and other undesirable things. In that instant she resolved not to remove them again until she was safely back in her own room, where she could throw the shoes deep into her closet and stick the nylons at the bottom of her clothes hamper to be dealt with some other day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Glynda fully secured the heels and moved to exit the gym, Weiss was\u2026</span></div></div>",

Peeled from the mat like a wet band-aid, Weiss could barely muster the strength to whimper weakly before being slammed back into the mat once again, a fresh wave of sweat flowing out around her even as the heat and pressure felt like it was going to cook her alive. A few more steps brought them both to the waiting heels, and to a new hell for the tiny girl as she and the nylon vanished into the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNear-instantaneously, Weiss found herself surrounded with a scent a hundred times worse than what she\u2019d previously experienced and was nearly drowned in the overflowing sweat that poured out from the soaked insole. The heat was incredible, the warmth of the sole above trapped within and amplified by the tight footwear, creating a sauna-like environment that left Weiss feeling like she was either going to melt away or become permanently ironed to the sweaty nylons. And all of it only became so much worse as the giantess above began to walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a resolute expression, Glynda did her best to ignore the sickening feeling of her heels as she strode purposely out of the gym. She had a full schedule ahead of her, and not enough time to worry about any minor irritations. Certainly no time for the barely perceptible itch that was the flattened body of team RWBY\u2019s fencer being smashed between her sweaty foot and the soaked insole below. On the way out she passed Blake and Yang heading for the exercise machines, sparing them only the briefest glance as she exited the gym and took her unknown prisoner far away from her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next several hours were a blur of activity for Glynda, and a seemingly endless blur of pain for Weiss, broken only by the occasional periods of blissful unconsciousness. After leaving the gym, the professor headed to the library to ensure that students were properly respecting the rules of the quiet place, and to return the books left scattered around to their appropriate spots, requiring more than a few instances of rising up on the balls of her feet to return heavy tomes to the higher shelves, pressing more and more weight down onto the defenceless girl in her left shoe. The patrol of the grounds and the training fields that followed was no less painful, as the heat of the day ensured that the amount of sweat in the heels only got worse as the day went on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her patrol work done, the professor had hoped to get a chance to sit down and rest her feet while getting some paperwork done but instead found herself summoned to Ozpin\u2019s office, where she was not entirely pleased to find one of Ironwood\u2019s specialists in attendance. Specifically she found herself met with the somewhat agitated gaze of one Winter Schnee, apparently displeased at having to wait for the older woman\u2019s arrival. As it turned out it seemed the young Schnee heiress was missing, having been seen by neither her teammates nor her friends since earlier that morning, with her sister having spent the last couple of hours scouring the academy for her wayward sibling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as her feet hurt, Glynda knew the safety of her students had to come first, so she headed out with Winter in tow to try and locate the missing teen. The already thoroughly annihilated heiress was smeared all the worse as the inevitably fruitless search unfolded, unknowingly subjected to hours of additional torment at the behest of her worried sister. Each time Glynda tried to suggest that Weiss may have just headed into Vale or something similar, her companion would argue that it wouldn\u2019t hurt to check just a few more places, or double check the library, or the gym, or\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it was that by the time Winter finally gave up on searching the academy, and the tired professor fell gratefully onto her bed, she\u2019d spent nearly eight hours on her feet. She took a few moments just to enjoy having the weight off her sore soles before mustering the strength to reach down and slowly peel off the moist heels, shuddering slightly at the wet feeling of the insoles slowly separately from her atrociously sweaty nylons. The next thing to hit her was the smell, a thick miasma of her own foot stench assaulting her nostrils as she reflexively threw the heels as far away as she could. That made things slightly better but the smell from her nylon-clad feet alone was still attacking her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large part of Glynda didn\u2019t even want to consider touching the truly toxic nylons, let alone expose herself to the undoubtedly horrific smell of her bare feet, but she knew that leaving them on would only make things worse in the long run. With clear reluctance she reached down to slide them off, briefly turning over her left foot to pick at the nylon and ensure it wouldn\u2019t snag, her tired eyes focusing for a few scant seconds on the moist sole of the soiled footwear.</span></div></div>",

For several long seconds she tried to process what exactly she was seeing, the stretched out nature of the strange smear\u2019s limbs and body slowly coming into focus, together with its thoroughly flattened head face-first against the ball of her nyloned foot. White-hair was the final clue as the blonde realised that she was looking at what appeared to be a tiny flattened form of the missing heiress, completely immobile and wholly adhered to the sole of her sweaty left nylon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking perhaps she might have been seeing things, Glynda quickly put her foot back down and moved to check the other sole, pressing Weiss back into the ground as she shifted more of her weight to her left foot. Only once she had checked every inch of her right sole for any similar discolouration did the professor finally raise her left foot again, raising an eyebrow when she once again spied the form of the tortured fencer. Her mind whirred as she tried to process what exactly was going on here. The heiress was missing, yes, but the idea that this could be her, smeared across her nylon, was patently ridiculous. Surely there was a more reasonable explanation here. A prank by some student perhaps. An illusion of some nature. A sticker. Or maybe someone had drawn it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe obvious solution would be to probe this\u2026 thing with her fingers, but frankly right now Glynda wanted to touch those nylons as little as possible, so instead she stomped the foot back onto the ground and began forcibly dragging it back and forth across the carpet. To Weiss, for whom the last few seconds had caused nothing but confusion, this was a return to the hell she had so recently escaped, the overflowing sweat smearing further into her body while her skin burned from the friction between herself and the carpet. Blinded by the foot, the unfortunate girl could do little but wonder what the hell this woman was doing now, lacking the energy to even groan in protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for them both the grip of Glynda\u2019s nylons was just too tight, and Weiss remained stuck, only being smeared worse by the violent treatment. Unwilling to give up so easily however, the blonde decided on another approach, raising her foot from the ground and giving the student a few seconds of belief before bringing it down on the sharp edge of the nearby coffee table and starting all over again. The professor ignored the sweaty marks she was leaving on the piece of furniture and the slight discomfort of the edge digging into her foot as she focused all of her attention on peeling off this persistent little sticker. For Weiss, what had been painful before became a hundred times worse as the hard surface of the table scrapped across her skin, rubbing her raw as it slowly began to peel her away. This torment was at least successful in finally ripping her free, lifting her edges slightly before completely removing her, but there was little comfort to be had, as Glynda remained oblivious to her success, continuing to furiously move her foot back and forth for another minute before finally lifting it away to survey her handiwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisoriented and in pain, Weiss had been left as a smear across the edge of the table, her previously barely recognisable human features all but obliterated by the shifting foot, which had spread her out to cover several times her original surface area. The one saving grace was that she was now face-up, and though it hurt just to open her eyes she was finally able to see who it was that had so injured her, gazing into the stern face of her professor looking down at her. There was a frown on Glynda\u2019s face as she examined her handiwork, sighing loudly as she realised that it was in fact just some kind of sticker, either stuck there accidentally or some form of prank by one of the students. Though she could not read her mind, somehow the heiress knew that this was perhaps her one and only chance to be saved, and put all of her effort into wiggling, shifting, anything to show that she was alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExhausted and ready for sleep, Glynda was just about to look away in dismissal when Weiss was finally able to peel just one hand away, its movement limp and frail but entirely inconsistent with what one would expect from a mere sticker. The blonde\u2019s thoughts from earlier returned all at once with a vengeance as she realised that perhaps this was, in fact, the missing girl she had been searching for most of that afternoon. Gasping in shock, she reached down to peel the tiny student off properly, sharp nails digging under the flattened skin and peeling the heiress free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith what was a small movement for her, and a colossal shift for the half-inch Weiss clutched in her hand, Glynda fell back onto the couch, looking down at her bizarre find as the white-haired girl slowly began to reform. As time passed limbs reasserted themselves and other features began to fill out, making it more and more apparent that this was in fact a human-being, albeit one at an unusually tiny scale. The only question was, what exactly should Glynda do with her now?</span></div></div>",

It was incredibly surreal to be standing on the vast landscape of the blonde\u2019s palm, but infinitely preferable to the situations she had found herself in earlier. Tired eyes looked up, hoping to see salvation, only for the tentative smile on her face to slip at the hard look she was receiving, following soon after by a sudden rush of gravity as the hand she was on tilted and sent her crashing to the couch below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping the tiny heiress without a second thought, Glynda allowed her expression to shift into a frown. When she had first looked at the shrunken student she had felt some degree of concern and guilt, but that had quickly given way to a rising sense of annoyance as she reflected on the last several hours of her life. Her day had already been long enough before she\u2019d been assigned to search for Weiss with that bothersome sister of hers, and now she discovered that all those long hours of searching had been utterly pointless as the lost fencer had been in her shoe the whole time. Couldn\u2019t she have done something to get her attention and save them all a lot of hassle?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd for that matter, how had the heiress ended up in her shoe in the first place? Had she been in there all day? Did she crawl in there herself? And why was she so small? All of those questions and more swirled in Glynda\u2019s head and made her existing headache all the worse, only souring her mood further. Really, regardless of the specifics it was clear that Weiss had somehow managed to shrink herself and then get herself, deliberately or otherwise, ironed to the professor\u2019s sweaty nylons. Most likely it was some short of foolish dust experiment gone wrong and an ill-though out attempt to seek help. That, or a deliberate attempt to sully the blonde\u2019s reputation by branding her a kidnapper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that last thought flashing across her mind, any hope Weiss may have had of sympathy was lost as Glynda lifted her feet and planted them before the tiny girl, uncaring of the awful fumes that wafted from her flexing toes to pour over the defenceless heiress. Her soles had been sore even before that pointless search, and now they ached all over. As far as the larger woman was concerned this was entirely the wayward student\u2019s fault, and there was only one way for her to make it up to her. \u201cMs Schnee. I don\u2019t know how you did this to yourself, and frankly right now I don\u2019t care. You\u2019ve wasted valuable time today, and it\u2019s only proper that I be the one to administer your punishment.\u201d Moving her feet a bit closer, she flexed her toes once more. \u201cNow, give me a foot massage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the feet had closed in Weiss had stumbled back in fear, falling to her rear as the massive extremities hung above her, the dark spectres of her previous experience coming back to haunt her. Her shock and fear were enough that she almost missed the words that boomed from above, and even when they did register she couldn\u2019t believe them at first. Punishment? She was going to be punished? She\u2019d suffered under those horrendous nylons, in those horrendous sweat-filled heels for hours, wondering if she was ever going to escape that hell, and she was the one to be punished? The smell of them alone was already driving her mind back into the darkness, slowly breaking her inside as she remembered those long hours crying out for someone, anyone to save her from that pit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the circumstances were different, perhaps the heiress would have reacted differently. Been more composed in the face of such unfair expectations. But as it was, she had no energy left for diplomacy, no strength to put forward a composed argument. All she had was rage against an unfair world and the uncaring professor who sat so primly above her. \u201cYou\u2026 you bitch!! You goddamn bitch! Do you have any idea how much I\u2019ve suffered beneath your feet already!? You\u2019ve been crushing me for hours you stupid blonde bimbo!! Do you know how much you weigh!? All that fat in your breasts and butt must be making you slow if you think it makes any sense for you to punish me you cow!! You fu-ah.\u201d Weiss\u2019s anger and breath left her all at once as she finally registered the shift in her captor\u2019s expression, the eyes that had been annoyed before shifting to a murderous glare in response to her ill-thought words. Suddenly realising what she had said, the tiny student scrambled to save face, backing away as she flung her arms up in defence. \u201cOh Oum, I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t me-gah!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken girl\u2019s retreat was quickly halted as Glynda\u2019s sweaty nylons slammed into her from both sides, coming together with a wet slap as they squelched Weiss\u2019s vulnerable form between their overwhelming mass. All light instantly faded away, and the heiress\u2019s senses were quickly overwhelmed with the horrendous smell and the foul feeling of the professor\u2019s sweat and foot grime soaking into her body once more. Above, Glynda\u2019s face was now fixed into a deep scowl that few had ever survived seeing, and all thoughts of mercy had well and truly fled her mind.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Glynda couldn\u2019t believe the nerve of this girl. After all of the time and effort the academy had put into her training and education, to think that she would speak to a professor in such an appalling fashion. And such heinous words at that. After what had been said, the vindictive part of her wanted desperately to make this stuck-up little bitch pay in the worst way possible, to enslave her forever, or better yet, maybe to just dispose of her now. But even in the depths of intense anger, she was still a teacher, and she still held on to enough rationality to know that would be taking it too far. Still\u2026 she couldn\u2019t just let Weiss get away with such conduct, not without meting out a severe punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the heiress firmly trapped between her nylons, Glynda started to rub her feet back and forth, now taking pleasure in the feeling of Weiss\u2019s defenceless body being scrubbed between them. \u201cNow listen up you bug. I was going to help you after just a short foot rub, but now I don\u2019t think you deserve that sort of kindness. In fact, I don\u2019t think you deserve any kindness at all.\u201d The blonde emphasised her point by pressing her feet together harder, a smirk temporarily displacing her glare as she felt the fencer\u2019s squishy body start to compact under the force. \u201cSo here\u2019s how it\u2019s going to work now. You\u2019re going to serve my feet, serve me, in any way I desire, until I decide you\u2019ve worked off your debt.\u201d With one last squeeze, she separated her soles, allowing Weiss\u2019s partially crushed body to peel off and fall listlessly to the couch below. \u201cDo I make myself understood?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGasping for breath and struggling to her knees, the shrunken student looked up at her teacher with despairing eyes, ignoring the sweat that clung to her form. Her time between the feet had been mercifully brief, but the ease with which she had been crushed and dominated drove home how truly helpless she was before this massive being. More than anything Weiss wished she could take back the words she had said, but the hard edges of the gaze that met her chilled her to the bones, and she found herself nodding without a word, not yet willing to risk retaliation or further dispute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she was pleasantly surprised at the acquiescence, Glynda didn\u2019t allow her stern expression to slip, reaching down to slowly peel off her nylons, allowing her little servant to really drink in the sight as her incredibly sweaty soles were revealed to the world, bringing with them a wave of odour that would have repulsed the blonde if she wasn\u2019t focused on Weiss\u2019s torment. \u201cGood. Then you can start by giving me the massage you should have before, except this time you can attend to my bare feet.\u201d Lowering one foot, she pressed the toes into the couch, causing deep depressions and nearly sucking the tiny heiress in. \u201cAnd you better do a good job too. If you do, this might all be over in a week. If you don\u2019t\u2026\u201d The other foot came forward now, hovering menacingly over the stricken Weiss. \u201cYou might end up serving me for months or even longer. If you\u2019re lucky that is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeeks? Months!? When the professor had said she could work off her debt the fencer had assumed that meant hours, or a day at most. Now she was told that the bare minimum she could hope for was a week. It was too much, and tears started to stream down her pale cheeks as she looked up with pleading eyes between the outstretched toes of Glynda\u2019s foot. \u201cProfessor please. I\u2019m sorry! I swear I\u2019ll do a good job, just please don\u2019t punish me for s-gah!\u201d Without hesitation the sole above her came down, and Weiss quickly found herself being rubbed between the couch and the sweaty appendage, a torment that continued for several long seconds before she was released.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down between her toes at the soaked girl, Glynda sneered at the pathetic bug that had once been human, more than ready to just stomp her into oblivion if she tried to defy her again. \u201cThat was your last warning servant. Next time I\u2019ll be adding a week to your punishment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no more words to resist, and barely enough strength to stand, Weiss reluctantly nodded and stepped up to the nearest sole, pressing her hands into Glynda\u2019s moist flesh and struggling not to vomit at the sweat that immediately coated her hands. She\u2019d been crushed today more times than she could count, and most of that had been under the foot of this woman, but somehow the act of actively starting to rub her hands across the sole felt like it was the start of something new. Like the first step on a path from which she would never be able to escape. Like giving in. But her will to resist was well and truly broken, and above her revulsion and the tattered remains of her dignity, the thought that most dominated the heiress\u2019s mind was a desire to do well and avoid punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the fumes from the feet were already starting to mess with Weiss\u2019s sense of balance she persevered, moving her hands up and down and left to right. The flesh of the blonde\u2019s feet was firm yet giving, and the lubricant provided by her sweat made the process easier, but it was hard to tell whether she was making any appreciable impact. In the brief moments that the heiress glanced up the expression on Glynda\u2019s face didn\u2019t change, still glaring down at the tiny girl at her feet. The shrunken student\u2019s fate now depended on whether or not she could satisfy her newfound master.</span></div></div>",

At her normal height giving a foot massage would be no issue at all, but she wasn't normal sized anymore. She was a bug in a world of giants, and that meant she didn't have the capability to give Glynda the proper service she so desired. And that would spell disaster for ant-like girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter how hard she tried to get any sort of reaction from the giant above her, her face remained unchanged. Weiss would be the first to admit she wasn't the most physically imposing member of her team. The honor went to Yang. If she were in the shrunken girl's position right now she may be able to give the giant professor what she wanted, but Weiss wasn't Yang. That meant she just didn't have the strength for the job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pathetic.\" Glynda whispered under her breath. Weiss still heard her clear as day however and when she did her eyes widen. Looking back at the giant's face, the Schnee heiress began tremble. Her usual scowl had deepened and her frigid eyes only seemed to grow colder. The look on the giant blonde's face said it all...Weiss had failed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken Schnee started to back away in fear at the realization. She was too small to get the job done. It was then that Glynda's words from earlier came back to her. If she didn't do an adequate enough job then she would extend her punishment. Punishment that would stretch on for months or even longer. Again the snow-haired girl felt the tears streaming down her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm very disappointed in you Ms. Schnee.\" Glynda started. \"I gave you a very simple command and yet you couldn't even do it properly.\" Her bare foot began to hover ominously over the shrunken girl who was now frozen in place by fear. \"Between your disrespectful attitude and inability to complete a simple task, it's become quite clear to me that you need to be taught a lesson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss's trembling intensified. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your service to me will be extended.\" Glynda said firmly, her cold eyes glaring daggers into the miniscule girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-professor please--!\" Weiss cried before she again found herself flattened under Goodwitch's sweat sole. Weiss was sure she was living in a nightmare, a nightmare she wanted so desperately to wake up from. The torture she had endure this day alone from Glynda's feet was astronomical. To think this kind of punishment would continue. She could do nothing was she was pressed firmly between the cushion and flesh, ground all about by the uncaring giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" The heiress thought. \"Why is this happening to me?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She felt the force of it rip her away from the chair as the semblance took hold of her and she floated up to eye level with the glaring goddess. \"Since you seem so insistent on being a pain in my ass perhaps I should get something out of it.\" She said and the Heiress started spinning in the air as she felt herself getting pulled out and expanding. She was so dizzy from it she couldn't even tell she had become a sphere nearly four times the size that her minuscule body had been. She racked her brain trying to figure out what Glynda meant by her statement when she saw she was drifting closer to a short cord with several balls attached there were several more of the balls slowly rotating around it and as they made their rotations the next biggest of them seemingly melded onto the cord due to Glynda's semblance. When she joined the balls rotating around the cord she realized what was happening and Glynda must have seen the look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right Ms. Schnee, as you can see my semblance allows me to repair broken things provided I have the component parts. I've been missing a bead for ages but it seems you're just the right size now.\" She flicked her wrist and Weiss felt her body make contact with to cord and simply bond to it in the same way the other beads had she was about fourth from the end of the cord on either end. Glynda licked her lips in anticipation as the beads floated closer to her and she caught them with her hand. \"This should be a sufficient job for you until I determine your behavior has gotten better, and you can hardly fail to act as one of my Anal beads unless you somehow break off.\" She explained while dripping some lube down from the top bead, and Weiss finally got to know what exactly it was she had been attached to and immediately started freaking out. The light movement that she did manage made Glynda giggle. \"Save it for when you're on duty Ms. Schnee or hmm perhaps I should Just call you toy for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe words punctuated another bout of floating in the air for the poor beads while Glynda wiggled out of her cloths fully.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>If she was being honest then Glynda would say that she was enjoying the massage. It wasn\u2019t a particularly strong feeling, but it was still enough to be appreciated, like a small animal creeping across her sole. But, after everything that Weiss had said, it didn\u2019t seem like punishment enough. The heiress deserved to suffer for her arrogance and rudeness. She wasn\u2019t in any particular hurry, so she let the girl struggle on for several minutes while she contemplated her fate, but eventually allowed an even crueller smirk to cross her face as she decided what her next actions would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Weiss\u2019s perspective there was no warning. One moment she was diligently attending to Glynda\u2019s right sole, and the next she was being snatched up by the toes of the blonde\u2019s left foot, her vision suddenly cut off as the powerful digits closed around her and she was instantly plunged into the sweaty crevice between the second and third toe. The smell here was far more intense than what had wafted off the sole, and the overflowing sweat now mixed with a thick coating of grime. Worse still, the voice that boomed from above confirmed that this had been no accident. \u201cI think it\u2019s time you really put your back into pleasing me bug. If you couldn\u2019t make enough of an impact on my sole, perhaps you\u2019ll do better work on my toes.\u201d A slight tightening of the embrace ensured absolute attention. \u201cNow be a good pet and lick up all my sweat and toejam. I want those toes spotless.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she had been repulsed before then Weiss was absolutely sickened now by the thought of so much as opening her mouth in this place. She\u2019d barely been here a few seconds and already a thick layer of grime was beginning to soak into her body, not to mention the waves of sweat stinging her eyes and the absolutely dreadful odour assaulting her nostrils. Even her friends\u2019 butts hadn\u2019t been this bad. The idea of adding to that torment by exposing her delicate sense of taste to this monstrosity was just too much, and while the rational part of her brain knew the consequences, the heiress couldn\u2019t overcome her instinct to escape and started to desperately wiggle in a doomed attempt to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPredictably, Glynda did not take kindly to the tiny student\u2019s attempt to break free, her toes instantly clamping down on the struggling fencer and compacting her into the sweaty folds of the crevice. It was like a vice had closed over every part of Weiss\u2019s body as she found herself forced face-first into the deepest recesses of the blonde\u2019s toes. A short-lived unclenching was following by another squeeze even more violent than the first, as her trailing limbs were flattened against the sweaty flesh of the toes to either side, forming a tight seal to keep the tortured heiress tightly in place. A dozen more ferocious clenches followed, smearing copious quantities of toejam across Weiss\u2019s face and leaving her with no option but to swallow the lump forced into her throat and breathe in this stench directly from its source. The urge to vomit rose again, stronger than ever, but there was nothing the unfortunate girl could do when her body was in such a devastated state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, glaring down at her shifting toes with an icy face, Glynda cared not for the suffering she was inflicting on her student, absolutely convinced that she deserved every second of it. First she had wasted her time on a fruitless search and tried to pin the blame on her, then she had said such horrendous things, and now she was continuing to resist her rightful punishment. The professor only relented so that she would be heard, as she spread her toes and fixed her eyes on Weiss\u2019s crushed remains. \u201cI warned you. Your disobedience has now earned you another week of torment. At this rate you\u2019ll be lucky if you manage to get free by the end of the month. Now. Lick. My. Toes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took several long seconds for Weiss\u2019s body to pull itself back together, though thankfully Glynda was at least reasonable enough to wait for the process to complete. She was still a bit flattened, and pretty sure some parts of her were still adhered to the toes, but as they came back together and the light disappeared, the shrunken student reluctantly extended her tongue and started to lick. It was\u2026 horrible, to say the least. She\u2019d gotten a small taste before, but even that couldn\u2019t compare to actually running her tongue across the moist and filthy flesh. As the seemingly endless supply of toejam started to fill her mouth, it felt like the taste of it was going to become permanently ingrained on her tongue, and no matter how quickly she tried to swallow, the feeling would linger in her mouth until the next mouthful made itself known. In no time at all she felt her stomach fill with the putrid detritus of her professor\u2019s toes, but the moment her licking slowed a slight tightening of the walls around her spurred her into a renewed vigour. She\u2019d just have to find more room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleased that she was finally starting to get her way, Glynda lent back to relax, propping her feet up on the arm of the couch as she spread herself out, keeping her head just elevated enough that she could still keep an eye on her toes and their tiny servant. The massage had been good, but this was quite possible one of the best things that she had ever felt, and the massive blonde sighed in contentment as she enjoyed the suffering of the shrunken Schnee. If she had known that this was what it would feel like she would have found some way to shrink the students herself. In fact, she rather fancied the idea of doing that now. Maybe adding a few of the less worthwhile students to her little collection. Later though, for now she just wanted to enjoy this. \u201cHmmm\u2026 good. You better get used to this my servant. You\u2019ll be spending a lot of time with my toes, and my sweat and toejam will be your only food from now on, so if you want to survive you better eat up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing those words, hot tears ran down Weiss\u2019s smeared cheeks, mixing with the abundant sweat of her captor\u2019s feet that had by now soaked into every bit of her body from head to toes. It was now clear that Glynda had no intention of ever relenting in this torment unless she was given absolute obedience, and the shrunken heiress doubted she would ever be able to fully meet the vindictive woman\u2019s expectations. If things kept going like this, she would spend the rest of her life servicing the blonde\u2019s whims, never again being able to see her friends and loved ones. Her only real hopes were either to find a way to escape or to do a good enough job to earn some small degree of lenience.</span></div></div>",

It wasn't hard to see where she was coming from, after all her experiences up to this point. Not a single moment has been pleasant since she became like... this. A lot of it involved her becoming the prey of some oblivious, heavy footsteps, and the heiress' interactions with Goodwitch sealed it.  She hated everything about it.

The usually agile dust user struggled to role out of the way, only managing to role onto her back as the foot of Cinder entered her vision, the normally immaculate foot caked in dirt after a session of exercise. Too weak to move, the white haired tiny gazed at the foot for a moment before it smashed down upon her, grinding down into the mat sadistically before twisting off, leaving the dirty mark of the unsurprised hero splattered near the edge of the mat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning softly and in sore need of a shower, Weiss gazed blankly upwards as she saw a girl she barely recognized. Hope flooded the tiny stains mind as the green eyes of the girl locked onto her with a slightly perplexed expression, the girls twin tales bounced merrily as she hopped down on one knee, reaching a slender hand down towards the tiny creature.

Snickering with a feeling of superiority of finally being bigger then someone she casually pinched her toys cheek sadistically.<br>\r\n\"Are you coming...?\" Cinders voice chirped out, snapping Neo out of her trance before nodding to the smoldering girl awaiting by the doorway. With one final sneer downwards to her competitor the disguised Neo quickly slipped off her shoe, preferring the gym equipment to the mats she hadn't bothered to take it off. Weiss could only weakly shake her head as Neo tipped her hand towards the entrance of her shoe, giving a not so friendly wave before the tiny girl fell in with a wet slap. Weiss only got a brief break before the shredded sock wound around Neo's foot crammed into her, the sweat and stench rivaling even Glynda as she wriggled her foot into the well worn sock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinder didn't bother questioning her quiet ally as she watched her wander back towards the base. The leader of the plan shrugged before heading into the showers with her wash cloth, not giving the girl a second thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss was in hell as the foot continued to pump her into the worn insole, if she ever managed to get into a better position the dexterous toes would simply clamp down on her, threatening to drag the poor girl into one of the frayed holes in the worn down socks. Not able to take it anymore, the ice girl desperately groped the foot, giving a tiny lick in hope of being relieved of her duty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeo on the other hand enjoyed her walk home, taking the scenic route and actually enjoying nature. She even considered trying to strike up a conversation with one of Weiss's old team mates- but what would she say? The girl smirked before forcibly changing it to a friendly smile as Ruby passed by. Her toes clenched around her toys tongue with confidence as she reached her room. The only question was- what to do now? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer shoes dropped to the ground, soon followed by the limp flat mess Weiss had become. Neo's eyebrows raised as she watched the tiny girl panting for breath, poking her flattened toy with a tiny smile before considering her options. Perhaps she should make this girl her slave? How much does the girl stretch? Could I make her obey my commands with just a point of a finger? Perhaps she could get the others to use her with Cinders manipulative help?

After all, there was nothing the short girl liked better than watching friends come to blows, whether they were aware of the conflict or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinching her toy\u2019s feet between the thumb and pointer of one hand and crushing her head between the thumb and pointer of the other, Neo pulled her hands apart, and watched with glee as the little girl was stretched out to a good few inches. It seemed she was quite malleable, good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing about Neo\u2019s illusion powers is that they were absolute. They didn\u2019t just affect what people saw, but what they heard and felt as well. Even what the smelled and tasted was affected. Her illusions were strong enough that even the sharp senses of a Faunus could be fooled into thinking there was a living breathing person standing in front of them when in fact there was nothing but air, and the illusions only became stronger when they were anchored to a physical form. Once complete, anyone affected by the illusion would see what she wanted them to see, hear what she wanted them to hear, smell what she wanted them to smell and feel what she wanted them to feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, as Neo happily started to squish and stretch Weiss between her hands like a tiny little stress toy she began to work her magic on the tortured girl, even her own senses losing track of pale white hair, torn clothes and porcelain skin as the shape and the feel of the girl altered before her very eyes. Finally dropping the girl onto her bed she smirked even wider as the illusion took full effect, and she found herself looking down at a tiny and thoroughly squished copy of [\u2026].<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a moment to admire her work as the disguised Weiss struggled to reform, Neo put a stop to any hope of escape by slamming her hand down on top of her newfound toy and ground the palm around until the fencer was reduced to a flat disk.

Covering her mouth momentarily, she had thought she heard Neo mention turning her into Adam, however her body looked the same to her. \"What the...\" Weiss tried to mutter as she looked towards a conveniently placed mirror ({ossibly positioned by Neo herself). Weiss internally screamed as she saw Adam looking back at her, followed by a gasp from someone entering the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo distracted about the strange circumstances, Weiss didn't notice the door open. There stood a shocked Blake, looking confused followed by a mix of concern and anger. A sigh of relief flooded over the tiny girl as she attempted to shout and wave, before the colour left her face. She looked exactly like Adam. Panicing, she turned and ran towards the edge, planning to escape and find a way of communicating later. The tiny girl knew she didn't stand much chance though as after just a few steps a hand slammed down on the desk infront of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adam...?\" Blake growled, her head tilted upwards to try and intimidate the tiny being. \"What are you doing here? Here to hurt my friends again?\" The cat faunus paused, waiting for an answer from the stunned 'boy' that gazed up paralized in fear. \"Further more- why are you shrunk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss eventually snapped out of her stupor, trying desperately to say something as her legs wobbled around the desk. Blake frowned, glancing around the room for something to tie her prisoner up. Jumping to her feet, Weiss attempted to scrabble away while she had the chance. She knew Neo wasn't far and that that devious girl wouldn't let her communicate with Blake. Even if she did manage to say something right now, what's to say that Blake will be safe from the evil doer<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, she only managed to crawl a few steps before getting crushed by a large weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Blakes rage and split second judgement, she had grabbed the closest thing to her and slammed it down on the tiny 'Adam'. Rubies worn down slipper had meant to be a warning shot, something to stop 'Adam' in his tracks. However, the surprising situation and the unplanned action had caused the giant girl to misjudge her attack. Anger flooded out of Blake to be replaced with remorse and fear. She wasn't a killer like Adam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly lifting the slipper up, fully expecting a bloodstain, she was happily surprised to see an Adam shaped sticker slowly trying to reform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching for a few moments while trying to understand the situation, Blake slowly smiled.<br>\r\n\"Talk Adam-\" She frowned, slapping the slipper into her other hand. </span></div></div>",

Almost broke... it\" Weiss internally screamed as Blakes face darkened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeo was loving life, standing just outside the window while checking her nails. Her mouth moved yet the words she spoke were coming in through the open window. She rolled her head with a giant smile on her face- rolling her tongue in joy as she finished off with, \"You biiiiiiiiiiiiitch\". Opening her compact, she slyly used the mirror out of curiosity. Watching the angered girl and the tiny Adam doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Invincible?\" Blake's face reddened, \"Fine- great- then I don't need to worry about killing you-\". Weiss could only weakly kick her legs before Blakes fingers curled over her, squeezing the poor girl like an actual stress toy. Unable to do anything, the tiny Weiss could only wait for it to be over as she was compacted into a ball. Using both hands, the giant Blake attempted to make good on her promise of turning 'Adam' into paste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrushed, mashed and dashed between her friends angered grip, she felt her stomach soon drop as she was suddenly slammed into the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe battered ball weakly looked upwards, her eyes travelling up the black and white outfit Blake always wore. <br>\r\n\"Wait- Blake-\" Weiss tried to speak, gazing into the annoyed eyes of her giant friend before being cast into shadows by the giant girls boot. Small pieces of debris fell from the chunky thing before it slammed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was by far the worst pressure she had experienced so far, where as the girls on the mats were just walking, Blake was currently shifting all of her weight into destroying the ball. Twisting the boot into the crushed ball for a few seconds before lifting her foot off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss twitched, her flattened form struggling to get off the ball of the boot.

This was turning out way better then expected! The flattened toy slowly lost all features as it was twisted into the dirt on Blakes shoe.<br>\r\n\"Geez- she has some issues\" Neo smiled, watching the faunus peel the Adam off. Awaiting a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, none came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can seriously do worse-\" Blake spoke, \"Did you do\" the cat girl took a breath, \"Anything to my friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime ticked by, no answer.

After a hour or what felt like ages for Adam/Weiss, Blake finally peeled them out of her ass. \u201cSo, after all of that, do you finally want to tell me where Weiss is?\u201d Blake asked in an annoyed manner. Weiss, now with countless broken bones and crushed vocal cords, was unable to say anything. This only enraged Blake even more. She then heard the door open. She turned around to see it was Yang and Ruby entering the room. With cat-like reflexes she shoved Weiss back into her panties and thought of what to do next.</span></div></div>",

Aw, and my feet are killing me now...\" Ruby moaned. This gave Neo an idea. And it would be fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeo knelt down in front of Ruby and picked up her right booted foot. Ruby raised her head \"Weiss? What are you doing?\" \"Well...\" Neo started, untying Ruby's boot laces \"Since you went to so much trouble for me, the least I can do is repay you.\" She slid the boot off and now held Ruby's bare nylon covered foot in her hands.

It was to much for the girl as she fell back down biting her lip. Neo pulled Ruby's nylons off and held the feet in front of her with one hand, while the other reached into her pocket and pulled out Weiss.

She worked and mushed the girl until she was flattened to the sole and stuck to it. Weiss received a face-full of flesh as she was pushed into Ruby's warm sweaty sole. She tried to struggle and scream but she was powerless to stop Neo's fingers as they pushed her into Ruby's foot flesh and all her screaming did was let some of Ruby's foot sweat slip into her mouth. She started to cry as Ruby's foot sweat started to burn her eyes. Weiss began to beg <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">\"Ruby... please\"</font> and almost on queue to really rub it in Ruby started to moan \"Mmm, t-thank you Weiss...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeo watched as Ruby bit her lip and stretched her toes with bliss, she loved how much pleasure Ruby was getting out of her friends pain without even knowing it.

Close enough to crush Weiss' spirit but not close enough to really take too much notice of her absence. What made it all the better was knowing how heavy Penny really was. She looked like an average girl, but no one in combat class was able to come close to lifting her. No one knew the real reason. That she was an android built by Atlas. All that weight coming down on the Schnee heiress made Neo laugh to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut who to make her look like? Most of the RWBY and JNPR girls had enemies, but outside that there were mostly rivals and opponents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when a thought came to her. A devious and evil one. It didn't have to be a flat-out enemy to make Penny unknowingly toy with Weiss, just simply someone who angered her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had the perfect person in mind. Pyrrha Nikos. The only person who could beat Penny in a combat match (who wasn't holding back). Penny tried to hide it, but she always seemed upset whenever the Mistral champion used her Semblance, probably messing with her programming. It wouldn't take too much convincing to get Penny to toy with a miniature version of Pyrrha. It even worked in her favour; when Penny would see Pyrrha at Beacon, she'd think there were no consequences for messing with the toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeo could even do an illusion on herself.

Someone who'd be busy with their own stuff to get as involved in finding Weiss as the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo who would it be? Neo had two thoughts in mind; the first was Glynda Goodwitch and the second was either Coco or Velvet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoodwitch definitely appealed to Neo's inner (and outer) sadist. Weiss looked up to Goodwitch as a role model and the teacher was always moving around, fixing up the damage left by students and training for the next big threat, so there were plenty of ways to torture Weiss. Neo already had the perfect identity for Weiss in mind. Goodwitch had a few fights with Cinder-although the former didn't know that her enemy was in fact Cinder-and probably wanted some payback for all the trouble she caused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt'd need Cinder's help, the woman knew how to manipulate, but Neo was tempted by the thought of Goodwitch looking at this toy who had once been a threat to Remnant and punishing her in every way possible. The illusion would need to make her look similar to Cinder, but Goodwitch never saw the face. Only the hair and eyes. The rest could be made to look different enough from Cinder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut would Cinder help? She had a big ego and might not even like the idea of even an illusion of a look-alike being made to submit and be tortured.

Or maybe Neo wouldn't even disguise Weiss in an illusion-depending on who she sent her to-and simply send her to be a toy for her new owner to toy and play with as they wished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last question-over than who she'd actually give Weiss to-was whether to give Weiss away to someone around Weiss' age and here for the Vytal Festival, or to send her off immediately to someone outside of Beacon, or outside Vale itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd at least see some of Weiss' torture if she gave Weiss to someone who only went to another combat school, but that kept the risk of being discovered or Weiss finding a way back to her friends.

Undisciplined, but ultimately the fault of her monitors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss boiled at the insult to her partner, her friend, and her team itself, but could do nothing as Neo twisted her form with her fingers alone. All Ciel saw was the scientist standing and waiting for her answer, but what was truly there was Neo shaking in anticipation and using Weiss as a way to distract herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The girl I want the toy to look like is the one truly at fault for my stress. Now, you say I can make the toy look like whoever I want. No matter who it is, you won't hold it against me?\" Ciel nervously asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all. You've more than earned this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, ma'am.\" Ciel said. A strangely cruel smile came to her face. \"I want the toy to look like...\"</span></div></div>",

A shudder went through the tiny Weiss as the light blue eyes of Ciel scanned her, noticing the obvious fear. The tiny Weiss shuddered as she saw her own reflection in the giant girls eye, the face of Penny looking glumly back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It can't feel emotions, correct?\" Ciel queried, her arms entwining behind her back as she examined the mini Penny.<br>\r\n\"Correct- it's just a toy to relieve stress upon, don't worry, we haven't shrunken the real Penny down. I'm afraid you'll still have to deal with the larger version of her\" Neo told the truth, squeezing the Penny look alike in her hand. \"It's also very durable- observe-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss couldn't put up much of a fight as Neo's two hands enclosed around her, flattening her out before pinching her sides.<br>\r\n\"It's practical and water proof to use the 'source of your stress' as a rag of some sort-\" Neo smiled, pulling Weiss outwards so as to resemble a rag, her features looking quite unhappy with her situation as her 'tormentor to be' nodded with a level head. \"Or- perhaps gum- it's made to always taste minty fresh\" Neo chuckled to herself, before dropping the rag to the ground. \"Anything that you think will help you relieve some stress-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the ground, the tiny rag struggled to reform while Neo listed some features, her tiny body struggling as she thought back on her terrible day. She didn't manage to get very far with her recovery however as the light from the sky dimmed with the shadow of someones foot. She tried to yell a complaint, yet nothing came out as the polished black shoe of Ciel stomped down upon her, grinding down like it was putting out a cigarette.<br>\r\n\"Thank you-\" Weiss heard from above, feeling the foot lift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeo was walking away, giving a friendly wave before vanishing from the tiny girls sight. Left only with the strict time keeper, the giant girl simply unstuck her from the ground, examining her crumpled form.<br>\r\n\"Penny\" She sighed, glancing at her watch as she timed her next move. \"I should get going, you will be a great help\" The giant girl glanced down without care at what she thought was a stress toy, her fingerless gloves quickly crushing down the toy with a content sigh before preparing to leave. \"I should probably hide you...\" She mumbled-</span></div></div>",

You will remain in my right shoe until half-way before bedtime. In that moment, I will then place you in the left shoe and you will repeat your duties which will be to massage, kiss, and generally worship the assigned foot. I will add pressure when I want you to switch it up and will apply further pressure if you fail to follow my desires. Is that understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss said nothing in reply. She couldn't speak through the misery and torment she was going through. This morning, she had left to go and train for the Vytal Festival Tournament and now she was here. Nothing more than a toy to be used for Ciel's relaxation and stress-relief because Penny was refusing to do what this control-freak said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a chance she'd never see her friends or know freedom again. An eternity of slavery under Ciel's foot, while she thought she was tormenting a smaller version of Penny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to try and appeal to her better nature, if she even had one!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ciel, you have to-\" Weiss didn't know if it was her voice Ciel heard, or if Neo's illusion worked at a range. She was crushed in Ciel's hand regardless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will presume the defiance is meant to act as a motivator.\" Ciel said, opening her hand let Weiss reform her body. \"Handling the real Penny has proven more of a nuisance than I first thought. You'll make a suitable stress-relief. Ideally, she'll be compliant and you'll only have to commit to minor service. If she is remaining difficult to control....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiel's grip tightened again and Weiss realised how powerless she was. Her Aura was the only thing keeping her intact and that was being stretched to its very limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I presume you understand your role?\" Ciel asked, the shadow of a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Weiss replied, her spirit broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" Ciel raised an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... Mistress?\" Weiss waited to see if that was the right response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suitable. For now.\" Ciel then slipped Weiss- or the mini-Penny- into her boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a quick slide down a white thigh-high foot and Weiss stumbled into the centre of the sole. She barely managed to flip onto her back before feeling herself get crushed down by Ciel's right foot. There was no chance of her escaping. Ciel would feel her climbing up the leg and would punish her harder than ever, if she tried defying her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe climate was warm and only getting hotting. There was only enough room for Weiss, if she breathed in and used all her strength, to move around the bottom of the sole and maybe climb up the side to reach the top of Ciel's foot. It was obvious why these conditions were chosen. She'd be too woozy to do anything but move around and worship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnless she felt like being tortured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss had no time to ponder further. She felt Ciel's foot push down on her, the command for her to start serving, and Weiss saw no other option than to move her hands against Ciel's sole and start rubbing. It took everything she had to add enough force and she shuffled up and down in place to get more of the sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiel had already started walking as Weiss could feel her surrounding go up and then come crashing down on her. Ciel was soft enough that she didn't instantly crush Weiss, but she could still feel her body being squashed by the force. By the fifth step, Ciel pressed down harder and Weiss took that as the signal to start kissing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hygiene was good. Ciel regularly cleaned herself and there was no sign of sweat or dirt anywhere. It was just the humiliation that made Weiss hate every minute of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe prayed that the real Penny wouldn't be a handful. If she was compliant with Ciel, it would mean she wouldn't feel the need to vent her aggression on what she thought was a smaller version of her partner. If she was trouble...Weiss would be in for a long day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiel herself was walking down the corridor feeling more relaxed than ever. The stress-toy Penny was following instructions as commanded and gave her a sense of authority and leadership when she saw Penny waiting just ahead. A part of her even hoped that the android would be her usual troublesome self, if only to make further use of the toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould Penny be a problem for Ciel?</span></div></div>",

Do you understand our schedule for today?\" Ciel asked expectantly. She already frowned when she saw Penny uneasily avoid looking at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About that...\" She paused, not noticing Ciel put pressure on her right foot. The stress-toy was massaging harder, but this was a bigger issue. \"Ruby told me that she couldn't find Weiss and she was starting to get worried. I was wondering if we could help her-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Penny, you were ordered not to fraternise with her. Furthermore, we have a schedule and must keep to it.\" Ciel's voice was calm as ever. The stress-toy Penny, however, was likely being crushed as she spoke. She frowned at Penny and put more force in her words. \"Is that understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor once, Penny actually listened, looking down miserably and nodded. \"Yes Ciel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" Ciel lessened the pressure and was relieved that something was going right today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stress-toy was already serving its purpose. She didn't feel a migraine at all and she could feel the tension seeping away. The stress-toy was learning on the job, a useful skill to have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd wait a bit more before having it start really worshipping her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't the worst thing in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss was managing to worship Ciel fine. It wasn't like Neo where she was at the whims of a monster but there was a clear pattern. Moment of tension from each step, maybe further pressure if something upset Ciel, and cues for Weiss to change tactics. It was structured and orderly so that Ciel could be comforted best, not for a killer's sick fantasies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss simply had to move around and worship. Ciel would press down to make Weiss move away and towards where she wanted the massage next, Weiss laid kisses down the path she took to cover every part with affection, and then Weiss would rub the tension away. She could feel her prison relax and loosen as she improved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only moment of far had been early on when something had upset Ciel and she started squashing Weiss. The pain was expected but horrifying all the same. Weiss tried to rub and kiss as hard as she could, but it must have been something above that made Ciel stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't know why but she had an idea. Penny must have been more obedient than usual and so Ciel had little reason to torment Weiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour must have passed before Ciel began pressing harder. Not enough to flatten Weiss but enough to send a message. Weiss was around the lower sole when she began licking. The taste was bad as Ciel was beginning to sweat, although that was the only cause. Her body was clean and pristine, even with practice earlier, and the sweat managed to actually hydrate her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss went from the ball of the foot, up the soles, covered the arches, and even managed to get through and between the toes without a problem. Weiss managed to avoid getting dehydrated or crushed by each step that Ciel took. Slowly but surely, Weiss managed to reach the top of Ciel's foot and covered it with kisses and licks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiel placed her in the left boot shortly after that with a commanding look. Weiss knew better than to defy or delay so she immediately went to worship the left foot the second the foot re-entered the boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had more experience now. It was almost interesting how much tension there was in the left foot compared to the right. Weiss almost took a perverse pride in the way she kept Ciel's right foot relaxed. That her worship could make a difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the only way Weiss could take what was happening. She had to play along and be the perfect stress-toy and relaxation tool so that Ciel would eventually let her guard down and she could escape. She had to find her team and pray the illusion wouldn't work on them. Or maybe they'd see a tiny Penny and listen to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, she kept her immediate thoughts on the worship. Massaging the foot, guided by Ciel's presses, while kissing and licking it in between. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was night when she was finally let out of the boot. She was in Ciel's grip in what was probably the bathroom and could see the sharp, but also nearly relaxed, look on Ciel's face as she looked down on the toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss was the opposite, even in her Penny-like form. Her body was soaked in sweat and her clothes had been torn from her, down to her bra and panties, and the illusion probably looked similar. Going by the look on Ciel's face, that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have to arrange for more suitable clothing later.\" She sighed, before staring down at Weiss. \"You did adequately, if inconsistently, Penny. Tomorrow, you'll perform the same duties- and will likely do so in the future henceforth- but I expect a performance closer to the second try than the first. As for sleeping arrangements, your flexibility means it won't be hard to tie you to my foot. Tonight will be the right and tomorrow the left and that'll be the pattern. You will thank me for your servitude both past and future each time I decide you have finished the current task. Is that understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Mistress.\" She said, doing whatever it took to please Ciel. \"Your relaxation is my purpose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was meant to pander to Ciel's ego and lower her guard. Weiss probably didn't even know about the tiny part of her that truly felt it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere, waiting by the window of Ciel's room with equipment used to bug the bedroom and the bathroom, Neo was silently cackling to herself after hearing those words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiel's expression didn't change, except for the way the corners of her mouth flickered up for an instant. Almost like a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiel herself was happy that this Penny was being obedient as well. Today had been a fine schedule, if Penny was morose throughout, but better she be gloomy and obedient than excited and uncontrollable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomorrow was a training session, ideally, so she could use the sleeping arrangements tonight to test how much she could tie Penny to her foot. Failing that, she'd have to crush this version against her foot and simply swap between exercises. She already had ways to ensure that she wouldn't fall off her foot by accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she prepared to stretch out the stress-toy's limbs and wrap it around her right foot, Ciel briefly hesitated with a thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss Schnee hadn't been found and people were beginning to ask where she had gone. Another day or so and she'd be declared missing. Ruby Rose had been distraught and it affected Penny's emotional state. Right now, she was being obedient, but this could serve as a complication.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, that was what the stress toy was for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was none of Ciel's concern what Commander Schnee's sister did. Knowing the girl, she was probably off somewhere doing what she liked. It was why she couldn't control her partner, who was making it hard for Ciel to control her own. Ciel, meanwhile, was focused on duty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the timing was strange, that she'd get this toy at the same time. Or it was just coincidence. Maybe she should try and ask the scientist who gave her toy about it tomorrow, and skip training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCiel had finally tied the stress-toy to her right foot, head pushed against the arches and hands against the soles to massage, when she made up her decision. Whispering it to herself, as Neo could hear it from the outside.</span></div></div>",

Her Aura would more than be enough to keep the hammer blows from actually hurting her hand. Weiss, on the other hand...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss felt the hammer come down on her before she could even start running. Pain electrified her whole body and she felt bones and muscles turn to nothing within an instant. She wanted to scream and howl, but her lungs were too flat to do anything and the best she could do was make a noise so quiet that not even Neo could hear her. The hammer came down again and again as Weiss became flat enough that she'd be placed in the envelope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was in complete despair as Neo smiled and waved at her, before giving one last wink, and dropping her into the envelope. Weiss felt paper slide next to her form and couldn't read the writing as her face was squashed against the envelope's paper, completely blocking out her vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was it. Her only chance was that her team would notice that she was missing and somehow track down her shrunken form to Neo. If she was lucky, they'd question her and be able to find out wherever she was being sent to, or whoever she was sent to would send the Schnee heiress back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Weiss didn't know was that Neo might have cast an illusion on her so that she'd look like Yang, for the Malachite Sisters to play with. Team RWBY would be searching for someone who didn't have her appearance to the outside world, and the Malachite Sisters would think they were toying with their tormentor from so long ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't know how much time had passed. All she could see was differing light and the feeling of air. The sounds of her team greeting someone would have normally made her feel joy, but there was none as she knew that they were probably greeting the woman who was going to ruin her life utterly. From there, it was feeling her prison get dropped into the Beacon mail-room and then what must have been hours of being shifted and moved around as she fought to try and reform her body completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, she just managed to get her body back to its original shape when she felt the envelope she was trapped in get thrown onto some kind of surface. Her legs turned to jelly and she could do nothing as the envelope was picked up and taken somewhere else now. Another painful drop and she felt light and air rush in when the envelope was torn open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA brief moment of joy at being released from the stuffy prison was replaced with by fear. Just who were these people and what would they do with her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A toy?

I'm going to have some fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMilitia shared her sisters smile and grabbed the end of the envelope and shook it up and down. Weiss could do nothing as she fell down from the envelope and crashed onto the ground. Her Aura was the only thing that kept her from becoming a completely flat shape again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she looked at those cruel grins, however, Weiss soon wished that she could have been in the envelope for a little longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMilitia and Melanie Malachite had to stop themselves from laughing at the pathetic creature before them.

The Atlesian military woman probably had a lot of stress and had to work hard and now she'd have a toy to do with as she wished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she would leave for Atlas, she'd be taking what she thought was a toy with her, and Weiss would be in the worst position in her life.

Winter cared for her sister and might notice any news that Weiss had gone missing.

Especially so if it was Weiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust gag Neo with a spoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she knew someone who didn't have those kind of moral constraints. A woman who had no mercy or sympathy for the weak, even if they were family, and who'd happily take the chance to torture a toy like Weiss without a shred of guilt. The very same warrior who could strike fear into even Neo's heart, with her reputation for battle and death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven Branwen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tribal-leader was always on the move and rarely spoke to Huntsmen or Huntresses, and she kept secrets from them as well. She wouldn't bother to find out more about Atlesian experiments. Or maybe Neo could simply send Weiss as an 'apology' to Raven and win back some favour. Either way, it wasn't like Raven would pass up the chance to assert her supremacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeo could send over Weiss as herself-spinning a story about an heiress who knew nothing of struggle, or simply a prize for Raven-or she could send Weiss as Yang or Ruby. Raven had no care for her daughter, and may have an interest in breaking Summer's daughter. Or Neo could send Weiss and make her look like a member of Team SRTQ. Give Raven the chance to torment old teammates of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd need to think about it, but Raven had her benefits. Weiss would be far away from her teammates and she'd be spending her life under-foot to a woman with no morals beyond survival of the fittest. She'd make Weiss know her place quickly and use the new features of the tiny heiress to her advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what if Raven decided she didn't trust Neo? Or she decided to use Weiss as a trade with Beacon? Or even got upset over whatever form Neo chose for Weiss? She'd probably sell Neo out or let Weiss go. Neo didn't know. Branwen was deadly, but also unpredictable and not in the good way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe someone else would be a safer bet.

The Schnee heiress' father was hated by most and Menagerie was the home of the White Fang itself. What better place to make Weiss spend the rest of her days? A toy for someone who would probably think it was harmless fun, or even just desserts, to torment a toy that looked so much like Weiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKali Belladonna, the wife of the head of Menagerie, was a good option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMenagerie was far-away from Vale and there was the bonus of her being Blake's mother. Maybe Weiss' teammate would visit one day and the little Schnee would have to watch as her teammate was so close, yet would never hear or see Weiss' pleas for help. It could even be enough to break the little heiress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat form? Neo could easily up the brattiness (and maybe anti-Faunus words) of Weiss enough that Kali would be fine with breaking the toy in. Or she could choose one of the other Schnee children like Winter or Whitley and go off from there. Maybe she could even choose Adam Taurus' form and write of his threat towards her daughter, driving her away from the White Fang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe possibilities were endless! All she'd need to do was write a letter- maybe pretending to be a Faunus sympathising with the old White Fang- talking about a new invention they wanted to test out. Or cut out the excuse and just say she had shrunk a Schnee-or Taurus-and that their attitudes needed adjusted. A toy that could never break and would be moulded into whatever Kali wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss' money came from exploiting Faunus, and now she'd be spending the rest of her life serving a Faunus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr would she? Kali had a strong moral code. It was likely that she'd be like Raven, but for different reasons. Maybe she was against torture, or would see through the lie if Neo claimed it as a toy, and would help Weiss. She could even use Weiss as a way to contact her lost daughter. Neo wasn't going to lose the chance to see Weiss break, all so that Weiss could be helped out of her situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was only a possibility, and Neo was running out of names.

Or she would, if she didn't want to know what real pain felt like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeo was both terrified and excited at the same time. Weiss would be far-away from Vale and in the one place that no one would ever suspect.

Weiss would be forever gone from her friends and stuck worshipping Salem without mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled to herself as she imagined Weiss forced under-foot, kissing at the soles of a woman who planned the destruction of everything she held dear. Her spirit broken and her body a mere shell as she dedicated her life to minimising the pain she felt. Her existence depending on the whims and pleasures of someone like Salem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe down-side was that Neo may never see the results herself.

Matt Skye, was it? She didn't know much about them, but she could rely on them breaking Weiss Schnee in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr Neo could take a chance with thinking of someone else.

One option is going with minor female characters who only had one-off appearances.

They would probably give anything to get their hands on a miniature Schnee! Plus she had vague connections to the organization through Roman. She could arrange to have Weiss sent to them and they would take care of the rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeo smirked down at the unconscious heiress. This was to easy!

She wished they knew where she was. She had tried in vain to get their attention, but they completely overlooked her. Despite the situation, Weiss couldn\u2019t really blame them. After all, how often do people look at bugs on the floor? Suddenly the container she was in stopped moving and shook. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss stood up with determination. This isn\u2019t the end, Weiss though. I will see my friends again! Weiss started to form a plan. She would use what little aura she had to jump out of the box once it opened and find a hiding spot. Then she would find a scroll and contact her friends! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the lid of the container, now revealed to be only a cardboard box, opened up.

Yang hovered over head, casually flicking a long piece of rope into a good position- she held each end in her hands as she slowly placed her powerful feet either side of the worried Weiss. The heiress could only manage an unheard whimper as her friend casually moved her foot over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang innocently wiggled her toes into the mat, unable to see the face poking out between them as she lined up her skipping rope. Poor Weiss was unable to do anything as the blonde powerhouse swung the rope overhead- her body getting jammed heavily into the mats as the foot covering her transferred it's weight onto it's ball before hopping slightly off the ground. The rope swiftly slipped under the gap, quickly smearing the tiny ice queen with a swift swipe before Yangs already damp foot slammed back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith unnerving accuracy from her years of training, Yang hopped in place- counting under her breath as she repeatedly slammed her foot down upon the mat with a heavy wumf sound. If someone were to look carefully at her foot as the bouncing hard hitter jumped, they might of seen a tiny gum like substance getting pounded into the dirt- the unrecognisable form occasionally getting stuck to the pounding limb before getting scraped off onto the mat again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss was in hell as Yang diligently continued- each hop blurring into the next one as Yang nimbly bounced on the balls of her feet. The giant girls powerful digits 0would pinch and grind into the unfortunate living sticker, only to release it to be chewed out by the ball of her foot. It felt never ending as the counting closed in towards the hundred mark, the tortured Weiss slowly found herself sticking more and more often to the sweaty foot- until one unlucky hop left Weiss stretched between foot and mat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an almighty whack, the skipping rope slammed into Weiss- tossing her away from the skipping torment. Unable to process what was going on in such a short amount of time, the tiny girl barely managed to see Blake walking towards Yang before slamming into the falling foot. The ice queens damp form instantly splattered over the falling foot before getting pushed down into the all too familier mat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake stood still, a frown briefly crowned her face for a moment before lifting her foot up behind her. It felt like something had slapped onto her foot. Peeking behind her, the faunas tried to check what she had stepped on with a curious pout- hopping she hadn't stepped in something gross. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss felt a small inkling of hope as her friends eyes scanned over her tortured form- still a little dazed by how fast the events had happened, but hopeful to be found. It took a little while before the keen eyes fell on Weiss's outline, however, the eye's didn't show a hint of recognition. Weiss shuddered, trying desperately hard to say something, anything as Blake casually brushed off her foot of debris.<br>\r\n\"The mats are filthy-\" Yang announced, trailing the rope behind her as she watched Blake attempt to brush off debris from her slightly blackening foot without much success. \"Just like my mind right now- meow- notice the girls from the other schools? Some of them are like- crazy hot- might even 'switch sides'- especially with the whole shortage of men at the gym recently\" Yang purred, offering the skipping rope to Blake who was currently failing to unstick Weiss from her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFear slowly ebbed into Weiss as she saw the skipping rope again- as much as Blakes nails hurt, she hoped among hope that the black haired goddess wouldn't give up so easily. Had Blake known it was Weiss she was trying to unstick, she would of done just that- however- Weiss currently just looked like another piece of dirt that she had picked up by walking barefoot- something that would probably fall off or get washed off in the shower. The foot slowly and gracefully fell to the ground.<br>\r\n\"B-Blake- n-noo-\" Weiss managed to get out- before getting compressed once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake quickly trailed the rope into position- her feet eagerly getting into position ontop of Weiss.<br>\r\n\"Bet you can't do it one footed-\" Yang smirked, collapsing behind Blake. Shifting her feet, Blake accidentally showed off her 'Weiss tattoo' to Yang as she spoke over her shoulder. Weiss could barely whimper in the shadow of Blakes foot at Yang, who playfully teased the sticker with her own wiggling toes. <br>\r\n\"That's what I usually do-\" Blake spoke, \"50 on one foot, then 50 on the other\"<br>\r\n\"Oh dang- didn't notice. I must of been too busy watching your bouncing butt-\" Yang chided- \"which, by the way, the girl behind me has been checking out\" the blond smiled at her blushing friend, taking note of the girl behind her coughing awkwardly before leaving. \"not to say that's a bad thing\"<br>\r\n\"Shut up-\" Blake smiled, shifting her weight- once again burying Weiss's muffled cries. She paused- a cat like smile fell on her face \"Bet I can do a hundred each foot-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss's body groaned as the weight doubled- <br>\r\n\"N- no-\" She mumbled, as the pressure sharply increased before the foot she was stuck on flicked into the air. The rope sped past twice, too fast to process, before the mat rushed up to greet Weiss again. The worst weight she had experienced so far fell upon her with a vengeance, ensuring she was fully two dimensional before quickly lifting up again. Unable to control herself, Weiss went up with it, getting brief glints of light before slamming down again and again. The taste of her friends salty foot filled her mouth as the strange torment continued- too dazed to close her mouth again after all the effort she had put in to open it, Weiss just accepted what was happening and tried to tune it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1\" Yang cheered, leaning back from her seated position- \"Happy new year! Eheey- eheeyy- get it? The count down?\" Yang smiled, watching the final foot fall demolish the darkened sticker one last time. Thinking nothing of it, Yang took another sip of water raising her eyebrows up and down at the playful cringe from Blake.<br>\r\n\"That- might be the worst joke you've ever told-\" Blake chided- lifting her other foot to reveil Weiss. She only hovered it slightly over the ground as she prepared to continue- her balance was impeccable. Yang smiled, glancing down at the weird sticker for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeaten and broken, Weiss was desperate to get off the foot. Her brain barely processed that she was finally stuck to the foot that wouldn't touch the ground for a hundred jumps. It slowly clicked in as a relief, it was even slower to kick in that it was a chance to escape, and it was even slower again for it to kick in that Yang was approaching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One second- this thing was annoying me last time-\" Yang boomed overhead, her sweaty boobs swung close to the nervous sticker- before the blonds powerful fingers carefully pinched Weiss on the cheek, swiftly peeling her from Blakes overworked foot. It seemed like a struggle, the weird substance stretched painfully outwards in a weird way. \"Gross- what even is this-\" Yang shuddered, letting go. Weiss groaned, having a bad feeling in her stomach as Blake glanced down.<br>\r\n\"Don't know, I couldn't get it off earlier- it's fine-\" Blake shrugged, hovering her foot over the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout mercy, Blake slammed her foot into the ground- pushing down all her weight onto her tormented friend before dragging her foot backwards, trying to scrape the offending object from her foot. Weiss's gargled yells fell on deaf ears as Blake repeatedly STOMPED TWISTED and GROUND down the pest, eventually feeling some progress as the object slowly slid over her damp feet towards her toes- which quickly wiggled and squeezed the wad of Weiss in disgust as Blake attempted to kick it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlopping down on the mat once more, Weiss twitched in disgust as she weakly drooled out her friends foot sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally-\" Blake mewed, wriggling her toes happily as she prepared to start again, \"One hundred more right?\" Blake smirked, not caring where Weiss had landed.<br>\r\n\"Yup!\" Yang smiled, slowly scooting back into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss groaned, her body slowly coming back together as a shadow fell over her again. A sinking feeling flooded her stomach as she noticed what the shadow was caused by-<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>By the time Blake\u2019s toes finally lifted away with one more good twist, the heat and pressure of their embrace, together with the sweat and grime that had accumulated across Weiss\u2019s tiny body had ironed the tiny heiress onto the mat, reducing her to nothing more than an insignificant smear of white and tan left behind in the gradually disappearing crater of the Faunus\u2019 footstep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her teammates moved away Weiss struggled to move, only to realise with a sense of rising dread that she could no longer even twitch her body. The near constant state of gradually reforming she had felt ever since that first footfall from Pyrrha seemed to have finally surrendered to the sheer magnitude of the crushing she had just received, or maybe her body had just decided that this was her true fated form. Whatever the case, she wasn\u2019t just crushed anymore, she was broken, immobile, and unable to even try to defend herself as yet another shadow loomed above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping up onto the mat, Velvet Scarlatina didn\u2019t see or feel a thing as her nylon-clad foot feel upon her unfortunate junior. Below her Weiss could do nothing but watch in terror and despair as the dark mass fell, pushing her deep into the mat once again as a fresh wave of heat and sweat was squeezed out over her twisted body. The nylons scratched at her skin as they forced her down, but unlike previous occasions the fencer didn\u2019t feel like she was at risk of becoming adhered to them, her limbs not even shifting as the mat below continued to maintain its hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the past, footfalls had come and passed relatively quickly, but this time the foot above her slammed down and then remained where it was, the pressure slowly rising as the foot sunk deeper into the mat, and the heat and sweat around Weiss rose to sauna-like levels. If a sauna smelt like tonnes of unwashed laundry and equally unwashed bodies. High above, Velvet had stopped to wait for the rest of her team to catch up, and as the seconds ticked by she began to absentmindedly tap her right foot, remaining blissfully unaware as her large sole pounded down on the tiny heiress over and over again, and smeared the unfortunate girl ever deeper into the spongy fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an eternity for Weiss, but just a few seconds for the giant Faunus, the older student finally stepped off as her friends approached, giving her little victim a momentary hope for freedom before that hope was crushed by the barefoot of Coco as CFVY\u2019s leader stepped up beside her teammate. The fashionista didn\u2019t stay for as long as Velvet, and she didn\u2019t tap her foot but her bare sole still added its share to Weiss\u2019s pain and humiliation as it dumped sweat and grime upon her and pressed down with crushing force as the comparatively massive girl stalked off with the rest of her team. For a single moment, the heiress watched CFVY leave, only to have that moment shattered by another crushing weight slamming down upon her as yet another group of students stepped up onto the mat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat followed was hours of trampling as the tiny girl was trodden on again and again, intermixed with crushing from other body parts as countless busts and derrieres fell upon her in an endless cycle of darkness and pain. Struggling to maintain consciousness as her world was dominated by the smell and heat of her fellow students, interspersed with the occasional teacher or older guest, Weiss felt like she\u2019d been crushed by every girl in Beacon at least once, if not more as some girls seemed to constantly come back for more. Oddly enough, as difficult as it was to keep track she felt like every male in the academy had somehow managed to step around her without incident, even as every last female seemed to zero in on her like it was their personal duty to make her life hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe visiting Team NDGO had stopped above her to do their stretches and light yoga routine, Nebula and Octavia dropping their amble buttocks onto her one moment, and Drew and Gwen crushing her beneath their generous chests the next, even as all four girls had continued to trample her beneath their feet. Neon Katt had chosen her exact spot to do jumping jacks for ten minutes straight, her feet landing on Weiss over and over again with an accuracy that almost seemed deliberate. The girls from Team ABRN, two of her earliest crushers, had returned to hold a mock battle with an unintended participant, bodies crashing down upon her over and over again as she was crushed beneath every body part imaginable, sometimes with both girl\u2019s weight at once as they wrestled for dominance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat girl Ruby was friends with, Emerald, had sat on Weiss for 600 sit-ups straight, absolutely drenching her with the ass sweat pouring through her tan booty shorts. Her teammates Cinder, and another goth-looking girl the fencer didn\u2019t know had arrived soon after, clearly having already completed the majority of their workout as their sweaty bodies joined the tanned girl. The shorter one\u2019s feet stepped directly into the crater left behind by Emerald\u2019s butt, both of them coming to rest on the shrunken dust-wielder as she scrubbed them back and forth to remove some of the excess sweat, an action copied moments later as she stepped off and her larger team leader took her place. The red-clad villain was saying something about a plan and timing or something, but it was all lost on Weiss as she was drowning in their collective sweat, overwhelmed by the smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirls she was more familiar with had gotten their turn as well. Pyrrha had returned to crush the tiny heiress with her ass as she sat down to pull on her shoes and Nora had come by twice to trample her with unmatched enthusiasm. Glynda\u2019s putrid nylons had soaked their sweat and heat deeply into Weiss\u2019s body as she stood on her for several minutes to examine Beacon\u2019s students at work, the massive instructor absentmindedly shuffling her soles before finally stalking off. Even her teammates had come back to crush her again, both Blake and Yang returning a truly amazing number of times to trample and crush her beneath their increasingly sweaty forms, eventually joined by Ruby as the younger girl finally finished her studies and got her own chance to torture her partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the day reached its end, Weiss had been rendered completely unrecognisable, even to close inspection, her features smeared into a stain indistinguishable from the hundreds of stains that covered the extensive mat. The population of the gym had gradually decreased and as closing time neared the heiress was given one more good trampling by the last few female students as they filed out of the building, the very last being her own teammates as they crushed her one at a time. Ruby\u2019s utterly soaked stockings her last visitors as they left her behind in their sweaty imprint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the lights finally flicked off and everything fell silent, Weiss was left only with the thought that she needed to escape, that she needed to be anywhere else but here when the next day came.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The going was painfully slow for the heiress, her splattered form barely making any progress to reform in the darkness. Weiss struggled against the bindings of the mat, motivated by the thought of repeating this torture for eternity. The fruits of her labor almost paid off, managing to peel slightly out of the mat. Sadly for Weiss, the strain of everything that had happened finally caught up to her as she soon passed out.<br>\r\n\"N-no- s-so c-lose\" She muttered, reaching up with a flattened hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss was dragged into a deep sleep, not waking up even when the lights came on. Her tiny body was somehow able to avoid a few footfalls as she slept, before one just barely scrapped over her- ripping the tiny Weiss from the mat completely. Weiss's eyes shot open in pain as she felt herself get scraped off, her eyes watering slightly. The pain was soon replaced with fear as she attempted to move her still 2D body, but she just ended up barely twitching. Looking at her arms, although dirty, and 2D, they looked normal, a glimmer of hope shone in as she realized that she at least looked human, albeit a sticker of one. The freedom of coming loose from the mat was quickly overcast by the all too familiar shadow of a foot. The tiny speck could only whimper as Penny stepped down upon her, the hope of escaping from the mat flickered as she was once more compressed by the ball of another girls foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grime and dirt gathered from the previous tramples must of done something as she didn't feel like she was sticking to the mat or the foot quite so easily. Her body just meekly hung from Penny's foot as she lifted off, falling away partway through the step only to get stepped on from a slightly different location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe robotic girl continued to chew out the tiny sticker that was loosing its stick under her foot like a hydraulic press. Every step, Weiss would move down the foot, every step Weiss would be flipped into a different position. After four steps the poor sticker made it to the arch of Penny's foot, lacking in pressure she almost instantly came off in the next step- drifting helplessly in the wind currents before just barely getting her legs caught under the heel. The pressure caused Weiss to gasp as her stomach was stepped on, her eyes watering up as she joined Penny for a few more steps before getting accidentally scraped off by a minor weight ajustment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss screwed her eyes shut as soon as she saw Pyrhaa and Nora overhead, knowing what was about to happen. She only opened her eyes after she felt Pyrhaa step on her left side. She peered up at the goddess that had stepped on her for a moment as the tiny Weiss attempted to say something, only to get wisked away once more. Her tiny form peeled off mid step only to get caught under the toes of Nora as she energetically wandered next to Pyrhaa, lost in conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Pyrhaa and Nora were completely unaware of what they were doing as they trampled  the paper this Weiss, her fluttering form constantly sticking and peeling off the two girls feet. Nora's energetic swinging legs seemed to create the perfect wind to keep Weiss from escaping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChewed by Nora's toes, crushed under the Amazons heavy heel, smashed under the ball of Nora's foot. It was never ending, occasionally she'd stick to the same place for a few steps, imbuing horror in the tiny Weiss's heart- only for her to be thrown out into a different location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss didn't know when it happened, but she soon realized she was being trampled by other students as a damp sock replaced the previously bare feet. Her body stuck to the fibers for a few steps, only coming loose to get slammed under a boot for a few steps. Every time she was freed from one student she would instantly get picked up by another. She didn't get much chance to process things as she was pounded into oblivion. She almost felt glad as she just barely recognized Ruby's foot. Weiss's weak fingers quickly curled around the nylon fibers without her really thinking about it as she crashed into the underside of the giant foot. She just wanted to escape the constant trampling of strangers, risking the chance of getting crushed into the nylon. Regret slid into the tinies head just as Ruby put her foot down. Weiss's fingers were instantly forced to hold on as the weight crushed them into the threads of the nylons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot noticing Weiss squish under her foot, Ruby clumsily made her way through the crowd. An onlooker would of seen it as a funny scene as the leader of RWBY danced around, occasionally getting spun, but for Weiss it was hell as she was demolished under the heavy foot falls, the twisting foot, the clumsy unpredictable steps and the sweat and smell from Ruby's old nylons. It was obvious that Ruby had been putting off doing her laundry again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaand free!\" Ruby announced, hopping out of the crowd. \"Why on earth is is this crowded?\" She asked out-loud, unable to hear the sticker under foot screaming as she stood still. <br>\r\n\"Beacon has a very good gym, I believe it's usually quite popular around this time\" Penny announced, bobbing up and down on the balls of her feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation continued for a few moments before Ruby was on the move again. Weiss's tattered form dangling from the ball of the hyper girls foot, unable to let go as she was dragged over the mats. Weiss screamed internally as the mat floor was replaced with the floor of a treadmill. Her mouth hung agape for a moment before her body clicked into desperation<br>\r\n\"RU-\" She attempted to scream her leaders name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby hopped onto the treadmill, silencing her teammates cries as she began pushing buttons, unsure exactly what she was doing as the treadmill started to point upwards. Ruby ignored it, pushing the other button for speed, wiggling her toes happily as she felt the machine begin to move. She began to walk, focusing on the balls of her feet as she chatted with Penny on the other machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby panted as she began doing her last set of rows, pulling on the rope one last time. Her feet rolled upwards as she pulled upwards revealing the smear on the ball of her foot, it wasn't even remotely human looking.<br>\r\n\"Haaa- I swear this was easier before\" She panted, sweat dribbling down her face.<br>\r\n\"I am most surprised, from previous analysis I assumed you wouldn't try this hard in a gym environment\" Penny stated, barely noticing Ruby rubbing her feet over the mat while resting on one of the not very popular rowing machines.<br>\r\n\"Eh? Really? I kinda have to be in shape to do this job, and this way I get to eat cookies-\" Ruby replied, almost licking her lips as she rolled off the machine. Her body instantly spread out as she collapsed into a sweaty heap, lying on her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss finally got her first break today, her mind drifted as she baked on Rubies dripping wet foot. The entire day had made her see how good she had it on the mats, at least she had breaks in between. This was constant oblivion, pounded under the foot of her leader who obviously favored cardio over strength training. Half hour walk, an hour running, an eternity squashed under foot as her tormentor curled a dung-bell, dug into and grinder under for 20 pushups, a standing break and finally rows on a rowing machine. She couldn't take much more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, one cool down walk on the treadmill then I think I'll call it a day-\" Ruby stated, not moving, \"After my body decides to move-\" She groaned, not noticing the gum on her foot suddenly panicing at the thought of more exercise followed by being in a boot. Penny however, noticed the strange blob on Ruby's foot. Originally she thought that it was just a hole in the nylons but on closer inspection it looked like Ruby had picked something up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One moment- friend Ruby appears to of stepped in something-\" She stated, reaching down. <br>\r\n\"Hu? What is it?\" Ruby asked, glancing over her shoulder as Penny pinched Weiss- tugging the poor thing from Ruby's stocking. Penny looked it over for a moment,<br>\r\n\"A faded sticker of some kind-\" She stated, tuggling slightly and noticing Weiss's elasticity, \"Or... putty?\" She tilted her head, causing Ruby to look it over. <br>\r\n\"Eh- it's textures like a sticker, but it's image is kinda faded. Whatever-\" Both girls shrugged it off, dropping Weiss in an overfull the bin on their way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss was balanced on top of the pile, close to falling out. As much as she didn't want to be in a bin, she knew this was the best chance to reform. Her body slowly began to regain it's 2D sticker shape when...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Weiss felt her body slowly unfold, her body aching from the torment she had just experienced. As soon as her mouth began to reform, she flashed a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs bad as things were, she couldn't get stepped on from this point. A feeling of safety shone on her, watching someone drop a candy bar near her. This was still risky, and gross, but it beat the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smile faded, as she saw Nora aiming a plastic bottle towards the tinies direction.<br>\r\n\"Wait-\" Weiss gulped, realising how close to the edge she was. She was painfully aware of how many people were walking past. The worst part was, she wasn't hearing the floof sound of a mat, she was hearing the loud thuds of someone walking on wood. Weiss struggled to reform as Nora wound up her shot, \"Nora- no!\" Weiss paniced, knowing her luck all too well as the bottle flew towards her, smacking her tiny form off the bin and onto the floor.<br>\r\n\"Woosh! Nothing but net!\" Nora called out, grinning as Weiss was quickly crushed underfoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang didn't even feel Weiss get obliterated under her meaty heel. The tiny sticker girl quickly joining the other junk that had attached to the powerhouses foot. Weiss wrythed in pain as she was put under the worst pressure she had ever experienced. The heel of Yang's foot had been the bane of her existance on the mats, easily being one of the heaviest experiences she had the displeasure to experience. Now, on the wooden floor, with no mat to protect her, the pressure was unfathomably worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could do nothing but whimper as she lifted up with Yangs foot with no sign of unsticking as the giant girl slammed her into the floor again and again without blinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang hopped onto the mats, not hearing Weiss's complaints as she lead with the heel Weiss was on. The conversation above that Yang was having was drowned out by the tons of flesh, followed by the sound of the foot sticking to the mat. Weiss felt her eyes shake with the power of every step as she slowly felt a thin layer of dirt cover her back. It was the first time she wished she would stick to the mat again, even if she would be further away from her friends and less likely to be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, when Yang stopped she rested her weight on her other foot, raising the foot Weiss was on as she rested on the ball of that foot. Weiss inhaled the heavy scent of foot for a moment, before exhaling, barely getting a look at the busy gym as she attempted to look behind her. The tiny ones body unable to so much as twitch as her unknowing torturer spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I think I'm going to do some weight lifting today- I did way too much cardio yesterday!\" Yang announced, \"Need to keep it up ready for the gun show, aw yeah-\" She spoke happily, Weiss could only assume Yang gave a little pose to show off her strength.<br>\r\n\"I can go for some dumbells-\" Blake nodded, out of view of Weiss. <br>\r\n\"Haha, I'm going to beat my squat record!\" The buxom blonde called out, not noticing Weiss's renewed struggles as she stomped down into a powerful pose- planting her feet firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss didn't even notice the painful stomped over the mats. Her brain was blank as she struggled to process what was happening. Weight lifting, Yang was known for being the strongest in the group. How much extra pressure was that going to be? The tiny girl didn't even attempt to struggle as fear over came her. She didn't fully notice how long Yangs foot had been staying still until the pressure began to build up. Weiss quickly tried to bite, to scratch, to scram but it was no use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBearing some warmup weights on her shoulders, Yang exhaled as she went down. No one paid attention to the girls heel sinking slightly deeper into the mat as she pushed down on the mat to lift the weight up, bouncing slightly only to come back down.<br>\r\n\"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten\" Yang counted, not breaking a sweat as she easily put the weight back. It always felt weird using light weights, but it was important to build up to lifting something heavy. She wandered around, stretching as she wandered around, waiting for Blake to do her set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Yang wandered, the demolished smear under her foot twitched. That was the worst weight she had ever experience, the shier will and fear of going through that again gave Weiss some tiny amount of movement between footfalls- but it was no use, she was far too stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake finished her set just as easily, before helping Yang lift the heavier weights onto the bar. Weiss screamed all the way as Yangs foot constantly steam rolled over her every time she stood up with a weight. Weiss was frantic now as Yang took her position. The tiny knew it was impossible to avoid, but she found some comfort in the vent. She squinted her eyes shut in preperation as the weight increased. Heavier and heavier, obliterating all thought as she just lay under Yang with a silent cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One\" Yang spoke, easily going down and up. Weiss feeling the momentum of the dip. \"Two\" Yang yawned slightly, finding it still far too easy. \"Three-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like an eternity before Yang put the weight back. She wandered away again, letting Blake use it. It was light enough for Blake to keep up at this point. This time, there was no struggle from Weiss. When the foot rose up, a paper thin faded mark could be made out. Anyone with super hearing who had their ear to Yangs heel might beable to hear the deflated noise of Weiss as she struggled to understand what was happening. The only thought in her head was that she wanted to be free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang set a few more weights up with Blake after Blake had finished her reps. She quickly got in position once again, as usual she didn't notice Weiss's struggles as she rolled the weight onto her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake, noticing almost everything about her friends breathing, the small amount of sweat on her friends head, the look of ease on Yangs face, almost every detail was taken in without effort by Blake. Her perceptive eyes always taking in more detain then most, however, not even the perceptive Blake bothered to notice how deep Yangs foot sank into the mat each rep. She only took note a few times as Yangs foot slid into a better position, planting itself down in her well practiced lifting technique. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one imagined the friction that caused, or the torment that was happening as Yang slowed down with the heavier weight set.<br>\r\n\"Oooone-\" Yang smiled, finally getting into the heavier sets. \"Twooooo\" She straighted, making sure her back was bent over backwards to avoid spine injury . \"Threee-\" She ajusted her feet, barely noticing how much harder it was to slide over the mat with the additional weight. \"Fouuuur, Fiiiiive, Siiiiiix, Seeeeven, Eiiiiight, Niiiiine aaaaaaaand Ten!\" Yang chirped, popping the weight off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang hopped away from the weight towards her water bottle, her feet plopping heavily on the floor. If you scraped some of the dirt away you might see a small discolouration on her foot where Weiss's obliterated form was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long before Blake finished her set, helping Yang put on a lot more weight. This was where the two decided to split their training, Yang doing 3 reps, 3 sets on this heavier weight while Blake stuck with doing 10 reps for 3 sets on the previous weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss could do nothing as Yang got back into position. Planting her feet firmly on the ground, Yang had no idea what she was about to do as she rolled the weight onto her shoulders with a more serious face. Her feet sank deeper then ever as she exhaled, her voice barely strained as she dipped down. Her heels raised slightly before slamming back on the ground to push herself upwards.<br>\r\n\"Oooooooone\" Yang started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang grunted, dropping the bar on the ground with exaustion,<br>\r\n\"S-sorry to keep you weighting...?\" Yang choaked out a pun, having spent a good while slowly struggling to get her last set in with Blake spotting her. Blake just rolled her eyes,<br>\r\n\"Sure sure, nice job on breaking your record\" she announced. Yang grinned, weakly slapping Blakes ass before wandering towards the changing room. \"Do you need to slap my ass every session-?\" the cat winced,<br>\r\n\"Every session- it's tradition now-\" Yang panted in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo trace of Weiss remained. The silent foot continued on without hassle, unaware of the demolished girl still attached as Yang wandered over to her shoes. With no trace, Weiss was utterly helpless and unable to get anyones attention after experiencing the worst hell imaginable. Her eyes widened slightly as Yang slid her bare foot into a well worn sneaker- vowing to shower when she gets back.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Struggling as much as she could, her tiny body refused to peel off the mat- however- the tiny twitches she did manage after a few hours gave her hope and the will to push on. However- it wasn't to be as she watched a few of the remaining staff members enter from another room. Curious and fearful of the heavy shoe falls of the staff members, Weiss redoubled her efforts, not wanting to be stood on again. Another twitch sent a shiver of joy, her eyes glanced towards a tired looking female staff member who grabbed the corner of another mat and dragged it towards a large storage cupboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss could do nothing as the blissfully unaware girl grabbed the mat Weiss was glued to, tossing it onto the tiny pile before wandering over towards another mat. The tiny mark could only watch as another mat was tossed ontop of her, and another, and another. Soon, the weight became greater then all of the girls that had trampled her that day, ironing the tiny down flatter then ever as the lights were turned off. The tiny heiress finally fell into unconsciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss awoke as her mat was getting dragged across the floor, getting slipped close to the door once again before being stomped on by the trainers of the personal trainer that dragged her into place. She felt ingrained, too weak to do anything as she gazed with a sense of dread at the open doors of the gym as some morning goers took their shoes off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStomped twisted and kneaded into the ground, Weiss could do nothing as she was flattened endlessly by feet- her body refusing to budge from it's position as she feared. After a short wave of people came a tiny gap as someone she kind of recognized came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay Zendong slipped her shoes off and wandered inside, her toes wiggling inside the battered cloth before entering the gym. With her one eye still covered by her beanie, the girl entered the gym in her usual attire. Her tired feet landing either side of Weiss as her toes peeked out of the socks. Unaware that she had a disgusted admirer, the sniper aimlessly glanced downward, noticing the mark. Not thinking too much about it, she rubbed her big toe across Weiss's face, pressing down like she was trying to kick it off before smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss watched as the girl stood to her side, purposefully resting her rancid sock ontop of her before darting to the side, her other foot slammed into the poor smear before darting sidewards again. The tiny Schnee couldn't even cry out as she was pounded under the larger girls feet as she darted from side to side. She could hear the girl counting each painful side step before a little buzz went off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay clicked her stop watch, smiling to herself-<br>\r\n\"New record-\" she grinned, her toes ground down on her 'marker' as she wandered over towards the bikes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss lay battered in the lint and sweat from the team BRNZ member as the next few feet skipped her. The peace wasn't to last though as her own sister came into view.<br>\r\n\"Not you-\" Weiss whimpered, watching her sister wander over still in heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith widening eyes, Weiss watched the heel of her sisters boot hover over her before slamming down, plowing her deeper then ever before into the mat- the pressure was far greater then anyone she had experienced. Worse still, Winter decided to stop ontop of her to look around.<br>\r\n\"Not here either-\" Winter spoke with concern for her sister, glancing around before twisting her boot off the tiny girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmashed, weak and unable to move, the tiny mark could only watch as her sister passed through a joking gaggle of girls, all of who decided to stomp around the micro, stomping and wiping there feet over her cruelly before wandering away. Unable to take much more of this, Weiss attempted to escape once more as her mat was grabbed by someone she didn't recognise. The blue beret of Ciel Soleil overshadowed the tiny smear as she dragged the tiny and the mat into another room.<br>\r\n\"Good- still on time\" Ciel spoke, checking her wristwatch as class began. The teacher, knowing she'll get Ciels wrath, quickly started the yoga session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTossing her headwear aside, the strict keeper of Penny stepped up onto Weiss, the pale underside of her toes mixed with the darker skin above as she started to follow instructions. Hopeful and nervous, Weiss watched the giant girl through the gaps in her toes, feeling the powerful digits slowly pinch at her as Ciel rocked forward onto her tip toes, taking a deep breath before looking to her watch to count the seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDread filled the tiny girls mind as she didn't feel herself coming out at all from the harsh pinching. Her dread only grew as the giant girl stepped forward, showing off the stretched out blue yoga pants that dawned her rear. Without hesitation, Ciel dropped down, pressing Weiss into the direct center of the giant girls ass. A musky smell wafted over her as she complained into her new prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make it worse, Ciel was muttering the seconds out loud, making each second feel longer. Weiss felt like she was going to lose her mind under this girl as she switched over to the next pose- informing the class that it was time to switch a second before the teacher did. Thankfully the instructor had been told of the annoying time keeping and instructed the class to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss couldn't even shudder as two hands fell either side of her unrecognizable body. She watched Ciel coming down towards her, though surprisingly it was her face to come in contact with the tiny. Pressed into the darker skinned girls cheek, Weiss felt embarrassment flood her system as the giant girl nuzzled into her,<br>\r\n\"1- 2- 3-...\" Ciel started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before Weiss was taken away from the relativily nice experience only to be flattened out over the girls harsh toes again. The counting got into her head as the time keeper kept going. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the lesson had ended, the tiny smear of a girl had been plastered across ever section of Ciels body, yet her body remained trapped in the mat. Weiss looked up with hazy eyes as her unaware assailant dragged the mat back into place. The small heiress scanned the giant girls sea blue eyes for some kind of help but in the end was left to be trampled once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDays passed as Weiss was used and abused by every girl there was, she occasionally heard about the search for her but ultimately that faded away. Weiss was oddly happy to see Yang wander in one day with a personal trainers uniform, taking up a part time job while studying for some extra money. However, the giant girl always seemed to guide girls over to the trapped stains mat, almost like she sensed her there as she trampled her sodden bare feet over Weiss.Every night, Yang would be the one to put her away, piling stacks upon stacks of mats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss was washed, cleaned and buffed up multiple times as everyone used and abused her. Her hope finally faded as May came back, her socked toes wriggling in their confinement as they explored the tiny girls body.<br>\r\n\"Damn- looks like that marks pretty much gone-\" She mumbled, \"I'll find something else to use-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss swore under her breath as Ruby's soaking nylons fell ontop of her, wringing out the days sweat as she walked to another piece of equipment. Blake stomped down with her bare feet, the same feet that had cemented her all that time ago, followed by Yang who did her usual hop. It felt like it was blending together- the tiny girl could only hope for some kind of change as more people came over to do situps over her crushed form-</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Eventually, after a few weeks of this torture for Weiss, what could only be described as a miracle occurred for the huntress. After a while, the teachers closed down the gym for three days in order to renovate and repaint the room for other students. During this time, all the equipment was placed in storage while this was going on. Luck was smiling down for Weiss during this time period as the mat she was stuck on was placed on the very top of the pile of mats. As she waited for the next round of torture to happen to her, she failed to notice her body slowly but surely regain its original, smaller shape. All Weiss did during this time period and enjoy what felt like peace that she had gotten lucky with. All she did was lay there and contemplate how her life came to all these students walking on her, sitting on her, and more. Eventually, the morning of the third day came for her, bringing her supposed break to a close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Damn it. This was the best rest of my life.\" Weiss said to herself. \"Why did it have to end?\" Weiss just layer there, remembering being stepped on by Ruby and her teammates, all of them unaware just who they where stepping on. \"I'm still curious just how I survived without any food or water, but I will not complain. I guess I'll just have to get used to this new life. Hopefully I'll forget my old life and accept being used by many others.\" Weiss said with a sigh. \"If only my body would reform.\" she said, bringing her right arm up to her face to cover her eyes. Wait... Her arm? Looking at her arm in shock, she was surprised to see that it was close to its original shape. \"Oh my Oum! I might be able to escape this after all. Oh what a wonderful discovery.\" Weiss said. She struggled with all her might that final day. She spent the entire morning lifting and moving her body after it being squashed for so long as it was. She then spent the entire night getting all of her motor skills back in order. By the time the morning came, Weiss was able to move almost as well as she used to, just a little bit rusty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Okay, I have my motor skills back. Now I just have to figure out how to prevent this and find a way  to be safe.\" Weiss said to herself. Suddenly, lights came on, knocking the huntress out of her thoughts. Looking around, Weiss saw her only hope coming her way. \"Oh my Oum, it's Yang. It I can get her attention, I can finally get some help.\" Weiss said. The pile of mats Weiss was on was pretty high up. It made Weiss level with Yang's eyes, which just might be able to save her from rounds of torture. Yang finally reached the pile with an even look on her face. Weiss started jumping and waving her hands all around in order to get the titanic blonde's attention. Yang finally looked right at her and a small look of recognition came upon her. \"Weiss?\" she boomed above her.  \"Yes!\" Weiss said with a smile on her face. Yang couldn't believe she was seeing her old teammate alive and well again, only smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh Oum, what happened to you, Weiss? After you went missing, we searched for weeks trying to find you. Most others gave up hope, but we didn't. Ruby, Blake, and I always kept looking for you. What happened? How did you get so small?\" Yang asked. Weiss told her about all that had happened to her before finally being found. \"Oh my Oum, I'm soooo sorry, Weiss. I didn't know you were here. If I had, I would have brought you back and found a way to help you. Hold on, I need to go tell the others.\" Yang said, giving Weiss a small hug to show her sorrow. Yang quickly brought Weiss back to their dorm room, where the others where just about to start their day. \"Hold on you gals, I have important news. I found Weiss!\" Yang quickly said, stopping both of them in there place. \"What do you mean? Where is we?!\" Ruby asked, excited and worried at the same time. \"Well, here's the thing.\" Yang said before bringing her fist out with Weiss standing in it waving at the titanic huntresses in the room. \"Hey guys!\" Weiss yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The other two couldn't believe what they were seeing. After finally finding their tiny friend, they listened to Weiss's story, feeling extreme guilt over their own part in what happened to her. Seeing that they had to do something, the trio quickly headed off to where Ozpin was at the time. They quickly went into his office and explained the whole situation to him, not leaving anything out. \" Well, I don't know how this happened to you, Weiss, but we will do everything in our power to fix whatever is wrong with you. I'm just grateful that you were able to regain your shape after being stuck like that for so long. Thank Oum that you were given those three days of rest. Now, I'm sure at your current size, you can't do much and risk losing you again, so we are first going to put an unbreakable tracking chip on you so that this never happens again. Next, we are going to assign you a keeper to look out for your safety. Finally, we will be contacting your family about finding you. Again, I am terribly sorry for the horrible ordeal you went through. You and your team can take the rest of the week to catch up with each other while we sort this out. In the meantime, I think it's time that you all go to the cafeteria. You must assuredly be hungry by now.\" After placing the chip on Weiss's back, it was decided that Yang would be Weiss's keeper and protector. Finally, the reunited RWBY headed of to the cafeteria to tell everyone the great news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's next?</span></div></div>",

The cat girls eyes slowly tracked downwards towards the 2D Weiss, her tiny form flopping between her toes. Not knowing what it was, and not knowing that shrinking could occur, Blake assumed she had stepped in someones litter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith slight scowl, she casually tried to scrape it off onto the mat without luck- the substance just seemed to stick to her foot further.<br>\r\n\"Gross...\" Blake complained, clenching her toes against Weiss's chest- somehow winding the trapped sticker.<br>\r\n\"B-Blake-\" Weiss choked, watching Blakes other foot come down harshly on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a twist of one foot, and quickly raising the other foot, she successfully snapped the sticker from one foot- only to find it loosely stuck to her other foot. A look of pure panic drifted over Blakes face as she noticed the sticker might actually be gum- her foot violently shaking the sodden mess of Weiss away from her.<br>\r\n\"What's up?\" Yang spoke up, noticing her friend hopping around on one leg<br>\r\n\"Gum- someone... spat gum on the mats for someone to step on...\" Blake gritted her teeth, looking disgusted as she looked around for the gum to throw it in the bin- saving someone else from stepping in it.<br>\r\n\"What? Gross-! You could say you were in quite the sticky situation!\" Yang grinned, wandering over to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss found herself flipping off Blakes toes, tumbling a small way before hitting something that was noticeably skin and noticeably sweaty. Her weak body glanced up a girls back as she slowly slid downward towards the mats again. However, Weiss soon realized how cruel fate could be as she quickly got tunnel vision, the light getting blocked out by something that could only be the underware of her new captor. The last sight she saw was a giant hand coming back, tugging at the tiny girls prison, tossing her down into the dank butt cheeks of this new girl. The musk making the tiny Weiss's eyes water as she slid deeper- her captors tight underwear ensuring there wouldn't be escape any time soon. The walls quickly closed in, flatting Weiss down once more.<br>\r\n\"Noooooooo\" She choked-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoco stretched her arms as she lent back, suppressing a yawn as she relaxed, watching her team exercise for a moment. Her sports wear was oddly stylish, well established designer labels gleamed over her attire. She seemed to be careful not to create sweat marks, even when exercising- opting to get top of the line sweat absorbers around her body to protect her clothes and her style.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding back a yawn, she rolled over. Her socked toes digging into the mat as she pointed her ass to the sky. Her sunglasses somehow staying with her as she rested on her elbows to read her book. She didn't bother with a timer, relying on her sense of 'I'm bored of this' rather then a time limit. She subconsciously clenched a few times as she felt Weiss's papery form tickle her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss couldn't help but thrash whatever limb she could right after it reformed, just to move her head slightly to avoid drowning in sweat. While fashionable, the sportswear Coco opted for aimed more for style rather then practicality. While her panties were absorbent to an almost magic extent, they didn't reach into the depths of the confident girls ass. Weiss's garbled cries were crushed out of existence by slightly annoyed clenches. The crushed girl could do nothing as she drifted deeper- the flattened girls body soon brushing up against something she really didn't want to be near.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoco's anus twitched. Biting her tongue, Weiss tried to pull away, trying to resist flailing as she reformed.</span></div></div>",

Spread out below her row upon row, was a field of exercise machines and sweaty, moving bodies oblivious to her presence. Feet slammed down over and over again as treadmills were pushed to their max, or rose and fell as stair machines pumped, butts ground against the seats of exercise bikes and rowing machines alike, breasts bounced up and down and side to side, and in every direction sweat flowed and breaths came in short frantic bursts. And the heiress knew that no matter where she fell she would surely perish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResigned to her fate, Weiss chose to close her eyes and wait for the end, deciding that she\u2019d rather not see her death approaching like this. Not when she was dying in such a meaningless way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment the tiny fencer\u2019s descent ended her body was filled with a burst of pain unlike anything she\u2019d felt before, every nerve screaming at her in agony as she went from terminal velocity to a dead stop in an instant. It felt as if every part of her had been crushed to paste, from her toes to her skull, and her only solace was that this pain couldn\u2019t possibly last for long before death claimed her. And yet, as seconds ticked by and the pain in her body began to slowly give way to numbness, Weiss found herself still oddly conscious, finally cracking open her eyes to see what she had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShifting her near flattened pupils, it took a long moment for the shrunken girl to realise what she had become, looking at the odd tannish puddle of gum spreading out across the bike seat on which she had landed in confusion, before realising what she was looking at was her own body splattered across the seat. Her clothes had been shredded in the landing, slipping off the side of the bike and falling to the ground below, leaving her tiny flattened face looking up from the very centre of the seat while the rest of her had spread out across its expanse and morphed to its shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked beyond words, Weiss could only stare in a combination of revulsion and intrigue as she felt her extremities start to twitch and retract at an agonisingly slow rate, the instant of crushing force that had seen her reduced to this state, juxtaposed against a reformation that might take hours. She need not have concerned herself with the time however as a colossal shadow swept over her, cast by an impossibly long leg reaching for the pedal on the far side of the bike, and quickly replaced with an even deeper shadow as a distinctly feminine body rose above the seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVocal chords too crushed to even attempt to scream, Weiss could only stare in silent terror as the seemingly endless expanse of [Name]\u2019s buttocks descended towards her defenceless form.</span></div></div>",

Weiss\u2019 senses were assualted by what she could be described as the worst taste and smell she has ever experienced in her life. Meanwhile, Emerald was pedaling as fast as she could while listening to loud music completely unaware of her tiny prisoner. Even if Weiss could speak, Emerald wouldn\u2019t be able to hear her between her voice being muffled by Emerald\u2019s pillow-like ass cheeks and Emerald listening to her music. Weiss was in a world of pain as she crushed and grinded into the sweaty seat. She couldn\u2019t even guess the amount of bones she has broken or fractured. She was just able to lie there as gallons of ass sweat flowed down her throat and into her stomach. She would have thrown up if she wasn\u2019t so damaged. Suddenly Emerald stop and then got off.

Weiss tried to call out but was too broken to even muster out a yelp, not like Cinder would hear or care if she heard Weiss. Cinder began pedaling but shortly stopped. Cinder sighed angrily and readjusted her pants, pulling them up. \u201cGod I hate these stupid pants, they\u2019re tight and way to small, I need to get new ones soon.\u201d Cinder said angrily. Weiss on the other hand was thankfully as now instead of being insulted by Cinder\u2019s ass stench she was just being regularly squished by Cinder\u2019s pants. However Weiss\u2019s victory was short lived as Cinder continued pedaling again. The sweat quickly came in and the heat under Cinder\u2019s ass scorched. Weiss wished something would happen to help ease the pain, a wish she would soon regret. As Cinder\u2019s exercise went on her pants continued to fall until Cinder\u2019s asshole was back to being face to face with Weiss. Cinder stopped pedaling and Weiss was waiting for Cinder to fix her pants, however she didn\u2019t. \u201cYou know what? Screw it, if my ass wants to hang out then it can hang out.\u201d Cinder said once again annoyed at incorporating pants. Now Weiss was in an opposite painful world as now instead of being crushed by pants, she was being forced to smell Cinder\u2019s ass along with having to feel the ass heat. It wasn\u2019t made better as Cinder channeled her anger into aggressive pedaling. Now Weiss was being forced to swallow Cinder\u2019s ass sweat straight from its source while smelling Cinder\u2019s hot ass air. It wasn\u2019t helped by Cinder rubbing her ass against the seat and sometimes bouncing up and down. With the combination of bouncing, grinding, and pedaling it shouldn\u2019t of seemed like such a surprise to Weiss when she found herself getting sucked into Cinder\u2019s ass. Weiss was now panicking, she didn\u2019t want to get stuck inside Cinder\u2019s asshole. Weiss felt that if she could muster enough strength she could pull herself together and climb out.

Weiss could do nothing but lie there and take the punishment she was currently enduring. Weiss\u2019 senses were assualted by the smell and taste of Neon\u2019s ass sweat.

The sweat from Neon\u2019s ass started to carry the taste of her dried shit and stale farts. Weiss wished that she could finally pass out from the pain and stench. Unfortunately for her the fact that you could pass out from a bad smell was a myth, as for passing out from pain, she was unable to do so due to her breaking or fracturing a bone each second Neon continued to unknowingly grinding Weiss deeper and deeper into the bike seat. Weiss just wanted this torture to stop and she didn\u2019t care if she had to die for it to happen. Unfortunately for Weiss, Lady Luck was not on her side. After what felt like and enternity, Weiss felt the crushing of Neon lifted off of her. With what little energy she had left, Weiss closed her eyes and let loose a sigh of relief.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Weiss could barely believe her eyes as she watched her own sister step up onto the bike, hovering her huge ass above her tiny sibling. The skin-tight white yoga pants the older Schnee wore made it look as if the moon itself was falling on the shrunken heiress as they struggled to contain Winter\u2019s generous curves, and seconds dragged into eternity as the seemingly endless mass descended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger Schnee hadn\u2019t even known that her big sis was in Vale, much less at Beacon, and had no time to even try to squirm away before the larger girl\u2019s buttocks crashed down on top of her, instantly undoing any progress her body had made towards reforming. Offering no defence, Weiss was utterly crushed beneath Winter\u2019s weight, the older woman\u2019s colossal cheeks overflowing the narrow bike seat and completely obscuring Weiss beneath their relentless mass. As the massive booty settled into place the sheer force of it spread the tiny heiress even further than before, actually folding her body around the edges of the seat as Winter\u2019s posterior claimed its throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss had always been jealous of her sister\u2019s curves. When she was younger she had assumed, naively, that she would fill out with time just as the older girl had. Yet as the years passed her own growth remained modest at best, while Winter seemed to grow more bodacious by the day. The little heiress loved her sister, but sometimes she just wished she could steal those curves for her own. Still, she\u2019d never expected she\u2019d experience them up close like this, or at this obscene scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, Winter was visiting the academy on an assignment from Ironwood, though she\u2019d already finished what she came for and had only stuck around to get the chance to meet up with her sister. She\u2019d dropped by her dorm but had been greeted only by the team leader, who was unable to advise her as to Weiss\u2019s current location. With no leads, and not wanting to stand around uselessly, she had decided to take the time to exercise and maintain her battle readiness. Having mounted the closest available bike immediately after entering the gym, she was pleasantly surprised to find that the seat was more cushioned than she had expected. Wondering if there was any way to get these same seats in Atlas, Winter briefly wiggled her generous rear and allowed herself a small smile at the smooth texture, utterly oblivious to the torment she was inflicting on her precious sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat torment became infinitely worse as the older Schnee began to pedal, her powerful thigh muscles driving her legs into motion as she quickly worked her way up to her preferred pace. The shifting rear that had been ironing Weiss to the seat now began to slide all over the place, pummelling the tiny heiress as the heat and friction quickly rose to unbearable levels. To make matters even worse her squished face was located directly under Winter\u2019s crack, and the massive cheeks above were slowly but surely pulling both the thin fabric of the yoga pants, and the crushed head of their owner\u2019s beloved little sister, into their increasingly sweaty embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to Weiss\u2019s plight, and intend on getting in a good workout, Winter paid no more than a passing thought to her developing wedgie as she powered on, the sensation of her pants being drawn into her rear almost pleasant as her cheeks slid easily together. She allowed a small smirk to cross her face as she became aware of eyes being drawn in her direction, boys and girls alike hypnotised by the rhythmic swaying of her beasts and the shifting mass of her booty as she pedalled. Though not interested in anything more than looks right now, the huntress still took a moment to put on a show, deliberately emphasising the movement of her ass as she shifted it left to right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the ordinary course of events Winter would have expected the seat to start to chaff as the minutes ticked on, yet she found this seat surprisingly comfortable, the spongy cover continuing to conform to her cheeks no matter how much they shifted. It was almost like riding on a cloud and she was seriously contemplating talking to the faculty about getting one of these bikes for her home gym. Or maybe she\u2019d just requisition this bike on behalf of the Atleasian military.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no knowledge of her sister\u2019s thoughts, Weiss was just hoping that this torment would come to an end. With her face now thoroughly smeared within the older Schnee\u2019s buttocks, she was utterly soaked in sweat, the viscous fluid soaking into her entire body as Winter\u2019s increasingly sweaty rump continued to plough into her over and over again. The fencer\u2019s face got the worst of it as the swamp-like conditions within the bigger girl\u2019s rear surrounded the tiny heiress with gallons of sweat that trickled down her flattened throat and invaded every single available orifice. Silent tears dripped from her eyes, only to become loss within the surrounding sea of sweat. The urge to gag, to hurl, was overwhelming but her painfully flattened body couldn\u2019t even manage the motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken girl could feel her body slowly beginning to adhere to the unpleasantly damp pants even as the shifting cheeks continued to iron her into the seat below. Though Weiss couldn\u2019t see it with her entire head buried out of sight, parts of her tortured body were alternating between being dragged along with Winter\u2019s butt and being left behind on the seat, a process that was slowly spreading her even further across the bike that she was becoming increasingly concerned would become her permanent home. That was, if her bigger sibling\u2019s bodacious rear didn\u2019t claim her first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a full thirty minutes of one of the best rides of her life, Winter noticed her sister\u2019s other teammates working out on the other side of the gym, the blonde and black-haired duo appearing to be engaging in some form of yoga routine lead by the shorter of the two. Leaning back in the seat and unknowingly pressing her ass down even harder into her unfortunate sister, the older girl considered getting off the bike to ask the pair about Weiss\u2019s current location, feeling that at least one of her teammates should know where she was. On the other hand though, she was really only just starting her workout, feeling like she could easily go for hours with such a comfortable seat. Not to mention standing would probably mean she\u2019d have to pull her developing wedgie as well, and she was really enjoying the oddly gummy sensation of her slick cheeks sliding together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrowning in thought, Winter eventually decided to\u2026</span></div></div>",

Dabbing the sweat from her forehead, the thick setted girl twisted around before elegantly hopping down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaware of the devastation below her, Weiss lay in her sisters sweat unable to move. She desperatly coughed out sweat as her twisted and flattened body tried to pull itself together.<br>\r\n\"Winter-\" She mumbled, before the sky turned dark. The tiny seat sticker didn't have any time to cry out as a pair of sweat stained shorts flew over her, blotting out the sun. With only a slight glance as the wet outline of the crack, Weiss was soon slammed back into the seat. Her head squeezed between the shifting cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh daaaang-! This seat is comfortable! Did they get new gel padding or something?\" Nora spoke, shifting her ass over Weiss's poor body before making a few hopping motions. If someone put there ear close enough, they might of been able to hear a scream over the sloppy sound of the sweaty rump.<br>\r\n\"They have?\" Pyrhaa spoke, standing beside the machine as she prepared to lift weights on the nearby mat.<br>\r\n\"Yeah- it's like- way more comfortable!\" Nora chirped, flexing her glutes over the poor cushion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot caring about warming up, Nora began full throttle much to Weiss's dismay. The friction was enough to destroy the seat Weiss was currently protecting. To make it worse, Nora often lent back, resting her hands on the back of the seat while pumping her legs as hard as she could. Rarely, the girl would stand up to pedal- displaying a stunned Weiss drooling out ass sweat before getting slammed back down and scrapped off. Each time this happened, she looked less and less human as she was folded and rolled under the hyper girls ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh- haaa- done-\" Nora spoke, slowing down a bit after a 30 minute sprint. \"I'm going to feel like a baby lamb after that one-\" She whimpered, slowly sliding off her seat. Pyrhaa turned to look at her friend with a smile, before noticing the girls rear.<br>\r\n\"Nora, you... seem to have sat on something?\" Pyrhaa looked confused, pointing to her friends butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRipping Weiss free with a wet slurp gave the tiny putty girl a surge of hope as she tried to talk.<br>\r\n\"So that's what it was! Man, I think this thing absorbed all the sweat down there\" Nora spoke, patting the back of her shorts. \"You've gotta try this sometime!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss shuddered, unable to speak after the harsh grueling session with both her own sister and the hyper active redhead...</span></div></div>",

Soon the soppy mess of Weiss goo was splatted onto her inner thigh and worked down towards her feet and back up towards her sweaty crotch. Things went by so fast, the poor girl didn't even notice herself being placed into Coco's hand. Panting and blubbering, the glob glanced up at the girls sunglasses for a moment before the girls hands stretched her out painfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoco was not in the mood, she really wanted her shower. <br>\r\n\"So unfashionable- whatever\" The fashionista sighed, stretching out the goo. Her naked body glistened with sweat as she wiped down her back- working the poor goo girl down her body before flossing around her enormous cheeks. \"What- material is this even?\" She spoke, surprsed as she wiped down her crotch. Her boobs made barely audible slicking sounds that Weiss retched apon before getting handed over to Velvet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThreaded over the 'lucky rabbit feet' of Velvet, Weiss was about to loose her mind as the rabbit didn't even pay the rag any attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd seemed endless, but at least people had become a little more distracted with chatting- leaving poor Weiss with more time per girl as she was used on Velvets armpits and chest. The goop looked with worry at Penny who just seemed confused before getting handed the rag. <br>\r\n\"Sorry, I got a little carried away there\" Velvet bowed before leaving. Penny gave an awkward wave,<br>\r\n\"Ok, goodbye friend Velvet.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe robot girl paused, looking down with a smile, <br>\r\n\"Hello friend Weiss, why are you a goopy rag? Is this some kind of game?\" Her head tilted as Weiss suddenly clicked back into reality. She struggled to talk as she tried to wriggle around \"I'm- sorry, this isn't in my databank of things that exist. I noticed your biometric readings and took a quick DNA sample. Apologies if I ruined the game you are playing- I do question your reasonings for being a rag but I won't spoil the fun\" Penny wandered over, squirting soap onto Weiss's body as she struggled to get the girls attention again. Penny glanced down, giving a confused smile \"I can't imagine this being plesent- is this a dare?\" She asked again. Again, no response.\"Understood, I assume this is part of the dare- not speaking. Either that or you are unable to but I will need more information as I wouldn't like to lose this game.\" She raised an armpit, not hearing Weiss's tantrum as she began mopping her armpit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss gave a small happy sigh as Penny finished flossing her cheeks. At least someone knew where she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Penny didn't even converse as she squirted more soap over the battered gunk. <br>\r\n\"Here you are!\" She presented the rag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why...?\" Weiss gurgled, before getting obliterated by Emeralds sweaty breasts. The girl complained about Cinder going on head of them to a mute girl as she wiped herself down. Weiss didn't have much of a chance to get her own complaints in as she was used to absorb sweat from the girls breasts and armpit. Gargling unhappily as she was moved downwards to dirtier areas before finally ending up on the floor where the mute girls harshly wiped her feet down before jamming the rag between her cheeks.<br>\r\n\"One thing though, this goo thing is pretty good. Think we should take it?\" Emerald grinned. The mute girl flexed her glutes as Weiss slowly dribbled out, a thoughtful look on her face.</span></div></div>",

She lost track of how many people used her as each person wiped down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, there were only a couple of people left. Weiss zoned out as Glynda carefully wiped the underside of her breast, taking longer now that the queue's had died down. Tired complaining to unheard giantess's, Weiss just let herself be dragged up into her teachers armpit as she continued to clean herself with the poor student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbed down the damp thighs, sweaty crotch and each toe. The slightly dingy goo girl just winced occasionally as her numb tongue was jammed into another disgusting place. The ass of Glynda was one of the worst she had tasted, giving a little gurgle of surprised disgust before being crushed into the flexing glutes and yanked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinter glanced down at the glob for a moment before leaving, having already used the poor Weiss as she discussed a report she was working on to Glynda, unaware of her frothing sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally-\" Weiss whimpered, slowly pulling herself together \"Honestly, w-what were the chances of this? Gross- I cannot believe that this happened to me\" She whined, suddenly hearing the slap of bare feet on tiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up in fear, Weiss locked eyes with Penny. A small sigh flittered through Weiss's lips, the girl surely wouldn't use her again and she knew Weiss was Weiss. She just needed to wait for her to reform to clear up any misunderstanding.<br>\r\n\"Friend Weiss? I did some research on this game you are playing\" The robotic girl stated, walking over. \"I am afraid I could not find too much at first, especially not on games. I did find a fetish relating to turning into objects and being used by people, that is the only reference I could find. It doesn't sound like you so please correct me if I'm wrong\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl examined Weiss who attempted to communicate to the best of her ability but she just bobbed up and down. Penny tilted her head, \"Is that a nod?\" She asked, the bouncing became more erratic, looking almost excited \"Understood, I shall attempt to get a friend to use you-  this is exciting! I have never been involved in this fetish thing before! It's supposedly pretty embarrassing so I shall try to keep it secret. I do hope my analysis was not correct, please correct me at any time if I am wrong\" The oblivious girl smiled, before crushing Weiss into a ball. Her processors started to work overtime as she tried to think of a place that would get the most use this time of day.</span></div></div>",

The girls all stared back at Yang with disgust and bewilderment, a few whispering between one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious, Yang? Blake shouted amongst the crowd in the front row, her hair dripping wet, gripping her towel close around her bare body. \"You completely ruined it,\" she stated, pointing to the undisclosed Weiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss was unaware of how bad things have become from being recognized as the snow queen. She couldn't even speak, her flawless white hair, and pale tone body presently surfaced in hefty brown with additional varied shades of filthy thanks to Yang and former girls' usage. Her body retained the worst reeking impure odor that made the other girls refuse even to touch after Yang's tedious practice, Weiss could also smell it herself. Far as Weiss could know, her reputation as a proud huntress was becoming tarnished with each handoff and shifting to an object of utility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, sorry everyone I guess I got a bit carried away,\" Yang apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on sis,\" Ruby yelled, struggling herself through the crowd while holding her towel. \" I wanna turn with it,\" she said, eagerly grasping cloth Weiss without much regard of what the others consider of her, and ran off in the opposite direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ruby, wait for a second,\" Blake yelled in a sisterly caring tone, chasing after the youngest teammate with Yang unclothed pursuing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby wander not considerably far as she heard the stoping of the girls chasing her, immediately she proceeded to squish Weiss together into a gelatinous ball. Ruby's let out soft giggles as continued playing with unknown Weiss as it excited her enormously. \"Wow, this thing genuinely fantastic!\" she gleamed, feeling more of Weiss formation seep between her fingers with each squishing, she could carry on for hours and not lose the pleasure. Of course, there was the existing stench emanating of the jelly mold, making almost Ruby want to vomit slightly, But grew tolerable as it evoked the comparable way her feet grew sweaty after an extended mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ruby, there you are,\" Blake muttered, appearing from the corner with Yang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby became startled by the arrival of her two team sisters so abruptly. Her body quivered wildly, losing her towel from its wrap, gentle falling to the ground. \"Uh, hey, you two sorry for running off and acting weird,\" Ruby blushed with embarrassment, holding the blobby plaything behind her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell where you think, Ruby? Drop that disgusting thing right now. You saw where's it's been.\" Blake argued, looking back to Yang, who quickly glanced away, \"Not to mention, we don't know what it is? It could be a Grimm or some unidentified dust property untested?\" Blake added on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, but Blake, it's so soft to the touch and unbelievably enjoyable to play with a ton! Can't I play with a little longer? You can try it out too,\" Ruby remarked back with a childish tone, handing it over with more squishing to show off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsequently, Weiss happened not to feel equal joy in possession of her juvenile teammate. Weiss started becoming sick with each change and mold of her body generated by Ruby's playful hands. Her body was aching with pain so unimaginable. Weiss desperately wanted to be ordinary again, to stand on her two feet with her friends, even most of all, a hot shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake let out a frustrating sigh, \"Get that gross thing away from me, Ruby! Ugh, Where's Weiss to be the voice of reason,\" Blake uttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax Blake, let Ruby have her fun for a bit,\" Yang jumped in commenting to defend her sister. The other girls in the locker room building from arrival in a rush to discover the mysterious gel outcome currently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch this, Blake,\" Ruby stated, grabbing everyone's attention in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby lowered Weiss glob body down on the bench as a ball. Weiss's eyes were visible for her to view at last. Except it couldn't have been a worse time as she stared directly up at Ruby pink slit and bare ass as she brought it down, crushing Weiss into a round dough splatter. The girls laughed, including Yang, as loud farting emitted from Ruby backside. The trapped air stuck inside Weiss blew out, leaving her a smudged mess attached to Ruby's small round ass as she turned towards the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see Blake,\" Ruby responded, showing off the advantage you can bring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Blake returned by crossing her arms with no sway. \"Ruby!

Once Winter started the treadmill she began to unknowingly grind her sisters face with unbearable speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss was forced to swallow gallons of her sisters ass sweat. Weiss was shocked that her own sister could create such a vile swamp ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinter then made her way to the rowing machines.

When she got up there was nothing there. Thinking nothing of it, Winter continued getting changed. Once she was done changing she left the locker room. Winter began walking but heard her scroll go off. It was a message saying that she was needed in Atlas ASAP. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinter left Vale with a souvenir in the form of a new ass slave that was her own sister. There was a missing persons report filed, but no one every thought to look in her sisters ass. Forcing Weiss to spend the rest of her miserable life in her own sisters ass.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Knowing that the day was still young and there would be many more opportunities to catch up with her sister, who by all accounts was probably off studying alone at this time in peace and coupled with the fact this, was the comfiest bike seat her rear has ever graced. Winter decided to really push herself to the limit and get a real workout in before attempting to catch up with her younger sibling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quick lean forward the older Schnee gripped hard on the handle bars in front of her, furiously pumping her legs as fast as they were able to handle. She would continue this for ten minutes before giving herself a brief respite and leaning her full weight back and gently pedalling sitting fully upright. Then once five minutes were up she grab hold of the bars once more and pedal like a demon before repeating the process all over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the flattened heiress things just seemed to keep escalating, each and every time she thought she had a slight glimmer of hope that she could get the attention of these colossal women, they would dash that hope in ways that seemed to be getting more painful, humiliating and disgusting. Not only has she been almost trampled by Ruby to start with, almost ending as an unnoticed smear to the young girl\u2019s foot. She was then flung by her teammate\u2019s hair into the awaiting maw that was her own visiting sister\u2019s buttocks.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss had even dared to dream that her voluptuous sister was simply using her battered form temporarily while she tried to decide what to do next, knowing that her sister hated wasting time and was probably just using the bike as a means to an end while she was deep in thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat thought was thoroughly quashed though as she felt her sister shift her weight forward, her face pinched and dragged forward alongside her. The shifting cheeks then picking up to a tremendous speed as they ground and rubbed every facet of Weiss\u2019s into the sodden fabric of Winter\u2019s yoga pants. The speed and intensity was so great Weiss swear she could feel her head beginning to heat up to almost burning levels of heat. The only saving grace from actually receiving savage friction burns seemed to be a combination of her weirdly squishable body and the cascading waterfall of Winter\u2019s sweat that flowed down her back and ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss\u2019s crushed vocal chords attempted to let out a pitiful cry as she once again felt the ice queens cheeks shift once more. This time her full weight collapsing backwards and the heiress felt herself pressed firmly into the smooth material of the seat beneath them. What was once a gristmill of activity was replaced with a slow methodical slosh of soft pillowy flesh. The sweat that was cooling down her battered face was now pooling and smearing across the rest of her crushed body as the cheeks ground and rubbed her in perfect rhythm to each other methodically.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis new level of torture was definitely getting to the unfortunate workout buddy as tried desperately to pry any aspect of her body from the wretched seat. No matter what she tried though the sheer magnitude of her sister\u2019s titanic cheeks held every part of her form firmly in place until she deemed it time to release her from its sweaty embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the larger of the siblings this was turning out to be the greatest ride of her life, two hours of nonstop cycling and that delightful wedgie had yet to go away. In fact that smooth feeling of the gummy cover was removing any concerns she had of have of chaffing her derriere. Not to mention the feeling of it gliding up between her hefty buttocks as she pumped her legs and it seeping down again as she sat atop it was removing a large portion of the boredom she would feel during her normal routine. Because of this she was even using the machine for a lot longer than she had intended to, her muscles actually beginning to cramp slightly as the lactic acid built up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Weiss too was aware her sister was starting to feel the effects of this level of exercise as the once precise movements she displayed when she first sat upon her where becoming much more laboured. When her cheeks shifted forward her booty would fully raise from the seat this time. Leaving Weiss plastered to the seat and giving the first breath of fresh air she has had that wasn\u2019t completely tainted by the overwhelming presence of Winter\u2019s ass crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss stared in contempt at the rotund mass that was sashaying tauntingly above her now. She had spent more time with that thing than she would ever have wanted to and she would never be able to look at her sister the same way if she ever managed to return to normal. Winter\u2019s booty seemed displeased with the seats glare as it slowly began to lower down upon her once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was it for Winter her body was running on fumes she barely had the energy to pump her legs now. She knew however that to get the most of your workout you have to squeeze every last drop of stamina. She raised her ass of the seat, a tiny pang of regret stinging her as she felt the gummy slip from her bonds. She then began to push one last time, her twin globes raising and slamming upon the seat over and over as she tried to keep herself going.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was it for Weiss the punishment was to unbearable, the constant slamming of her meaty glutes was sending her over the edge. Her eyes darted around the room between each butt slam trying desperately to catch the attention of any other gym goer to her horrific predicament. As expected however all she managed to do was to catch glimpses of Beacon students going about their business completely oblivious to her plight. When Winter\u2019s ass finally stopped its assault Weiss was treated to an extra-long embrace of that swampy crevice that ruined her life, as her sister sat there for a moment just breathing in as much fresh air as she could. Then with a sickening squelch her sweaty form rose up of the seat and dismounted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough spending much longer than she had planned Winter smiled, her body awash with endorphins. Her smile faded slightly as she glanced at the seat however. The gummy material that lined it was completely drenched in a thick and viscous layer from the dirtiest part of her body. Scrunching her nose in disgust at the spectacle she grabbed a nearby workout towel and gave it a thorough wipe down to ensure the next user had as nice a visit as she did and with that she sauntered off, keen to finally try and catch up with her beloved sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss however was\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For Weiss this was pure agony. The foul smell from her sisters sweat, was only multiplied by the fact that it was coming from her ass, and even worse was that Weiss had been crammed too close for comfort, to her sisters asshole. It was only a minor relief to Weiss, that there was both yoga pants and underwear between the giant hole, eminating the vicious smell from her larger sisters asshole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each step the buxom Schnee took, her extravagant globes jiggled with each step, her yoga pants and skimpy underwear completely unable to contain their massive size.  With each jiggle, Weiss was ground by her sisters soft cheeks, but both due to her current size, and the beating they had given her earlier, this was a torment like no other, even with her Aura being able to sustain her. Weiss weakly tried to soften the blow from the giant globes by stretching her arms out to stop the opposing cheek from smashing into her, but to no avail as her arms only sank into the flesh, for it to momentarily engulf her entire body, before releasing her from torment for a brief moment. With each assault, the sweat that had started to soak trough the pants, emanating from deep withing Winters crack, drenched Weiss, and she did her best to avoid getting any in her mouth and eyes, each time she was engulfed by the sweaty globe of warm flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Winter, the exhaustion from the bike ride was great, and she needed a moment to rest and regain her breath. The large Schnee retreated to a bench in the gym, and dropped herself down onto the bench, with all her weight. As Winter dropped down full weight on her ass, not even all the padding it possessed with it's great size and softness, could shield Weiss from the pain. Having only been subjected to a slight squishing from the soft yoga clad cheek of her sister, in brief moments, she was now viciously assaulted by it, and it's stench. Weiss was horrified that her dignified sister could reek like this, and the young Schnee instinctively retched in horror, only to get a mouthful of her giant sisters ass sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss was aggravated at this point, and quickly mustered all her might, to clench her fists and slam at her giant sisters cheek, in the hopes she would finally discover what hell she let her smaller sister endure. Weiss pounded her fists as hard as she could into the soft flesh that enveloped her, getting disgusted by the liquid that covered her tiny hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinter had only gotten a moment of rest, before she felt an itch emanating from deep within her crack. The giant Schnee thought to herself how she should have worn underwear that was not as restrictive on her assets, but lamented that she had chosen an older, and smaller pair, to make up for the sweat she would build up. She quickly glanced around the room, to see if any of the inhabitants would notice if she snuck her hand down to adjust her skimpy underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing around, Winter noticed a few people in the gym. The boisterous redhead from team JNPR, Nora, doing squats to maintain her impressive rear. The buxom blonde and melancholic black haired girl from her sisters own team, practicing boxing, with the blonde \"forgetting\" to block around her generous chest, so they would jiggle with each hit. There was professor Goodwitch, surprisingly in a pair of tight leggings, that complimented her adult figure, running on the thread mill. Finally there was a dark skinned girl, with green hair, who were busy lifting weights. If any of these people were to see a great Atlesian specialist, go at her rear like some primate, it would ruin their name, not to mention the Schnee name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinter contemplated her thoughts for a while, before finally deciding...</span></div></div>",

Was caught off guard by a whole new level torture as she was blasted with remaining stench that was trapped in Winters panties.

As she did, her planet sized cheek let go of her younger sister, deeply embedded within her crack, freeing the younger Schnee from her torment at the hands of her unaware sister. Weiss let out a relieved sigh, and yelled out to her sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Winter, i am glad you noticed my struggles. I have been caught deep withing your posterior, and i need you to free me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this proved futile, as the cheeks muffled the tiny Schnee's cries for help, due to her size. Winter continued her walk over to the walls opposite her, to do her stretching exercises. As the soft globes of her sisters posterior continued their previous assault against the tiny Schnee, she again let out a cry, this time of terror, and without the usual refinement of the Schnee family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WINTER, YOU MONGREL. GET ME OUT OF YOUR FAT ASS, BEFORE I GET REALLY ANGRY\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoincidentally as Weiss had yelled this out, was when Winter had finally reached the wall, and was ready to do her stretching exercises. The large Schnee started with bowing down to reach her toes, and in doing so bend over and parted her cheeks unknowingly. To most of the spectators within the gym, that caught on to this, none of them noticed the tiny aggravated heiress, stuck deep withing the crack of the massive rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Winter had parted her cheeks in her stretch, it had also opened her colon slightly, and the stench that emanated form withing that, was far worse than any of what Weiss had been subjugated to earlier. Weiss recoiled as much as she could in horror, and gagged at the stench of her sisters fecal matter remains, and praised that she was no closer to the dead center of her sisters ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Winter was unknowingly giving a full show to many of the inhabitants of the gym, one of the more bold members took the chance and slapped her ass. The impact made her generous cheeks jiggle in her loose yoga pants, and the giant Schnee quickly recoiled and turned on her heels to slap the offender. The Schnee slammed her palm against the cheek of the offender, with a resounding slap that made most other members of the gym stop dead in their tracks to see what had transpired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare you lay a hand on a lady like that, you uncouth beast\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinters fury was immense and while she was yelling at the perpetrator, she paid no notice to what transpired in between her cheeks.

She was on the top bunk, suspended from the ceiling, there was nothing she could climb on to get up there. Looking over to the edge of her own bed, Weiss saw her leader's discarded footwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRuby has to put them on eventually right?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After her panic attack seemed to go away, Weiss steadied herself, looking down at the floor over the side of her bed, then back up at Ruby\u2019s. Putting out her right hand she attempted at forming a staircase of her glyphs straight up to Ruby. One by one each glyph formed, making a spiral staircase going straight up and onto her leader's bed. Afraid that her glyphs would give way or her aura would run out at any second, due to her diminished size, she cautiously took her first step onto the platform, then another, and another, it seemed it would hold for now. Weiss began to go up the glyph staircase as quickly as possible, wanting to get help as fast as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith only 11 more glyphs to go Weiss was almost on top of the bed before she felt a sudden shock of pain and collapsed, looking down she saw her glyphs one by one disappearing, her aura had run out, limited by her new height after all. Weiss made a leap for the side of the bed, barely making it in time as her final glyph dissipated, hoisting herself up onto the mattress, she made her way towards the giant girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up at Ruby, Weiss noticed that she had her headphones in, listening to music as she played on her scroll, meaning Weiss\u2019 original plan was foiled, as she could neither use her glyphs to get to Ruby's face for her to see her, nor could Ruby hear her yelling, so Weiss would have to go with Plan: B, getting Ruby to notice her via hitting the side of her nearby leg, hoping she\u2019d feel her punches, rather than Ruby just smacking what she would think was a mere bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter running over to the younger girl\u2019s leg, Weiss began to hit it as hard as she could, over, and over again, hoping for any reaction at all, but alas, never got one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026. Shit\u2026.\u201d Weiss sighed, as she began to brainstorm new ideas, but the only one she could think of wasn\u2019t something she was a fan of. If Weiss couldn\u2019t climb up to Ruby's face, and the giant girl couldn\u2019t hear her, there was still a way to make Ruby feel her, by tickling the giant girl, however Weiss knew after a year of sharing a dorm with Ruby and Yang\u2019s shenanigans, Ruby was only ticklish in two spots, her armpits, and her feet, of course, Weiss didn\u2019t want to do either of them, but she had to choose the girl\u2019s feet, due to the fact Ruby would most likely clench and squeeze her arms into her self, crushing Weiss in her armpit in a reaction to the tickling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss liked to keep her feet well kept, they were never smelly and were always clean, Ruby\u2019s feet, on the other hand, were horrendous to the tiny girl, who couldn\u2019t help but gag looking up at the stocking clad toes wiggling slowly. However this was Weiss\u2019 only chance of getting help, other than just waiting for her other teammates to come back, and who knows how long they\u2019d be gone for. Placing her hand on her team leaders foot, Weiss began to tickle, and almost immediately, Ruby:</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Weiss carefully began to descend down the wood of her bunk to the floor. It was a difficult choice, but in the end she chose the one that didn't involve her potentially plummeting to her doom. There were just far too many uncertainties about her aura in her current state. For now she would play it safe and make for her team leader's footwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully it didn't take long to reach the floor as it was much closer than the bunk suspended on the ceiling. Looking up at the top bunk now and the room around her made Weiss feel smaller than she had since this whole ordeal started. Being at ground level like this truly put into perspective how small she really was. As much as she didn't want to admit it, she was an ant, an insignificant ant. Anyone could step on her and be none the wiser. Just knowing that nearly made her beat out of her chest. How many ants had she stepped on that went unnoticed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing her best to shake off the terrifying thought, the Schnee heiress returned to her mission. She had to make it to Ruby's boots. Spying around the room, she found the leather footwear discarded in a corner. One was standing at attention while the other was overturned. Instinctually she wanted to admonish her team leader for her lack of care, but now was not the time. She needed to stay focused on the task at hand. She could always chew Ruby out later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing back up at the top bunk one last time, Weiss made her move. Not wanting to waste any time, the heiress began to sprint across the wood floor. What normally would've taken two or three steps at her normal height would now be like running a marathon at her current height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss began to feel tired after a while, running full speed ahead. She might've been in great shape but she was no Yang or Ruby. Those two stamina freaks had energy for days. She could recall one time where Yang challenged Pyrrha to a race that took them around the entirety of Beacon Academy. While the blonde brawler had come up short, she still looked like she could run for a little while longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby on the other hand was an energizer bunny. She never seemed to run out of energy. She was like Nora in that respect. Both of them could go on for hours on end without rest. Unless of course the task was uninteresting, and in which case they would either become sluggish or fall asleep. But then again so would anybody, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Weiss made it to her destination, hunched over and wheezing. No one could say she didn't get her exercise for the day. After taking a second to re-collect herself she finally looked up at the big black behemoths before her. Ruby's boots were huge. Boots were bigger than her. Granted that was obvious, but still...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. You can do this.\" Weiss told herself as she inched closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she did she suddenly froze. Her hands quickly flew to her nose to cover it. There was a horrid smell in the air... and it was coming from Ruby's overturned boot. Weiss stared through watery eyes at the opening of the boots opening and couldn't believe the foul smell that had invaded her nostrils. It reek! If there was anything Weiss was anal about it was cleanliness and hygiene! She made sure to keep her feet well kept and her boots odor free. Ruby clearly didn't. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gods!\" Weiss coughed. Why was the smell so strong? Why was she able to smell it only now? Was it because of her new size? It had to be. There was no question that was it. At her normal size this would've been nothing, but now in her miniscule state, Ruby's leftover foot odor was like a chemical weapon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss was starting to regret this course of action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! It's too late for regrets. I made it this far and I'm going to go the rest of the way.\" Weiss declared. She wanted to become a huntress. If she couldn't power through some foot stink then what chance did she have. Weis powered through the smell and made her way towards the upright right boot. It was time to get climbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss reluctantly removed her hands from her nose and began to scale the boot. Luckily for her there was a lot to grab ad cling to. She made it to the top of the toe section in no time at all and began her trek up the laces. If anyone had told her she'd be scaling a pair of boots to save herself when she arrived at Beacon Academy, she'd have called them daft. Yet here she was doing just that. What was her life?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after what felt like an eternity, she reached the top. She was literally sitting atop the opening of Ruby's boot. Unfortunately the rancid smell had returned. In hindsight she should've expected that. This was still Ruby's go to footwear after all. Looking over the side she could see just how deep the opening was and couldn't help but think about what would happen if she fell in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd be trapped with that foul stench. Then Ruby would come down and eventually put them on, making her life worse. She be crushed. And if she wasn't she be trapped in a constant state of rise and fall while Ruby's foot eventually started to sweat and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss desperately shook off those thoughts... there was no way that would happen. Her negative thoughts were soon interrupted by a loud bang. The resulting shockwave shook the heiress all about. Good thing she clung to the boot like her life depended on it. It really did. She looked up to see the source of the quake was none other than Ruby who had jumped from the top bunk down to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss was equal parts scared as she was relieved. No doubt Ruby was coming to retrieve her boots. Once attempted to she could gain the larger girl's attention and get rescued. It was time to get noticed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So Jaune was left to his own devices and bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to see what Team RWBY was up to he strolled across the hall and knocked on their door. <br>\r\nAfter receiving no response after the second time knocking Jaune figured that no one was home and should have left then and there.<br>\r\nHowever he was bored and not overly clever so he pushed the unlocked door open and entered the girls room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn odd sight lay before him. Beakers and cases with the Schnee logo emblazzed on them were full of dust. It appeared that Weiss had left some form of dust experiment set-up in the room. Surprised at how the usually strict and book following heiress had left such potentially dangerous crystals out in the open he waltzed up to the crowded desk to take a closer look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately he tripped over something and fell face first into the dust causing a minor explosion and a cloud of smoke to obscure his vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he regained his sight and senses Jaune was puzzled mores than his usual self. The desk appeared gigantic and the room seemed to have grown or more likely he had shrunk. The poor guy had been reduced to less than an inch in height. He could see the smallest cracks in the floor, the umber of rifle bullets discarded under one of the beds, and the incredibly long distance back to his own dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being as smaller than a mouse Jaune's main worry was that he had just blown up something in RWBY's room that he had gone into without permission. As he tried to figure out a way to explain his actions and get back to his normal size his worst fears were confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone had heard the explosion and was walking towards the room, their footsteps booming in Jaune's ears like a Godzilla movie.

This could be expected of him, given at his normal size Yang's features were enough to stun any man, but as a tiny guy starring upwards Yang's \"assets\" seemed even more grand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer legs where pale pillars that went up forever meeting well toned thighs and an ass that seemed big enough when Jaune was not shrunk, now it looked big enough to block out the light while her breasts where giant spheres that perched on her chest. However his lecherous staring was soon cut short as Yang had taken off her jacket and let it fall to the floor. Directly on top of Jaune. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCursing his luck he floundered under the heavy cloth and tried to find his way out. After much undignified squirming he managed to crawl out from under the jacket and found himself next to one of the beds. Its covers looking like a great wall to him and yet he was small enough to see the minuscule holes in the fabric. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud yawn which sounded like the groaning of a tree collapsing or the roar of some beast caught Jaune's attention as his eyes found Yang once again and a real sight to behold. Without her jacket Yang only had her orange tank top and black shorts on and was stretching with her arms up in the air as she yawned. Before his own body would betray him once again Jaune decided then and there the best thing to do was to get Yang's attention. She was nice. She would understand that the dust accident wasn't his fault entirely. Hell she barely noticed the charred desk and left over beakers and crystals (apparently explosions were more commonplace in their dorm than Jaune thought). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question was how does a tiny Jaune Arc grab the attention of a giant girl who looks to be on the verge of sleep?<br>\r\nThinking quickly he knew he had to get up higher and began to climb the nearest bed's covers finding purchase in the holes in the fabric and after what seemed like a gruelling climb found himself onto of the mattress. Now all he had to do was find a way to get Yang to see or hear him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis plan may have worked except Yang was tired and Jaune had made the mistake of climbing onto her bed! The blonde boy tried to scream but his throughout was dry with fear as a shadow fell over his body. </span></div></div>",

The soft pressure that enveloped him combined with the heat radiating from Yang's body made the situation more enjoyable than it should have been. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was pain though, pain amongst the pleasure. Just as he could feel the bubbly fat of Yangs but conform around him he did feel the pressure and pain that comes from having one's body smushed into a near 2D form. Which worsened as Yang shuffled back and forth on her butt trying to get rid of the \"lump\" in her mattress. His body was shuffled from under one cheek to the other and even spent some time trapped in the crack of her ass but the sheer size of Yang's butt kept him trapped with no chance of crawling out from under it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like an eternity of odd pleasure with uncomfortable pain  before Jaune was saved from the odd situation when............</span></div></div>",

Do you know who many boys would kill to be in your position?\u201d Yang teased. Jaune agreed, many boys, himself included, would love the opportunity to get intimate with Yang Xiao Long\u2019s famous bust. The problem for the tiny JNPR leader was that, at his current size, he was less getting intimate with them and more literally going to be devoured by them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave fun in there!\u201d The brawler giggled at the panicking boy, and released him, letting him plummet down towards her hungry boobs. Her aiming was somewhat off, so Jaune instead landed with a small bounce onto Yang\u2019s left breast. He gained his footing as fast as he could and attempted to jump off her and back onto the bed, figuring his putty body would allow him to survive the fall. Yang\u2019s fingers were faster however, and they wrapped tightly around him up before he could even try. \u201cOh no you don\u2019t!\u201d The busty blond laughed as she slowly inserted her little struggling friend between her waiting mounds. Soon all that remained of Jaune to the outside world was his head and shoulders, the rest of him submerged within Yang\u2019s tight bosom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere we go! Now, is this so bad?\u201d The captor cooed to her captive, gently ruffling his hair with a finger. The shrunken teen held his head low, trying and failing to hide that his face was burning red with embarrassment. Yang couldn\u2019t help but find him super cute, and gave her breasts a little squeeze, giggling as he moaned at the sensation. Her smile widened naughtily as she thought about how red he would be after what came next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune, meanwhile, was staring at the hungry gap that had consumed most of his body and was now holding him in place, waiting for it\u2019s master to feed the rest of him to it. He had always imagined a girl\u2019s breasts to be warm and supple, which Yang\u2019s definitely were, but they were also hot and firm, especially as they squeezed around him. He pondered if he\u2019d be able to, by some miracle, remain in his full form or if he\u2019d be flattened instantly. A smaller, dirtier part of him pondered if anyone would believe him if he told them he\u2019d been between Yang\u2019s breasts. His redness doubled at the thought, but he quickly concluded the brawler would probably cripple him if he did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was torn from his mind when he felt her finger begin to press down on the top of his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could protest, he was shoved down, quickly vanishing from the world as he was swallowed up by Yang\u2019s flesh. He was forced inward till all any onlooker would see were Yang\u2019s plump melons. Once he\u2019s came to a halt and the finger retreated away, the heat and pressure had greatly increased, threatening to melt and crush the little invader into her skin.

She thought of just playing with him with her boobies but then a thought came to her. A mischievous smile appeared. \"You know Jaune I haven't done enough cardio this week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn between her melons Jaune heard her. He tried desperately pushing her boobs away trying to reason. \"No Yang please don't do that you'll crush me!\" He kept pushing the two mounds of flesh trying to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang barely heard that, her impressive cleavage made his speech muffled and she still felt the boy tickle her.  \"Aw don't be scared Jaune the girls will keep you safe, besides if you can survive my \u2018gigantic\u2019 butt then you can take a run between my assets.\" She giggled as he kept his futile struggling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow then\" She then takes off her shirt still wearing her bra and keeping Jaune in her bosom. She kept her combat shorts on and put on an orange tank top that showed plenty of her top without a hint of her fellow tiny blonde, and exposed her midriff and put a bun around her making a pony tail. She left the dorm room<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Jaune hope you like my sweat!\" Yang said as she got on the jogging track and started running. As she jogged her bust bounced and she felt Jaune's puny body still struggle in her chest. She giggled enjoying every second of her little friend being helpless in her chest, she can feel him struggle and jiggle in the small space her enormous mummeries allowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune wasn\u2019t sure how to feel about any of this, he was being bounced as Yang took every step, getting hit side to side by a boob as one of her arms collided with her boob as she ran. Then there was the sweat coming down her neck and forming her bosom, he was getting covered in it almost like water drenching his uniform going into his clothes. He was aroused, what healthy young man wouldn\u2019t be when your whole body is imprisoned in a large bosom as Yang\u2019s, but he was also uncomfortable from knocked back forth, up and down as she jogged, also he had to swallow some of the seat. Luckily his aura seems to be keeping him from getting injured or Wiess\u2019s crystals increased his durability. He couldn\u2019t tell if he should be lucky or scared in this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang kept jogging and giggling as she felt Jaune bounce in her boobs with a simple jog, she can go long for longer with her stamina, but she\u2019ll probably stop here. After all she may want to play but she doesn\u2019t want to hurt her little friend, and Ruby would never forgive her if she her first Beacon friend. She stopped at her last lap only letting out a single sigh not too tired but she was covered in sweat, she looked down and squished her boobs together squeezing Jaune. \u201cAlright Vomit Boy, we\u2019re all done.\u201d She let her bosom go hearing a muffled sigh from them. Yang giggled as she began walking back to the dorm looking down at her chest, she had plenty of fun doing that feeling the boy helplessly struggle between her boobs, she always thought she was a badass fighting grimm like nothing, fighting White Fang like nothing, but with little Jaune she felt kind of like a goddess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoddess, she could get used to that, maybe she\u2019ll have Jaune pamper her like one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune felt relaxed as now her chest was only going slightly up and down. He can only imagine what awaits him as he\u2019s being taken back to the dorm. He can only hope that she\u2019s done with her games. He looked up to see light and two fingers came and pulled him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Vomit Boy, good job on not vomiting!\u201d Yang smiled as she dangled the boy in at eye level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune moaned as he wiped some of Yang\u2019s sweat off his face looking into Yang\u2019s eyes and he can see her mischievous smile. \u201cYang, please tell me you had your fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang looked at Jaune covered in her sweat. \u201cNope\u201d She smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYang please!\u201d Jaune pleaded with his \u2018giant\u2019 friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang just giggled at his whining. \u201cCome on Jaune it wasn\u2019t that bad besides every guy has wanted to be all sweaty with me.\u201d Her eyebrows went up and down. \u201cIsn\u2019t that right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune blushed and looked away much to her amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah that\u2019s what I thought anyways I got some more fun for us planned.\u201d She put Jaune on the dresser and used her hands to reach for her ponytail and started pulling her hair bun out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune looked up at his friend. Or is it captor now? \u201cWhat are you going to do now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang simply let her beautiful golden mane down straightened it so she can look and looked down at the doll sized knight with a smirk. \u201cWell I worked up a bit of a sweat so\u201d she grabbed Jaune in her fist much to his shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYang not so hard!\u201d He yelled as her grip was a bit tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry  Vomit Boy.\u201d She said as she climbed up to her bed and put Jaune at the foot of it watching him bounce up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune got up and sees Yang\u2019s gigantic pale skinned feet in front of him, they were more than twice as tall as he was he could barely reach the balls of her feet. \u201cYang?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang was sitting up looking down at Jaune in front of her sweaty feet. \u201cMy feet are aching, Jauney can you rub them for me pretty please?\u201d She asked batting her eyelashes, this was the pampering she\u2019d like, it\u2019ll be great to her tiny adorable friend try to give her a foot massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune looked at Yang\u2019s feet, her toes were curling anxious for a massage. They were glistening a little with sweat from the run Yang did, thank god he put she didn\u2019t put him in her boot instead. He wasn\u2019t sure if wanted to be tiny with Yang now, he could probably survive jumping off the bed and run to try to get help elsewhere. Who knows what Yang has planned after this. What does he do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The bedsprings creaked as she bounced off the bed, leaving the flattened Jaune in her wake as she wandered over to a chest of draws. He tried to reform as he heard the draws role open, he slowly peeked over a fold in the bed to see her squeeze an orange top over her exposed boobs, Jaune quickly looked away out of embarrisment as the draw slammed shut.<br>\r\n\"That's something I'll skip out mentioning when I'm found\" Jaune coughed, looking back to see Yang jamming her clothes in a laundry bag before wandering back over towards the bed. Not given much time, the tiny Jaune started to run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang bounded back over to bed, grabbing onto the top bunk for support as she balanced on one leg to remove her sock. After the first one was taken off, she hopped onto her other foot and yanked the other off. Her titanic rear shadowed over the running Jaune without mercy, flattening him once more to her cheeks as she jammed her socks under the bed. The blonde powerhouse glanced around the empty room briefly,<br>\r\n\"One night to myself-\" She grinned, hopping up to flick off the light switch, taking Jaune with her on her right cheek \"Might be able to get a good lie in without Weiss waking up so early-!\" she shuddered at the thought, flicking the lights out before wandering back to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune whined as he was bounced around the ass of one of the hottest girls in the academy. A huge amount of pressure scraped across him as the oblivious girl scratched and ajusted the black material he was on, his breathing apparently a tiny nuisance in her life. Thankfully this peeled him off her butt, letting him float back down onto her bed as she sat down again, just barely missing him once more. She scooted back before flinging her legs over the dazed sticker, tucking them into bed before yanking the covers up over herself she rolled onto her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before she fell into a deep sleep, drooling over imaginary guys, unaware of the very real, very tiny, guy reforming under her covers. Jaune soon managed to get up, his eyes struggling to make out the black material of Yangs taunt shorts from under the covers. His gut instinct was to run away, however the bedsheets were too heavy to lift and crawling under them would just lead to the edge of the bed/ pin him down.<br>\r\n\"I- need to get her attention-\" Jaune gulped, deciding to run towards her head before she turned over. Does he make it?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Trying to ignore the heat radiating from Yang, Jaune started to run up towards the head. His feet stumbling on folds in the fabric or indentations made by Yangs sleeping body. He squinted leftwards as he ran, noticing the fabric had gone from black to orange, a sign of progression in the right way. When he gazed forwards he suddenly noticed something he hadn't thought of. Thick, bramble like hair halted in his tracks as he crashed among the matted surface. He yelled out, struggling to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang winced slightly in her sleep as something tugged at her hair, more annoyed at the pressure rather then the pain of it being pulled on. Still in deep sleep, she subconsciously reached down, yanking her hair carefully from underneath her before rolling onto her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune felt light filter into his brambled prison as a giant hand attempted to brush hair from underneath her. Seeing a chance to escape- Jaune grabbed onto a passing finger. As soon as he touched it, the hand clamped down on a handful of hairs, crushing the air out of the blonde leader before letting go and sickenly swinging about as Yang rolled onto her back. When he came to his senses, he noticed the finger he was stuck on heading towards her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to Jaune's perverted thoughts dismay, Yang sloshed him around her underarm to scratch an itch before resting her hand (and a sickly Jaune) onto her pillow with a dainty sigh. The tiny Jaune struggled harder then before, learning his lesson about hanging around in such a dangerous place. His body peeled off, bouncing from palm to pillow just as it clenched in reaction to her dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven some more time, Jaune managed to pop back into shape. He shakenly backed away from the hand, as he went the long way around it to reach Yangs head. Good luck appeared to shine on the young night as he saw the tip of her ear touching the pillow. Unable to see the perverted smile on the giant blonde he rushed forwards-</span></div></div>",

He looked right, squinting through the darkness to check if he had made it to her shirt yet. As his eyes ajusted, his mind reeled.<br>\r\n\"Aw COME ON!\" Jaune yelled. There was no mistaking it, the shorts had ended with skin. He looked up and down, hoping that what he was looking at wasn't a leg but there was no denying it. He let out a sigh as he gazed down the way he had just came, his ears in tune with Yangs heavy breathing as he psyched himself to run again. His legs pumped as he started spriting back the way he had just ran, his thoughts nervous and scattered. It wasn't long before his fears were confirmed, the giant blond slowly started to role over towards him. Unable to defend himself from the incoming pressure, he simply cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang wiggled onto her back, her ass devastating the young JNPR leader in one stretched out blow. Her perverted smile slowly vanished as she started to toss and turn, disturbed by the lump underneath her as she subconciously tried to demolish it. This time Jaune was given no breaks as her powerful cheeks pounded and squeezed him into a more comfortable form. She finally settled with him firmly plastered within her wedgie, her face slowly relaxing as her eyes opened up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune didn't have time to complain as he was molded by the shifting glutes. Her titanic cheeks chewed him up without mercy as she tried to relieve the discomfort his former 3D body had. He whimpered as Yang gave a satisfied sigh, relaxing ontop of him. The musky material around him squeezed tight on his ingrained form. Not 5 minuted later, Yang shifted once more, jamming hit body further then he thought possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang sat up in bed crosslegged, grabbing her water from the bedside. She flexed her strong glutes as she felt a small discomfort on her ass as she drank. She mulled over getting rid of the itch- perhaps her shorts were causing it- loose fabric or fluff tickling her. She idly considered turning them inside out before the thought of an empty room over powered it- she grinded down happily as she gazed around at the empty beds, biting her bottom lip.</span></div></div>",

As Yang brought Jaune to her face, her eyes widened in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JAUNE? Oh my god, what happened to you? Why are you so tiny? What are you doing in here? And why exactly were you on my ass?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last question from the blonde, was not asked in a tone of shock, but more of skepticism, to why exactly the tiny boy was in the room of 4 girls, 1 which he desired deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Yang, it got in here to see what you guys were up to, when i started messing with some stuff on the table, and suddenly i was this big. Then before i know it, you enter the room, and i am suddenly flattened by your big massive ass\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune blurted out the words, but instantly regretted his choice, when he saw the eyes of his big captor flaring red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big? Massive? Ass? Jaune, you come in here, make up some story about shrinking down, so you could likely spy on us, and now you say i have a FAT ASS?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no i said it's big cause i'm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JAUNE, I HAVE A GREAT ASS. HOW DARE YOU INSINUATE THAT IT'S THIS BIG\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe roar from the buxom blonde, was deafening to Jaune, and he could feel her fingers squeeze him hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, if my fat ass is such an attraction to you, why don't you just spend some more quality time with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde words were filled with anger, and before Jaune knew it, he was heading straight for the glove sized cheeks again.

As Jaune leapt out of the way of her shoe he got a good look of her giant profile, giant curves included, however his landing on the hard floor snapped him back into reality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiguring now was a good chance as ever to get someone to notice him he shouted out.<br>\r\n\"Blake! Hey Blake down here!\", he screamed at the top of his lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for Jaune Blake's sensitive faunus ears picked up his tiny voice all the way from the floor and she turned from surveying the remains of the dust explosion to try and see who was calling her. After seeing no one else in the room or door entrance she was about to turn back to the ruined desk and dust beakers when the voice shouted again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blake! Down here on the floor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing in frustration the raven haired girl plopped to the floor expecting to see some form of a prank from Yang but not the tiny version of Jaune right in front of her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune also didn't expect the giantess to fall to the floor with such force that he was bounced in the air by the impact. Upon landing painfully on the ground he found himself right in front of Blake's giant amber eyes, her pupils nearly as big as he was. He backed away from the unnerving sight bound felt his back bump into Blake's hands which she had placed behind the tiny Jaune in an almost protective manner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jaune what happened to you\", she asked in a concerned and soft voice but it still felt like a strong wind to the tiny huntsman so close to her face.<br>\r\n\"I don't know I checked to see if anyone was in your room and then that dust experiment over there exploded in my face, (no need to let her know he caused the explosion), next thing I know I'm smaller than a minuscule mouse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake gave him a look of pity, \"Aw your poor guy, I''ve told Weiss not to experiment in the room and now look what happens. Don't worry I'll find her and hopefully she'll know how to get you back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever she realized that leaving Jaune in the floor of their room at such a small size was probably not a wise idea. She could bring him with her but who knew where Weiss was and the last they needed was for her to somehow lose Jaune in the middle of the school so she decided to leave him somewhere safe in their room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter telling Jaune her plan he agreed to it and Blake let him hop onto the open palm of her hand and then gently lifted him up and carried him over to a dresser in the room. As he was carried along Jaune couldn't help but notice that while Blake was no Yang she was still very voluptuous especially when he was this small and at the same level as her chest. Her breasts stood out like blake and white fabric covered hills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully Blake didn't notice his leering and placed him on top of the dresser where she hoped he would be safe while she was gone. Though Weiss might hate his guts, and Yang liked to make fun of him, Jaune was a nice guy and Blake always had a soft spot for him and would hate to see him get hurt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok Jaune you should be safe up here. Just hang tight and I'll get Weiss or someone else to come fix this. Just don't move and stay safe ok.\" Upon seeing his nod of response Blake left the tiny blonde boy and began to turn to leave the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune watched her go before he realized he had forgotten to ask her what he was to do if somebody else came. Walking forward he took a big breath to call out to Blake when he felt the entire dresser shake as Blake lightly nudged it with her body as she was turning. Jaune's clumsy nature or bad luck came back to haunt him since he was close enough to the edge of the dresser for the light bump to send him flying off the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a tiny yelp due to his size Jaune fell through the air regretting that the dresser was above shoulder height as he looked down and found himself falling towards..........<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The ringing drowned out the voice of the falling boy as he slipped into her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune didn't have much of a chance to say anything as he effortlessly rolled down Blakes chest, the radiating body heat and filtered light quickly highlighted his situation as he tried to halt his fall on the moving girl. His arms tried to get a grip on her vertical chest as he bounced down, his eyes widened at the chasm of cleavage he seemed to be fated for as he called out once more-<br>\r\n\"Bla-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No credit?\" Blake spoke softly, failing to hear or feel her friend get wedged between her boobs as she stood still outside of the door. Her arms slowly crossed as she thought about what to do, unaware of the crushing pressure she was putting her ally under. Her large boobs smothered the tiny micro as she made her decision, briskly walking away with a small bounce to her step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune gasped air as she finally uncrossed her arms, his body slipped slightly further in before her stopped himself instinctively with his arms. Not a second later, the two giant orbs of flesh slammed down, compressing and lightly jiggling him before retreating, letting him fall further. He felt a rush of gforce as the collosal boobs came together once more, smearing him between the hot and damp flesh of Blakes cleavage. The chest retreated once more, letting him fall further before compacting again. Each step Blake took mashed the poor blonde further into her voluptuous breasts as she bounded down the hallway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach step she took bounced her chest up and down, her bra took the brunt of the weight so that it was fairly unnoticable to the outside world but to Jaune it was a world shattering difference. The bouncing breasts, constricted by the bra, took out and excess energy inwards, towards the increadably crushed micro. Jaune couldn't even call out any more as he had finally fallen to a point where he would only move a little each time after a devistating step. The tightness and heat threatened to knock the speck out as his saviour quickly turned into his tormentor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was of course, oblivious to the firm grip she had on Jaune as she assumed he was safe on the dresser. She paused infront of the large double door leading to the library before reaching out for both handles, utterly obliterating her helpless passenger as her boobs were pressed together mercilessly. The unaware cat girl simply looked around the library without a second thought to what she did before leaving for a section used for communications.</span></div></div>",

I like women as much as the next guy, but this is way more than I ever wanted or needed...\" As if offended by Jaune not wanting them, Jaune began to sink deeper into the goddess' chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake opened the computer first trying to contact her team manually through the scroll Integrated program. However, when she received no answer she sighed, \"Jaune needs help now...\" She began typing 'Shrinking Dust' she nodded to herself, \"I'll see what I can do for you Jaune, I'll fix this.\" Looking through the various results she stumbled upon a result reading 'Shrink dust reversal' she quickly copies the link along with the other note worthy links and sends them to her scroll. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up and heading out of the library she begins to head towards her dorm. However, on her way there she presses her boobs together again trying to scratch the itch, \"stupid new bra...\" She says as she readjusts it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy tugging one side of her bra, her cleavage is pushed around Jaune unevenly forcing him full further in and threatening to hungrily and mercilessly swallow him under her fun bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the tickling becomes to much for her and she quickens her pace, passing various students on the way, she finally makes it to her dorm. Opening the door she sees that her team has yet to return. Without wasting anytime she tugs at her bra again, \"stupid thing!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the inside Jaune's now neck deep in her cleavage, he begins panicking in normally Jaune fashion, and begins to sink further, he began struggling against Blake's chest. However, through this it caused him to finally fully sink in, his hair being the only thing showing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, through his struggle he caught Blake's attention. Taking a peak inside she looks around in her bra. At first she thought it was nothing, but thanks to her keen eyesight she saw a mop of blonde hair. Quickly looking at the dresser she turned beet red and reached into her shirt, pulling the poor boy out he took a few gasps of air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jaune...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune quickly looked at the familiar voice, if he didn't see Blake as a goddess before he had corrected that mistake at the sight of his savior. \"Oh, Blake, thank god... I was smothering in there, I never wanted to go through that again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly raises a brow eliciting the same reaction out of him, \"Uh...

He fought in vain against the suffocating skin, his struggling registering as little more than tickling to the giantess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake moaned at the futile resistance of her prey, and soon parted her kiss just enough to shove his head inside her hot and wet cavern. There, with her lips around his neck, her massive tongue assaulted his head relentlessly, drenching everything from his hair to his chin as it helped itself to his flavor. Jaune figured he must have tasted good as another moan echoed throughout the cave and boomed savagely in his eardrums. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only when he was running dangerously low on air that she released him, letting his head slip free from her dominating mouth with a wet pop. Where he had once been like a mouse in the kitty\u2019s grasp, now he was like a fish; ripped from water, drenched and gasping for air. He hacked violently, ejecting as much of the foreign saliva as he could from his mouth, and wiped at the sticky substance preventing his eyes from opening with his hoodie. A few wipes and a ruined sleeve later his eyelids managed to separate, though part of him wished they hadn\u2019t, for he was greeted by the giant face of his captor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake smirked at her handiwork. \u201cLike I said, Jaune\u2026\u201d She lulled as she tenderly massaged his damp hair with a finger. \u201cMy body has <i>many</i> was of making you change your mind...\u201d </span></div></div>",

Yang noticed, squeezing her legs together,<br>\r\n\"Ha- uh- I'm only like this because it's an all girls dorm but... if your going to stare like that then I might have, like, a few questions\" She nervously grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaware of Jaunes body slowly getting fed into her crack, Yang sprang out her tight spandex sleepwear.

Her hand slowly snaked around his body, and much like the animal began to slowly crush him. He began to struggle causing Blake to scoff, \"I swear you, humans...\" Jaune looked up at that, and Blake titled her head with a mock sad look, \"oh did little Jaune not know that, thinking you can fight against me at this size?\" She shook head side to side, \"what a pathetic attempt at freedom... But now, I'm gonna have to punish you...\" She trailed off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune looked at her with wide eyes, \"w-wait Blake, you can't d-do this!\" Blake slowly began to carry the Blonde to her bed, \"I think you need a lesson in who's the cat and who's the mouse.\" She tossed him on the bed with a glare. \"Stay...\" Jaune was quick to follow the obvious order. She slowly removed her boots, \"I think with my stockings off, you have something to look at and appreciate.\" She slid off her stockings and turned to Jaune with a mischevious smile that didn't make him feel all that safe.

Severely.\" Jaune nodded in fear and quickly got to work rubbing her feet to the best of his ability at this height, he started at the heel and ended in the middle of the arch. He couldn't help but admit that Blake's feet smelled and felt that of a goddess. They were so soft and smelled of lavender, it was alluring!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued to rub her feet in intervals, he's been at it now for about 45 minutes. Blake had he face buried in her book if anything this was your chance to get away before Blake goes too far! He slowly turned around then bolted for the edge of the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake's bow twitch looking up at the sound of very soft thumps on the mattress only could be heard by her Faunus hearing. Looking up with a glare, if looks could kill Jaune would have dropped dead with the glare burning into the back of his coat. \"Oh no, you don't!\" She jumps from the bed, quickly catching up to him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jumps forward ready to catch him!

She woke up earlier then the rest of her team, her curious mind itching to find out what happened next in her book. Glancing at the time, she noted that everyone else would be waking up soon. She sighed slightly, ajusting her black dressing gown slightly before grabbing her laid out clothes with ease. Feeling that her hair had air dried she loosely put on her shirt, kicking her dressing gown under the desk as she did so. Her silky smooth underwear dropped to the floor to be swooped up by her eager toes, sliding them up her leg. She gave a little hop on her seat to get them on, landing heavily each tug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake paused, her sensitive ears picking up Rubies waking up grumbles. With cat like reflexes, the raven haired girl changed into her usual atire, smiling up at Ruby's bed ready with an appology for waking her up early. Something on her chair caught her eye however, some kind of sticker. With a gasp Blake recognized the flattened form of her team mate on the wooden stool she had spent hours sitting on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-ruby?\" Blake gasped, watching the tiny figure twitch back into life. During the night, Ruby had shrunken down mysteriously, needless to say her attempts at getting someones attention had not paid off. \"O-or is that a sticker...?\" Blake frowned, breathing out slightly as she examined the wet ass print of her recent shower. It was flat, but definatly twitching. Her little party member slowly wabbled up onto her feet, not looking very happy,<br>\r\n\"Blake-!\" Ruby whined, shocking the confused cat girl. \"What happened-? W-why am I small? W-why did you sit on me?\" Ruby collapsed, tired from the lack of sleep, leaving poor Blake to deal with the odd situation,<br>\r\n\"I- don't know, I didn't realise you were on my seat-\" Blake stammered, poking her leader over with curiosity before snapping back to reality, \"I'll wake the rest up, let them know about the situation...\" Her eyes widened as she noticed Ruby's shaking head,<br>\r\n\"It could be temporary! I don't want to worry everyone, besides...\" She glanced around at the beds, \"I trust Weiss and Yang with my life, not this situation. Our little secret, kay?\" Ruby puppy dog eyed up to Blake, with such tiny proportions the cat girl found it hard to resist... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake chose to...</span></div></div>",

After about 20 minutes Blake had heard someone yawn as Yang had groggily got up her bed,noticing Yang was about to hop off her bed onto hers she quickly pushed the pillow Ruby was laying on out of the way so she wouldn't get stomped on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GOOD MORNING\" Yang said loudly this caused Weiss to wake up. \"Ugh Yang do you have to be so loud\" Weiss said annoyed. Yang noticed Blake was sitting on her bed she also noticed Ruby wasn't in her bed wondering where he little sister went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey girls have any of you seen Ruby this morning?\" Yang asked. \"Not since last night\" Weiss said.\" Well I happen to know where she is... though you might be a bit surprised at what happened to her\" Blake said to her other teammates.

A bit squished and tired\". \"Squished what do you mean?\" Yang questioned, \"well whenever I found Ruby her body had somehow been flattened like a pancake her body somehow flattening out...\" Blake answered best she could.\"It must of been a side affect to whatever had shrunken her\" Weiss concurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well whoever did this is going to pay for shrinking my sister!\" Yang said angrily. \"Now now let's not start making assumptions about who or what caused Ruby to shrink the most important thing right now is trying to find a way to turn Ruby back to normal\" Blake said to calm her friend down. \"You're right.. But how are we going to turn Ruby her normal size?\" Yang wondered. Before one of the girls could give yang an answer, the three heard a tiny yawning sound as the little Ruby woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh oh hey girls I had the weirdest dream that I had been shrunken and Blake sat on me...\" Ruby said upon waking she then looked down at the big pillow she was sleeping, \"Oh so it wasn't a dream\" Ruby said in realization. \"Sadly no it wasn't sis but don't worry me and the others are going to find a way to get you back to normal size\" Yang said to comfort her little sister, \"So what ideas do you two have\" Yang asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it would be best to ask a teacher about thier might be alone who knows a way we can fix it\" Weiss suggested. \"Alright that sound like a good idea everyone agree\" Yang asked. Blake nodded in agreement Yang then looked at Ruby who also agreed but had a question to ask. \"Could one of you stay here to make sure I'm safe\" Ruby said. \"Don't you worry sis I be stay here to protect you\" Yang replied to her little sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright it's settled then me and Blake will go find a teacher You and Ruby will stay here\" Weiss said, after all 4 girls nodded in agreement Weiss and Blake went off to find a teacher who could help Ruby...</span></div></div>",

Yang walked up to the table a smile on her face as she quickly slapped her right hand onto the table, instantly flattening Her tiny sister. She kept slapping her hands on the little Ruby, switching between both hands after each slap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a minute of doing this, Yang then decided to see how her sister was holding up ,as she peeled Ruby's flattened form off the table surprised about how soft her body was in this state.\"You still holding up well sis?\" Yang asked Ruby. Though it took a moment Ruby was able to reply to Yang,\"Yeah sis... I'm doing fine\" though still quite tired from the first part of Yang's squashing session and in quite a bit of pain, Ruby was still ready to take more punishment being sure that her body was far from its limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting her answer Yang took her boots off and got ready for her the next round of squashing her sister. Yang gently laid on the ground as she brought her yellow nail polished feet straight down on Ruby, Flattening her into the floor.

After a few of stomping on Ruby, Yang having gotten out of her trance like state, had quickly stepped off of her sisters demolished form. Ruby body had been reduced to a paste like form as Yang once again peeled Ruby off the floor having a bit more trouble do to how smeared Ruby had been.\" Heh, sorry sis I think I went a bit to overboard there, my next idea will be nice and quick though I'll be putting a lot more force then the previous squashing so be ready\" Yang said to her little blobby sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang took a good look at Ruby, noticing her little face in the middle of her blobby form, letting out a little giggle about how silly her sister looked as she got ready for her plan. Yang had grabbed one of her Ember Celicas, putting it on her wrist as she turned into its weapon form. She then grabbed Ruby with her other hand and molded her into a small ball loading her sister into her weapon as she got ready. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quick swing of her arm her weapon fired Ruby out of it, sending Ruby flying into a wall at insanely high speed as Ruby ball like form splattered all over the wall. Yang walked over to the wall as she peeled her sister off of it.\"Wow I smeared you good didn't I\" Yang said. \"I think that's enough for now\" Yang said feeling that she had flattened Ruby enough for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually... Wait a second Ruby I have one more thing I want to do with you in terms of testing your durability\"Yang said carrying Ruby to the bathroom to wash her off. Ruby meanwhile was currently passed out having been tried out from all the squishing, as Yang ran her under the water to clean her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter doing so Yang once again rolled her up into a ball,however instead of putting Ruby into her ember celica, Yang had tossed Ruby into her mouth deciding to see how well Ruby would work as gum. Yang started to chew her up with her teeth making Ruby into a gooey mush as Yang then brought Ruby up to her mouth as she started to blow a bubble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby bubble body stretched out many times its tiny size before Yang poked it with her finger causing Ruby to pop all over her face. Yang peeled Ruby off her face laying her down onto Blake bed so she could reform. After about Ruby body had returned to its original form as Yang picked her up with a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now were done that I think I can determine that your body seems to have no limit on how much it can stretch, the only limit being how long it takes you to reform\" Yang inferred.\" Well atleast we won't have to worry about me being killed in this tiny form\" Ruby mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do you want to see what Else your body can do, or should we wait till Weiss and Blake come back\"Yang asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby replied saying that they should...</span></div></div>",

Pyrrha was carried along with the unconscious girl through trails and over mountains to reach her cabin in the woods. Quietly, as Ruby recovered, Pyrrha hid in under tables and explored the house while Taiyang was out gardening. She managed to befriend Zwei, the only face she was willing to show hers to, and who also just so happened to make for great transport.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Pyrrha learned that Ruby was leaving with the rest of her team, she was ecstatic, ready to hitch a ride and be with her friends. But then she doubted herself, realizing the dangers wound be much greater at her diminutive stature. So she stayed, with Zwei and the Xiao Longs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha has sat on the couch with Zwei, watching the news that Taiyang had happened to leave on, when she heard heavy thumping coming from up the stairs. Looking over, she saw Yang making her way down, figuring out the buttons on her new arm (Pyrrha knew already from noisy nights that she found the vibration function). From her reconnaissance she learned Yang was going to start training soon with her dad. But with him out of the house for now, Yang was just doing whatever.<br>\r\nPyrrha noticed Yang making her way towards the couch, attracted by the noise of the T.V.<br>\r\n\"Okay, Zwei,\" Pyrrha said, \"be a good boy and let me on. Please. I can't have Yang seeing me.\"<br>\r\nZwei ignored her, as he sometimes does, choosing instead to sit down next to her.<br>\r\nPanicked as Yang got closer, Pyrrha tried to mount him on her own, only to get kicked off as he jumped off the couch. As she rolled onto her back to get back up, her heart skipped a beat as she realized it was too late. Yang didn't see her, but it was much worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young blonde sparsely looked at the screen as she fiddled around with the different functions on her new arm. She blushed and smiled when she accidentally turned the vibration function back on. \"Nope, that's for later!\" Laughing to herself, she turned her back to the couch as she sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe force of the giant's giant legging-clad bum crashing down onto Pyrrha was agonizing. It was all the feeling of being hit by an Ursa Grimm, only more intense, all over her body, and with the warmth of blood rushing to her cheeks as she was smushed under the cheeks she admittedly stared and admired at while hanging in Yang's room on some lonely nights. It was painful, it was embarrassing, and it was inescapable. Pyrrha learned after one fateful night under Yang's sheets (She'd tell you she had nothing to do with being there) that being stuck under a curvy girl isn't as fun as it seems, and she's learning that lesson all over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang pushed her chest forward, stretched her arms up together, and straightened her legs out, sighing a satisfying grunt as her whole body crackled and popped in stretched relief. Unfortunately, this pushed her body, and more importantly her booty, down into the couch. Pyrrha's muffled screaming going unnoticed by Yang, she flexed her cheeks as well, ready to get all her muscles ready for her training later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the force grew and the cheeks squeezed together, Pyrrha found herself being eaten up by the thinly-clothed ass of the buxom blonde above her. Soon, after Yang's periodic clench and releases, Pyrrha could no longer feel the cushions below her, now only feeling Yang's powerful muscles chew her up, squeezing the air out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to Yang, however, Pyrrha's presence deep between her cheeks was giving her a very distracting feeling. She tried to ignore it, but she just couldn't. She stopped her stretching to bring her hand down to her leggings and deal with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was she feeling?</div></span></div></div>",

Listening happily to the splashes of the water slide- \"Ohh- I'm totally going for that first-\" He shuddered, wrapping a golden tail around the zip- tugging it slightly open before taking a peek out from Blakes bag. \"The queue is going so slow though- still- standing on a cute girls swimwear still beats remedial lessons-\" The monkey boy nodded to himself- slipping back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Failing his exams and mocking the evil teachers had seemed to of stopped our mighty hero from checking out the new leisure center's opening. However- the monkey boy genius concocted a devious plan, mixing dust in order to create the world first shrinking explosion! Gone in a blaze of smoke, our dashing hero snuck off into the... uh... day... hitching a ride within the buxom Blakes bag\" Sun boasted, dashing his head left and right, on the lookout for Glynda who would certainly be hot on his tail. His story was mostly right, his tail knocking over random vials shrank him. His- silent sneak away in a cloud of smoke was more him yelling something along the lines of 'So long suckers! I'm getting a tan!' mid shrink- not going unnoticed by the surprised Glynda who had agreed to look after him as he shrunk under the door. \"Almost- foolproof-\" He mumbled, slinking back down as he hoped Glynda went to the beach or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few more minutes before the girls made it to the counter- buying their tickets with happy chatter before moving onto the changing rooms. As soon as the zip undid, the tiny monkey boy slipped into Blakes clothes, ready to jump out. He wasn't prepared for the speed of the ninja like girls hand however- his tiny body quickly flying into the air from the force of her taking out her swim wear. <br>\r\n\"What the- h-HEY! Bla-\" He started as he fell, his words cut off as he splatted against a surface. Unnoticed-</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Having no idea which direction the RWBY girls had gone in, Sun figured his best bet was to head to the pools. Not only would it be a comfortable place to hang out, and maybe even tan a little, but it would also give him an excellent opportunity to \u2018appreciate the scenery\u2019 as it were. Or, more accurately, to spy on Blake and the other girls in their revealing swimsuits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to waste any time, the swift Faunus shot a quick glance up to make sure his path was indeed clear before dashing out the door, narrowly outrunning yet another girl following him out the exit, her bare feet slapping audibly on the tiles as she passed overhead. Pulling an immediate right turn and making a dash for the other side of the path, Sun just barely managed to skid to a stop in time to avoid being crush underfoot by a group of thoroughly soaked women heading back towards the change rooms. With no time to identify the giants above, the next few minutes were a blur of dodged footsteps and near misses before the shrunken teen finally made it to the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing a sigh of relief as he hugged the base of the nearest railing, Sun rolled his eyes at his own stupidity. \u201cWhy did the monkey cross the path? Because he didn\u2019t think it through.\u201d He chuckled at his own joke, before shaking it off and heading back towards the pool, or at least following the girls who looked the most like they were heading for a pool. Hugging the wall this time, he managed to avoid any more near misses for a while, and took a moment to note just how full of girls this place really was. He honestly wasn\u2019t sure if the centre was open to guys at all, but it was evident that today at least it was women only, as everywhere he looked was girls, girls and more girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd while he couldn\u2019t see the place too well at his current stature, it looked like it was a veritable maze of pools and spas, interspersed with lounging areas, water slides, and other amenities. Taking a moment to look over the edge of the path he currently stood on, Sun realised that the whole facility was multilayered as well, with some of the pools being at a notably higher level than others. There were signs warning guests not to jump into the lower pools from the upper levels, but with huntresses-in-training like Yang and Nora in attendance, it was really only a matter of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy coincidence more than intent, Sun had taken the path to the central pool, sitting around mid-height and covering an impressive area. As the protection of his railing ended and the path opened up before him, the monkey Faunus looked around and realised with a grin that he had in fact managed to track down his original targets, the Team RWBY girls chatting animatedly with Pyrrha and Nora in the lounge area directly across from his current position. Reaching them would mean crossing the open ground between, and risking getting trampled, but he\u2019d made it last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, there were other options available to him. Closer than RWBY, the pool itself was occupied by a bevy of girls. Closest to his current position were a couple girls he recognised from Haven, Arslan and Reese, who were bobbing in the water while chatting with that sniper girl from Shade (May, if he recalled correctly) and that crazy cat Faunus from Atlas (definitely Neon). Team ARBN hadn\u2019t necessarily been close with Team SSSN at the academy but they got along well enough and he\u2019d be lying if he said he wasn\u2019t interested in checking the girls out at his current scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were plenty of other girls around of course, but right now Sun figured his best options were either the lounge area or the pool, and he casually stepped forward as he considered his options.</span></div></div>",

He paid for that decision before he even had a chance to process what was happening, a sudden and painful impact catching him in the side and propelling him into the air so quickly that he was well on his way before he even realised what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTumbling uncontrollably through the air, Sun got a brief view of the rabbit girl Velvet rushing by below him and dimly realised that the object that had hit him had in fact been the older girl\u2019s foot. His tiny body had been an unseen and unintentional casualty as the brunette headed to join Coco at the other side of the pool, the impact not even registering to the much larger Faunus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fast moving foot had impacted the shrunken blonde with enough force to send him flying straight over the water and the lounging area, his previous targets passing by below as he travelled over both them and the boundary separating the central pool from the smaller ones below. As he cleared the railing his tumbling finally subsided to the point where he could actually see where he was going, blue eyes looking down as one of the smaller pools rushed up to meet him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis pool was much cosier than the larger one above, and was currently occupied by a group of five girls that Sun only dimly recognised. Leaning against one side of the pool, Cinder Fall was a woman he vaguely recalled as another Haven student, albeit one that barely ever seemed to actually be at the academy. Her green-haired teammate Emerald was floating closer to the middle of the pool and appeared to be engaged in conversation with her leader, while that small gothic girl floated on her back nearby (Sun wasn\u2019t sure if he\u2019d ever actually caught that one\u2019s name). The other two girls were paddling around on the other side of the pool, and the Faunus was pretty sure they were the twins from that club that Yang liked, though why they were handing out with Cinder was beyond him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSun noticed all of this in the few seconds it took for his accelerating body to reach the ground, using the last of his strength to flip over and protect his face as he slammed down on the tiles at the very edge of the pool, narrowly avoiding a direct impact with the water. Though he supposed it was a good thing he didn\u2019t have to worry about drowning, the impact with the tiles almost instantly reduced him to a flattened disk of flesh and torn cloth, groaning in pain as his tiny eyes blinked up dimly at the glaring sun above. He\u2019d wanted a chance to tan but definitely not like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill dazed, the blonde frowned as he felt more than saw a movement in the water behind him and a sudden burst of noise accompanied the form of one of the bathing females rising from the pool, casting a deep shadow over his stricken body as [Blank] descended towards him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cTch, empty.\u201d With a frown, Melanie tossed her empty drink can out of the pool, neither noticing nor caring where it landed as she started making her way towards the water\u2019s edge. \u201cI\u2019m going to get another one Miltia, do you need anything?\u201d The younger twin shook her head, and the brunette didn\u2019t even bother to enquire as to the needs of her other companions. They were colleagues in a venture, of which only the barest logistics had been explained to her. They were not friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the edge Melanie took no notice of the tan smear that had once been Sun, simply planting her hands to either side of him and hoisting herself up in one fluid movement. Raising her right leg from the water, she swung it forward over the lip and planted it on the very edge of the pool, before leveraging all her weight onto the appendage as she pulled the rest of her body out. It was a testament to her well-trained leg strength that the young enforcer was able to pull off such an exit, balancing on that single foot for several long seconds before finally bringing her other foot down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a short moment the brunette felt that the texture of the tiles beneath her right foot was strange, but she dismissed that thought soon after as a trick of the water and nothing more. For the unfortunate Sun, however, that strange texture translated into crushing torment as Melanie\u2019s sole bore down on him, compacting his already flat form even further as her full weight pressed down. The last thing he had seen was the ball of this girl\u2019s foot zeroing in on his head before she had destroyed any chance he had of reinflating himself and getting help from the bathing beauties. Being sat on by Yang before had hurt, but back then her weight had both been distributed over a larger surface, and lessened by the way she was sitting, with her feet still taking weight. This time, all of Melanie\u2019s mass had been focused on him for a few agonising seconds, not to mention that the well-used sole of the kick-focused girl\u2019s foot was much firmer than Yang\u2019s jiggly booty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe force did lessen somewhat as the other foot was planted but by then the damage had already been well and truly done. The wet flesh of Melanie\u2019s foot adhered to Sun\u2019s skin and clothing as the force of the impact ironed him onto her sole, smearing his legs and torso along the underside while his face was flattened against the ball, and crushed all the more as she went to step off, her heel lifting first before the rest of the foot followed. To the monkey Faunus\u2019 utter dismay he was taken with it, lifted high into the air before being slammed down again. Utterly flat, he could do nothing to defend himself as the brunette\u2019s full weight bore down on him with her next step, only to be lifted up once more to repeat the process over and over in a seemingly endless cavalcade of torture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncaring of the hell she was inflicting, Melanie bid a casual farewell to her compatriots before heading for the stairs to the upper levels. For her it took only a dozen or so steps to reach the stairs, a cycle of movement not even worth the briefest conscious thought. It took only a fraction more of her attention to safely ascend the stairs, which she took at a languid pace, flattening Sun all the more as she pulled herself up and scrapped him across the smooth wooden panels. By the time the two of them had reached the top and travelled the remaining distance to the drinks area, the unfortunate Faunus had been alternatively nearly drowned in puddles and rubbed raw against the floors, his clothes mostly shredded and ripped away, while his body was more adhered than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisoriented and in pain, Sun couldn\u2019t even groan as he was continuously crushed beneath the foot of the oblivious enforcer, wondering if she was ever going to reach her destination. From Melanie\u2019s perspective the trip to the line took only a couple of minutes, whereas to her passenger it felt like an eternity. Having just emerged from the pool, the brunette\u2019s feet were at least relatively clean and fresh smelling, but that wasn\u2019t much of a comfort when they were busy squishing him into oblivion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for Sun the stomping did eventually stop when Melanie joined the drinks queue, sighing to herself as she crossed her arms and tapped her right foot in frustration for a while before transitioning to absentmindedly rubbing it back and forth across the tiles. For the first time since exiting the pool, the kick-specialist was leaning most of her weight onto her left foot, her right ghosting across the tiles as it moved. Crushed as he was, the captured Faunus saw a possible opportunity to escape and began to struggle with what little strength he had left.</span></div></div>",

Had it been down to his strength alone, he would certainly have failed, but for once luck appeared to be on his side, as his squished hand caught under a loose edge of one of the flagstones. It stung like nothing else as his hand was pulled tight against the coarse tile and his arm stretched to several times its normal length, but the move was successful in pulling his shoulder and part of his torso free before the foot swung back. With the next pass his body was folded over itself but both his head and his other arm were peeled from the offending sole, allowing him to grab another handhold as the line in front shifted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSun hadn\u2019t quite been prepared for Melanie to step off completely, but he held on as best he could as the brunette shifted forward, his torso momentarily stretched like a piece of gum as his hips and legs were carried off while his arms remained attached to the floor, and for a few terrifying fractions of a second he was worried he was going to break in two. Seemingly at the last moment, however, the water adhering him to the sole gave way, and his lower half snapped back to join the rest of him on the floor. His body was mashed all over the place, all of his nerves were screaming at him in agony, and his limbs were stretched and twisted in odd directions, but he was finally free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHigh above, the entire queue had shifted, and Melanie had stepped forward to fill the resulting gap, frowning slightly as she felt something like a bandage peeling from her foot. She glanced back over her shoulder to see what it was and glowered as she saw a stretched out tan lump where she had just been standing. It was probably someone\u2019s gum, and she had a half a mind to give it a good stomping in retaliation for touching her, but held back given that she was well aware that would be a fairly self-defeating and pointless action. So instead she just glared and moved on, comforting herself with the thought that if she left it there it would inevitably get stomped on by someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeedless of Melanie\u2019s sour thoughts, Sun relished in his first chance to breath in what felt like forever. He was still mangled and had difficulty perceiving his surroundings through the squished features of his face, but already he could feel his body starting to pull itself back together, his stretched out limbs slowly retracting back in towards his gradually reinflating body. That said, now given a proper chance to reflect, the monkey Faunus conceded that maybe hitching a ride in an unknowing Blake\u2019s bag after accidentally shrinking himself while fleeing Glynda had, just maybe, not been one of his brightest ideas. Even getting the chance to see his not-so-secret crush in her swimsuit, not to mention her teammates and a ton of other girls, probably wasn\u2019t worth what he had been through so far, and certainly wouldn\u2019t have been worth it if he\u2019d remained stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of swimsuits, the squished boy was at least given a good view as he struggled to reform, a very impressive set of curves coming into view as the line shifted. From the angle his eyes, or at least one of them, were facing, he couldn\u2019t make out the face of this new arrival, but from what he could see she was certainly very well developed, suggesting perhaps a fully-grown woman rather than a teenager. While he\u2019d deny it if he was asked directly, Sun was admittedly a bit of a perv. After all Blake\u2019s \u2018bow\u2019 was only the third of her features he\u2019d noticed, coming after her large booty and nice bosom. On that note, this woman surpassed the cat Faunus in every way, her bottoms clearly struggling to contain the sheer girth of her rear, while her top strained to hold her chest. It was a rather nice view all things considered, and almost made him rethink his earlier concerns. That was, until the line shifted again and those lovely curves were obscured by a rapidly descending foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSun was able to muster just enough strength for a feeble scream before the smooth sole slammed down upon him, instantly undoing what progress his body had made towards reforming. His body\u2019s attempts to pull back together had done nothing but ensure that the whole of him was in the path of this unknown woman\u2019s step. His mangled form spread beneath her sole while his head and shoulders ended up beneath her toes, the biggest one in particular pressing down on his face while his arms were plunged into the sweaty crevice beneath. The weight of the step was intense, and the crushed Faunus was instantly aware that this woman was heavier than his previous tormentor. Worse, whereas Melanie\u2019s foot had been cool, the sole that was now pressing down on him was warm, bombarding him with heat, and adhering him worse than ever as its sweaty moistness pulled him in, the open pores hungrily sucking him up as he was plunged into every available gap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn instant later and the weight doubled as the woman\u2019s other foot lifted and her toes clenched down, reducing what was left of Sun\u2019s arms to a feeble smear of flesh to be toyed with within the crevice, and removing any chance of grabbing onto something to free himself. At this point he wasn\u2019t even surprised when the foot lifted again and brought him with it, his crushed body trapped worse than it had ever been with Melanie as his unknown captor moved towards the front of the line. Face-first against her toe, he could do little but wonder absently who it was that had claimed him, only to have that thought crushed out of him as the foot slammed down once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo who is it that has claimed Sun as their new squishy foot accessory?</span></div></div>",

Though she got some weird looks from other people there she told people to ignore her saying that it was nothing It couldn't be possible, could this blob really be the boy she was looking for, she double checked to make sure she wasn't seeing anything but to her surprise the evidence had been there as the more she sat there the more human shaped the blob started to look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Sun not being stepped on anymore was a blessing however when he was brought up to the face off this woman to say the least he wasn't to happy. Seeing that Glynda had found him he sort off hoped that she wouldn't realize that it was him and would just peel him off her foot and toss him away, potentially to a place were he could reform. that hope was dashed as she yelled out the his last name, Thought not being happy about being found out and was likely to be punished he was at least happy that he wouldn't have to be squashed again, likely that having found him Ms. Goodwitch would take him to a place to be turned back to normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\nUnaware of what Glynda had planned for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Glynda looked at that reforming blob of Sun a smile started to form on her face, the dust that had affected Sun not only made him shrink down but also made his body squishy and durable. Glynda decided she would take advantage off this by using Sun's body as a stress toy for her to play with as punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed Sun's body peeling it off her foot as she closed her hand around Sun's body squeezing to prevent it from reforming. She than walked off Sun's blob like form in hand with her drink being left at the counter as she left the leisure center going to the wash room to take her swim clothes off and put her school uniform back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe than walked through the halls to the teacher's lounge to play with her new toy, no one was in the teachers lounge today luckily for Glynda as she sat down at a table dropping Sun blobby body on it as she waited for it to reform, after Sun had reformed Glynda looked at him with devious eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIntimidated by the huge face off the teacher Sun saw before him he deiced to play it cool to potentially move around the subject off his punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how has your day been...\" Sun said awkwardly. \"Well Mr Wukong I've have been spending an hour looking for your only to find you have some how been shrunk down and squashed against my foot\" Glynda said intensely. Sun sighed \"I'm getting punished right...\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yep\" Glynda replied \"And to make up for all the running around looking for you that you made me do, I'm going to use your body as a squishy stress toy\" Gylnda said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSun was shocked to say the least he had just escaped being squashed on, and now he was being told that he was going to be punished by being squashed on more. Before Sun could reply he saw Glynda hand coming down on him he could only let a small scream before it squashed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she squashed Sun, Gylnda grabbed him and started stretching and squashing him with her hands enjoying his soft dough like form between her hands.As she did this she started to think off other ways to play with her new toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she got an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well before I start doing other things with your body I should test out how far you can stretch or how flat you can become\" Glynda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlynda was going to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kali Belladonna, wife of Menagerie\u2019s chieftain, and loving mother of one Blake Belladonna, had received word from a trusted source that her daughter had joined a hunter-team in training at Beacon academy. Though surprised by the news, the older cat Faunus was, more than anything, overjoyed to hear that her child was not only alive and well, but appeared to have turned away from the dark path that that Taurus boy had begun to lead her down. Her source had assured her there was no White Fang plot involved, so she had resolved that the most logical course of action would be to visit Vale herself and make direct contact with her much loved but trying offspring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, upon arriving in Vale after a long trip on a fishing boat she had taken a quick whiff of herself and instantly determined that she needed to get thoroughly cleaned before approaching Blake, wanting to be in her absolute best condition before reuniting with her daughter. A sign for a new pool with speciality spa-facilities had caught Kali\u2019s eye soon after, and she\u2019d made a beeline for them, little knowing the risk of encountering Blake and her team, who were also in attendance. Fortunately for the older Belladonna, fortune had been in her favour, and she had already spent a couple of hours relaxing in one of the many spas before getting thirsty enough to grab a drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince a visit to a spa had not been on her original itinerary, however, the Faunus had been forced to purchase a bikini on her arrival and had admittedly failed to properly convert her measurements to the different system used in Vale. As such, Kali found herself clad in essentially a cheek-revealing black thong and a bikini top that showed more cleavage and under boob than she had intended, the combo leaving very little to the imagination and exposing off her curves for all to see. If Ghira were here he would certainly have objected, just as soon as he stemmed his nose bleed that was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she shuffled forward in the drink\u2019s line, Kali had no idea that she had stepped on the shrunken Sun, even as her playful toes started to squelch around the captured parts of his body. Though trained to act in a refined and dignified manner, the raven-haired woman was a tactile and fidgety person by nature, and her toes were all too happy to accept their new playmate, pulling his stretched-out body into their embrace bit by bit as their owner waited patiently in line. Soon after, the Faunus obtained her drink and turned to head back to the spas, intent on getting another good soak as each step crushed her unfortunate passenger, further flattening him into the moist flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Sun still had no idea who had captured him, only that whoever it was they were inflicting upon him a far worse torment than he had experienced under Melanie. The sweaty flesh of her big toe was forcing all of its moisture directly down his throat, while the smell of the perspiration invaded his nose. Worse, even if he couldn\u2019t see it, he could feel more of his body being inexorably pulled in by the toes, turning him into a glorified chew toy as they rubbed their grime into his skin. His neck was stretched, and only the force of her toe every time it came down was preventing his head from being pulled into the abyss as well, something he was sure wouldn\u2019t last long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Kali reached the spas, most of Sun\u2019s body had been pulled into the embrace of her toes, only his head and lower legs still free while the rest of him was a twisted smear within the crevice. That said, freedom was relative, since his head was still crushed and the student could do nothing to defend himself as he was plunged into the hot water, his skin burning at the contact. Now faced with the very really possibility of drowning, Sun put everything he had into struggling, but succeeded only in causing a minor tickling sensation between his captor\u2019s toes. Though she felt the tickles, Kali passed it off as being caused by the bubbles and responded by playfully scrunching her toes, pulling the last of the squished boy in and removing any sight of him from the outside world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trapped Faunus was granted some small mercy as his tormentor leant back and raised her legs, lifting her right foot from the water and bobbing it in the air while continuing to scrunch her toes, but any relief he may have felt was quickly lost as her other foot closed in. For a fleeting moment the attacking toes retreated, and Sun was able to get a glimpse of the outside world, only for that glimpse to be filled with another set of toes as Kali started playing footsie with herself, rubbing her toes along and beneath each other and unknowingly scrapping them along the tiny boy\u2019s body. Even out of the water the warmth of the spa was heating her feet, and an increasing quantity of sweat was flowing into the blonde\u2019s body, mixing with the grime that was already present beneath the Faunus woman\u2019s toes as she pressed Sun deeper and deeper into the folds of the sweaty digits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Kali this was heavenly. The warmth from the spa was seeping through her skin and into her bones, warming and rejuvenating her as she allowed herself to fully relax into the water. With no-one else around to judge her, there was no need to maintain appearances and she was free to just let loose, happily playing with her own toes as she allowed the dexterous digits to move freely in what felt like the first time in forever. There was an odd sensation beneath the toes of her right foot, but it wasn\u2019t unpleasant, and rather than investigate she just pressed the toes of her left foot into the gap as hard as she could, rubbing them back and forth and moaning in pleasure as the feeling got stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Sun it felt like Kali\u2019s toenails were trying to tear him apart as they dug into his skin, while his face was simultaneously being smeared into her toe-jam and stretched further and further across the moist flesh. A part of him hoped that the scrapping nails would peel him free, though he knew he would then have to deal with the water below, and the threat of drowning it brought with it. He could distantly pick up the sounds of this unaware woman\u2019s moans as she took pleasure in his suffering, but ultimately Sun could do nothing but hope for some chance of salvation.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Sun\u2019s presence had remained mostly beneath her notice as she continued to soak and allow her toes to play with each other, Kali did gradually come to realise that there was something other than bubbles tickling the underside of her right toes. She could feel the pressure of the toes from her left foot pressing into the gaps, but it also felt like there was something in-between. Something that was preventing direct contact. Like a sock but smoother, feeling more like an extra layer of skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever it was, it was pleasurable, and relaxed as she was the Faunus woman tried not to worry about it, simply enjoying the feeling of it beneath her wiggling feet as she alternated between squeezing it harshly beneath her curled toes, and scrubbing at it forcibly with the digits of her left foot. Sometimes she would catch a nail under its edge or otherwise snag something and feel it start to pull away, but another quick rub or squeeze would address that issue and keep it right where she wanted it. Her sweat and toe grime seemed to be acting as lubricants and adherents, allowing her to spread this foreign substance all over the base of her toes, like spreading massage oil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll good things must come to an end however, and eventually the more logical part of Kali\u2019s mind told her that she should really check what exactly it was she was so happily spreading across her feet, in case it turned out to be something notably unpleasant. Really it could be any number of things, but most of the items she could think of weren\u2019t exactly pleasant. Resigned, the cat Faunus moved to a more upright position, briefly dunking her right foot back into the water before pulling it out and turning the sole to face her curious eyes, amber orbs already narrowing in concentration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all honesty, as her eyes finally alighted on what was left of Sun\u2019s squishy body, Kali had no idea what she was looking at. A tan lump of\u2026 something was oozing between her toes, looking more solid that liquid yet clearly able to be easily manipulated by her own fairly casual movements. Even now a simple wiggle of her toes pulled a part of the mass into the yawning gaps, catching it between and squishing into even more as the digits came back together in an enthusiastic embrace. It didn\u2019t look unpleasant at least, and there was no sign of anything particularly sticky or otherwise dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Sun, this examination afforded him his first opportunity to see who it was that had him captured. The majority of his face was currently being squeezed between this woman\u2019s second and third toes, but one eye was free enough to peer out of the gap at the discerning amber eyes that peered down at him. He had no idea who this woman was, though he did note that she bore some resemblance to his crush Blake, and that she sported a similar pair of cat ears on her head, though these had been left uncovered. It was relatively clear that, while she had maintained a certain lustre, this woman was several years older than himself, her gaze holding a depth of knowledge and wisdom beyond what he was used to. Even so, the blonde couldn\u2019t deny that this massive being was quite attractive, and felt that he would have liked to meet her under different circumstances. He tried to wiggle to get her attention, but what little he could manage was easily covered by the movement of her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill oblivious to what she was looking at, Kali wiggled her toes a few more times before eventually reaching down to peel off the tortured boy. Seeing a particularly thick mass between her second and third toes, she reached into the gap and squeezed the lump between her fingers, unknowingly crushing Sun\u2019s entire head in the process. Closing her palm into a fist around the lump, she pulled hard, slowly but surely peeling off the rest of his body as it slid from the crevice and the gaps between each set of toes. As more and more came free her fingers would feed it into the confines of her fist, allowing greater leverage to work with to tug at the last few vestiges. It would have been faster if she\u2019d stop clenching, but the feeling of the gum sliding between the digits was just too good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually though Sun was freed, and when Kali finally unclenched her fist, he was just barely able to see out from the squished mass he had become. The removal process had certainly been unpleasant, and more than a bit of her sweat and toejam had come along for the ride, but the palm of this woman\u2019s hand was an infinitely preferable place to be than beneath the smelly embrace of her toes. Better yet, from this vantage he could get a better look at her impressive body, particularly the bountiful chest bobbing in the water below. Taking a chance to finally breathe some fresh air, the monkey Faunus felt that things were finally starting to look up, but in doing so he utterly failed to realise that he was missing what might be his best chance yet to struggle and be noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Sun\u2019s lack of independent movement, and utterly smeared and unrecognisable features, there was nothing to distinguish him from a squishy lump of clay, and that was exactly what Kali determined him to be as the fingers of her other hand descended. A brief shadow was the only warning the shrunken student received before suddenly finding himself being forced down into the palm, each of the cat Faunus\u2019s fingers pressing down on various parts of his body as she experimented with his malleable nature. For her part, Kali found herself utterly fascinated by this squishy thing, quickly moving from just poking to pinching and prodding, shifting the mass so that she could attack it will all ten fingers as she stretched and squished it between her hands.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sun was caught between pleasure and pain as dexterous fingers probed every inch of his body, their touch light but insistent as they nipped at him, further obscuring and twisting his features. Woken from his stupor, the blonde finally began to put some effort into struggling, but the tiny movements he could manage were completely obscured by the motions of Kali\u2019s hands, and before he could even attempt to speak the Faunus woman forcible slammed her hands together and began rubbing them in circles, quickly compacting the unfortunate boy into a small tortured ball of flesh and blowing all thoughts of pleasure from his mind. For several long moments she just enjoyed the feeling of the cool material being rolled between her palms, before eventually pausing to hold her new squishy ball up to the light and attempt to decide exactly what it was that she was holding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding it up to its namesake, Kali slowly turned her new discovery around to examine it from every possible angle. Had she done this to begin with she may well have realised its true nature, but as it was all features had been thoroughly demolished, leaving behind a mostly uniform tan surface, with the few discolourations easily dismissed as smudges of muck from her own toes. Its gum-like texture and malleability was now known, as was its internal cohesion preventing it from being pulled apart. These matters and more were taken into account, considered and understood, and a conclusion drawn. \u201cOh, I see. It must be some of that massage clay from the parlour. Guess it was stuck to one of the guests and came loose somewhere. Wonder how it got on my foot though?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, how it became attached to her didn\u2019t really matter in the long run. It looked clean enough, so the Faunus simply dunked it back in the water for a quick wash, giving it a thorough scrubbing in the hot tub before pulling it out for a final examination and a small smile. To Sun, Kali\u2019s words filled him with nothing but dread, having now realised his mistake in not moving earlier. He tried to speak but was instantly cut off by his trip into the burning water, the force of the scrubbing he received leaving him cleaner but also utterly annihilating what little ability to vocalise he had left. As he one again came face-to-face with the deceptively pretty face of his captor, he felt only dread at the small smile that crossed her lips, knowing all too well that such a look meant nothing good for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with her work, Kali slowly stepped out of the spa, careful not to drop her newfound clay in the process. As she quickly grabbed her towel to dry off with one hand, she allowed her smile to widen, truly pleased at her discovery. She\u2019d seen some massages being given when she first headed into the pools, and the thick clay-like oil they had been using looked absolutely heavenly. One of the masseuses had mentioned that it was great for drawing out and absorbing sweat, and if the squeaky clean feeling of her toes right now was any indication it really lived up to its reputation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a little silly Kali spoke down at the squishy lump like it was a real person, oblivious to the fact that it actually was. \u201cHow lucky. I was going to drop by to pick some of you up, but you\u2019ve saved me the trip.\u201d Teeth were bared as the Faunus woman\u2019s smiled turned into a playfully sinister smirk. \u201cToo bad for you though. You would have been much better off remaining stuck to whoever carried you away, since you may never be able to come back from where you\u2019re going to be going now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKali could think of a hundred uses for such a fortunate find, but right now there was one that stuck out most prominently in her mind, making itself all the more known as she shifted her stance a little and felt her colossal cheeks slide together. She\u2019d admittedly always been fairly proud of her booty, and perhaps more delighted than she should have been that her daughter had inherited it, but it wasn\u2019t without its downsides. The heat deep within her crack could reach unbearable levels, and the resulting sweat often had nowhere to escape, sealed within the tight embrace of her buttocks. Proper cleaning was difficult, so any means of reducing the ever-present swamp was welcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Sun\u2019s perspective, the sight of his new owner\u2019s face and chest was replaced with a view of her back as he was brought around behind her, with his eyes almost immediately trailing down to get a look at this woman\u2019s lower curves. If his throat wasn\u2019t already crushed, the blonde would certainly have gulped audibly at the sight that greeted him. He\u2019d thought that Blake\u2019s rear was big, but somehow the seemingly endless expanses of flesh below him were even bigger, the two massive buttocks sitting either side of a cavernous abyss as her bikini bottoms were slowly pulled away. If nothing happened to save him now, there was no telling if he would ever be able to escape.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>All in all, Sun found himself quite conflicted. On the one hand he was terrified at the possibility of being crushed between the firm-looking cheeks, which even now were shifting below him and grinding against each other. But on the other hand, he couldn\u2019t help but feel an instant attraction towards this woman, who seemed remarkably like a bigger, more mature, version of Blake. Not that his opinion really mattered, as high above his captor released her grip and allowed him to fall. Her aim was true, and with a quick plummet, the shrunken student found himself sliding into hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKali shuddered in pleasure as she felt her new booty clay fall neatly between her cheeks, its own weight combined with the slickness of her flesh causing it to slide rapidly out of sight. Wanting to prolong the sensation as long as possible, the cat Faunus began shifting her weight from side to side, sashaying her hips until she finally felt the lump come to a stop deep within the abyss of her rear. Fighting off the temptation to stick her fingers in and really force it deep, she released her grip on her bikini bottoms and allowed them to snap back to her ass, the fabric quickly burying most of its mass between her buttocks and ensuring that her unknown prisoner had no hope of escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Kali her little passenger felt pleasantly cool between her warm cheeks and already she could feel his tiny body starting to soak up her overflowing sweat. For Sun, any sense of pleasure he may have felt had been utterly blown away the moment he had sunk in between the hellish orbs. The heat was near-excruciating, and the pressure was crushing him from all sides, but those things were next to nothing in the face of the sweat, the smell, and the taste. As much as he\u2019d admired his fair share of large asses, the Faunus had never really considered what they were like inside, and now that he was being exposed to one, he was seriously starting to reconsider his previous fascination. The sweat of Kali\u2019s booty was everywhere, already soaking deep into his skin despite his short period of exposure, and the stale smell of it surrounded him from all angles, seeping into his nose no matter how hard he tried to keep it out. But worst of all was the taste. In his squished state, the blonde was unable to do anything to prevent the sweat from seeping into his mouth and violating his tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the burning mass of his captor\u2019s booty pressing into him from all sides, Sun felt like he was trapped in the world\u2019s worst smelling sauna. With so much pressure and heat from all sides there was no hope for his body to reform, and if anything it was actually getting worse, with even casual movements from Kali stretching and squishing his body between the cheeks. It felt like his already malleable body was going to melt into goop if he stayed here much longer, though he knew that he didn\u2019t exactly have a choice in the matter, and that his future depending solely on his unaware jailer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny boy\u2019s experience only became worse as Kali started to move, her static cheeks exploding into sudden motion as the already crushing force multiplied many times over. Where before he had been slowly sinking, now Sun was being actively chewed up like a piece of gum that had found itself on the wrong end of someone\u2019s digestive system. Claiming its new pet, the Faunus woman\u2019s booty consumed him without remorse, welcoming him with a fresh wave of sweat and a cloud of noxious fumes as the stagnant air within shifted to surround him in a horrific bubble. Any hope of reforming was well and truly lost as the shrunken student was smeared across both cheeks, forming a tight seal as he reluctantly set to work soaking up the swamp of this woman\u2019s endless abyss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlissfully oblivious to the torment she was inflicting, Kali just smiled happily at the feeling of the clay sinking deeper between her cheeks. It felt good, better than good really, and she allowed herself to give a bit of extra emphasis to the sway of her hips as she exited the spa area, increasing the rate at which her ass chewed up its tiny passenger. Her bikini bottoms were slowly being sucked into the abyss as well, but she left them alone, the presence of the fabric only increased her mounting pleasure. The swaying of her booty, and her gradually disappearing clothing, drew more than a few lingering looks as she re-joined the crowds in the pool area proper, but secretly the cat Faunus was enjoying the attention. Though she knew she should feel annoyed by the obvious gazes, it amused her to think that no-one even seemed to notice her ears when they had a nice rear to look at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question remained though, what would she do with the rest of her day? It was tempting to head to Beacon now to find her daughter, but at this time of day the younger Belladonna may well be out, so Kali felt it would probably be better to hold off on the reunion until the next day. More relaxation sounded good for the time being, but would it be better to relax more here, perhaps with a trip to the sauna, or should she head back to her hotel for now and just take it easy for a few hours?</span></div></div>",

Sun yelped, quickly dashing down the corridor, skidding around the corner and smacking his back into the wall, just as the teachers eyes glanced up to check the hallway. \"She figured out where I was going already?\" Sun panted, glancing around the corner, \"Man- she got here fast- guess the pools out of the question for now-\" Sun grumbled, giving a little perverted smile as he carefully moved towards the spa- thinking about oggling some girls while he waited for Glynda to move on. In his perverted state, he haphazardly dashed towards the steamy door on the other side of the corridor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss rounded the corner, her bare feet slapping on the ground after storing away her sandles. The ice queen rubbed her neck with a sigh, deciding that she would rather get pampered then goof around. Her pale foot painfully stepped down on a surprised Sun, instantly splatting him to the slightly reddened ball of her foot before taking him along for the ride. Every step she took was a fight for Sun as part of him would try to stick to the ground, while the other part wanted to stay on the damp foot. Much to Sun's dismay, the foot seemed to be winning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA polite staff member bowed to the heiress, pointing out the robs and slippers,<br>\r\n\"Have a nice day-\" She finished, causing a relaxed smile from the worked up dust wielder. Her toes subcounciously wiggled, tugging her prisoners head closer into their em-braise without noticing the tiny vibration of Sun's yelling as she slipped on the robe, taking off her swim wear as she noticed a sign suggesting it for the massages. That and it was a girls only area she was going into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBattered and mashed, Sun barely managed to pull his head away before noticing the slipper he was about to head into. With a strong second wind, he quickly pushed and pulled himself away from the foot, not wanting to be flattened all day under it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However he was able to stop himself, hitting the top of the bag right next to the zipper. Hitting it he wasn't pulled out with the swimsuit but instead stay inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the swimsuit finally gave room, Sun found himself dropping back down onto the ground. He shakes his head around and looks up at the unzipped heaven above him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nhe's not seeing anything down here, Sun needs to get up. Thankfully that isn't so hard for him. Being the acrobatic boy he was, he can easily reach it. Taking a couple of steps backwards as Sun gets a running start. With a running start he was able to get the height, just to reach the zipper and hold on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his muscles that Sun was proud to show off, he pulled himself up. Lifting up and looking out into the changing room. His head poking out and looking at the fours girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Man! I missed out\u201d He said as he looked at the four giant girls changed. Each of them wearing their swimsuits as it made him beyond sad. While Ruby and Weiss were wearing a single swimsuit which covered their bodies, Blake and Yang both had Two Pieces on which showed off their toned stomachs. Of course each of the girls has their swimsuits in their own colour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts not that Sun doesn't like the sight of the four girls in Bikinis. Its just he knew what happened moments of before and the sight he could of captured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake in her two piece walked towards Sun. He quickly moved out of the bag, seeing that she was carrying her clothes. He doesn't want to be pushed under them so with the speed he was proud of. He got up and moved behind the bag. Sliding down as he hid. Blake put all her extra clothes into the bag as Sun peeped out. Looking at the gigantic Faunus that he's grown to love. And thats not lying, he does love her. Something about her Loner/Fierce personality really made him like her, not to mention she looks beautiful to him. And she's a Faunus, which is of course a plus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her so big, he was amazed at how big her body was. Her stomach looking like a platform all on its self. Her legs being more juicy then any of the other girls he's ever met. And her breast, just hanging there almost begging for the Monkey Faunus to play with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd when she turned around, he could see her massive rear, shaking back and forth as she joins her friends. Sun with a stupid smile on his face was enjoying the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was the only girl he was honestly wanted to peep on. Ruby\u2019s body was to young and not developed enough for most boys to like. Weiss had an alright body, but her personality kind of ruins all that for Sun. Blake is distant, Weiss is just rude. And Yang....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay maybe Yang is another girl he wanted to peep on. Looking at her he's pretty sure any guy would. He has an ass and a pair that even adults would be jealous of. And her being in a Bikini, he couldn't help but takes eyes off of Blake and switch them over to the blonde. Every movement that she took shook her body around as she walked. Which was really good cause Sun had his eyes focused on her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay were heading out, come on Weiss. Lets get to the slides before theres a line\u201d Ruby said hoping with excitement\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRuby, there is a line. They're is always a line\u201d Weiss said rolling her eyes, feeling Ruby grab her hand and lead her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEvery line has a start, so lets go!!!\u201d She said dragging Weiss out, the heiress being less the excited knowing this is how its gonna be the entire day. This was suppose to be her day for a break, a day for rest. A day without Ruby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee you two later, have fun with her Weiss\u201d Yang said waving as the two left the room. Now it was just Blake and Yang... and little Sun<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou seem happy Yang\u201d Blake said raising her eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I'm happy, normally i have to look after Ruby when we go on trips. Now its time for Weiss to suffer\u201d Yang said as they both laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey're was a moment of silence, until Blake sighed. Speaking up she said \u201c_________\u201d</span></div></div>",

Walking down the hall she checked dorm after dorm, checking for anything not allowed in the school such as alcohol, illegal types of dust, or even pets. The last one in question Goodwitch was curious about, hearing barking and finding dog hairs across campus, although in her mind she thought the barking could possibly be Faunus activity but the hair was completely another thing, so she made sure to check the third story, where teams such as JNPR and RWBY were staying, which was where the barking would come from every now and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon arriving at the young teens' door, she could feel like something was off, thinking it as nothing other than becoming ill she continued on and walked inside the dorm room. she began checking the room up and down, under the beds, in the bathroom, no signs of a dog that couldn\u2019t be explained as untidy students, but that same unnerving feeling from earlier grew, and she ended up having to grasp herself as she collapsed onto the bathroom floor in pain, the feeling was horrible and all she could do was wince and breath as she slowly faded out of consciousness, with her eyes closed the entire time she never noticed the room getting much larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon waking up Glynda checked her surroundings, doing several double takes of the now giant bathroom, unable to come to senses as to what had happened to her, but once it clicked she started to have a major panic attack, curing up into a ball, arms shaking and hyperventilating, until something even scarier happened. miniature earthquakes seemed to get closer, and closer, louder and louder, until the bathroom door swung open, revealing a huntress\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlynda's eyes exploded with the sight of the gargantuan girl, shocked so much so she couldn't move a muscle, and just simply watched, step after step, the huntress loom closer... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nbut which of the dorms had Glynda entered?</span></div></div>",

The tiny huntress used her semblance, plus a small piece of fluff beneath her, to rise up and get to the student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching the counter, Glynda proceeded to shout out to Pyrrha, trying desperately to get her attention, although doubting herself to be able to, with her new found size.

At last she could be rescued and taken to someone who'd be able to help her properly. Too bad that was just wishful thinking on her part. The words that fell from one of her favorite students proved as much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told Nora that if she kept her space a mess insect would invade the dorm. No matter, I know just how to deal with pests.\" The redhead reached over to the far side of the counter and grabbed a nearby weapon catalogue. Glynda felt both fear and disbelief run through her as Pyrrha rolled it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She thought she was a bug!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now please stay still.\" Pyrrha said as she hovered her improvised weapon over the wide-eyed professor. Immediately Glynda's instincts took over and she used her semblance to evade the incoming catalogue. Frustrated by missing her target, Pyrrha took another shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain and again Glynda dodged for her life as Pyrrha became more and more determined to end it. Up above, the much larger girl was amazed at the difficultly she was having trying to pin down this annoying insect. She was no stranger to small targets but this was ridiculous. But at the same time... Somewhat exciting?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made no sense to the huntress in training. She only ever became excited like this when facing down another person. She would be the first to admit she was a bit of a fightaholic, but a fight if she could even call it that against a bug was strange. Still, her battle lust demanded she take this bug out. With a grin reserved for only her opponents in the ring, Pyrrha redoubled her efforts to defeat her tiny foe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlynda was really scared now, she knew that grin. That grin spelled doom for every student that ever faced her in the ring. If she were normal sized she could easily defeat her student, but as it stands victory was simply just surviving. But that would prove to be a monumental task as Glynda felt exhaustion starting to set in. She was overworking her semblance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha seemed to notice her swift foe loosing steam as they weren't moving as fast as before. Perfect. She had won the battle of attrition. Pyrrha tightened her grip on her weapon and swing down with a loud smack. She must've struck her target this time as she no longer saw the insect on the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe eyed her weapon closely and didn't spy her target's remains. It must be trying to retreat. Pyrrha scanned the entire bathroom from top to bottom and couldn't find heads or tails of her prey. her quarry had escaped. The warrior within was not pleased. How dare that pest escape! No! How dare she fail to eliminate the enemy! With a loud sigh the huntress in training calmed her nerves. It wouldn't do to get upset. Besides, she had classes to get ready for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough if she ever found that insect again, she'd settle thing... Permanently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Only someone else had been there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting talked down by her daughter, Raven had felt quite bad about the things that she had done, She wanted to make it up to her daughter but she still was Against helping Ozpin in his battle against Salem, seeing it as fighting an unwinnable battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead she decided to shrink down someone to yang and her team as a potential way to get revenge on her for the things that she had done to them. Remembering that she had a special type off dust in her bandit camp that could shrink things leaving them permanently shrunken. Raven had turned into her Raven form to get it and go back to haven where she left Cinder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing about this dust is that could only be used by being activated by a maiden,unfortunately by the time Raven found that out she had gotten rid of most of the dust that she had kept before her tribe had captured the previous spring maiden , mostly due to it taking up room, However Raven still kept one vial of it on here encase she needed to get out of live threatening situation, She instead decided to use it to shrink Cinder deciding that not only would it stop Cinder from to take revenge on her tribe for betraying her, But she was going to give the shrunken maiden to yang and her team so that they would be able to get some much needed revenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter having pulled Cinders frozen body out of the pool she had fallen into, she shattered the ice causing Cinders body to fall still unconscious from her battle with Raven, She then sprinkled the dust over Cinders unconscious body before using her maiden powers to activate the dust as it shrunk cinder down leaving her at mearly 3 inches tall it also made Cinders maiden powers severely weakened making them completely harmless, on the contrary it increased Cinders durability to insane levels making Cinders body able to be squashed and stretched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven then picked up Cinders small body before leaving, She then got a cardboard box to put her, wrapping it up before leaving it at the doorstep off the room Team RWBY and the others were sleeping at, she knocked the door before transforming into to her Raven form flying away back to her camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello anyone there?\" Ruby said, she then looked down seeing a box that said for team RWBY. Runs picked up the box taking it to the room her and the rest of the members off team RWBY were sleeping in. She left the box there asking Weiss Blake and Yang to come to there room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuuuggnnnhh what happened...\" Cinder said in an annoyed tone. Suddenly Cinder remembered everything, The attack the lead on haven, Her going down to the relic chamber with vernal and... Raven, She the fought and was beaten by her. Cinder was enraged after being made a fool by Raven vowing to get revenge on her.......But first she needed to find out we're the hell she currently was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was dark in this place,and the walls felt like cardboard, only to feel the room start to rumble as it was shook up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting the rest off team RWBY together Ruby showed her teammates the box.<br>\r\n\"What do you thinks in it\" Yang asked Ruby, \"And were did you get it from\" asked Weiss. \"I can't answer your question sis as I haven't opened it yet, but for Weiss's question I can simply answer that with I found it in front of the door after hearing a knock, I looked outside and just saw this box that said for team RWBY\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There a note on the side\" Blake mentioned. I'll read it said yang, it says that the thing in head is some type of toy for relieving stress, being quite squishy and durable. \"Well let's open it up then\" Ruby said in excitement. After opening the box up the group was surprised to see cinder fall having been shrunken down to a few inches tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinder meanwhile was trying to get her vision back after the sudden flash of light blinded her, after being able to see again she was shocked to see herself surrounded by The 4 members off team RWBY all towering over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby was the first to grab the little cinder and angry look in her face. Cinder fryer to blast a fireball at Ruby to make her let her go but to her shock her maiden powers weren't working.Upon see this a smile formed on the 4 girls faces, not only realized was Cinder shrunken and powerless, but if the the note was to say anything she was also very squishy. Ruby dropped Cinder onto the table before slamming her hand down on Cinder squashing her flat,\"THATS WHAT YOU GET FOR THE HORRIBLE THINGS YOU'VE DONE YOU MONSTER \"Ruby said angrily. Yang followed suit slamming her mechanical arm down on Cinder, this went on until each girl of team RWBY had gotten their chance to squash Cinder a couple of times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey weren't done with Cinder yet, they then dropped Cinders squashed form on the floor before stomping on it with their bare feet, after a few minutes of doing this they then picked up cinder before Ruby suggested an idea,\"Everyone grab a side and pull\" Ruby said. As each member of team RWBY grabbed a side of cinders body they pulled in different directions stretching cinders body out quite far, \"Yeah you feel this Cinder this is called team work!\" Ruby said confidently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually they let go as cinders body snapped back to the middle before falling to the floor, leaving a broken mess of a blob that cinder had reduced to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hi-Fiving eachother team RWBY talked about what to do next to Cinder to themselves so that they can have fun getting revenge on her, or do they show Cinder to the other to give them a chance to give Cinder some payback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll four finally agreed on...</span></div></div>",

They also felt that it would be safest if they kept Cinder for themselves, deciding that it would be quite hard to keep track off Cinder with everyone getting there revenge on her and would possibly lead to Cinder escaping when they weren't looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Cinder it looks like your only going to have to worry about me and my team torturing you, don't think that means we'll go easy on you though, we will make sure that you are going to suffer horribly for all the things you've done\" Ruby said as she looked down at the gooey mush that Cinder had been reduced to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Ruby wasn't much of a girl for excessively cruel, she felt that Cinder deserved nothing less, after all the horrible things that she did to her and her friends she deserved to be put through hell to spend the rest of her life as a bug who they could squash without mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what should we do next to our new bug\" Weiss asked, wanting to go back to torturing Cinder, especially after what Cinder did to her at the battle at Haven.\"Yeah Sis I'm ready to continue beating this pathetic bug into submission\" Yang said as she cracked her knuckles to prepare for what they would do to Cinder next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well alright girls, I think we should get our bug used to her new role\" Ruby said as she picked Cinder up laying her on a table while signaling her teammates to follow her as she sat down on a couch with her team,putting her bare feet on the table in front of the blobby mass as her teammates did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright bug, you better listen to our demands or else we'll make your hell much much worse for you\" Ruby said as Cinders body reformed, this caused the small maiden to try and run away only to be met with Ruby's sole plummeting down on her as Ruby brought her feet together and rubbed the squashed Cinder flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah ah ah, no running away buggy, this is what you get for trying to escape your goddesses\" Ruby said in a exhilarated tone as her red nails scrapped against Cinder form harshly, this got the rest of the team RWBY quite excited for what their leader had planned, especially with her referring to them as goddesses when talking to there new bug toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now lick you pathetic bug!\" Ruby demanded as the flattened Cinder desperately tried to reform only to be squashed by Ruby again and again until she obeyed, frantically licking the girls feet in desperation to try and stop this torture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of playing with her foot bug, Ruby was satisfied and decided to pass Cinder to Yang, who had a giddy expression on her face.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cinder had no idea how this had happened. One moment she was confidently striding across the courtyard on her way to do some more snooping, and the next she was standing on the flagstones at no more than 3 inches tall, with the rest of the world now towering above her. There had been next to no warning, just a sudden headache and a feeling of falling as the ground rushed up to meet her. In an instant the semi-Maiden had been reduced from one of the most powerful and threatening people on the planet to a tiny creature barely even worth taking notice of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a rule Cinder did not experience fear. She didn\u2019t allow herself to. But right now, as the ground beneath her feet began to vibrate with the approach of heavy footfalls, she began to think that maybe there was a time for fear after all. When she\u2019d entered the courtyard there had been no one else around, but now the temporary lull in activity had passed and students were starting to enter the area once again, their thunderous footsteps echoing in the tiny criminal\u2019s ears. Eyes darting, the fire-wielder scanned each approaching face and foot, seeking out the quickest path to relative safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flash of black at the corner of the mastermind\u2019s eye caught her attention, and she adjusted her view to see the disguised Neo approaching in the distance, bedecked in the Gothic Lolita-like outfit she\u2019d chosen for combat, complete with heavy black boots. Though far away at first, the steady stride of the short girl was bringing her forward at what seemed a dizzying pace to Cinder and the shrunken girl quickly began to wave her arms back and forth and yell up towards her ally, moving to intercept the illusionist\u2019s path in the hope of being rescued from this potential death trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end it proved a poor decision. As the disguised girl moved closer it became increasingly apparent that her eyes were not focused on the ground, but rather looking vacantly ahead as she wandered aimlessly. Realising her folly, Cinder attempted to correct her course, but acted far too late to avoid the sole of the boot that rose above her and crashed down with seemingly lethal force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinder had fully expected to die when the massive boot had fallen, but the reality was somehow even worse. Her body was instantly squished into putty by Neo\u2019s footfall, crushed into the treads of the boot like a piece of discarded gum, and stretched painfully over the sole. While most of her body had been mangled and contorted into an unrecognisable mass, her head, crammed deep between the treads, retained enough of its form to allow one eye to stare fearfully down at the ground as the foot lifted, carrying her helpless body along with it as it sailed through the air and came crashing down once again, plunging the tiny criminal back into a world of darkness and pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Neo, she was just taking her usual stroll across the courtyard while pondering what to do with her day. She hadn\u2019t been assigned any information gathering duties, so she was just wandering around for now, not paying much attention to anything, least of all to any stray creatures foolish enough to cross her path. As such, she hadn\u2019t taken any notice of her tiny leader as the girl vanished beneath her boot, nor was she at all concerned with the fact that she was now bringing said leader along with her, mercilessly driving Cinder into the ground over and over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had rained earlier that day but now the sun was starting to bear down, and Neo dutifully corrected her course to head back inside where she wouldn\u2019t be at risk of melting. This took her across one of the academy\u2019s lawns, still heavy with dew and spotted with puddles of mud, but it was of no difference to her. The soles of the illusionist\u2019s boots were thick so even as she stepped down into the muddy grass she didn\u2019t have any concern that it would reach her feet. Indeed, today she had a bit of extra protection under her right boot to help absorb all that dirt in her place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few short minutes for Neo, and an agonising eternity for her little prisoner, she finally stepped off the grass and back into the dorm building, not bothering to wipe off her boots as she made her way back to her own dorm and sat casually on the edge of the bed. Pulling off her boots, and doing her best to ignore the foul stench that was released as she did so, the disguised girl flipped them over briefly to examine the soles. She couldn\u2019t help but make a face at the sheer quantity of mud and torn pieces of grass stuck to the sole, pretty much completely obscuring the original sole and filling up the treads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering whether she should put the boots outside or just wipe them off and stick them under the bed, Neo\u2019s eyes fell briefly on an oddly familiar piece of twisted mud-encrusted gunk near the toe of the right sole, momentarily entertaining the thought of a closer inspection.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Neo was a curious person by nature, and though that curiosity usually followed a more sadistic path she was capable of taking interest in the small things as well. That piece of gunk, whatever it was, had gotten her attention and she quickly ripped it from her sole with minimal effort, noting that whatever it was it was now covered in a healthy layer of mud and wet grass clippings\u2026 and it was twitching. Before the surprised illusionist\u2019s very eyes the previously unrecognisable piece of gunk began to stretch and contort into a more familiar shape, the distinct outline of a human body starting to form as some of the larger chunks of mud flaked off and feel to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter nearly two full minutes of reforming a nearly fully formed body hung from Neo\u2019s fingertips, the only part still missing being the head, which would appear to correlate to the bit of putty that the disguised girl still had crushed between her fingertips. Still curious, she dropped the now clearly feminine body into her other hand, watching as the head slowly took shape and the figure struggled to rise to its feet. It took a moment longer for her to realise just who it was she was looking at, bits of a torn Haven uniform and pale skin becoming visible through the muck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisoriented and in pain, Cinder slowly raised her vision to the looming face of her teammate high above, swallowing her fear as she wiped away as much of the mud from her face as she could manage. Her entire body still ached from her experiences under Neo\u2019s boot, but she did her best to force a stern expression on her face, annoyed at the other girl\u2019s lack of immediate action. \u201cWell? Don\u2019t just look at me you fool! Get help!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeo of course didn\u2019t respond verbally, not that Cinder had expected her to, but the tiny girl was annoyed to note that her expression didn\u2019t change either. She was about to raise her voice again when she suddenly found herself in motion, falling to her ass as her temporary transport turned around and headed into their adjoined bathroom, barely even bothering to keep her hand flat before unceremoniously dumping Cinder in the basin from a not inconsiderable height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny criminal didn\u2019t even have a chance to respond to the rough treatment before she was nearly drowned in a torrent of water, knocked flat on her back by the sheer force of the downpour before being picked up in uncaring hands and scrubbed vigorously in an attempt to remove the remaining dirt obscuring her form. Cinder wanted to scream up at Neo to stop, to let her know that she was hurting her, but she was at least glad to feel her body return to a relatively clean, if partially squished, state. When the water finally stopped, she glanced up to see her teammate again, hoping that now that she was clean she\u2019d get some real help, but as her eyes settled on the illusionist\u2019s face the menacing smirk she was met with filled her with nothing but dread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDumped just beside the basin, the shrunken mastermind did her best to scramble back to her feet and turn a demanding gaze on Neo as the other girl wiped her hands. \u201cListen to me girl! I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re thinking, but if you know what\u2019s good for y\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinder had intended to chew Neo out, to remind her that even in this state she still held power over her. To remind her of the deal that Roman had struck on behalf of the both of them. But her words were silenced with a crushing finality as her former subordinate\u2019s hand came down on her with astonishing force, instantly reducing her to a two dimensional smear before the fingers curled back around her and yanked the tiny girl up to hang before the same menacing smirk as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Neo\u2019s perspective she had never particularly disliked Cinder or anything. The older girl\u2019s plans after all had given her plenty of opportunities to exercise her sadism. But this was an opportunity she just couldn\u2019t pass up. She now held in her hands what was essentially a bit of sentient putty, seemingly able to feel pain but unable to be squashed, and completely and utterly subject to her non-existent mercy. It didn\u2019t matter who it was. It could have been anyone as far as she was concerned. What mattered was that as she stretched out her former employer she could see the girl\u2019s face contorting in pain and witness the brief look of horror that came over those eyes as she smashed her hands back together, rubbing them vigorously just so she could feel the defenceless girl\u2019s squishy body oozing between her fingers. It was like a dream come true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only question now was, what should she do with Cinder next. Playing with her like this was a lot of fun, and she was enjoying seeing just how much she could stretch her former boss before her body\u2019s resistance would become too much, but even as she continued to stretch and squish and mash and crush the other girl she knew that she wanted to do something more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping back into the room proper, Neo\u2019s spared a glance down to her own feet, noting how soaked through with sweat her socks had become after being stuck inside her boots for so long, and entertained the thought of introducing Cinder to her undoubtedly rank feet. Then again, she had just gone to the trouble of cleaning the girl so maybe now would be a better opportunity to try something she couldn\u2019t do when her new toy was dirty, like see how she tasted. Another alternative would be to go find Emerald and see if she could convince her to help torture the fire-wielder. That would be fun, though she\u2019d probably have to disguise Cinder first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter careful consideration, during which time she continued to casually play with the putty in her hands, Neo eventually decided to\u2026</span></div></div>",

Noting that her soles were dripping with perspiration, the disguised girl took a moment to stretch out her sweaty toes and properly appreciate just how rank her feet had really become before reaching back down for her new toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she\u2019d had any choice in the matter Cinder would have run, but she was still far too squished from her experiences with the giant girl\u2019s hands to move as she was snatched up once again and brought around to face the feet of her capture. Even before contact was made she could tell this was going to be a terrible experience, the dripping sweat filling her vision as she was plunged towards the sole of Neo\u2019s right foot. Actual contact, however, exceeded even her worse fears as she was instantly bathed in sweat and surrounded with an indescribably rank odor. It only got worse as the other girl started to rub her against the foot, one finger placed on the back of her head to ensure that her face was smeared directly into the largest pools of sweat. Cinder couldn\u2019t even close her mouth as she was forced to swallow mouthfuls of the foul liquid, the salty liquid pouring down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove, Neo was having the time of her life as she continued to torture her defenceless prisoner. While she enjoyed watching the rest of the tiny girl\u2019s body sponging up her sweat, she took particular pleasure in making sure to drive the mastermind\u2019s head into every sweaty fold, using it to clean the ball of her foot before moving to the crevice of her toes. Smirking, the illusionist then forced the partially flattened head between her toes one by one, smearing Cinder\u2019s face into the accumulated sweat, grime and toejam that had accumulated between the digits, unaware and uncaring that she was forcing her former boss to swallow some of the foul detritus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point Cinder wasn\u2019t sure if she could take anymore, nor could she wrap her head around how things had ended up like this. She was soaked with sweat and covered in grime, feeling like the sickening mixture was literally beneath her skin at this point. To make matters worse her stomach and throat were coated in a mix of substances she\u2019d rather not think about, and all she could taste and smell was her teammate\u2019s feet. She couldn\u2019t even fight back or complain, since Neo\u2019s harsh treatment ensured she was constantly caught between being squished and reforming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took several long minutes of constant torment for the illusionist to satisfy herself that her right foot was clean, and several more for her to repeat the process on her left. But by the time she had finished with both soles her rising excitement over the process had caused her entire body to heat up and her feet to perspire further, presenting Cinder with a never-ending cycle of torment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, however, Neo grew tired of being the one doing all the work and dumped her new toy on the bed, waiting for the shrunken criminal to reform enough to shoot a withering glare at her before motioning to her feet and wiggling her toes in a silent demand to be massaged. Cinder responded with a string of curses and some unflattering commentary on the nature of the other girl\u2019s parentage, because there was no way she was ever going to willingly approach those monstrosities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr at least that was what she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeo didn\u2019t even blink an eye at the abuse that was being hurled at her, simply unfolding her legs and, with a movement too fast for Cinder to even follow, let alone avoid, brought her feet together around the tiny girl, enjoying the audible wet squish as the sweaty soles flattened her team leader into a perfect foot rag. Not wasting any time on such pointless concepts as mercy, the illusionist violently rubbed her feet back and forth, making sure to squeeze as much sweat as possible into the abused girl as she twisted and mashed her between the shifting soles. All to deliver a clear message. That she was to be obeyed without question or even worse punishments would follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several more minutes of torture Neo finally relented, separating her feet and leaning down to peel the totally flat Cinder from her sole before dumping her on the bed again. Returning her feet to their previous position she waited for the shrunken student to reform enough to watch as she pointed to her feet again, this time sticking out her tongue to indicate that she wanted her toy to lick the soles and narrowing her eyes to remind her captive of the consequences of non-compliance.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At this point Cinder wanted nothing more than to tell Neo exactly what she could do with herself in excruciating detail, and to remind her exactly what happened to people who defied her. But as much as her arrogance screamed at her to give voice to those thoughts, the rational part of her knew that it would be the wrong decision. There was nothing she could do against this kind of overwhelming force. Far better to do as she was told for now and wait for an opportunity to escape or alert someone else to her predicament, regardless of what horrors she may have to endure in the interim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing her pride, and not giving the illusionist the satisfaction of looking her in the eye, Cinder reluctantly approached the nearest sole. Legs still only partially reformed, she stumbled slightly as she looked up at the rank and sweaty foot, hesitating as she distantly wondered how it had gotten this bad again when she\u2019d just \u2018cleaned\u2019 it a few minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis shouldn\u2019t have been so difficult for her. Just a few moments ago she\u2019d been forced face first against this very sole. She\u2019d swallowed sweat and toejam and faced utter humiliation as she was grinded into the folds. And yet there was something distinctly different about willingly licking it. It would mean admitting defeat and accepting her position as nothing more than a foot slave for Neo, even if only temporarily. It would mean accepting that she was little more than a bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, she had no choice. So, reluctantly, she extended her tongue and began to lick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though she\u2019d tasted this already, the feeling of the thick sweat sliding down Cinder\u2019s throat remained overwhelming, her body instantly screaming at her not to swallow, and to regurgitate what she had already consumed. It tasted like eating someone\u2019s dirty gym socks and smelled like something had crawled into her nose and died. And that wasn\u2019t even mentioning the grit and grime that continued to slide down her sadistic captor\u2019s feet together with the sweat, inexorably finding its way into the tiny criminal\u2019s mouth as she reluctantly continued to lick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove, Neo watched with glee as the tiny Cinder tended to her sole. For the most part she just liked watching the prideful girl utterly humiliate herself, though she had to admit that a part of her was also enjoying the sensation of the tiny tongue running over her foot. She lowered the toes of her other foot down to the fire-wielder\u2019s level and wiggled them slightly, inciting her new toy to start licking between the toes as well, and nearly making her shudder with the pleasant sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShifting the digits, Neo pulled the shrunken student\u2019s head in deeper and then clenched down, watching gleefully as the rest of Cinder\u2019s body shook in pain as her head was instantly squashed into mush between her toes. She spent a few more moments playing like this before peeling the girl off once again and allowing her to return to her endless licking duties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only question now was what to do next? Inevitably her other teammates would eventually return, and Emerald and Mercury would most likely not be on board with the outright torture of their leader. Cinder had manipulated both of them for sure but they had various reasons to remain loyal, and were not particularly close to Neo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could simply hide Cinder from the others, preferably somewhere on her own body. It would be fun to have the little mastermind trapped in her boots all day long, or maybe stuck to her body somewhere else, somewhere suitably humiliating and fun for her. But she could also use her semblance to disguise Cinder as someone else and convince Emerald to help her torture the girl instead. Or maybe she could go one step further and not only disguise her toy as someone else but also disguise herself as Cinder and take over the other girl\u2019s plans as her own.</span></div></div>",

Neo hand had been like a hydraulic press coming down on the splattered Cinder, As Cinder silently cursed about what she was going to do to Neo once she got out of this and back to normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Neo had got a signal sent to Emerald as she met up with her outside of their dorm having sent her a message to her scroll.\"So what is it\"Emerald said in an annoyed tone questioning what Neo had dragged her here for, being quite vague about why she needed her here, her scroll message literally being \"Come to the hallway outside our dorm I need some help with something\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing these words, Neo used her hand with wasn't squeezing Cinder to open the door to the dorm they had been staying in, then shaking her closed hand that she held Cinder in to signal Emerald that she had something she wanted to show her. Emerald entered the dorm still not sure why Neo had sent her here as Neo followed Emerald into the dorm. After closing the door Neo opened her hand to show the squashed being that had laid in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing free from Neo hands was a blessing, as Cinder started to reform seeing Emerald looking down at her in a strange way.\"Oh Emerald it's you, if you would please get me out of Neo's hand and tell the others about this betrayal\" Cinder told Emerald. Neo however had prepared for this and upon changing Cinder she also controlled what Cinder had said to Emerald, making sure to make the words coming out her mouth sound extra pathetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Emerald perspective she had seen a tiny Ruby talking to her.\"Oh thank goodness it's you Emerald,Please help me I've somehow been shrunken and have been captured by this person I don't even know, please take me away from her\" was the words that Emerald heard from the shrunken Cinder disguised as Ruby.

Neo nodded,\"And you called me to help you torture her\" Emerald asked, assuming from Neo sadistic behavior, Neo nodded again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing this shocked Cinder as she realized that Neo had disguised her to look like Ruby just so she could get Emerald to help torture her,\"YOU BITTT--...!\" Was all Cinder could get before Neo squashed her again stretching her body out to show Emerald that the shrunken 'Ruby' was also squishy and stretchy to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter playing with Cinder for a bit Neo then gave the disguised girl to Emerald to let her have a chance to play with the human putty.\"Hah this feels great Neo it's nice get some revenge on this girl who has given us so much trouble during our plans\" Emerald said enjoying squeezing and stretching the tiny 'Ruby' between her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinder had been through much pain as Emerald had forcefully slammed her hand together on her body, Cinder tried her best to retaliate to her oblivious underling but wasn't able to do so because of the relentless squashing Emerald had unleashed on her body making her more and more smushed by the second, As Emerald  tortured her shrunken leader.Neo watched from a distance finding much amusement out of the torment being caused to her former leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of Emerald demolishing the tiny Cinder, she had laid the squashed girl on her bed, as Neo signaled her to come over to show her ideas she had typed on her scroll of other ways they could torture the tiny girl.Upon showing Emerald the choices on her scroll the two had agreed that they would...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>      It was a shining day at Beacon Academy, the Vital Festival Tournament was drawing closer everyday. The students all were prepping for the tournament and enjoying peacefully life at Beacon. But, hidden inside Beacon, Cinder Falls was at work on her master plan to bring down Beacon. She was working with her semblance to create a new power to help enact her evil plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"With a few more changes, my new power will tear this place to the ground.\" Cinder plotted and finished her new power. When she began to test it, a strange feeling overwhelmed her body and she blacked out. When she woke up later, something felt different, the room seemed to have grown in size. \"Great, a spell that made everything else larger, just what I need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Cinder began to figure out how she was going to reverse her spell when the ground began to shake. It got more fierce as Cinder watched the doorhandle turn. Staring in awe, Cinder watched her loyal servant Emerald walk into the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Emerald walked into her dorm looking for Cinder, who wanted to meet and discuss the plan for the tournament. But when she arrived, Cinder wasn't anywhere. \"That's odd, Cinder isn't usually late. Maybe I'm in the wrong place?\" She walked towards the bed and heard a light squish under her foot as she crossed the room. \"Huh?\" Emerald puzzled. She lifted up her boot to see what she stepped in, and was shocked to see Cinder flattened to her foot. \"Oh my god! Cinder?! What happens?! Oh god, I killed her. I killed Cinder, I am in so much trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Cinder realized that her power had shrunk her, and somehow being shrunk had made her body malleable. After being stepped on by Emerald, she knew she had to reclaim her power before she ended up a smear under her boot. Prying herself off, Cinder fell onto the bed and regained her shape. For the first time she saw how small she was compared to Emerald. She had been small enough to be stuck completely under her foot, which left her at about 2 inches. She calmed her anger and began to try and gain control over Emerald.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Sweet child, I'm fine. You just need to be more aware of your surroundings so I don't end up stuck to you for the day. Now, about the plan for...\" Cinder started before her head was flattened between two of Emeralds fingers. \"Wait...you used your powers to make yourself small and squishy? I don't know why you would ever do that, but if you can't be hurt, then it won't matter what I do to you.\" Emerald shook Cinder by her flattened head and watched her body struggle back and forth as she tried to break free. She let go and watched Cinders head pop back into shape. \"You still will listen to me child, just because of a miscalculation, doesn't mean you can steal control from me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"I beg to differ, you've been harsh and in control of me for so long. Now it's my turn to have the power and get back at you.\" Emerald quickly flattened Cinder between her hands, watching her paper body float down to the bed. She then stood up and pulled her pants and underwear down, showing her butt to cinders paper form. \"I'll show you how powerful I can be without even having to try.\" Emerald said as she jumped and landed straight ontop of Cinder. Steamrolling her back and forth to make sure she stuck. She quickly hopped up and walked over to the mirror in the room, turning around to see her leader now stuck firmly to her ass. \"Hope you enjoy yourself down there, maybe now you'll respect me alittle more.\" She said with a slap, causing her flesh and Cinder to jiggle in a wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Emerald pulled her pants back up, putting more pressure on her tight butt and crushing Cinder Into it more. Emerald walked out of the room and continued to enjoy her day, now even more exciting because of her passenger. Cinder shook side to side as Emerald walked down the hall, jiggling from each step. Emerald had plans for her boss, and decided to..... . </span></div></div>",

The team simply shrugged with vague answers and suggestions before finally scrapping the tiny girl into the cats lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinder cringed as she splatted down onto the soft lap, recalling her tormenting time on the floor as the giants around her gave some tips. Her face turned pale as the black haired beauty shrugged them all off- before picking up the tiny girl from her lap.<br>\r\n\"I think I'm just going to read a book-\" Blake sighed, looking at Ruby's pouting face, \"With her under foot...?\" Blake questioned, getting a gleaming smile and a thumbs up in return. The cat girl sighed, quickly leaning across and grabbing her favorite book, knocking Cinder to the floor in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinder yelled profanities as she slapped into the floor, her body quickly rolling onto her back to stare down her enemies defiantly only to see Blakes giant foot slamming down towards her. She gave a tiny scream before the plump foot slammed down ontop of her. The powerful squishy toes quickly wiggled and wormed her head into their tight embrace, using her hair to mop up the extreme amount of sweat she had built up. Her tiny voice was met with deaf ears as the expert reader quickly got lost in her own world, grinding her feet down excitedly as she continued her hobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinder felt like she was melting away, she had been trapped underfoot for just under two hours but it felt like years, the damp mass casually moved back and forth over her, steam rolling the evil girl into the 'disgusting skin', Blakes wandering toes often forced open her pets jaw to wipe her foot clean on the stained tongue. Cinder gagged down whatever was crammed down and even attempted licking to appease the cruel cat girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake honestly didn't think she was being cruel, she barely even registered the girl below her as she got into the story of her book. After two hours of reading she was finally taken out of her dream like state by the growling of her stomach. Quietly she put away her book and stood up, after a few steps her brain suddenly kicked into action, remembering her foot toy by the vibrations from the girls constant swearing, The cat girl shrugged before walking over, grabbing some food, then worming back to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she made it back, Cinder was practically glued onto the object she most despised, her body was completely plastered to the heavy girls foot, her mouth forced open from the pressure as she was pumped into the floor. She was glad when she felt Blake finally attempt to peel her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake put the flattened 'toy' onto her bed as she rubbed her foot, noticing less sweat then her other foot.<br>\r\n\"Wow- did you actually lick my foot?\" She chided, glancing over to Cinder with raised eyebrows. Cinder struggled to reform and talk, but her body was still too weak. \"That.. kinda feels nice- alright, I won't step on you again, but you've got to finish the job\" Blake blushed, scooting over before planting her bear feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to end up underfoot again, Cinder weakly crawled forward, her body shuddered as she slowly licked the girls heel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls lost track of time, Blake switched feet on the tiny girl, forcing her to lick her foot from scratch while she read, a slight yawn escaped her mouth as she felt her tiny pet stop licking. With a hidden happy mew she wiggled her toes, feeling a bit more comfortable with the sweat gone, replaced instead by the thin layer of saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This has been... surprisingly enjoyable\" Blake spoke to no one in particular as she plucked the tired girl from the foot of her bed. Feeling tired, Blake casually gazed around for something to hold the prisoner in before remembering when the girl was stuck to her foot. Thinking about the cold saliva, she quickly grabbed tiny Cinder, using her to wipe her foot down before placing her on the ground. Cinder looked up weakly, ready to spew out another insult before the slightly cleaner then before foot slammed down upon her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake stiffled a yawn-<br>\r\n\"Sorry- I was told to keep you underfoot at all times, and I don't like wearing socks to bed-\" The large girl apologised insincerely as she steam rolled the girl into her sole once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby yawned as she filled the kettle up, enjoying her hot chocolate before bed. Her butt quickly found it's way to the counter as Blake wandered in, her bare feet slapping against the tiles-<br>\r\n\"Hey Blake, how was Cinder?\" She asked casually, while Blake touch tested the kettle before bringing out her hot water bottle to fill,<br>\r\n\"Oddly- pretty good\" Blake yawned, scrunching her toes as she filled the bottle- \"Going to head to sleep- night-\" Ruby gave a small nod, knowing her friend to be not very talkative, especially before bed<br>\r\n\"Night Blake- \" Ruby smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before Blake slipped under the covers once more, falling back into her old routine as she put the hot water bottle at the foot of her bed. She quickly drifted off to sleep with her playful feet sliding around the length of the heated bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinder whined quitely, unable to make much noise as her work was undone under the sudden change of temperature. The heat was overwhelming, opening up the girls pours to make the foot slick once more, this time however, Cinder was under the gunk. her quiet whining was soon silenced my her ichy other foot as Blake slammed the two monsters together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorning slowly dragged into the picture as Blake slowly woke up. Cinder was still smothered by the damp foot and lukewarm water bottle. Her tiny body melted and smeared into the grime surrounding her soppy foot.<br>\r\n\"I need- a shower-\" Blake spoke, not hearing the angry yells under her foot as she slid out of bed, only to be met with an impatient looking Weiss waited for her turn.<br>\r\n\"Ah- I believe it's my turn miscreant\" She frowned, watching Blake sit back down with an affirmative nod.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blake frowned slightly as she lifted her foot. Partially at the stale smell of her own foot sweat but mostly at the wet smear that Cinder had been reduced to. Though she\u2019d stopped thinking of the tiny thing as a human sometime around when she had last plastered her to her foot, it was still disconcerting to see the girl\u2019s crushed form reduced to little more than a tattoo on her moist sole. The fire-user had been flattened so badly that it took several moments for the Faunus to get sufficient purchase with her fingernails to rip her off, the tortured body coming off with a disturbingly wet sound, like removing a sodden bandage from an equally sodden body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss was also disturbed as she watched her friend struggle to remove their new foot pet from her clearly over-heated feet. There was no way she was touching that thing with her hands. It would be tantamount to touching Blake\u2019s sole directly, something she had no intention of doing at this time. Instead she reached into her pocket and pooled out a delicate lace handkerchief, momentarily regretting the need to soil such a thing before holding it out towards her teammate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Faunus girl wasted no time dropping the crumbled Cinder into the heiress\u2019s handkerchief, though it took her a moment to shake the girl loose, the sweat having already begun to adhere to her fingers. The moment the mastermind landed in the lace it was instantly crumbled around her, Weiss squeezing it around her toy before rubbing it vigorously between her palms, intent on removing as much of Blake\u2019s foot sweat as possible before playing with the little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinder herself had had no time to appreciate her temporary freedom. She\u2019d been happy of course to be freed from Blake\u2019s hellish foot, but the experience was no better within the confines of Weiss\u2019s handkerchief. The palms on either side of the cloth were relentless as they twisted her body in every direction, burning her with the friction of the fabric even as the foot sweat that still covered her was being smeared across her skin. The excess sweat was being absorbed by the lace but that sodden lace was in turn being rubbed back over the tiny criminal, ensuring she had no escape from the smell of the Faunus\u2019s feet, which had long since embedded itself in her tortured nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally satisfied that she had removed a sufficient quantity of the grime, Weiss unfolded the handkerchief and allowed Cinder\u2019s mangled form to slide out, slipping over the edge and into the opening of the tights she held out below. The broken girl slid helplessly into the left sock of the sheer white tights, thankful at least to find that they had obviously been cleaned recently. Though she knew it was only a matter of time before she would be introduced to this girl\u2019s foot as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeering down into the tights, Weiss could barely see the little criminal squirming uselessly in the left sock. \u201cYou better get used to it down there, because that\u2019s where you\u2019re staying all day.\u201d She smirked knowingly. \u201cUnlike Blake I have no intentions of just sitting around all day either. I\u2019m going to go do some shopping in Vale, and it\u2019s your job to keep my left foot comfortable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss wasn\u2019t sure if Cinder could even understand her words like that, and she didn\u2019t care either. As much as she tried to suppress it her upbringing had engendered a sense of entitlement in her that constantly sought opportunities to control others. She\u2019d never do something like that to her friends of course, but now that this opportunity had presented itself she wasn\u2019t going to let it go. After all it wasn\u2019t like this thing deserved any better. If everything that letter said was true than she\u2019d done terrible things, and intended to do worse. She deserved to be a slave to their feet, to be reduced to nothing more than a piece of grime on their soles or a bug between their toes. And Weiss would take great pleasure in making sure that she experienced everything that was coming to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no time for Cinder to even contemplate escape as the heiress plunged her foot into the tights and skilfully wrap her toes around the criminal\u2019s shrunken form, making sure to wedge the entire body into the gap between her toes and her sole. The small girl\u2019s head was instantly crushed beneath Weiss\u2019s big toe, while she squeezed the rest of the body like a piece of putty, enjoying the feeling as the other girl\u2019s squishy body was forced into the gaps between each digit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeliberately grabbing her highest heels, Weiss slipped them on, knowing that the pressure on her toes would only be increased by the high angle, and relishing the opportunity to increase the torment she was inflicting. Below, Cinder could do nothing to defend herself as she was mercilessly crushed under a far greater pressure than she had ever experienced under Blake, the sweat of the heiress\u2019s toes already beginning to leak into her as the heat began to rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking only a moment to wish her teammates a good day, Weiss stepped out of the dorm, deliberately favouring her left foot as she strode down Beacon\u2019s hallways towards the docks that would take her into Vale, and savouring the delightful feeling of the mush between her toes.</span></div></div>",

Usually, she was far more reserved with her purchases and careful with her time, but today there had been a spring in her step and a determined glint in her eye as she set out to ensure she spent as much time on her feet as humanly possible. All day she had continued to favour her left foot, allowing her increasingly sweaty toes to play with the utterly mangled body of the tiny criminal trapped within their embrace. Even when she purchased shoes she would try on the right one only to make sure the fit was good, ensuring there was no chance for Cinder to escape the ever expanding pool of sweat in her left heel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver time the feeling of the girl beneath Weiss\u2019s toes had become indistinguishable from the usual feeling of grime and sweat, the shrunken girl\u2019s existence ground down to such an extent that she practically became an extension of the foot that held her prisoner. Yet the fencer made sure to never forget what it was that she had beneath her feet, using her moist toes to play with the tiny student every chance she got and driving her ever further into the toe crevice. Whenever she was standing still she would twist her left foot around, ensuring there was absolutely no reprieve. If she ever even thought the girl was trying to squirm or escape she\u2019d stomp down with all the force she could muster and wouldn\u2019t stop until she was sure that all movement had ceased. It had been absolutely exhilarating to know just how much power she had over that tiny piece of human trash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she was back a part of her wanted to see just what sort of state she\u2019d reduced Cinder to, hoping that she\u2019d at least managed to do more damage than Blake. If she was lucky she may have smeared the tiny thing so badly that no-one would ever be able to recognise she was even there, then she\u2019d be able to keep her forever without anyone knowing where she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, it wasn\u2019t enough yet, not nearly enough. If she checked now and her toy was still visible then her teammates would know and she\u2019d have no choice come the next morning but to turn her over to either Yang or Ruby. But if she kept her there and continued the torment then, when she finally pulled off the tights the next morning she could claim ignorance if the tiny bug had disappeared, suggest that she had escaped somehow when she was distracted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was with that mindset that she slipped out of her heels and turned to face her partner, the girl having been watching her curiously from the top bunk ever since she came stomping into the room. \u201cRuby, I need to borrow your boots.\u201d She sighed irritably at the raised eyebrow she received in response. \u201cJust for the night, my feet are cold.\u201d It was a stupid lie, but she didn\u2019t want to remind the girl of their little prisoner just yet and it seemed to work as the younger girl just shrugged and nodded, motioning to the boots sitting at the foot of Weiss\u2019s bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching down to grab the boots, Weiss next headed to the small adjacent bathroom, and in particular to the used clothes basket. After a small amount of rummaging, she located what she was looking for, the pair of nylons Blake had worn today, together with Yang\u2019s used socks. Fortunately the other girls\u2019 legs were more toned than her own and she had little difficulty pulling one of Blake\u2019s nylons over the left half of her own tights, and then one of Yang\u2019s socks after that. Repeating the process with the other nylon and sock on the same foot was more difficult, but after a bit of working her left foot was encased in five layers of fabric, saturated in the combined sweat and horrid foot stench of the three older members of Team RWBY. Once that was done she shoved the whole thing into the cushy interior of Ruby\u2019s left combat boot, just barely squeezing it in, and smiling with satisfaction as she felt her foot sinking deeply into the moist insole of her leader\u2019s footwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked ridiculous of course, and immensely lopsided, but Weiss didn\u2019t care. She had a plan. While sleeping there was little she could do to make Cinder anymore indistinguishable from her sole other than to keep the pressure up, but that didn\u2019t mean she couldn\u2019t aim for a plan B. Simply put, if she couldn\u2019t make the girl invisible than she\u2019d simply make sure she was adhered so badly to her foot that no-one would ever be able to free her. Already she could feel the heat on her foot rising and the sweat beginning to poor down into the boot, undoubtedly drowning her little captive in a world of heat and stench and, with any luck, slowly ironing her into the warm and sweaty flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecure in her victory, the heiress climbed into bed, shoving Ruby\u2019s right boot under the desk and skilfully hiding from the eyes of her teammates as she pulled up her covers and made sure her left leg in particular was as nice and toasty as possible. In reality the whole situation was quite uncomfortable, but the hope that tomorrow would see her as the full-time owner of her own little foot toy was enough to send Weiss off into a world of pleasant dreams, even as below the tiny Cinder was subjected to a hell unlike anything she could have ever imagined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the next morning comes, what state has Cinder been reduced to?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the forceful heiress slept above, Cinder was feeling hotter than she ever had before in the tight space off all this fabric. The combined stench from all four of the girls made for a toxic tasting air, burning her lungs with each forced huff as the night went on. Spending a day under Weiss was one thing, but at this rate, Cinder would be stuck beneath the sword wielder forever! The heat made sweat pour out of every crevice and into her body. Drops of sweat seeming to soak through from Ruby's boot  to completely cover the poor girl to a flattened puddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour or so went by, suffering through heat, sweat, grime, and the occasional toe wiggles. That's when the heat really began to do it's job. All the layers placed around her left foot were cooking her skin, forcing her pores to open up to cool off and let more sweat escape. Cinder, finally free from the content rejection of escape, began to try and peel herself free from the stubborn girls sole. But, the force from the combined fabrics were pressing back on her, forcing her body to remain flat and squished further into the sweaty sole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach little pore started to nip at the fire users body, pulling it under Weiss' sweaty skin. Having space to move into, her body instantly found relief by reform under her skin, sinking Cinder in like a tattoo. While the room was silent, Cinders tiny screams echoed out through the boot as she tried desperately to break free from this torture. Every little inch she was pushed back was only met with force from the socks, keeping her nostrils filled with sweat; and also giving the heiress exactly what she dreamed for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun rose the next morning as Weiss began to wake from a lovely dream, feeling refreshed but extremely hot. \"Oh god...I can't imagine how bad it must me down there. She has to be gone for sure!\" She thought to herself, feeling her foot pruning from the long night in multiple layers. Taking a quick look around to see her teammates still somewhat asleep, she quick threw the covers off and set the sweaty boot down with a Stomp. If Cinder had fallen asleep somehow last night, she wanted to make sure she was awake for this. \"Now, let's see how far you sank in last night.\" She said with a sadistic smirk, beginning to untie Ruby's boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heat and stench could be smelt as soon as Weiss took her foot out, spreading across to the whole room. \"Oh god, *cough cough* what a disgusting stench.\" She winced, starting to peel off each layer of sock and nylon, each one getting sweatier as they were removed. While her plan was beginning to come to and end, the smell from last night began to wake the other members of team RWBY. Yang in particular was the one to wake up first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh....god, what IS that smell? Weiss, did you cause all of this?\" The blonde fighter asked, plugging her nose as she rose with a rude Awakening. That's when she remembered that today was her day to spend with Cinder underfoot. She had big plans for her, wanting to go training and fighting with her in her favorite brown boots. Her lilac eyes looked down at the heiress' feet, seeing them already barefoot from a goodnight sleep. \"Oh riiiiight, hey Weiss, time to give up the insole. That little bug and I get to spend the day together. Hopefully we will get off on the right foot.\" Her smug face from her pun only made Weiss groan in disgust. \"Do you always have to make a pun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang hopped off her bed and waisted no time picking up Weiss' feet, trying to find Cinder. \"H-hey, what do you think you're doing?!\" She shrieked a bit, flustered to see her teammate so willingly grab her feet. \"Relax, I'm just peeling her off your sole and then I'll.....huh? She won't come off...I can't even feel her!\" At that moment, Weiss gained a wicked smile and devious eyes as she whiped her foot from Yang. She quickly looked down at her sole to see Cinder clear as day. While it wasn't what she wanted to happen, after scratching at the girls face, she found that she was scratching her own skin directly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, she's under my skin! It worked!\" She exclaimed with glee, taking pride in the girls broken and screaming face stuck as a part of her. \"Wait, what do you mean it worked?! Did you do this on purpose?!\" The brawler replied with for eyes. Her excitement let her master plan slip out, and now she would have to cover for herself. \"I mean...it worked, my foot is nice and warm just like Ruby said it would be! She let me borrow her boots to stay warm last night. My feet get pretty cold without them.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYangs eyes seemed to calm a bit, not really believing her, but knowing there wasn't much more they could do. \"Of course you'd get cold feet Ice Queen. You must have been cooking to get her under your skin.\" She sighed, giving cinder a poke before standing up and starting to get ready for the day. Weiss was filled with pride, stroking her pruny foot over and over to just tease the little girl. She had become part of her now, and Weiss would get to enjoy the pleasure of knowing she would be stomping over a worthless little bug every second of everyday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she began to get up though, Yang stopped her for a moment. \"Hold on Weiss........</span></div></div>",

Partially because of the severe talking to she\u2019d just gotten from Professor Goodwitch, partially because of the thin coating of dust that was still irritating her skin, but mostly because of the fight that had precipitated it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat braggart Cardin Winchester had been giving her teammate Velvet trouble since the day he\u2019d entered the academy. For the most part Coco had tried to let it slide. After all, Velvet herself had asked her team not to intervene, feeling it wasn\u2019t worth getting in trouble just to put some troublesome first years in their place. But really, there was only so much she could tolerate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when she\u2019d caught Cardin and his cronies planning to dump several beakers full of powdered dust over the innocent rabbit Faunus for no reason other than pointless bigotry and their own sense of entitlement, she\u2019d retaliated by punching the numbskull in his big stupid face. She\u2019d gotten herself covered in half of the dust from the beakers for her trouble, but the other half had ended up over Team CRDL and Cardin had been left with a broken jaw so it was 100% worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course she\u2019d gotten dragged off by Goodwitch afterwards, both to get scolded for straight out punching another student and to get checked for any side effects of the dust exposure. Mixing powdered dust without a proven recipe was dangerous at the best of times, mixing several beakers worth was just asking for trouble. Even so, there was no immediate sign of any problems, so after brushing off any obvious deposits of dust, Glynda had let her go with instructions to get some rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this had left Coco with a distinctly sour disposition, which was only worsened as she inevitably remembered all the other times some jerk had taken issue with Velvet\u2019s ears, or Fox\u2019s eyes, or Yatsu\u2019s quiet nature. All of it was giving her the worst headache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact that headache was quickly becoming more of a problem than she had anticipated. The drumming in her skull was building to a painful crescendo as her vision began to swim. She stumbled into the wall as she experienced a sensation like the floor had suddenly dropped away and she was starting to fall. Instinctively she brought up her arms to break her fall. Then everything went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoco didn\u2019t know how much time had passed by the time her vision started to return, her senses still dulled by the aftermath of whatever fate had befallen her. At least the headache was fading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet as her eyes adjusted again she was faced with an impossible sight, enough to make her wonder if she was still unconscious. Where before the carpet had extended just a few feet before the next corner, now it extended out as a vast plain before her, the wall she had fallen against now far out of reach and the ceiling looming an impossible distance overhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rational part of Coco\u2019s mind wanted to deny what she was seeing, but the part of her that was training to fight monsters for a living couldn\u2019t deny the reality of her situation. Someone, impossibly, the fashionista had been reduced to what she would roughly estimate to be around 2 inches in height. Small enough that the reverberations of the footsteps now echoing down the hall shook her to her core, her eyes trailing up and up to behold the rapidly approaching figure of\u2026</span></div></div>",

Usually she was significantly taller than Velvet, ears notwithstanding, so it was particularly jarring to see the gentle girl now standing taller than most buildings, her rapidly approaching footsteps producing miniature earthquakes even through the soft carpeted floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear that Velvet was dressed for bed, her feet bare and the rest of her body covered only with a pair of light brown booty shorts and a tank top. The slight bounce of her chest made it clear that she wasn\u2019t wearing any underwear either. Her state of dress and the manner in which she was glancing around nervously as she walked suggested she had left the dorm in something of a rush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fast speed of the Faunus\u2019 approach left Coco with only a split second to reach a determination of her next actions. On the one hand she could flatten herself to the wall and avoid her friend\u2019s gaze, but then she\u2019d be left alone in the hallway with no way of seeking help. On the other hand she could dash out and try to get Velvet\u2019s attention, with the associated risk of being crushed accidentally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, she wouldn\u2019t have come to Beacon if she wasn\u2019t prepared to take risks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealising this was her best chance of getting help, Coco threw caution to the wind and quickly dashed out to the center of the hallway and started to wave her arms up at Velvet, yelling as loudly as possible to get her teammate\u2019s attention. For a brief moment she thought she had been successful, the Faunus\u2019 eyes turning in her direction. But then they continued on and the sky was replaced with the descending shadow of Velvet\u2019s right foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Coco hadn\u2019t returned after the earlier incident with Cardin, Velvet had become worried. It was bad enough that her leader was going to get in trouble because of her problems, but the chance that the dust had caused some harm the taller girl was almost more than Velvet could bear. She loved her team, she really did, and more than anything she didn\u2019t want them getting hurt for her, or because of her burdens. It wasn\u2019t that she didn\u2019t appreciate the fact that they cared about her enough to step in when she was in trouble, but she just wished they\u2019d be more careful about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was with that determination that the rabbit Faunus had left the safety or her dorm room in the direction of Professor Goodwitch\u2019s office, hoping to meet Coco along the way. She kept glancing around out of nervousness that should other student would see her in her night clothes, but so far the cost appeared to be mercifully clear. For a brief moment she thought she heard someone in the distance, but as her eyes flicked in that direction she confirmed that the hallway was still empty and casually took another step in her ongoing search for Coco.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoco didn\u2019t even have a chance to dodge as her friend\u2019s foot came down with crushing force, forcing her to her back and filling her vision as it sought out the ground below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Velvet it just felt like she\u2019d stepped on an uneven bit of carpet that flattened out evenly under her weight, whereas Coco experienced the unsettling and painful experience of her body flattened out under the sole of the Faunus girl. Rather than being crushed to death as she had expected, her body gave in under the pressure and flattened out into a two dimensional shape, crushed deep into the carpet by Velvet\u2019s slightly damp sole before being lifted into the air once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slightly gummy nature of Coco\u2019s body allowed her to stick to her teammates\u2019 sole as Velvet continued down the hall and around the corner, step after step pounding her into the ground and grinding out the third dimension of her body. Her face had been flattened to the ball of the Faunus\u2019 foot and her senses, when they weren\u2019t consumed by the pressure and agony of being forced into the carpet below, were dominated by the taste and smell of Velvet\u2019s foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continued for several dozen steps but eventually the slight irritation to Velvet\u2019s sole and the quiet squishing noise of the progressive flattening of her body was enough to draw the rabbit girl\u2019s attention to her sole and she paused to lift her foot an examine her unwanted passenger.</span></div></div>",

A clump of tan and brown smeared over her foot, the main mass a mix of textures while the extremities were a consistent tan colour that nearly blended in completely with her sole and looked almost like\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a gasp the Faunus stumbled back and nearly put her foot back on the ground before catching herself against the wall and lifting her foot as close to her face as possible. Ignoring the slight smell that assaulted her nostrils, her keen eyes confirm what she had feared, the small form of her squished team leader practically ironed into the sole of her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few terrifying seconds Velvet was sure that she\u2019d killed her friend, snuffed her out with her careless steps, but then Coco twitched and in a single blur of movement the bigger girl had dug her nails beneath the edges of her friend\u2019s flattened form and ripped her from her sole with a sound and sensation not unlike removing a wet bandage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoco was aware of the lessened pressure as she was lifted from the ground but wasn\u2019t sure what was going on until she heard the sound of Velvet\u2019s gasp and the subsequent violent movement as the girl stumbled into the wall. Realising this was her chance to be saved from this hell she\u2019d been plunged into she squirmed desperately and was rewarded as she was pulled free from her sweaty prison, the brief moment of pain as she separated from the sole more than worth the sweat air of freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing deeply, Coco groaned as her body slowly began to pop back to its original shape, dimly aware that she was now being clasped in Velvet\u2019s cupped hands. Reaching up with a barely reformed hand, she untangled what was left of her shattered sunglasses from her hair, together with the bent remains of her favourite beret. Regretfully placing the irreparably damaged items in her lap, the fashionista gloomy noted the general tattered state of her outfit, for once wishing she\u2019d actually worn the academy\u2019s uniform to class. At least her body appeared to be recovering well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of heavy breathing eventually brought Coco\u2019s gaze up to meet the impossibly large eyes of her teammate, only to realise that the Faunus was in the middle of what appeared to be a major panic attack. Velvet\u2019s breathing was erratic, coming in short sharp gasps, and tears were pooling in the corner of her eyes as she stared down at her tiny leader. As she slowly regained her sense of balance, Coco realised that the girl\u2019s hands were trembling as well, vibrating mildly beneath her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling her longs reinflate fully the leader tried a casual start to the conversation\u2026 \u201cAh, hey Velvet, how are yo\u2026\u201d only to be cut off by her frantic friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry! What happened!? Are you okay? Did I hurt you? I\u2019m sorry! I didn\u2019t see you. I didn\u2019t know you could\u2026 I\u2019m sorry! I\u2019m so sorry! Please be okay. Coco!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, not so loud Velvet.\u201d Coco clutched at her ears, overwhelmed by her teammate\u2019s frantic voice booming so close to her. \u201cI\u2019m fine really\u2026 well my clothes could be better. Ah, I mean\u2026\u201d She frowned as Velvet sniffed loudly. She didn\u2019t want to make her sad. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019m not sure what happened. I just\u2026 became like this. Then you turned up and, well\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Coco\u2019s sake, Velvet tried to get her breathing under control, though the tears continued to trail down her cheeks. She lowered her voice to a whisper as brought her cupped hands up against her chest. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry I stepped on you Coco, and I\u2019m so glad you weren\u2019t hurt. What... what do we do now.\u201d This was definitely not something the academy had prepared them for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s just go back to the dorm for now. We can work out what to do there.\u201d At the very least, they\u2019d be away from any unexpected interruptions or unwanted visitors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelvet nodded, continuing to clutch her hands to her chest and unintentionally bumping Coco against her breasts as she spun around and headed back to the dorm, leaving her tiny leader to clutch onto her fingers for the quick trip back to the safety of team CFVY\u2019s dorm room.</span></div></div>",

On the one hand this meant that Velvet could devote all of her attention to helping her shrunken leader. On the other hand Velvet could really have used the support of her teammates right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raised height of the bed left Coco at closer to Velvet\u2019s knees then her feet but didn\u2019t do much to decrease the vertigo of looking up at the titanic Faunus. Even at their current size difference, the tiny girl could see that her giant friend was still waiting for her instructions. If the situation wasn\u2019t so dire, it would almost have made her laugh. Temporarily pushing aside the sheer terror of her situation, and the lingering scent of Velvet\u2019s feet, Coco tried to think of their most logical next step. \u201cOkay. Can you please get my scroll. I left it under my bed. It\u2019s got my biometrics on it so it should be able to scan for any aura abnormalities.\u201d With the baseline on the scroll they could at least get a decent comparison between her aura before and after the dust exposure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight.\u201d Coco\u2019s bed was directly across from Velvet\u2019s so they rabbit girl quickly spun around and fell to her knees to search under the bed, her superior night vision and flexibility allowing her to easily force half her body under the bed to more closely scan the contents down there. When you had a four people living in a single room you had to take advantage of every bit of storage you could find so there were more than a few items under their and Velvet had to wriggle around a bit to find what she was looking for but eventually her eyes fell upon the scroll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to Velvet, her search for the scroll produced an unexpected show for Coco, the rabbit Faunus\u2019s firm buttocks lifted high as her body bent forward, and shifting from side to side as she moved around beneath the bed. The bare soles of her feet were also on full show, the slight perspiration still covering the skin reminding Coco all too vividly of her own experience beneath the weight of those appendages. Even so, the sight of her friend\u2019s search caused an odd sensation to build in her stomach and a strange blurring sensation at the edges of her vision. Almost like she\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Coco could dwell further on the sensation, Velvet rapidly extracted herself from the bed, spinning around fast enough to leave her breasts bouncing in place for a few moments as she practically skipped back over to the bed to present her prize. Gulping deeply, and looking anywhere but her friend\u2019s torso, the team leader forced herself to focus only on the Faunus\u2019s face as her teammate quickly raised the scroll and initiated a scan, the two of them waiting several long seconds before a loud beep signalled the scan\u2019s completion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeen to see the result, Velvet climbed onto the bed beside Coco, failing to notice as the tiny girl was left to desperately scramble across the sheets to avoid rolling beneath the young huntresses\u2019 legs. Placing her feet flat on the bed on either side of her shrunken leader, Velvet unconsciously scrunched her toes around the sheets as she turned the scroll towards Coco.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes flicking over the screen, the shrunken huntress noted with a rising sense of disappointment that the readings were normal. Despite the beating she\u2019d taken from the Faunus\u2019s foot her aura was still optimal and there were no inconsistencies in the output, nor had the scan picked up any abnormal dust concentrations. Whatever had happened to her, no trace had been left behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelvet looked disappointed as well, her long ears dropping in concern as she gnawed on her bottom lip and shuffled her feet on the bed, nearly knocking Coco over with the sudden movement. For a long moment the sound of the shuffling feet dominated the shrunken girl\u2019s ears and all she could think about was the time she\u2019d spent trapped under the right sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact that the rest of Velvet\u2019s body was shifting around as the Faunus squirmed uncomfortably wasn\u2019t helping, and Coco was finding it increasingly difficult to keep her eyes from straying. Whatever these feeling were they weren\u2019t normal, not for her at least, but in the end she couldn\u2019t stop herself. Meeting her friend\u2019s eyes with some difficulty, she finally put words to the thoughts she\u2019d been trying to keep inside. \u201cVelvet, please\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

Why would you even ask that!?\u201d Of all the things that Velvet thought Coco might say in response to the scan results, that hadn\u2019t even been on the list. Instinctively she pulled her feet back and folded her legs, noting with trepidation that Coco\u2019s eyes unflinchingly followed their path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease Velvet, I\u2026 I need this.\u201d Now that she\u2019d put voice to her desires, Coco couldn\u2019t stop herself. Her mind was filled with the memories of when Velvet had stepped on her in the hall, the sweet agony of those few precious moments of being crushed beneath the uncaring tread of her teammate. It took every ounce of self-control she had not to charge across the bed and force her way to the Faunus\u2019s feet, and even then the only thing holding her back was her desire not to force her own needs on Velvet. Any thought of embarrassment had long since fled her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching down with one hand, Velvet forced Coco\u2019s head up so that she was looking the tiny girl in the eyes. She swallowed thickly at the sheer need she saw, such a foreign expression on the face of her usually composed leader. \u201cCoco, do you\u2026 do you have a foot fetish?\u201d She was well aware of how much Coco enjoyed shopping for shoes, among other things, and she\u2019d certainly helped Velvet picked out more than a few pairs, but it\u2019s not like she\u2019d ever smelled them or anything, so the rabbit girl had really had no idea that these sorts of thoughts might be lurking in her leader\u2019s mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoco however shook her head, despite her current thoughts she retained enough of her composure at least to know these thoughts were unique to her current circumstance. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt like this before Velv. I can\u2019t explain it, I just\u2026 I just need you to step on, squish me, crush me with your feet.\u201d She wanted to say more, to ask for more, to do more, but she held herself back for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think maybe\u2026\u201d Velvet paused to gather her thoughts and to shift uncomfortably as she removed her hand and Coco\u2019s gaze once again fell towards her obscured feet. \u201cIt\u2019s a side effect of whatever made you shrink? If we just ask one of the teacher\u2019s then maybe\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLater.\u201d Coco didn\u2019t bother to raise her head to respond, peering instead at the Faunus\u2019s toes, sticking out from under the thigh of her left leg. \u201cRight now, please, just step on me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelvet wanted to say no, wanted to tell Coco that there was no way she\u2019d ever do something like that, something that could hurt her, but she knew that wasn\u2019t what Coco needed right now. So, with a great deal of reluctance, she raised her foot and held it over her friend. She hesitated just long enough to be sure the tiny huntress wasn\u2019t going to move, and then carefully brought her foot down, feeling little resistance as it came to rest on the soft surface of the mattress. She was vaguely aware of the feel of Coco\u2019s body beneath her sole, but it felt little different from the mattress itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Coco\u2019s perspective the impact of the Faunus\u2019s movements was much more noticeable. Though Velvet wasn\u2019t pushing down with enough force to squish her she still found herself trapped beneath the near-suffocating weight of the larger girl\u2019s flesh. Coco\u2019s tiny body was forced back into the sheets, the soft fabric bunching up beneath her body and pushing her up into the sweaty flesh of Velvet\u2019s sole. She was surrounded on all sides by the smell of her friend\u2019s feet and the feel of the sweat slowly trickling over her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was scary really. That she could need something like this. It wasn\u2019t natural, not for her at least. She knew it had to be some sort of side-effect of the shrinking, but right now she couldn\u2019t bring herself to care. Right now all she could think about was Velvet\u2019s foot. Though the weight of the flesh on top of her made it difficult, Coco was able to open her mouth and happily began licking the Faunus\u2019 sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reaction from Velvet was immediate. The unexpected sensation of Coco\u2019s tongue caused her to instinctively press down harder with her foot. Much harder. Although the soft surface of the bed prevented a crushing as bad as had happened in the hall, there was still enough force applied to partially flatten Coco, Velvet\u2019s flesh pressed deep into her still open mouth and filling her senses with the taste of the Faunus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealising with horror what she\u2019d done, Velvet immediately pulled back her foot, wincing as her friend\u2019s partially flattened body came into view. \u201cI\u2019m sorry! I didn\u2019t mean to!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoco however waved her off, still lying in a foot-shaped indent in the sheets and breathing deeply as she took in the lingering scent of Velvet\u2019s foot. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, I\u2026 please, do that again. More, do it more.\u201d She looked up at the Faunus, naked need and want shining in her eyes.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Finally deciding to just bite the bullet and do what she needed to do, Velvet brought her feet up on either side of Coco, turning the soles ninety degrees to face her tiny leader and giving the smaller girl a few moments to climb to her feet before bringing them together with the clap of flesh on flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment Velvet had finally started to move her feet, Coco was pretty sure she knew what was going to happen, but even that hadn\u2019t prepared her for the reality of suddenly finding herself trapped between the Faunus\u2019s feet. Where before she had been compressed beneath the girl\u2019s weight, now she was being smothered between both soles, utterly surrounding with hot flesh. Her back was to one foot, and her front to the other, and she happily began licking the sole in her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Velvet was ready for it, and she had to admit that the ticklish sensation of Coco\u2019s tongue on her sole wasn\u2019t unpleasant, though she did cringe at the thought of how that must taste. Trying to think of what would make her leader happy, and hopefully satisfy her enough that they could both get some sleep, Velvet began sliding her feet back and forth against one another, feeling the tiny girl\u2019s body being rolled back and forth across her soles. The Faunus couldn\u2019t help but shudder slightly as her feet slid far enough to bump Coco against her sensitive toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Coco the sensation was nearly indescribable, her features were slowly being flattened out as she was rolled back and forth between the soles of her teammate, and she quickly built up a thin layer of grime and sweat across her clothes and exposed skin. Every few seconds she wold be rolled into the step of Velvet\u2019s toes, the long digits giving her a quick squeeze before releasing her back into the grip of the soles. The rabbit girl\u2019s feet were relatively clean but there was enough residual grime to give her a thorough coating and the smell enough to engrain itself deep within her nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of slowly ironing Coco flatter and flatter, Velvet decided to switch tactics, separating her feet and letting the other girl\u2019s body fall back to the mattress before bringing her right foot down with a great deal more force than she\u2019d previously used. Her aim was good and she managed to catch the girl\u2019s head between her toes, forcing Coco\u2019s face between her big and second toe even as the rest of her body was flattened beneath her sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she wouldn\u2019t want to admit it out loud, Velvet was starting to see the appeal of this situation. Of being the one in a position of power for once, with Coco completely unable to resist her. The Faunus ground her foot down into the bed, pushing down to the extent that the mattress hardened into an unforgiving surface and she could feel Coco\u2019s body being once again rendered two dimensional beneath her weight. At the same time her toes began playing with her friend\u2019s squishy head, wrapping themselves around her shrunken skull and squeezing from all sides, kneading her doughy flesh like a piece of gum that had gotten caught where it shouldn\u2019t have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoco was in heaven, her body a buzz of sweet agony as it was flattened beneath Velvet\u2019s unforgiving sole, even as her head and face was smeared along the underside of the Faunus\u2019s toes. With some difficulty she managed to force her mouth open and run her tongue along the nearest toe, picking up some of the toejam and greedily swallowing it down, the heavy grimy texture coating her throat as she struggled to force it down her flattened esophagus. The taste of it just made her want more and she rapidly began running her tongue over every surface in reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling of the tongue again made Velvet giggle, her toes instinctively clenching down to rub away the ticklish sensation, forcing Coco\u2019s head deep into the crevice between her toes and smearing her flattened face into the toejam that had accumulated there. A few furious seconds of grinding followed before Velvet finally relented, slowly allowing Coco\u2019s head to pop back to normal.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Velvet, irritated by the odd squishing sensation, lifted her foot as best she could. Her balance wasn't the best, so she hopped around for a couple of steps, sending her boobs jiggling about, before bracing against the wall and blushing a bit. Looking closer at her foot, she saw an odd colored blob. It looked a lot like Coco, but it was way too small. Velvet scratched at it a couple times, prying its flat form from her filthy foot. She really should've grabbed some shoes...<br>\r\nBringing it up to her eyes, she was certain. This had to be one of those weird stickers that had been going around Beacon Academy lately. She had heard one of the boys was making these for the 'cutest looking girls' but she wasn't sure she had seen any in person. Actually, come to think of it, Jaune might've had one of Weiss the other day in class... Anyway, she was certain this little sticker was modeled after Coco. Coco would be so happy to know that her fashion sense was being noticed. The Faunus decided to hang onto the sticker until she found Coco, and give it to her as a gift for helping her with the bullies. Even if she preferred dealing with her problems herself, she appreciated Coco's effort...<br>\r\nCoco, meanwhile, was in a world of pain. Between being crushed under the rabbit girl's massive foot and being forced to directly smell her bare feet and taste her nervous foot sweat, she had gone into sensory overload and been effectively knocked out. Being thrown about by the massive g-forces as Velvet quickly hopped about and moved her tiny form to her face did the poor shrunken girl no favors. By the time she was lifted up to the bunny girl's face, she was too far gone to utter even a peep that Velvet's massive ears could hear.<br>\r\nVelvet lifted the sticker up to her face, directly to her nose, and took a whiff. \"Phew, that's kinda smelly. I guess I should've expected that if it was just lying on the floor... and got stuck to my feet...\" She'd have to wash it up a bit before giving it to Coco. It was made of that weird gummy stuff, so it should be fine. But her booty shorts didn't have any pockets, so she'd have to stick it somewhere while she found Coco, and give it to her later. But where was she going to hide it? She'd be way too embarrassed if someone saw her wearing it on her forehead or something. She looked bad enough now - which reminded her she should hurry up before someone came along. Thinking quickly, she decided...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Furtively swivelling her head from side to side, Velvet quickly determined that there was no-one else nearby, and her keen ears told her there were no approaching footsteps. Assured that she wouldn\u2019t be seen, she quickly pulled open the collar of her tube top, temporarily exposing her modest chest, and slapped the little sticker onto her left breast, shuddering slightly as she felt it adhere to the skin with a wet slurp. Maybe she should have cleaned it a bit before applying it there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking off her apprehensions, Velvet noted that the little sticker was starting to slip, sliding down her breast on the inner side. It seemed it had picked up too much lubrication and grime from her foot and wasn\u2019t sticking properly anymore. Not wanting to let it slip off completely she grabbed a breast with either hand and pushed them together, burying the unfortunate sticker girl between the twin mountains of her warm and sweaty boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoco was still too out of it to really appreciate what was going on. She was dimly aware that she had been removed from her teammate\u2019s sole and examined by massive brown eyes, but was confused as she was placed on another softer surface she didn\u2019t recognise, rather than being immediately carried to safety. She felt her sweat and grime soaked body beginning to slip when another massive object filled her view and she was suddenly subjected to the intensely painful sensation of being crushed between two immense masses of flesh. Completely surrounded by the warmth and sweat of the other girl\u2019s body, the shrunken student could do nothing but wait for this torment to end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding her chest together for several seconds, the bunny girl loosened her grip and let her breasts slowly separate, only to slam them back together again as she noted the sticker still hadn\u2019t properly adhered, the head attempting to peel off with the right orb rather than remaining stuck to the left. Wanting to make sure that her new toy was well and truly stuck, Velvet squeezed her breasts together over and over again, as well as rubbing them against each other to ensure that the little sticker would become firmly adhered. After another twenty seconds of unintentional torment she allowed her bust to separate once more, smiling to herself as she noted that the Coco sticker was now properly adhered to her breast, looking almost like a tattoo against her flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting go of her collar and allowing the tank top to snap back, Velvet set of once again in search of her leader, blissfully unaware as her braless chest bounced with her footsteps and battered the tiny Coco between them. Though she was not as well-endowed as some of the other girls at the school, her breasts were still more than big enough to shift significantly as she strode down the academy\u2019s hallways, crushing their little passenger over and over again as they swung to and fro. Despite the size of her ears, the Faunus was oblivious to the squelching sound as her sweaty chest assaulted what she still believed to be nothing more than a sticker of her leader, the increasingly large amount of sweat from her pores being rubbed deeply into the defenceless girl\u2019s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRetracing the hallways all the way back to the staff area Velvet was surprised to find no sign of her leader, but quickly set off to check a few other possible locations where Coco may have gone to get her head straight. The cafeteria was a bust as well, as was the main courtyard and the training rooms. All the trip accomplished was to remind the Faunus girl how humid it was out tonight, her tight clothing becoming uncomfortably clingy as the sweat from her curves began to soak into it. She pulled open her top again temporarily to allow her increasingly sore chest a chance to breath, briefly lowering her gaze to check that the sticker was still where she had left it. She had to grimace slightly at the obvious layer of sweat that now completely covered the grimy sticker, but at least it hadn\u2019t moved. If anything it looked like it was even more adhered than the last time she\u2019d checked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting her top snap back once again, Velvet continued to check a few more locations before finally giving up, realising that wherever Coco was, she wasn\u2019t going to be hanging around the halls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer first thought was to head back to the dorm, hypothesising that her teammate may have passed her in the halls at some point and already gone to bed. Alternatively, she could go to Professor Goodwitch\u2019s office in case Coco was still there, either being questioned or serving some kind of detention. If nothing else, Glynda might be able to confirm when she had last seen her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was also a thought nagging at the back of Velvet\u2019s head that she was missing something obvious. That maybe she should be taking another look at that sticker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a moment to consider her options, Velvet decided to\u2026</span></div></div>",

After 5 grueling minutes of being stomped on the sisters had finished their training session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew well that was a exiting experience\" Yang said in a exhilarated tone, she then noticed something that was stuck to her sister for as she sat down to catch her breath\"hey sis theirs something under your shoe\" Yang mentioned to Ruby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh I didn't notice that sis\" Ruby said as she pulled her boot up peeling the blob under her foot.

He was being squeezed at every angle by something soft. It was very tight.<br>\r\n-------------------<br>\r\nNora woke up the next morning, not hungover as she expected.

Too focused on the future she could share with Ren, Nora paid no attention to the weak protests from Ren, trying to push the giant soft mass away from him, so he could get a moment of fresh air. However as Nora continued to drift off about the future she and Ren could have, she continued to grind her massive tush around, completely obliterating the poor boy trapped beneath her. Nora was in heaven in her own mind, and the subtle touch of Ren into her soft behind, only pleased her subconsciously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen was in a fight for his life, much worse than any Grimm could ever do. The consistent grinding of the planetary sized cheeks above him, only was made worse by the fact that Nora was managing to slide her dangerously small underwear around, much to Ren's displeasure. The tiny underwear getting slid around, meant that Nora would occasionally flash Ren her asshole, and the lower part of her pussy, making Ren dread if he were to get too close to either of them  in his current state. Ren could do nothing but fight valiantly for his life, trying to slide away from the hungry holes of his massive teammate, in the hopes he would not get devoured by either of them. In his current position, the asshole seemed the most hungry, as it was ever looming above him, occasionally flexing slightly open and releasing a strong musk, that made Ren gag violently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other hole, only a small distance away from his feet, was the giant pussy of his teammate, dotted with fine red hairs, to match Nora's head. Glistening slightly, Ren was worried, and that worry only increased, when he realized Nora was getting slightly wet. Whatever was happening outside his giant fleshy dome prison, Ren could only assume that Nora was doing something to stimulate herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nora fantasized more and more about her future husband, she vigorously shook her massive ass around in the seat, enjoying the vibrations coming from the seat, and the thoughts of her long time best friend pleasuring her in every way. As she continued on, Nora could not help but get excited, both from the divine feeling from the seat she was currently on, and the imagery that was playing in her mind currently. She felt her tiny underwear hug her massive ass, a pair of underwear she had gotten from Ren ages ago because she had kept tearing her old ones due to her lost for his sugary pancakes, and she enjoyed the feeling of them defiantly trying to contain her now even more sizable rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the panties slid around, Ren lamented ever having let Nora get this big on pancakes, despite him never having had an issue with her big cushioned rump when he was at normal size. As the giant wrinkly hole, continued to loom ever closer to Ren, he dread what were to happen, if it got a good hold of him. At his current size, and with the flexing from it, it could easily devour him, and if Nora had not notice him now, would she be able to notice him if he slid into her hungry hole. Without warning however, Nora slammed her ass back into the seat, pushing her meaty cheeks further down, and pushing Ren close to the underwear above him. Ren was now at much more peril of sliding into her underwear, and laid awaiting the gyrations of the giant soft cheeks. The cheeks suddenly continued their rhythmic dance, and as the panties slid ever close to scoop him up towards her gaping maw, she suddenly stopped again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was happening on Noras side</span></div></div>",

Some were of gods but if they were cats, some were of Nora crushing Grimm, and some were of Ren cutting firewood in the back of the cabin they would build in the middle of the woods. Nora tried to fantasize what it would be like, Ren making pancakes and Nora beating eggs, but something kept distracting her.<br>\r\n\"What is this on my butt?\" she whispered to herself. She shifted her weight around the squishy putty-like substance cushioning her cushion and creeping up between her plump cheeks. \"This is familiar, but I can't place my finger on it.\" She continued her twisting on the puddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the putty formerly known as Ren could feel every movement of his unaware giantess friend. Given the amount of pancakes he baked for her one would assume that her large cheeks would be soft and pillowy, which they are (as Nora was shown Ren in the past), but surprisingly it still hurt like hell. Ren's form was being pulled every which way, his body now thinned like paper, covering most of the red-heads left cheek, his head slowly heading towards a, *cough*, less desirable area of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora was having enough of this, she wanted to see what this thing was once and for all. This wasn't to say she thought it was uncomfortable, she really enjoyed the feeling of soft putty on her. It was simply a matter of annoying curiosity.<br>\r\nShe rose out of her seat to walk out of the class, trying to cover whatever was on her bum with the hem of her skirt. She managed to take only a few steps before being stopped by Professor Oobleck.<br>\r\n\"Ms. Valkyrie, where do you think you're going?\"<br>\r\n\"Um... The washroom?\" Nora took another step before being stopped again.<br>\r\n\"Can it not wait until after class? We are learning about the very important matter of trade deals between-\"<br>\r\nNora zoned out again.<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah, trade wars. Very important. But I just can't concentrate when I have to go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Oobleck let her go, or does he keep her in class?</span></div></div>",

Please sit down and try to pay attention.\"<br>\r\n\"But-\" But Nora was cut off.<br>\r\n\"Now!\"<br>\r\nIn the seats below Nora, Ruby stifled a giggle while Yang rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n\"You two!\" Oobleck was tired of being interrupted. \"One more disturbance like that and I'll have you two thrown in detention!\"<br>\r\n\"What!?\" Ruby exclaimed.<br>\r\n\"What did I do?\" Yang began to get mad, and you don't like Yang when she's mad.<br>\r\n\"That's it! Detention!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora normally would have joined in the continuing commotion, but the distraction on her butt seemed more important. She needed to know what it was, but obviously she couldn't just deal with it in class. She would have to do what she does best: not pay attention to it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Ren, however, not paying attention to Nora's butt wasn't so easy. He had a little relief when she stood up, with no weight being forced on him and feeling the brief airy breeze on his skin. He even managed to reform away from between Nora's cheeks slightly, re-becoming somewhat human-shaped. But alas, all good things must come to an end, as Nora's back-end was, again, firmly planted back on the wooden seat. This time, however, Nora was trying to ignore him so there would be less grinding. Yay?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora looked for anything to distract her from the soft thing pillowing her cheek. She stared at the notes on the chalkboard, getting bored and shifting her attention to the cup of pens on Ooblecks desk. \"Pens are so boring\" She shifted her attention to Blake's little bow which, now that she thought about it, looked a little like cat ears. \"Hey, now wait just a minute,\" Nora thought, \"Could Blake be a...\" She was cut off by a question from Oobleck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Valkyrie, are you paying attention?\"<br>\r\n\"Um... Yes?\"<br>\r\n\"Okay, then you must be able to tell me when the battle of Noarbut was.\"<br>\r\n\"Of course, it was...\" She blanked. \"2003?\"<br>\r\n\"Ms. Valkyrie, if you can not pay attention, then I'm afraid you're going to have to join detention with Ms. Rose and Ms. Xiao Long.\"<br>\r\nNora stood up in surprise. \"What!?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, detention buddies!\" Ruby threw her arms in the air knowing that it wouldn't just be her and Yang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlopping back down in her seat, Nora pouted and crossed her arms over her chest. She couldn't believe it, a full extra hour with this squishy seat stuck to her. And she wasn't the only one upset. Ren wasn't sure how much longer he could withstand Nora's ass, no matter how soft it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter class, it was just Nora, Ruby, Yang, and Oobleck. Nora decided to move seats up two her two friends, giving Ren a much needed ten seconds of fresh air before being crushed again under Nora again. It was eerily quiet, and boring. But suddenly, Oobleck left. \"I have to go to a meeting, but I trust you three will stay here for the duration of your detention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UGH! He's gone! Now I can get comfortable.\" Yang took off her school jacket and blouse, leaving her top with just a yellow sports bra.<br>\r\n\"Good idea, \"Nora replied, \"I've had something stuck on my butt ALL day!\"<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Ruby asked.<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but I'm about to find out!\"<br>\r\nStanding up and lifting the back of her short-skirt, Nora's fingers lifted the edge of her panties and attempted to grab at the mysterious, sticky putty. \"I'll say this though, it's super comfy. You guys will have to try it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally getting a grip on it, Nora slowly peeled it off, revealing a beige coloured 'thing' that was roughly bent into the shape of Nora's cheek. Looking down at it Nora was filled with curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen saw light for the first time from under Nora's skirt, and was relieved to see fingers coming. \"She must know I'm here! I'm finally being rescued!\" Nora's fingers grabbing at him was a bit painful, a lot painful actually, but Ren knew it was necessary for his freedom. He waited patiently as Nora haphazardly pulled at his puddle-body, finally getting a grip and ripping him off of his prison. Blinded by the light, Ren squinted as he looked up and recognized the cute redhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut did she recognize him?</div></span></div></div>",

His face was a small smudge that she couldn't see. He was still nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bubbly girl grabbed Ren and squeezed him in her fist to test it's moldability. It was so soft to Nora, she loved the feeling of it morphing to the shape of her hands, the subtle actions of her fingers massaging it like dough (much to Ren's displeasure.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Nora!\" Ren tried to yell, \"It's me! Ren!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut due to his size, stretched out vocal chords, and prison of hands, his voice had no chance to reach out to her. He was just nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! No wonder it felt so good, thing thing is soft!\" Nora exclaimed, growing red as she came up with other ideas for it. But first... \"You guys REALLY need to try it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Yang started, \"my bras <i>have</i> been getting a bit chaffing.\" <br>\r\n\"And my boots are always so uncomfortable!\" Ruby added.<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll just <i>rip</i> off a piece for each of you, and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen screamed when he heard that. \"Ripped in half!?\" he thought, \"I'd rather be whole!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora yanked either side of putty-Ren, grinning wildly as she tried to tear it apart. But much to her dismay, and Ren's glad relief, it refused to tear. So she pulled even harder, stretching Ren thinner and thinner, giving Ren an unimaginable pain measurable to being sat on full force by his curvy, bubbly team mate. But filled again with relief, Nora gave up, keeping him in one, long, spaghetti-like piece.<br>\r\nKneading him back into a more rounded shape, Nora gave up. \"I guess this putty just refuses to split. I'll have to give him to only one of you for now.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, me me me me me!\" Ruby excitedly sung, \"my boots are <b>killing</b> me!\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, whatever Ruby,\" Yang said, \"try having boobs as big as mine, with no store in town selling a large enough size!\" She nudged her bra into Ruby's face to emphasize her point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the bickering Ren had managed to morph back almost recognizably human shaped. He just hoped he could finish before Nora decided who to give him to.<br>\r\n(Spoiler: He doesn't)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe understood both of her friends issues herself. Her boots always has her sore, and whenever she finally wears a bra it's uncomfortable, needing to steal one of Pyrrha's larger-busted ones.

Ruby then stomped her foot down making sure the putty was throughly pressed against her foot then, smiling as she felt the soft substance pressing against her sole \"oooo... you weren't kidding Nora this putty is really soft\" She said happily. On the contrary Ren was the exact opposite upon hearing that Nora was going to give him to one of the two sisters Ren <br>\r\nwas trying even harder to reform not wanting to experience Ruby's feet or Yang breast's unfortunately it wasn't enough as he felt his body being grabbed out of Nora hand then being thrown in Ruby's sock. Ren tried to yell so that one of the girls might hear him but was shutted up as Ruby's foot stomping down on him putting him through much pain. It became worse as Ruby stomped again causing his body to flatten out undoing the progress he had made to try to reform. Up above Ren could hear the three girls taking about something but he couldn't tell what do to crushed by Ruby's foot. Ruby's continued to enjoy the putty stomping down happily unaware of the pain she was causing to her friend. \"Lucky you\" Yang said being a bit upset that Nora didn't choose her to have the putty. Ruby replied saying \"I'll let you have a turn later... Actually I have an idea that is if Nora fine with it\". Interested Nora asked what ruby's idea was yang also being quite intrigued.\"My idea was that we share this putty with eachother taking turns each day for who gets to have it next... of course this is Nora's putty so if she wants to keep it to herself then that's fine Ruby explained\". Nora smiled \"sure we can do that you can keep it for the rest of today then give it to me or yang tomorrow\" Nora replied.Ok then you okay with that Yang\" Ruby asked her sister.\"Yeah that sounds like a good idea\" Yang said back. \"Okay then it's settled I use this putty for the rest of today then I give it to one of you tomorrow\" Ruby said happily. All 3 girls shock has being in agreement after there detention was over they went throughout there day regularly Ruby having a great time with her Ren putty. Ren, meanwhile was stepped on for the entire day by the young girls foot having to suffer the pain off being smushed all day long. Eventually it was time for bed Ruby took her boots off leaving her socks on to keep the putty against her foot for the rest off the night. After telling her teammates goodnight she went off to bed.

Every time she would either be chatting away with friends, doing dangerous missions, or just enjoying herself training. Each and every day she was getting stronger, that was something to be respected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was more of the same though. At least that's what Raven thought as she took flight and landed on a nearby tree branch. She was currently in her bird form as she watched team RWBY through their window. It was open so it was easy to hear all four girls ramble on about... stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat girl in black, Blake, she thought her name was, was mostly keeping out of the conversation. She seemed more interested in her book. Raven could tell the Schnee girl was stressed out from their team leaders bubbliness and was doing her best not to yell. Ruby, the leader was a cheerful as always. She was just like a mini clone of Summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was Yang. She looked so much like her, except she seemed to get her father's color scheme. She was a walking body of energy looking for adventure. She was also the maker of extremely bad puns. She must've gotten that from her father as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA part of her wanted to go talk to her, but decided against it. From what she'd observed of the buxom blonde, she had a very bad temper. She was more likely to hit first and ask questions later. That was something Raven would rather avoid. But maybe one day they'd talk. Maybe?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven jumped down from her perch before returning to her human state. It was starting to storm and she wanted no part of the rain. With a sigh she drew her sword and swiped the air. Before her a crimson gateway opened. It was time to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout lookin back she walked through the portal. When she did she expected to be back at camp. She expected a barren landscape filled with tents, fire, and infighting. Maybe even Vernal kicking a man while he was down? But the last thing she expected was THIS!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer crimson eyes frantically looked around as if expecting an attack, and what she found shook her. She recognized this place. She'd snuck in here a few times when it's residents were out. This was team RWBY's dorm. Only it looked a hell of a lot bigger. Or to be more precise, she'd gotten a hell of a lot smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" Raven whispered. She must be at least an inch or two tall. Three if she was being generous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp above the voices of team RWBY were like thunder. At her size it was like she didn't escape the ensuing thunder outside. Just how had she gotten here in this state? Did her semblance have something to do with this? If so, then maybe it could fix it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried using her portal again only to end up closer to team RWBY, or Yang to be more accurate. And did this dorm just get even bigger all of a sudden? That's when it hit her that she'd just lost an inch. Somehow going through her portal shrunk her. Raven made a mental not to use her semblance again lest she shrink out f existence. She currently dove under a bed for cover as team RWBY's conversation ended. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven watched as It appeared all the girl's were splitting up. Yang looked like she'd be staying for a while. As the rest of team Ruby appeared to be leaving, Raven was left with quite a dilemma. She needed help, as loath as she was to admit it. She could either try and get it from Yang, but that had it's fair share of cons. Or she could try asking one of her teammates for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was she going to do...?</span></div></div>",

It looked like one of the dorm bathrooms.<br>\r\n\"Calm down! Perhaps I slept in the bathroom? That can happen- right?\" Jaune swallowed, not fully grasping the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of waiting, a door creaked open, light flooded the room making the tiny leader squint slightly. He noted down that he couldn't close his eyes, although he felt no need to blink. A tired looking figure yawned as it stumbled into view, Jaune almost immediately sighed with relief as none other then Ruby shuffled into his view. He tried to call out to the sleepy leader, her bed head clearly showing as she dumped her towel and clothes on the floor, \"Ruby! I was wondering what happened- did I sleep in your bathroom? What's up with that? Haha-!\" Jaune nervously tried to communicate, yet he felt something was wrong. Little red looked huge from this perspective, her eyes stared directly at little Jaune without surprise or greeting. Her huge hand lazily reached out to him, causing him to yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill unsure what was going on, the once blonde haired leader of JNPR was lifted up with ease by the leader of RWBY, her iron tight grip squeezing him heavily as he questioned what was going on once more. A mirror filled his vision, showing a tired Ruby awkwardly biting off the top to her toothpaste. Jaune gazed blankly at the hand that held him, yet all he saw was a frayed toothbrush. Slowly putting two and two together as the tube of toothpaste approached him, he struggled harder then ever to move, yet his toothbrush body refused to move. It wasn't long before Ruby covered his face with minty toothpaste, filling his tastebuds to the brim as he dreaded what would happen next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light he had slowly dimmed as he suddenly hit a warm wet surface, Ruby's hard molars bit down on him as she rinsed a bit of toothpaste that fell off. Jaune winced as Ruby's morning breath wafted through the mint.<br>\r\n\"Ru-\" He yelled, before suddenly getting yanked through pursed lips. His body used to clean the back of each tooth roughly and quickly, in the darkness and foam, Jaune felt like he was in an earth quake before he popped out, trying weakly again to communicate as he tried to recover. \"R-\" He started, before Ruby bared her teeth once more, opening her mouth to jam him in, scrapping across the top to remove the gunk, occasionally biting on his body before retreating. He didn't even bother trying to communicate as she shut her mouth, foam from his rough housing dribbled down to her chin as she mashed the little brush boy against the front of her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune felt battered and bruised as he was laid out onto the sinks counter top, he watched with stunned awe as the hyperactive, yet innocent, leader rinsed her mouth out with water, spitting it out into the sink before reaching out for him again. He whined softly as he was brought back into her minty mouth for one last scrubdown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack of the teeth, across the top, rubbed up and down her sudded taste-buds before being grinded across her grinning teeth once more. As she set him down on the counter again, he hoped she was done with him, watching her rinse her mouth out a few times before thankfully putting the toothbrush into a cup. He was too battered to even notice her turn on the shower as he dizzily tried to recover from Ruby's tongue lashing and embarrassment of being used.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt a slight queezy feeling, like his soul was leaping out of his body. As his vision returned, he slowly registered his new surroundings- he'd turned into-</span></div></div>",

The blonde haired boy winced as he saw the normally clean freak girl dump a handful of wetwipes into the bin, he guessed that she didn't want to be late or unclean. He also guessed that fate had chosen this day for him to be one of her items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe swallowed as hard as a sock could swallow as she sat down next to him, her face cringing as she felt her toes slide against each other. Without any wet wipes left and with time ticking on she mentally swore as the ice queen of the school roughly grabbed Jaunes paralized body. It didn't take long for the complaining Jaune to work out what he was as he saw his partner get swiftly jammed onto Weiss's left foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small leader whimpered as Weiss hardly glanced down, her unwashed foot swiftly entered into him, wiggling down his sock body.<br>\r\n\"W-weiss-!\" He tried to call out once more as she tugged him tight. Her uncaring eyes wincing as she slowly brought a finger down, idly rubbing his body between her toes, mouthing 'gross' every now and then before remembering the time. Jaune could only whine as the petite girl slammed him into the ground, grinding him down with each step before the lighting changed. Giving up yelling, the tiny sock accepted his fate at the feet of one of his friends as she ram rodded him into her boot. Her cold and clammy foot slowly warmed up as it wriggled yesterdays sock lint into her new socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss stomped down her heel just as the shower turned off, She shot the door to the shower a dirty look before opening the front door- <br>\r\n\"It's 8:54\" She called through, smiling as she heard Ruby crashing around the bathroom before leaving herself. She swiftly shut the door behind her before matching off at a quickened pace, listening to her heels crack on the tiled floors as she briskly walked to lessons, Unaware of the torment she was putting her sock through as it soaked up a day and a nights worth of sweat. Weiss sighed, regretting skipping her evening shower for sleep, but glad she found the pack of wet wipes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe arrived just in time to class, taking her regular seat near to the front as she prepared for her lesson. Her long toes idly curling and pinching at the worn down sock as the lesson started to begin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until later that the sock was to be removed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune felt his body giving up, the abusive toes constantly gripped and pulled at his nose and tongue as his unaware tormentor enjoyed her lessons. The cold feet had slowly heated up durning the day as it flossed him thoroughly between each toe, even when they stopped pinching him he could feel the tiny pieces of  lint she had managed to grind down lodged between her toes. After hours of tapping, clenching, wiggling and stomping in the cramped prison of Weiss's boot he realized they had reached the time he had been dreading. Her foot firmly planted it self on his body as she got ready to fight her opponent in a training session. She was merciless- stomping twisting and running to finish the match as fast as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss panted, a bead of sweat dribbling down her forhead as her opponent surrendered. She smiled, giving a small bow as the bell rang out once more. The young dust user almost ran as everyone made their way to the locker rooms to get cleaned up. Her grin widened as she slipped into the showerroom first, her mind set being 'first in last out'. Happy to be alone, she quickly yanked off her boots, <br>\r\n\"I've got to get up before Ruby-\" She winced, noticing the outine of her toes from the sweat on the light blue sock, not noticing her abused sock gasping for air and feebly escape from her filthy foot, Weiss quickly yanked off the rest of her clothes, subconciously procrastinating releasing her foot from her sock last as she hurried to get into the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune couldn't complain, he had finally escaped the old boot, his mind and body too worn out to care about the changing girl ontop of him as she hopped out of clothes and made her way towards the showers. Her fingers slowly peeled him away from the sweaty foot just as the noise of chattering girls drifted into the locker room. Jaune didn't care too much until the rushing Weiss flung him into the middle of the floor as she hurried to get to the shower.<br>\r\n\"Wait! Weiss!\" Jaune tried to yell, but it was pointless. He could already feel her scrubbing off the lint that had once been apart of him. A shudder ran down his spine as the door opened, the crowd of girls wandered towards his crumpled body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven no time to think as some of them started to take their boots off, his mind went blank as he glanced up at Coco's sunglasses before her plump bare foot landed ontop of him, her heavy weight grounding down on his frilly body before kicking off. Not given time to recover, a long white socked foot was quick to replace it, kicking him back slightly across the tiled floor. He just barely saw the previous girls bunny ears before a nylon clad foot covered him. The skirt of Ruby fluttered over head as she bore down into him, <br>\r\n\"R-Ruby-\" Jaune attempted, before Yangs boots decimated his attempts at speech. He was put through turmoil as Blakes bare foot replaced that. The rest of the crowd piled in, completely trampling the poor sock into the ground, he occasionally managed to spot someone he recognised like Emerald and her team before they too hopped ontop of him without thought, Cinders heels finally making him give up hope of escaping the constant trampling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowed slowly died down as everyone made there way into the showers. Jaune couldn't even admire the sight as his flattened body lay still infront of the door in pain. He managed a small groan as he heard the door opening once more for another stomping.<br>\r\n\"Wow- when did we get a foot rag?\" Nora's chirpy voice buzzed in, her boots and socks slipping off ungracefully as she bounded over to Jaune. Without pause, she quickly stepped down, wiping her feet harshly against the poor socks body with glee before Pyrrha and Ruby stopped her,<br>\r\n\"I don't think the school would invest in that-\" Ruby smilled, the sock on the ground radiated joy as Pyrrha picked him up away from her hyper team mate. After a quick glance, she dropped the sock off on Weiss's bench,<br>\r\n\"Sorry Weiss-\" She spoke softly, leaving the sock rest.</span></div></div>",

A part of him was still hoping that this was all just some crazy and scarily realistic feeling dream. Or maybe he\u2019d gotten hit in the head during training and this was all just the result of a concussion. In truth, he\u2019d take waking up in the infirmary, again, over\u2026 this any day of the week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut of course it wasn\u2019t to be, and he found himself once against looking at the same scene as before, though admittedly from a notably different angle. His new body now hung from a small hook on the rear wall of the locker room, giving him a perfect view of the surrounding students in varying states of dress and the shower beyond. If the circumstances were different, he may even have enjoyed it somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune could more or less feel that he was still mostly two-dimensional, but couldn\u2019t see the exact form he had taken. The cotton and fuzz of his abused sock body had been exchanged for the pliable and absorbent texture of an all-purpose rag, the shape of his body now a flat square of cloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn\u2019t see it, but the shadow above him could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trapped knight had very little time to take in his new situation as the encroaching shadow fell further across him. His senses appeared to be focused somewhere near the \u2018front\u2019 of the rag but from his low angle he couldn\u2019t make out the face of his visitor, nor could he do anything to stop her slender fingers closing around him and removing him from his place on the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTugged off the hook, Jaune was allowed to flop listlessly against the side of his newfound capture as they turned and headed back towards the changing area, or the showers beyond. He still couldn\u2019t see their face, but as they advanced he heard his capture\u2019s voice booming around him, declaring that whatever he was, he was just what they had been looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe\u2019d recognise that voice anywhere, but what was she going to use him for?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jaune looked up in confusion as he was raised and hung from a small hook in one of the showers, finding himself now nearly face to face with his partner, the tall redhead looking down at him with the small smile he was used to receiving on a daily basis. But that look that usually brought him comfort now filled him with dread, as Pyrrha turned on the shower and reached to grab the soap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaware of Jaune\u2019s plight, Pyrrha was just glad she\u2019d managed to find a spare shower cloth, or close enough. For whatever reason there seemed to be precious few available in the locker room today, and she always preferred to have one to clean out the hard to reach places of her body. Hanging her find from the nearest hook, she flicked on the shower and quickly began lathering herself up with soap, unintentionally giving her partner the show of his life as she ran her hands all over her body, making sure to lather herself thoroughly before reaching for the unfortunate rag once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was nothing Jaune could do as he was grabbed by his partner, her wet hands feeling ice cold against his \u2018skin\u2019 as the water literally soaked into him. Before he even had time to brace himself the part of the rag most closely linked to his face was pushed up against Pyrrha\u2019s abs and his senses were instantly filed with the acidic taste of the soap covering the girl\u2019s skin, together with the accumulated sweat and grime from a long day of classes and battles. His body was quickly moved across the redhead\u2019s abdomen and sides, around her back and up and down each arm and leg, picking up more and more soap and grime as it soaked deep into his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Jaune, he soon found that cleaning his partner\u2019s extremities was the least of his problems, as Pyrrha lifted an arm and mercilessly ground his \u2018face\u2019 against the days\u2019 worth of filth that had accumulated within her armpit. An overwhelming quantity of sweat, and a healthy dose of acidic soap, poured into his body as he was vigorously rubbed into the grimy flesh. He\u2019d known the girl could work up quite a sweat during practice but he\u2019d never really had to face the consequences of it like this, as the redhead was good at making sure to clean up after practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, no sooner was he freed from one hell then he was plunged deep into another, as Pyrrha casually moved him from one pit and rubbed him just as vigorously into the other. For Jaune it felt like things couldn\u2019t get any worse, though deep down he knew this was far from done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Pyrrha there was no reason to pay any more attention to this particular rag than she would any other, which was to say no attention at all. Finishing with her armpits to her own satisfaction, she took a moment to squeeze out the excess soap and grime from the cloth before lowering it her feet, quickly cleaning the soles before taking her time to clean between each toe. Excessive perhaps, but she was nothing if not fastidious when it came to showering. After all, she wouldn\u2019t want to subject any of her teammates to her lingering foot stench, least of all her partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was difficult for Jaune to determine what was worse, the pain of being wrung out, like his body was being pulled in every direction at once while simultaneously being crushed together, or the thick layer of toe jam that had now joined the sweat and grime already soaked into his body. Where before he had mostly felt unpleasantly wet, now there was a distinctly sticky feeling to his skin, like he\u2019d taken a long bath in cooking oil, or some similarly viscous fluid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA further wringing followed as the unfortunate knight was lifted away from the amazon\u2019s feet, though rather than freeing him from the accumulated grime, this time the effect was more to force the toe jam and other material deeper into his body, filling up the gaps in the fabric. If he had still had the ability Jaune was sure he would have vomited up the entire contents of his stomach at that moment, but all he could do was scream internally as the merciless redhead brought him around to face her substantial rear, thoughtlessly grinding him against the fleshy cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing the fabric deep into the flesh of her ass, Pyrrha hummed happily to herself as she gave herself a thorough cleaning. Though it was probably just her imagination she allowed herself a brief fantasy that there was something different about this cloth. That it was somehow special and meant just for her. Destined to clean every last inch of her body for the rest of her life. Becoming slightly lost in the fantasy, Pyrrha allowed her cleaning to deviate slightly from the norm and began running her partner\u2019s helpless form across first the exterior of her crack, and then slightly within it, cleaning the outer areas and soaking up the near-constant thin sheen of sweat within her buttocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he thought he wanted to vomit before then Jaune wasn\u2019t sure how to describe just what he was feeling now, his senses utterly consumed with the taste and smell of his partner\u2019s butt sweat, so much so that he barely noticed as he was moved once again and brought face-to-face with Pyrrha\u2019s prominent chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing to hum, Pyrrha took her time running the small cloth over her chest, lifting and cleaning beneath each breast and deep into her cleavage. All the while the amazonian beauty continued to lose herself in her fantasy, imagining that the there was something special about the cloth, or that Jaune himself was touching her like this. She didn\u2019t even notice that she had spent far more time cleaning her torso than necessary until a sudden stimulation brought her eyes snapping down, and she realised that she had been grinding the cloth into her hardening nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiting her lip, Pyrrha\u2026</span></div></div>",

Turning the shower on harder, she quickly washed off the remaining suds and turned to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only when she reached for a towel that the redhead realised that she was still holding the cloth that she had just been rubbing so roughly against her body, the blush in her cheeks rising to match the colour of her hair as she bit her lip. A part of her thought it best to get rid of this thing before she lost herself completely, but the rest of her just couldn\u2019t stand to let it go. Though she had no idea what its true nature was, she knew somehow that this seemingly normal rag was special. Nothing before had ever felt so good against her naked form. It just had to be hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrapping a towel tightly around her body, Pyrrha gave one more furtive look to her surroundings before biting the bullet and stuffing her new toy deep into her cleavage, pushing it completely out of sight as she strode out into the changing rooms. Even just the minor movement of her chest was enough to rub the cloth between her breasts, stimulating her enough to need to supress a moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever while Pyrrha was in heaven, Jaune was in hell. His brief period of relief as the redhead dried herself ended the moment she plunged him between her still mildly moist boobs. The filthy rag that had become his body was defenceless against the shifting orbs that now surrounded him, the already flat cloth crushed further within his partner\u2019s massive bosom. Lost in darkness, he could do nothing but stew in the smells and tastes that had been absorbed into his body, practically baking in the heat of Pyrrha\u2019s body as the massive goddess above controlled his fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith just the force of the towel holding them together the pressure of the amazonian\u2019s firm breasts had already been truly intense, but for Jaune a brief lessening of the force as the towel was removed was quickly replaced with a pressure unlike anything he had experienced so far as Pyrrha donned a bra that was far too small for her substantial assets. To the transformed blonde\u2019s great misfortune, his partner was the kind of girl who saw her prominent chest as more of a burden than an asset, something that got in the way of her natural combat abilities, bouncing around at best and throwing her off balance at worst. To counteract those problems as best she could, the redhead had taken to wearing a well-reinforced bra that was a couple of sizes too small, dealing with the pain in order to maximise her combat utility. Although she wasn\u2019t expecting to go into combat any time soon, she kept it up to ensure that her body was properly acclimatised to the uncomfortable situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven so, as Pyrrha quickly pulled on the rest of her casual outfit and headed out of the showers and towards the dorms her boobs still had enough room to rhythmically squish together, rolling around their prisoner with the apparent intent of squeezing every last drop of moisture from Jaune\u2019s tortured body. The darkness from before had become all the deeper as the outer layer of clothing cut off the light, and if the heat from before had felt like an oven, the unfortunate knight now felt like he had been plunged into a furnace, his ragged body practically adhering itself to the warm flesh. The scent of his partner surrounded him from all angles, seeping into him and filling him completely. It felt like both his body and his mind were being imprinted, like she was making him hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill oblivious to Jaune\u2019s fate, Pyrrha allowed a small smile to cross her face as she continued towards the dorms, almost shuddering at the lingering feeling of the thoroughly squished cloth. She\u2019d managed to control her blush by now, though she still felt lingering embarrassment over her earlier actions and couldn\u2019t bring herself to remove the rag quite yet, worried that if she did she wouldn\u2019t be able to resist the temptation to put it to further \u2018use\u2019. A part of her was concerned that someone was going to notice her actions, that she\u2019d get in trouble for stealing school property, but she figured the cloth was just one among many, and that it wouldn\u2019t be any great loss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Pyrrha dwelled on her acquisition the dorm of Team JNPR drew closer and closer, and along with it a potential new future for Jaune. But does the transformed team leader stay as a cloth, possibly forever, or do the fates see fit to change him once again before he can meet that fate?</span></div></div>",

The strong scent of her body had now soaked deeply into his form, mixing with the engrained sweat of her body, marking him distinctly as the personal property of Pyrrha Nikos. Whether or not whatever had cursed him to this fate recognised such things Jaune didn\u2019t know, but it seemed he was remaining put for now, left to whatever intentions his oblivious teammate had for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTired after a long day of intense study and exercise, Pyrrha wasted no time falling face first onto her bed with a long sigh, squirming slightly as she burrowed her breasts deep into the soft surface of the mattress. Wanting to get as comfortable as possible she reached back and unclipped her bra and the unfortunate Jaune was crushed all the more as the redhead\u2019s chest flattened beneath her, the warm flesh struggling to fill every available inch of space and trapping him in-between. If his partner felt anything at all it was only the pleasant sensation of his cloth-body tickling her assets, and her only response was to press down harder as she rubbed herself slightly against the sheets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat started as minor squirming evolved into Pyrrha full-on dragging her breasts along the bed, her hardening nipples sliding along the inner linings of her unhooked bra as she starting to bring herself back towards the heights she had achieved in the shower. That thought however was enough to bring her mind back to her passenger and she paused to reach in and retrieve her team leader from his personal hell. The redhead didn\u2019t bother to raise herself up first, so the process involved Jaune being dragged out slowly across the flesh of her breasts, until he finally came free with a wet slurp. Whereas it felt pleasurable for Pyrrha, for her tortured friend it was just another round of being dragged across a wall of flesh that saturated its heat, sweat and scent deep into his form as he passed, as if it didn\u2019t want him to leave without taking with him something to remember it by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Jaune had fully emerged he had been broken enough that a part of him wanted to go back, actually missed the sensation of being trapped between his partner\u2019s boobs. The soft smile that Pyrrha spared for him didn\u2019t help, almost making it seem like she knew who he was, even if he knew she didn\u2019t. The soft tenderness with which he was laid out on the bed was in sharp contrast to his treatment so far, like being touched by an angel that hid a devil underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor several long minutes Jaune was given the chance to regain his sense of self as Pyrrha rested calmly beside him, her soft breaths fluttering his body as she drifted into a relaxed state. Yet all of his senses remained directed towards the redhead, and it was becoming increasingly difficult for him to visualise himself as anything other than a rag that existed to serve to this goddess\u2019s ever need. So it was that as she shifted onto her back and reached towards him, he didn\u2019t even want to resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching out to grab her little wash cloth, Pyrrha began to almost absentmindedly rub it across her neck and shoulders, enjoying the feeling of the cool fabric running along her skin. She noted with some interest that it had managed to dry out completely since she\u2019d stored it in her cleavage, all of her sweat and grime from earlier, as well as the soap, having been absorbed deep into its form. The tall beauty felt a small jolt of electricity wherever the cloth touched, nearly cooing as she pulled her shirt up slightly and began to run her leader slowly over her abdominals, tracing every line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis slow and intimate approach was doing nothing to help Jaune regain his bearings. Even through his inhuman body he could still feel himself becoming increasingly aroused at the contact, able to feel every inch of Pyrrha\u2019s toned flesh as he was gently run across it. He\u2019d known from the start that the redhead had an excellent figure, but never in a million years had he thought he\u2019d ever get to experience it like this, and though it wasn\u2019t what he would have wanted, it wasn\u2019t really that bad. So maybe in the end, if he did stay like this forever, he could maybe deal with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she was unable to read her partner\u2019s thoughts, and still had no idea of his fate, Pyrrha would have to agree that it would be just fine for things to stay this way forever. The feeling of the cloth against her skin was exhilarating, perhaps in part just because she wanted to be, or perhaps because some part of her somehow knew what it really was. Whatever the case she bit her lip as she moved the rag slightly lower towards the hemline of her shorts, contemplating a moment before\u2026</span></div></div>",

All he could tell was that his nose was invaded by a god awful stench. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe soon got his answer as he heard the muffled voice of Glynda. Horror flooded over him as he soon realized that he was now her thong with his face positioned right in front of her asshole. Glynda, unaware of Jaunes new form, continued teaching while pacing back and forth causing Jaunes face to be pulled deeper and deeper into the abyss of her asscrack. Jaune tried to scream for help but it was all in vain since his cries for help were muffled by Glyndas well endowed rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknowingly Jaune only made things worse for himself, the second he opened his mouth it was filled with the foul tasting flesh of Glynda\u2019s asshole. If things weren\u2019t already bad enough, Jaune heard and felt a rumble coming from her stomach. Glynda not wanting to fart in the middle of class decided to hold it. Unknowingly making things even worse for Jaune. The gas in Glynda\u2019s stomach started to painfully build up. Realizing there was still half of the class to go, Glynda slowly started to let loose as quietly as she could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">Pfffffffffffffffff</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaunes senses were assaulted by the vomit inducing stench that was being expelled from her ass. Noticing that there was no sound or smell, Glynda continued. Due to not wanting to be caught off guard by a loud one, she prolonged the expulsion of her flatulence, unknowingly making Jaunes torture even worse as he was forced to bear the unusual torment. Jaune was in hell as he was trapped face first in her asshole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like ages, Glynda finally finished farting and the bell rang signaling the end of class.</span></div></div>",

He was forcefully dragged up and down her haphazardly shaved armpits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like ages, Jaune was removed from her armpit, wasting little time she quickly started working on the other armpit. Jaune was in hell, his mind raced as the taste and stench of the sweat embedded itself in his mouth and nose. Cinder then continued to methodically use Jaune\u2019s new form across her body. Jaune\u2019s mouth was flooded with what seems to be oceans of sweat as she slowly dried off her sweaty chest. Due to his new size, Cinder\u2019s breast seemed be the size of mountains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Cinder moved onto the part of her body Jaune dreaded the most, between her legs. Jaunes vision was filled by the ominous sight of Cinder\u2019s bare crotch. Jaune was then introduced to new, unimaginable stench as Cinder used him as butt floss for 5 minutes. During Cinder\u2019s thorough cleaning off her ass, Jaune was unable to do anything but smell and taste the awful aftermath of her intense workout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCinder then moved onto her feet.

Unfortunately for Jaune though, Yang was much more rough with him. He was plunged face first into Yangs rancid armpit and was ground into it. Yang was somehow more through than Cinder and made sure that there was not one drop off sweat was left when she was done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis meant that Jaune had to drink rivers of sweat. The sweat from both Cinder and Yang mixed together and made it taste and smell 100x worse. If Jaune still had a stomach, it would have ruptured from all the sweat he was forced to drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the first armpit, Yang brought Jaune over to her other armpit. Jaune could taste even more of Yangs armpit sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he was unawarely being tortured, a line of very sweaty girls was forming due to all the showers being unfortunately broken. Yang noticed and got a move on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang forcefully made Jaune give her a colossal and sweaty motorboat. What seemed like endless amounts of sweat assaulted Jaune\u2019s senses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang then moved onto the worst part of her body, between her legs. Unfortunately for Jaune, Yang loves her pubic hair as much as the hair on her head. Yang quickly but throughly used Jaune as butt/pussy floss. His face was forced into Yangs jungle of pubic hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune was introduced to a new level of torture as she mercilessly dragged Jaunes face across her pussy lips and asscheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang then finished off her turn of torturing Jaune by using him to clean her giant sweaty feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Yang was finished, she passed Jaune to the next girl/girls.</span></div></div>",

Still unable to call out, he tried to calmly call out to Ruby once more,<br>\r\n\"Ruby?\" He timmidly asked, the faint sound of music and banging thudded on nearby his prison as he assessed the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing that covered him seemed to be a bed-sheet, yet the floor was definitely carpeted rather then an actual bed. This definitely wasn't the bathroom anymore, he wasn't even sure whose room he was in. Finding it pointless, he listened into the music, realising someone was softly singing along as the thud of footsteps got closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout much warning, a tanned foot kicked away the bedsheets,<br>\r\n\"There's a point where it tips there's a point where it breaks-\" Emerald sang, her bare toes picking up Jaunes stunned body, tossing him up to her hand. She hummed slightly, not remembering all the words as she held the tiny Jaune towards her naked chest.<br>\r\n\"What-\" Jaune stuttered, gawping at the half dressed girl infront of him. The girls green hair hovered over his helpless form before pushing him into her boobs, shattering any thought process the transformed Jaune had as he felt himself forced to hug the girls enormous rack. With a small click and reajustment, she let her full weight fall on a rather stunned Jaune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand brushed her hair through Jaunes straps before checking herself in the mirror.<br>\r\n\"Looking good-\" She winked to herself, picking up a top from the floor. Jaunes tight grip on her boobs strained as she let them rest on him, shaking about as she tried to toss clothes from the floor into her laundry basket in time to the music.<br>\r\n\"S-sto-stop!\" Jaune spluttered, unable to communicate to his owner as he bobbed along uncontrollably. Emerald didn't even give him a chance to work out exactly what was going on, she demonstraighted it the hard way as she hopped around her room in an attempt to clean up.<br>\r\n\"Almost done Ember?\" Another girl entered the room, her heels clicking as she transfered from wood to carpet.<br>\r\n\"Almost!\" Ember called, sniffing another shirt. Her rapid movements stopped briefly, letting her breasts bounce to a standstill as she lifted her arms. Having a quick glance at Cinders crackling gaze he was soon covered by light armor and straps, crammed into crevices to remain out of sight. He gasped at the sudden increase in heat before he heard his owner chip out confirmation of being done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to do anything but support the gun wielder's bouncing boobs, Jaune quickly worked out that he was a bra. Not only that, but an outgrown bra that Emerald refused to throw away just yet. The heavy weight bobbed ontop of him, stretching his body harshly with just a few steps, it was nothing compared to the torment that happened earlier. He heard the radio switch off before the bobbling increased in ferocity, the girl using him must of ran to keep up with her friends-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater in the day, Emerald was finally unclipping her bra. Sweat dripped down from her face as she panted a few curses,<br>\r\n\"I didn't expect training to be that intense-\" She muttered, taking a deep breath. Jaune was too weakened to celebrate his freedom, flopping onto the bench with the rest of Emeralds sweaty clothes as he recovered from the day. His battered body zoned out as he watched the bare breast that crushed him all day bounce away on their own, straight into the locker room showers. He had a quick break, ignoring the smell coming from him and the other clothes as he rested. He felt himself drifting away, his vision faded as he felt his strength slowly return.

He tried to get a grasp of his surroundings as he lay down, he mentaly sighed as all he managed to gather was that he was between two beds on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before the shower stopped, The tiny blonde shuddered as silence entered the room, his eyes darted around as he heard the door open up. A strange girl that he kind of recognised from somewhere came into his vision wrapped up into a towel- her bright golden orange eyes burned in her slight smeark as she sat down on her bed. Jaune gazed in awe as the bare feet infront of him crossed regally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Jaune gazed up at the new arrival- he failed to notice his previous tormenter on the other bed- her voice sounded slightly annoyed as she spoke,<br>\r\n\"How long do I have to be friends with them? They're like- so happy- all the time! I can't stand it-\" Emerald sighed, her bed springs bounced as she slammed her head down. Jaune shuddered as memories from earlier flooded back. The methodical girl from before easily calmed her down with her voice- vaguely talking about plans for after the Vytal festival. Jaune had stopped paying attention at this point, focusing on freeing himself before he was used again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe soon realised how pointless his struggling was as a pale hand swiftly picked up his form. He shuddered as the giant black haired girls eyes pierced through him before looking away. Jaune's mind clicked into place as he remembered someone mentioning her name as Cinder, a girl on Emeralds team. He was given a second to see the complex chinese designs on her long upper sleepware before he was dropped to the floor and stomped on by the cruel goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Cinder- she had simpley stepped onto her underware, hooking her cold toes through the leg holes as she calculated the next day. She reached down gracefully for the terrified Jaune, swifly pulling him up her smooth legs without caring for his safety. Her smoldering eyes looked onwards as she thought about how close she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune tried to yell out as he slid up her legs, his body contorting to their shape as he quickly realised he was this girls underwear.

Cinder's backside was perfectly clean, which Jaune thanked the heavens for. That is, until, Cinder began to shuffle her rear end around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe supple butt cheeks chewed up Jaune's fabric form as he felt his body slide deeper and deeper into Cinder.

They were on and they were straight, so there was no reason for her to spare a thought for the unfortunate fabric. As she spoke with Emerald however, her restlessness over the plan caused her to shuffle her posterior across the bed, a minor movement that allowed her an outlet but was hidden from outside eyes. Unfortunately, the result of that movement was that she now found her panties progressively more bunched up, to the extent that it was really starting to irritate the sensitive flesh of her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs calculating an individual as she was, Cinder still preferred simple long-term solutions to most problems. She could fix the panties, stretching the thin fabric over her generous rear once more, but then she\u2019d just find herself with the same problem the next time she sat down, or even just as a result of the usual sway to her hips as she walked. So instead she simply reached back and casually pushed the fingers of her right hand between her cheeks, forcing her panties into the grip of her cheeks before grabbing the band and tugging up, plunging the majority of her underwear into the dark abyss. Now she wouldn\u2019t have to worry about fixing them again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the shadow of Cinder\u2019s hand had fallen over him, Jaune had hoped he would be saved, but instead he found most of his body forced deep between her cheeks. The brunette may have been clean but Jaune still found himself surrounding by the musky scent of her rear and the overwhelming pressure of her ass flesh pressing in on him from all sides. All he could see was darkness and all he could hear from here was the distant gurgling noises of his captor\u2019s gut and the steady beat of her heart thrumming through her veins. For a few moments the pressure on one side increased and then the other, as outside of his prison Cinder lifted her legs and slipped into her black pants. His prison jiggled as the older girl hopped in place for a moment to get the tight fabric up her legs and over her hips, and though he couldn\u2019t see what had happened Jaune had a pretty good idea from the way the pressure on all sides noticeably increased and stayed that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside, Cinder quickly finished donning the rest of her outfit and slipped her feet into her shoes, taking a moment to admire the way the heels lifted and tightened her already firm ass before casually heading out the door to continue her plans for the destruction of Beacon. As always she walked with a sway to her hips, her firm cheeks sliding against each other as she stalked down the academy\u2019s hallways, unknowingly chewing on Beacon\u2019s least fortunate student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn this particular morning, the traitorous girl was in no hurry to reach her destination and Jaune was subjected to countless steps and sways, feeling like his fabric body was going to be torn apart by the constant grinding of Cinder\u2019s unforgiving cheeks. Simply by walking her panties were pulled tight against first one cheek and then the other, all the while being rubbed back and forth across the inside of her crack, smearing what was essentially Jaune\u2019s face all over her back entrance. If he could he would have cried out, squirmed, done anything to avoid yet another day of unknowing use, but all he could was hope and pray that he would soon be released from this torment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the tomb of her rear, Jaune could do nothing as Cinder\u2026</span></div></div>",

Today she and the rest of her team had been called to engage in some sparring with a number of other visiting and local teams, apparently as part of their ongoing training and preparation for the upcoming tournament. For the villainous team it was a good opportunity to scout out any potential threats from among the student body, so that they could be more effectively dealt with when the time to strike came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoting the rest of her team had already arrived, Cinder warmed up with some quick stretches while waiting for Goodwitch to announce the first matchup. Bending to touch her toes she didn\u2019t pay attention to the way her underwear pulled taunt against the inner lining of her crack, nor to the way it was pulled tight against her cheeks as she stretched her legs up above her head one at a time. She was aware that she\u2019d torn panties before with these sorts of movements but it was hardly a matter of concern. If they broke she\u2019d just get some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune of course was far more concerned with the fate of this particular pair of panties. He\u2019d been pulled taunt before when Cinder had struggled her way into her pants, but the pressure he experienced when she touched her toes was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before, and for a few terrifying seconds he was absolutely sure he was about to be torn in half. Then after she straightened he was subjected to yet more agony as she stretched her legs. Somehow even through his cloth body he was still able to feel pain and the strain of being stretched across Cinder\u2019s curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of a throat being cleared had Cinder standing up straight again and moving her eyes to Goodwitch, who checked her clipboard and announced the first fight. Much to the sinister girl\u2019s pleasure she herself had been chosen for the battle and would be fighting a darker-skinned student from Haven, another team leader by the name of Arslan. She strode confidentially into the arena, choosing to face off against this challenger with her bare hands and feet rather than reveal the full extent of her abilities, and waited for the starting signal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Jaune he experienced a few brief moments of relative peace before he dimly heard the sound of a distant chime and then everything around him exploded into hellish movement. When Cinder had been walking the grinding had been incessant but manageable, but now she was sprinting around the arena and her booty was shifting so violently that Jaune felt like he was being pulled in every direction at once. One second she\u2019d be in full stride, pulling him tight against her cheeks, the next her glutes would clench down around him as she tensed her thighs and leapt into the air. For half a second the transformed student experienced a sense of weightlessness before he was pulled violently against his captor\u2019s right cheek as she spun her body into a powerful spin kick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shockwave travelled up Cinder\u2019s leg as it connected with Arslan\u2019s hastily raised arm, a vibration that travelled quickly to her ass and pounded Jaune between her jiggling cheeks. In the next moment she brought both legs down and landed heavily, her legs and hips absorbing the impact and bringing her buttocks slamming together with tremendous force from the rebound, smearing the trapped knight between them with the greatest force yet. Almost instantaneously she was on the move again, and Jaune\u2019s torment continued in a never ending barrage of grinding, shifting, crushing, jiggling and bouncing buttocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if that wasn\u2019t enough, sweat was starting to leak out from Cinder\u2019s pores, the foul smelling liquid spreading across her cheeks as Jaune\u2019s tortured body was rubbed against them. He could feel his body literally soaking up the sweat as he was dragged across it, and worse yet he could taste it. He no longer had a mouth yet he felt as if someone was pouring gallons of sweat down his throat, the taste staying with him as the sweat accumulated in his body. The smell and the heat too were becoming more intense, the combination of copious sweat and general exertion coating the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis torture continued for several minutes before, with a final blow to her opponent\u2019s chin, Cinder dropped Arslan\u2019s aura into the red and was declared the winner of the round. Satisfied with the battle, the villainess calmly descended the stage, waving off Emerald when she offered assistance and taking a seat as she waited for her name to be called again. She was aware of the now sweat-soaked panties still lodged deep in her ass but she gave them no mind, other than to briefly grind her butt down into the seat below to ensure she was as comfortable as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill buried deep within his captor\u2019s posterior, Jaune could do nothing but try to enjoy the respite from his previous predicament, even though he was still soaked in sweat and surrounded by Cinder\u2019s now unpleasantly moist and sticky buttocks. Some small part of him had hoped that this would be the moment she would finally pull her wedgie, but unfortunately for him it was not to be, and all he received in response to his hopes was to be ground back into that sweaty flesh as the brunette shifted around to get comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter around twenty minutes of watching fights for Cinder, and twenty minutes of trying to pretend he was anywhere else for Jaune, Goodwitch announced that they were going to start fights between pairs. Once again Cinder was going to be up first, this time together with Neo (or Noir as far as anyone here was concerned) and would be taking on Coco and Velvet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut is Jaune going to be coming along for the ride this time, and what will happen to him if he does?</span></div></div>",

The cat girl slinked out of the room without arousing suspicion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- can't- believe-\" Weiss panted, exausted from her rant she gazed into Ruby's puppy dog eyes before turning away with a growl. \"You have to pay for it-\" Weiss huffed- waiting for a response from Ruby. All she got was a gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around she saw Ruby holding onto her skirt, she looked like she was trying to pull it but there was no force.<br>\r\n\"Ruby?\" Weiss frowned, unsure what she was doing,<br>\r\n\"It's- pulling me-!\" Ruby whimpered, her body slowly shrinking before being absorbed. by the fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter initial shock and a change of clothes, Ruby thankfully returned a few inches in height. Her two friends frowned at the new height-<br>\r\n\"Weiss- what's happening?\" Yang started, unsure if she should touch her little sister,<br>\r\n\"I- don't know- the dust was experimental-\" Weiss stuttered, \"It must of mixed with something in the bucket- but- this is just-\" She bit her lip, watching the micro melt into the floor before pulling herself out again. \"Weird...\".<br>\r\n\"So- what now?\" Ruby called out, hoping up and down to prevent herself getting stuck. The two giantess frowned at the strange sight,<br>\r\n\"It should wear off when the dust dissipates from your body- dust can be relatively safe to test side effects as long as it's not explosive\" Weiss sighed, \"There's nothing that could cause explosions or anything like that... it was approved for human testing but some reactions to other dust could cause... small side effects...\" The tiny girl slowed as she seemed to learn how to stop herself from being absorbed. She shuddered at the thought of being so small at this size.<br>\r\n\"For now- you should probably just hide or something in an empty draw- then we'll know where you are if you get 'absorbed'\" Yang nodded knowingly, noticing the wood like texture on Ruby's legs as focused slipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby pouted from her box prison- Yang and Weiss appologeticly waving up above-<br>\r\n\"Serves you right for trying to prank your truly\" Weiss chuckled, \"You'll be fine, when it wears out you should grow back.

She sighed, ready to try and get up again when some thundering footsteps approached her prison.<br>\r\n'Finally...' Ruby thought, struggling to have her own form again as a face popped up. Panic struck the tiny girl as Blake picked up her prison, unable to see the camouflaged girl inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake reentered the room to find it empty, glad to be out of the argument she wandered over to get her favorite book to go read somewhere before noticing her old shoe box on the side table. She opened her draws before curiosity struck,<br>\r\n\"What's this doing out...?\" She spoke softly, peeking inside it to see if it was in use. Nothing inside it. She tipped it upside down to see if someone was using it as an art project or something, nothing. She shrugged, placing it back on the counter top, not noticing the tiny girl fall out into the open draw, instantly absorbing into an item.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby yelled out in panic as she dropped down, bouncing against something before feeling her body sink down.

Now unable to see, Ruby had no warning except the feeling of inertia as she hit the ground. Feeling her sisters feet as she put them through the holes of her thong.

The familiar feeling of wet panties and sticky fingers slowly drifted over her as she slowly rubbed her rear in bed groggily.<br>\r\n\"Bathroom...\" She muttered, clenching her ass cheeks a couple of times as some 'excrement' dribbled down into her crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to be seen by the team, she carefully lent over the bed to look at some shorts. She picked up some tight black shorts, glancing at it for a moment with a blush as she recalled Weiss's idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss had suggested when Ruby went missing to hold and check any items left on the floor in case Ruby had fused to them. Giving them little shakes in case she had falled asleep and waiting a few minutes. They couldn't do it for every object, but it was better then the thought of accidentally wearing her or using the poor girl as a shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLieing on her stomach, with her crotch slowly ruining the battered thong she wore, Yang briefly blushed as she imagined Ruby somehow fusing with her thong. Her heart dropped a little as she remembered the gym and felt how gross it felt right now but the thought slowly passed. The draw was closed, there was no way for the tiny Ruby to access the draw and she wouldn't of tried to sneak into such an object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a small sigh, she shook the shorts.<br>\r\n\"Hey Ruby- if you are in here please leave... I didn't shower after the gym and I don't think you want to stick around...\" She shook it a couple more times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaited a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen slipped them under the sheets, curling them up her legs and over her rear. The bed springs complained a couple of times as she hip thrusted the tight shorts on, unaware that her thong was the person she was looking for. Unable to even get a shout out as an extra layer of cloth smushed the rear together in a horrible swampy mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuddering slightly at the feeling of the dirty thong getting compressed into her cum and ass sweat, Yang quickly hopped up with some careful steps. She paused, flushing again as she arranged the bed sheets so that it looked like Ruby could get out. Making sure to hide the wet spot though.<br>\r\n\"Sorry if you fused to this-\" She bowed, slinking over and grabbing clothes she had designated as safe inside the draw before wandering to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking sure to check the counter and place the clothes up high in case Ruby was dumb enough to try to get her attention via clothing, Yang carefully peeled off her shorts, checking the floor before dropping them. Soon followed by her thong, which needed to be tugged out of her cavernous ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Ruby was practically drooling, her tired mind barely registering what was happening.<br>\r\n\"I just wanna sleeeeeep-\" She groaned internally as the cheeks force fed her more ass sweat. Everything about this felt wrong, It wasn't until Yang actually slipped the thong off and held it up to examine the soiled garment that Ruby started to act again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggling, she pushed herself out, trying to wave at her sister before finally dropping out of the thong. </span></div></div>",

Not just any ones dildo, but Yangs dildo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby could do anything as Yang brought her down to her pussy. It was then that Ruby realized with disgust that her face was on the tip of the dildo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang unknowingly plunged her baby sister face first into her pussy. Ruby wasn\u2019t surprised at all that she still had all of her senses but still wished she didn\u2019t. Ruby\u2019s taste buds were assaulted by the inside of Yangs pulsating pussy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby realized with disgust that her sister could normally do this for hours on end. Yang usual tries to do it when Ruby either isn\u2019t in the room or sleeping. But due to being quite loud, she has been woken up by Yangs moans of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby began getting sick not only from the smell and taste of her sisters questionably clean pussy, but the nauseating movements as well. Ruby could begin to taste her big sisters cum and new she would climax soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang began to push her little sister in and out of her pussy faster and faster. Finally, after hours of torturously being used as her sisters dildo, Ruby was blasted with Yangs disgusting cum but was just glad it was over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Ruby became human again. \u201cOh my god, I\u2019m human again\u201d!! Ruby exclaimed. \u201cJesus Christ, what\u2019s going on\u201d!!!?? Yang yelled in confusion. \u201cWell, I was turned into your thong\u201d. Ruby said trying not to shiver with disgust. \u201cOh my god\u201d. Yang interrupted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe worst part was that I still had all my senses, so I could smell and taste both your pussy and ass\u201d. Ruby said shaking the image out of her head. \u201cOh god\u201d. Yang said trying not throw up. \u201cThen you wore me all day and I had to spend the whole day with my face in your sweaty ass\u201d. Ruby said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang stood there in shock and almost threw up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen you went to the gym and I had to swallow all of your ass sweat\u201d. Ruby said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang wasn\u2019t able to hold it anymore and threw up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen it got really bad when you started farting\u201d. Ruby said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang remembering how bad they were threw up again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen you used me as a dildo.\u201d Ruby said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang threw up even more realizing she just shoved her own sister up vagina. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so so so sorry I put you through that\u201d. Yang said with tears running down her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust don\u2019t say another word or mention this to anyone. I\u2019m going to take a very very very long shower and suppress my memories. Do that and I\u2019ll forgive you\u201d.

I might have to wait till the dust wears off and just deal with whatever I am.\u201d Ruby replied, wincing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang started to speak with an awkward look on her face as she fiddled with the thong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really hope you don\u2019t have to since Weiss has been doing some experiments and she has concluded that it will take a few weeks to wear off.. you're also currently absorbed to the inside of my workout thong.\u201d Yang frowned.<br>\r\n\"T-then if you don't wear your tho-\" Ruby started, but Yang cut her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeiss also explained some of the side effects. I don't think your gonna like them- one is that despite keeping your human appearance and senses, you are actually more so the object than the human.\u201d She poked the tiny girl- noticing Ruby depress down like fabric for a moment.<br>\r\n \u201cAdditionally, you'll release some weird aura that makes everyone see you as the object you were absorbed into... it's also believed that you'll attract people into using you\u201d Yang sighed, \"I kinda know it's the effects, but I do really need to start my workout- and this is kinda my favorite workout thong...\" She noted, not noticing or caring as she dropped the thong to the floor. She casually yanked down her shorts and panties as she apologized halfheartedly again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout saying another word Yang began pulling her sister up. When she finally had her on, Ruby\u2019s face was completely wedged up her half-sisters ass.

Extracting a tiny crystal and placing it under a microscope, Weiss examined the piece carefully.<br>\r\n\"Interesting- it's quite like fire dust but it should be able to give more of a kick to it-\" Weiss shrugged, \"Not my style, but Yang might approve of it.\" The white haired girl paused, glancing at her supplies. One of her custom formulas had began to vibrate slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking, Weiss picked it up, bringing it closer to the test dust in the process. The vibrations got far more intense, making it harder and harder to hold onto.<br>\r\n\"What on earth-\" the dust wielder raised her eyebrows. She felt like she had a decent understanding of dust having used it on the battle field, but her own experiments were fairly useless and unreactive until now. Curiousity flooded into her system as she thought about becoming a famous inventor for a moment. \"No- I like dust, but I'm not a scientist-\" Weiss stated, moving the vial away. \"I'll send this over to the agency though- perhaps-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vial shattered in her hand, the test dust shot up towards it like it was pulled in. She was hardly able to scream before being consumed by the mixture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoughing up some dust, Weiss slowly sat back down in her chair. All that was left was a lump of black powder on the floor, barely noticeable. Sighing, Weiss carefully picked up the broken vial, tossing it into the bin. Thankfully it had shattered into relatively big pieces so it didn't take too long to clear up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to take a sample, Weiss thought about getting something to collect it in before feeling slightly woosey. Taking a few steps towards the door before suddenly transforming into a doll. Her body clacked onto the floor with an inaudable yell of surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little bit of focus, the toy changed back into Weiss- slowly and strangely. It was like it turned into blue water and was trying to transform into a human. The wobbily shape eventually solidified to reveil a panting Weiss on the floor.<br>\r\n\"What.. the hell...\" Weiss whined, slowly turning into a liquid again before focusing. \"Shit shit shit- hold on-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't keep focus forever however, her body soon melted back down into goo right as a knock came at the door-<br>\r\n\"H-help\" Weiss gargled, before sinking down onto the floor.

Her entire being recoiling as it felt like her tongue was being squeezed into the giant foot. The ball of Yangs foot twisted as its pressure increased, grinding the grime into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss's complaints slowly got weaker and weaker before she felt herself slipping into something. Horror shoot into her as she tried to rip herself free with every fiber of her being. Her last desperate look up was at Yangs uncaring face as the giant blonde slipped Weiss into the running shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Filthy- rotten- hot- sweaty- I- I'm not- please- wait\" Weiss fumbled- feeling dizzy as she suddenly started to move. The rank foot of the tank in the party wiggled inside of her before slamming down into the worn out  insole. The ever increasing heat- the smell, the taste- the embarrassment- all of it washed over poor Weiss as she attempted to scratch at Yangs skin. However- without arms- she was unable to do much other then drown in footsweat. The whole area was exploding into hell as she was shook around, slamming repeatedly against the walls before supporting all of Yangs weight. It was all too much. She hoped that her struggles would at least alert her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Yangs perspective, it was an ordinary day. She slung her workout bag over her shoulder and wandered off down the hall with her usually skip in her step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hopping down the stairs, pounding Weiss senseless in the process, Yang wandered out of the dorms and walked over towards the gym. No-one that saw Yang suspected a thing, even if she took off her shoe- they would only see a heavily sweat stained fuzzy sock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening her locker, Yang slipped her bag in before slamming it shut. She finally noticed something with her sock. Popping her heel out, she reached in, grabbing the limp sock and yanking it back over her heel. She pulled it a couple of times with confusion.<br>\r\n\"Oh dang- did the elastic snap?\" her voice sounded surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss felt- tenderized. Her body going limp and no longer supporting Yang's foot as well as it should of done.<br>\r\n\"Please- just take me off-\" She said in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang pulled the sock up again.<br>\r\n\"Well- I guess this is going straight in the bin. This really socks- sucks... dang it Yang, you can make a better pun then this. Your really making a foot of yourself\" Yang thought. However, the sock suddenly seemed to hold this time round as she pulled it up. \"Hu- alright then- guess it won't go in the bin yet\" Yang shrugged, testing the elastic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss was petrified, her entire body tensed up as she held her place on Yangs foot. She didn't want to get tossed out and thrown under a heap of rubbish, if she turned back under a pile of stuff that could be dangerous. Yang usually left clothes under her bed- if she could just hold on during the gym session she would be in a much better place later.</span></div></div>",

Ren found my lucky sock! The pair is together again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen shuddered hearing those words, as he realized that was the reason he was unable to talk or move, he had turned into one of Nora's socks. He remembered when it had first gone missing, one day when he had been doing laundry he had taken the over worn pair to wash, when one of them didn't come back with him Nora was mad for both the wash and loosing the other sock, he had always tried to keep her wearing clean ones but she had mostly refused washing those spasific ones. As she pulled the other one from it's hiding place within her underwear drawer she smiled with joy, something Ren had been trying to get her to do for her birthday but not like this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready to get back into action boys! I know you've been missing my feet like I've been missing you.\" She wiggled her toes in anticipation and as the foot of the red head pushed into him he found where all of his senses really were. First the inside of the sock was full of taste buds, even the light sweat that Nora had gotten in the night was a torrent of salt, the faint funky smell wafted from it. His eyes were mercifully at the very edge of the sock, meaning they would rest outside her boots. The final part was when her foot and leg fully rested within him and her toes wiggled a jolt of pain and extacy ran through him. With Ren and his twin in place Nora pulled up her boots, the smell inside was the stuff of nightmares and Ren balked at it just hanging over them. Nora wasn't about to go slow though and roughly shoved her foot into the boot, happily pressing the poor sock into it's rightful place. Ren tried to scream as the pressure her boot put on him and the horrid smell combined made his whole Aura cry out, although nothing could be felt by the oblivious girl who had only just gotten her favorite socks back. Just a few quick stomps full of pain and pleasure both and she was ready to face the day, wondering what other surprises Ren might have for her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Weiss sat back- her present was almost done. After giving Blake the dust upgrade Ruby had been getting hyped up more then usual about weapons, since it was her birthday coming up Weiss thought it would be a good idea to give Ruby the same treatment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter multiple talks to people within her families company she finally managed to gather some expensive dust prototype. It had been deemed safe for use, it only had a few more tests to pass for it to go on the shelves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have to ask Ruby to review the product at some point.\" Weiss spoke calmly as she hid the vile away, remembering the dust reacted badly with the dust in her sword, she carefully separated the samples. It wasn't fully tested, but mixing those two dust samples could disintegrate the prototype. Weiss sighed as she started to put all the dust back in her suitcase, being careful not to mix the prototype with the other dust in her possession before she tensed up to a door slam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeey~ Weiss! What are you doing?\" Ruby called out from behind Weiss, stomping her feet dry on the welcome mat they bought last Christmas. Ruby heard a smash that drew her attention upwards. \"W-what the? I thought Weiss was here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaware to the leader of Ruby, Weiss had done what she set out to avoid. Trying to hid Rubies present, she dropped the prototype and another dust vial, smashing them both and mixing them into a pile of goo. Without thinking, she brought her hand down on the goo \"Ruby's going to be so disappointed...\" She started to mutter, turning around to her friend before she blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby slipped off her boots and wandered to where she thought Weiss was. <br>\r\n\"That's weird... Weiss left her suit case open.\" With a slightly worried frown, she noticed the broken viles, picking them up and tossing them into the bin, she returned to put away Weiss's stuff. \"Hey Weiss! I'm putting away your stuff! It's all over the floor and I think we're having guests around later!\" Ruby yelled to the closed door of the bathroom. <br>\r\nAfter slipping the suitcase back, she sat down on a chair, glad to take the weight off her feet. Out of the corner of her eye she noticed a strange bubbling droplet. \"What is that...?\" Ruby pouted, rolling from her chair to get a better look. It looked like some kind of liquid that was melting away. \"Ah-? It's dissolving? Uh- Weiss? What is this?\" a little nervous, she extended a finger to poke the strange object. As she made contact, she too blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss lay on the floor, having narrowly avoided Rubies nylon boot feet stomping around the room she had finally found a reletivly safe haven under a chair. While the smell of her 'glorious leaders' feet was still pungent in the air, she still felt relativly safe here. Somehow the prototype had managed to shrink her on skin contact.<br>\r\n\"How did that skip testing? I thought it was essentially safe, they just had a few tests to pass the governments strict laws on dust use...!\" Weiss panted, feeling oddly out of breath. She was sure she had been stepped on at some point, it felt as though her body had gone briefly two dimensional... but is that even possible? While Weiss pondered this news as well as how to get Ruby's attention she noticed the giant clutz flop out of her chair. \"Never mind how do I get her attention, how do I avoid getting flattened by her....!?\" Weiss spoke jokingly, yet her face paled as she watched her friend crawl across the floor like a lost puppy.<br>\r\n\"-What is this?\" Ruby boomed out, before her body suddenly vanished before Weiss. <br>\r\n\"R-Ruby?\" Weiss yelled, noticing what was left of the mixture bubble out of existence as she rushed out towards where her friend had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-ah-?\" Ruby gasped, her landing had been soft, landing on the ever expanding bed of someone from her team. \"What happened?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Weiss scanned the floor, Ruby slowly gathered where she was from the bed.<br>\r\n\"Whose bed is this? Why is everything so big?\" Ruby yelled, before noticing her own fortified bed, \"N-no way! This is my room? Ah- everyone was just behind me, surely they'll know what to do!\" Not grasping the concept of being crushed by mistake, the tiny Ruby cheered for joy as she heard the front door open as if on cue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown below, Weiss gave up on her search for Ruby as she heard the door open. Having experienced Ruby's stomping feet earlier, she decided against standing in the middle of the room.<br>\r\n\"I hope your safe...!\" She muttered, taking shelter with the junk hidden under Yangs bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo- I'm back. Blake said she had something to do so she split. Is Weiss here?\" the blonde powerhouse called out, slipping her shoes off and hanging up her coat. Without waiting to long for a response, she thundered lazily into the room, suddenly realizing she was talking to herself. Shrugging it off she wandered into the bathroom with a yawn, kicking close the door with a socked foot before brushing her teeth ready for bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yang!\" Ruby yelled once more, her voice cracking from yelling so hard. Realizing it's no use now that her sister was in the bathroom, the young leader collapsed. \"Gyah! This is already exhausting... I wonder what that liquid thing was\" Her eyes glazed out as she tried to put her brain to use, her hands rubbing furiously at her hair, \"Weiss's case was open- was Weiss shrunk too? Did I step on her!? Ah- I never thought of that!\" As questions collided with questions, the scythe wielder failed to notice Yang grabbing her sleeping shorts and top from under the bed. Thankfully the used clothes were far away from Weiss's position. \"A-ah! YANG!\" Ruby cried out once more, before watching Yang yank down her shorts and panties right in front of her, \"W-wah! Yang, change in the bathroom! Wait- what are you doing?\" Without her scythe to grant her a speed boost, Ruby couldn't hope to dodge Yangs bare rear crashing into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang kicked off her used shorts as she sat on the bed, unaware of her audience or her flattening sister as she started to kick the used clothes under the over filling underside of the bed, narrowly missing a yelling Weiss. After changing top and peeling off her socks, she finally started to slip on her tight shorts she uses for sleeping. Tugging them up her sweaty thigh, she briefly hopped up, trapping a screaming Ruby between her cheeks as she sealed off the exit with her tight sleep wear.<br>\r\n\"I didn't get to tell Ruby that everyone canceled on us\" Yang yawned, standing up to stretch. Her cheeks subconsciously tensed briefly mid-stretch before she relaxed out of it- stifling another yawn as she crawled under the covers. \"Good for me- I really need an early one- shower can wait for the mornin'~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss was having her worst day yet, surrounded by Yangs discarded used clothes, trapped under her bed after being trampled by Ruby- she swore she was the most unlucky person in the world, not yet knowing about Ruby's situation. She waited for the creak of the bedsprings above her to settle before making her move through the maze of clothes. As the room grew darker, the bed springs started to creak less and less and the labyrinth became increasingly harder to navigate. Weiss swore under her breath as she realized she had almost stumbled down the still warm orange sock of the buxom tank of the party. \"I hope your having more luck then me...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As soon as Weiss stumbled out from Yangs used shorts, the door slammed once again.<br>\r\n\"Oh great...!\" Weiss whined, listening to the bangs of shoes coming off in the distance. Quick on her feet, Weiss quickly made her way over to the chair in the room, deciding to climb up higher to try and get the newcomers attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Blake!\" Yang yelled from bed, wiggling to get rid of what she assumed was a piece of fluff from her old sleepwear, never would she of guessed that it would be her sister trying to get her attention. The bed headed blond gave her best smile as the fauna wandered into the room.<br>\r\nBlake raised an eyebrow as she saw Yang already in bed,<br>\r\n\"I thought you were going to the gym with Ruby later?\" She asked, wandering over towards the bathroom door,<br>\r\n\"We finished up early- it's been a looooong day\" Yang yawned back, tucking herself under her warm blankets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of a tap soon filled everyone's ears as Blake wandered into the bathroom to freshen up, the door soon swung shut as a clang from the toilet seat suddenly erupted. While Yang's rear lazily chewed on Ruby's struggling form, Weiss was on her way to finishing her plan for attention. Having made it almost to the chairs seated section, she was already beginning to congratulate herself for her plan. Reaching the first way-point, she was instantly discouraged to find the backing of the chair on the other side.<br>\r\n\"Ruby you clutz! You turned the chair round to sit down!\" Weiss cried out, \"Why didn't I consider it... now I need to traverse a part I'm not entirely sure is safe...\" Glancing at the lazing Yang and the bathroom door, she quickly made her mad dash for the other side of the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout halfway across the chair, the black cat of the party sauntered out of the bathroom, her stocking wrapped feet thudding gently on the floor. Continuing her conversation with Yang she wandered over towards the chair, casting a shadow over Weiss before spinning the chair to face the desk.<br>\r\n\"No- no no! This isn't happening!\" Weiss yelled, picking up her speed as the titanic ass hovered over her minuscule body. Thankfully, Blake decided to open her book and find her page before sitting down, the force of her sitting almost blasting poor Weiss off the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to everyone- within Yangs sweaty ass, little Ruby was struggling to escape. Almost every bit of progress she made though, caused the titan holding her to jam her deeper into the horrid dungeon.<br>\r\n\"I-if this keeps up I'll-\" Ruby gasped, not wanting to continue her thought process. The cheeks were tightly smooshed together by Yangs weight, making progress slow and disgusting for the little leader. After one final spert, her hopes of escaping were dashed by Yang finally fixing her itch with a finger. Poor Ruby felt her body flatten to the plump rear repeatedly as Yang subtly scratched at her under the covers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss was having a much luckyer break with her climb, the chair thankfully had many resting spots and Blake's movements were relatively slow and predictable for Weiss's quick brain. Climbing was hardly a challenge from all her training and dedication, every move she made was calculated and pulled off perfectly. While she was focused with climbing, the conversation above did grab her attention.<br>\r\n\"Weren't you returning with Ruby?\" Blake boomed overhead, slipping a bookmark into her book,<br>\r\n\"Yeah- I kinda split away from her though- I had to pick up her present. She might be sleeping round someones house or something- she's making a ton of friends recently\" Yang yawned back, her hands returned to the back of her head as she gazed up at the bed above her. \"Weiss is also missing, they might be doing something together\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving reached the top, Weiss set out to yell a retort. She knew she was too small to be heard by the titanic giantess that surrounded her but it was something that she was finding increasingly relaxing. Before she could whip one out though, she noticed Blakes arm pit come increasingly close, exposing a way into her clothes. Gazing up towards her scarf she the sudden scary idea of climbing Blake to get to her ear.<br>\r\n\"Blake!\" She called out without response, her feet stomped in frustration as she realized the ear wasn't only her best bet, but possibly her only chance. Clambering to her feet, she ran towards her friend's underarm with new found determination. Quickly jumping out and grabbing the material she realised her bad timing as Blake began to move. \"Wait! Bl-Blake! Stay still!\" She yelled, realizing she didn't want to be thrown off or flattened to her teammates armpit she hurredly slipped into the clothes, narrowly avoiding the colliding skin. Pinned between Blakes skin and clothes, she watched with horror as she watched the arm swing in time with Blakes walk. Getting pulverized under there would be a form of torture Weiss was determined to avoid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Blake filled her cup full of water, she failed to feel once of her friends begin to climb up the side of her boob. Trying not to yawn, she took a brief sip before wandering back. She rubbed her temples as she wandered back towards her book, glancing over at the snoring Yang who had kicked the covers from her while spreading out.<br>\r\n\"Honestly...\" Blake smiled, setting down her water as she wandered over to Yangs bed. Unaware of bouncing boobs controlling Weiss's fate, she bent over drag the covers back over Yang. Her bra strained against the sudden weight as Weiss was tossed to the side. Unable to detect any distress however, Blake simply stood back up to return to her book. The sun had fully set a while back, and her torch was running low on wax. With a sigh, Blakes final action of sitting down bounced the unready Weiss about once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Ruby was trapped for the night, what would become of Weiss?</span></div></div>",

Weiss, feeling the need to educate her younger classmate, stepped forward,<br>\r\n\"They occasionally let the smaller, weaker Grimm to slip through to this point to focus on some of the bigger opposing forces\" Weiss smiled, tipping her nose up confidently as she scanned the trees \"it makes a rather interesting training situation for students that are just learning the ropes. I have to admit though, there were some grimm that haven't been recorded before\" As Weiss spoke, their pickup arrived, Weiss and Ruby jumped into the machine while Blake scanned the area.<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Yang questioned, before she could say anything else she noticed Blake swat her neck.<br>\r\n\"Nothing, just- mosquitoes...\" Blake frowned, she thought she saw something weird from that mosquito but decided to ignore it.<br>\r\n\"Ouch- hey!\" Yang also swatted her neck, quickly checking her hand to find the crushed form of a mosquito, \"Dang it, I react badly to these things... lets get back to the dorm before more show up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did everyone know, that tiny mosquito was an abnormality of nature.

It wasn't a huge amount of pain, but it was noticable on their faces,<br>\r\n\"Hey- are you two ok?\" Ruby wandered over towards her sister as the helicopter landed at the acadamy.<br>\r\n\"I'm fine- m-must of been something I ate!\" Yang joked, exchanging a worried glance from Blake as they both thought back to the mosquito bite. Weiss wandered over to help Blake up, but as she reached her she suddenly vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGazing down on the floor, Weiss saw what appeared to be a very confused and bewildered little Blake toy wandering around. Her mind worked hard to process this new information as Ruby stumbled backwards,<br>\r\n\"Y-yang?!\" Ruby yelled, having leaned over to support her sisters weight, the last thing she expected was for the weight and her sister to vanish. Her foot slammed down upon the tiny Blake, flattening the tiny girl to the bigger girls tred as she fell.<br>\r\n\"Ruby!\" Weiss yelled, grasping the situation. She quickly snatched up a confused Yang from the floor before jumping down.<br>\r\n\"I'm alright Weiss!\" Ruby laughed it off, starting to stand up. Weiss looked deathly pale, looking down at the ground. Ruby traced her line of sight to a tiny crumpled Blake sticker on the ground. \"Cute!\" Ruby started, before remembering her disappearing sister, \"Wait- Yang vanished! Also, where's-\" Ruby was cut off by Weiss's scared stare. In her closed fist lay a struggling Yang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Blake managed to reform. Everyone slowly calmed down as they grouped together to discuss the situation. Blake and Yang told the two other team members about the mosquito bite, it was the only thing they actually shared.<br>\r\n\"I've never heard of an event like this happening before...\" Weiss murmured, comparing Blakes height to Yangs. Oddly, Yang was far bigger then Blake, while Yang was the size of a small doll, Blake had become the size of a bug. Is was quite worrying to see Blake so tiny,<br>\r\n\"Perhaps I'm smaller because I was injected first\" Yelled Blake, \"it might of used more on me as it's first target!\" Blake rubbed her throat as she sat on Yangs shoulder. Measuring up, sitting down she was the size of the powerhouses ear.<br>\r\n\"No offense, but I hope so- I reaaaally don't want to be that small!\" Yang bluntly put it, giving an apologetic glance as Ruby panicked in the background.<br>\r\n\"We need to inform someone..!\" Ruby eventually decided, almost crushing the two tiny figures as she rushed back in. Thankfully Weiss moved them both out of the way from the hyperactive girl.<br>\r\n\"No- they could be experimented on. I know a few people that could potentially look into a cure for this discreetly\" Weiss spoke with confidence, \"It should be your choice though-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang gave a silent gulp as she began to talk it over with Blake... they eventually decided to-</span></div></div>",

Pyhraa and Nora, standing at their locker, spun around at the news.<br>\r\n\"Ruby, I wanted to let her know in PRIVATE- jeez now the whole schools going to find out\" Weiss stormed forward, jabbing Ruby in the arm, \"Think first-\" Weiss gave a final sigh, suddenly remembering what she was carrying. Glancing down at a shaken up Yang she became appologetic as Ruby retorted in a sing song voice,<br>\r\n\"Think first!\" Ruby laughed slightly- finally over her nerves as a concerned Glynda demanded an explanation-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n____________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So- yeah! That's what happened!\" Ruby blurted, \"They're also super stretchy and flatten out like a sticker when stepped on!\" She smiled, happy with her explanation. Both Yang and Blake winced slightly at the last part before looking up to the giant teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had all moved into Glynda's office to avoid the gathering croud. Yang and Blake were happly on the more solid ground of Glynda's desk as she listened to the story. Blake was happily sitting by Yangs feet this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They can be flattened? How did you find this out- it seems impossible.\" Glynda asked, glancing down at the two shrinkee's. Her eyes didn't even hint at surprise as she wrote something down in a document,<br>\r\n\"Ruby stepped on Blake\" Weiss sighed, Ruby started to stutter once more-<br>\r\n\"On accident! Besides- she wasn't hurt at all! Look-\" Ruby stuck her thumb out, aiming for the stunned Blake-<br>\r\n\"Hold on a second!\" Blake yelled- unheard by her -act first, think later- leader, the thumb completely flattened her to the desk, grinding her down before releasing. <br>\r\n\"See!\" Ruby spoke triumphantly as Glynda examined the flat Blake.<br>\r\n\"Interesting- Yang is the same?\" Glynda asked, picking up a startled Yang, her strong fingers stretching out her shocked face with curiousity. She ajusted her glasses slightly before continuing to play- ignoring the groans that came from the putty in her hands.<br>\r\n\"We haven't tested it on Yang-\" Weiss bit her bottom lip, \"I think it's actually quite uncomfortable for them\" Weiss looked over to a, now guilty Ruby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang was put down on the desk as Glynda decided to speak.<br>\r\n\"Rumors travel fast at the acadamy- I'm guessing there are students who were listening at the door too. With Ruby's loud voice, it's without a doubt that everyone will know about your situation by the end of the day.\" She sighed- \"I'm not sure if this will be temporary or permanent- this has happened on rare occasions. It can last years or even days- for now...\"</span></div></div>",

Weiss seemingly ignored her as she dragged her feet into the bathroom, \"Looks like it was a long day, wonder if I can do anything to cheer her up-\" Yang pondered, her hands automatically stretching Blake about, a bad habit she had picked up at somepoint. A toilet soon flushed followed by the sink turning on, snapping Yang back to reality \"Oh- sounds like she's done- why are you so flat? Did you want me to use you as Weiss's toe rag again? I thought you didn't like that?\" Yang mewed, dropping the crushed toy between her breasts, \"I'm joking, I'm joking! Sorry, my bad habits come back to haunt me! Hehe-\" a blush spread across her face as she looked away from the annoyed sticker smooshed between her boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss wandered in from the bathroom, her body tired from the long day of work. Her eyes drifted towards her bed which had a lone Yang standing in the middle.<br>\r\n\"What are you doing on my bed...?\" Weiss frowned, sitting down next to Yang to remove her shoes.<br>\r\n\"Watching a film with Blake, it's rather good!\" Yang smiled up nervously, Weiss sighed back. Her hand grabbing and dumping Yang to the stool close to the bed before wandering off to get changed.<br>\r\n\"You two are lucky you didn't need to do combat today-\" Weiss glanced at Yang, stuggling to see any sign of Blake before giving up and grabbing her sleepwear, \"Ruby seemed super excited to come back, quick warning, she might have another 'prank' up her sleeve-\".<br>\r\n\"Not the best place to put me...- us -...\" Yang muttered, half paying attention to what Weiss was saying. While Weiss had initially taken up a motherly role over the shrinkees, Yang's carefree attitude towards accidents and Ruby's odd pranks had made her a bit to relaxed, she had even started to laugh at some of Ruby's 'pranks'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yang, what if Ruby comes back and doesn't notice us?\" Blake called up, making the giant blonde jump slightly,<br>\r\n\"Quit worrying will you, I'll just dive off- we are invincible\" Yang smiled down, picking her up and putting her down next to her. \"Just sit back and relax!\" the blond power house of the group sat next to her, kicking her bare feet over the edge with ease as she listened to Weiss complain about her day.<br>\r\n\"I really want to get down now though...\" Blake stumbled over her words, \"If you get crushed they usually find you quite easily, while when I get crushed- well-\" coughing slightly as she noticed the dark twinkle in Yangs eye.<br>\r\n\"Oh? I can help you out, Ruby discovered something super weird about our bodies the other day! Check it out!\" Yang chuckled, grabbing the nervous Blake by the head. Not hearing the complaints, Yang stretched the little Blake toy as far as she could, aiming for the top of the chest of draws they were sleeping on. \"Like a rubber band! Neat, isn't it?\" Yang laughed again, her fingers slipped mid laugh, launching Blake over the edge of the stool. \"Oh dang- that's not good...\" Yang sighed, knowing she had abused her friend once more. Before she could jump down she didn't notice a shadow get cast over her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby yawned, her body feeling battered from the long combat class. She rested her back pack on the stool as she unpacked some of her books, carefully putting them down on her bedside table.<br>\r\n\"I've got an awesome new prank to show you two-\" Ruby spoke happily, a yawn escaping her lips, \"You've also got a task Blake! Tomorrow- sleep~ leader~ need-\" Her face turned into one of bliss as she stripped off into her bed, not noticing a surprised Yang stuck to the bottom of her backpack as she slid it under her bed. \"Night you two-\" Ruby spoke softly, \"Night Weeeeiss\" She called out, hearing the muffled sound of Weiss yelling goodnight with a toothbrush in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Where did Blake land?'</span></div></div>",

She glanced from Yangs bed to the chair, noticing she wasn't there.<br>\r\n\"Great-\" Weiss sighed, checking her feet and her bed before she suddenly felt something bounce of her chest. The dust users tired eyes glanced towards Ruby's bed, noticing a panting Yang next to a broken up pencil she was using for ammo to get her attention. Her pencil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang's happy go lucky smile twitched as she was yanked up from the ground by the annoyed Weiss. Her body squishing slightly from the pressure,<br>\r\n\"Y-yo!\" Yang spoke jokingly, giving a weak wave. The ice cold look gave her shivers, \"So- uh- long day?\" She smiled, breaking Weiss's cold exterior a bit, \"Hey, at least you don't have to carry these babies around everywhere, major back problems!\" Yang laughed, pointing to her boobs. Weiss smiled wearily,<br>\r\n\"I think mine are actually bigger\" Without warning, she pushed Yang into her chest, giving a small smile as she compared sizes with the nervous Yang, \"Fairly sure just one of them is bigger then your entire body\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss eventually let Yang go, returning to her bed. She gave her aching feet a small rub, she slowly thought about making the tiny Yang give her a foot massage to compensate her lost pencil, there definitely needed to be some form of punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------<b r></b>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake landed with a thud infront of the bathroom door, her body battered from Yangs careless playing. She slowly rose to her feet, noticing her dangerous position outside of the door. After only a few steps, the sound of running water vanished to be replaced by the noise of a turning handle.<br>\r\nBlake gritted her teeth, running as fast as she could as she heard the sound of footsteps sticking to the wooden floors, shuffling slowly towards her. A moments darkness was all it took before Blake felt an enormous amount of pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat girl gave a small whimper as she lifted up with Weiss's damp foot, her sticker like form mixing perfectly with the dust and debris that had already started to cling to the dust wielders foot as she wandered around obliviously. Her foot THUDDED constantly on the ground, grinding the little cat girl further into the tired foot. The creaking floorboards groaned as the giant girl stopped, her feet slowly rocked to keep balance while she stood still on the tiny cat girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an uncomfortable amount of time spent ground into the dusty floor the foot thankfully lifted. Blake tried to move as Weiss's tired eyes checked over her, unable to pick out the tiny form from the small amount of dust and dirt picked up from the short walk around the room.<br>\r\n\"W-Weiss- w-wait\" Blake tried to talk, her voice too weak to be heard even from Yangs height. She whimpered as Weiss let go of the foot, pressing down with her entire body weight as she checked her other foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before the giant foot above stomped off to bed, Weiss's icy cold fingers did little to make the tiny Blake feel better about the situation as they gently massaged her in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------<b r></b>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss happily mewed as she felt her toes click, she tilted her head towards Yang, biting her lip awkwardly, thinking about the nerve the tiny had for breaking her stuff as she said-</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Weiss\u2019s tired eyes glared at Yang as she thought back to the all the trouble the tiny girl had caused her over the last two months. It would have been hard enough to look after a placid, well-behaved person at Yang\u2019s size, let alone Blake\u2019s, and Yang was anything but well-behaved. She\u2019d wander off whenever Weiss wasn\u2019t looking and found her way into every nook and cranny, including some that Weiss would very much like to keep to herself, thank you very much. Half the time she\u2019d take Blake with her as well, willingly or otherwise Weiss couldn\u2019t tell, which would make things even harder to deal with. She\u2019d even gone and lost Blake out the window once, necessitating hours of what was supposed to be study time spent carefully scouring the court yard until Weiss had finally found the little Faunus flattened in the grass, having been trampled by some nearby students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Yang\u2019s little escapades had evoked concern in Weiss, genuine fear for the safety of her friend and a maternal instinct she hadn\u2019t even known she possessed. Over time, however, concern had turned to exasperation, and exasperation had turned to annoyance. Because really, why was it her responsibility to look after someone as irresponsible as Yang? Sure, there was no way she could trust Ruby with such a responsibility, not by herself, but that didn\u2019t make it okay for Yang to make things so much more difficult than they needed to be. And now the oaf had gone and broken one of her favourite pencils for no apparent reason other than getting her attention. The nerve of her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quiet little huff, the heiress decided enough was enough and reached out to snatch Yang off the bookcase faster than the girl could react, roughly squeezing as she brought her hand back to her bed. \u201cYou really should learn to respect other\u2019s stuff\u2026 and you can start by making it up to me for the pen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaught off guard by Weiss\u2019s sudden aggression, Yang didn\u2019t even have a chance to respond before she was dumped onto the heiress\u2019s bed just short of her right foot. The force at which she impacted the bed winded her slightly but it didn\u2019t take long for the blonde to climb back to her feet and send a glare of her own towards her giant teammate. \u201cWhat the hell Weiss! I was jus\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSave it!\u201d Weiss\u2019s booming voice cut off the shrunken girl\u2019s protests, as she shifted her right sole directly in front of the girl, her left moving to lay flat on the bed, unknowingly burying Blake beneath her foot once more. \u201cI\u2019ve had a long day, and you\u2019ve just been lying around watching movies. Now it\u2019s your turn to earn your keep.\u201d Wriggling her toes, she shot a pointed look at Yang. \u201cMy feet are sore, do me a favour and give them a massage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the heiress\u2019s foot right in front of her, Yang was taken back by more than the other girl\u2019s words. Even though Weiss had only just had a shower, the blonde could still smell the sweat on her sole and the distinct scent of the grime between her toes and in the folds of her feet. It was somewhat of a revelation that even a girl as obsessively clean as Weiss could have feet like this, the heady bouquet of scents making Yang dizzy. It wasn\u2019t terrible, not at this range, and Yang was used to the smell of sweaty bodies by now, but it certainly wasn\u2019t pleasant either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the hesitation on Yang\u2019s face, Weiss decided to take matters into her own hands, forcing her foot forward until it bumped into the tiny girl, temporarily forcing the brawler\u2019s face and upper body into the sole and almost knocking her over completely. \u201cI\u2019m waiting Yang. And just so you know, if you don\u2019t get at it, I\u2019m just going to step on you and do it myself.\u201d She probably wouldn\u2019t actually do that, she wasn\u2019t quite there yet, but she was getting tired of the blonde\u2019s hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Yang it was like being punched in the face by a moist mattress, the smell hitting her almost as hard as the foot itself before she stumbled back and away from the offending appendage. Even from such brief contact she could already feel a thin layer of the heiress\u2019s sweat coating her face and soaking into her top. Her immediate instinct was to wipe the sweat from the face, but under the weight of Weiss\u2019s glare and the looming threat of her foot she instead took a careful step forward and slowly, hesitantly, brought her hands to the other girl\u2019s sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken girl\u2019s palms sank into the larger girl\u2019s flesh, barely noticeable to Weiss but a good couple of inches from Yang\u2019s perspective. Repressing the urge to move back in revulsion, while still trying to keep the rest of her body as far away as possible, Yang starting moving her hands back and forth along the ball of Weiss\u2019s foot, shuddering slightly as her fingers slid across the slick flesh. The smell was stronger at this range, but manageable, though that did little to take her mind off the feeling of the sweat now pooling between her fingers. It was almost like she was kneading the sweat out of the heiress\u2019s soles, slowly coating her hands with the viscous fluid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly Weiss hadn\u2019t really expected to feel much from her friend\u2019s attentions. Maybe a slight tickling or scratching sensation, but no real form of relief. She was more than a little surprised then to feel a small tremor go down her spine at the feeling of the brawler\u2019s strong hands running across her sole. Suppressing a gasp, she resisted the urge to make good on her previous threat and just smash Yang between her feet and use her as her personal foot toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally lifting her left foot from the bed, and giving Blake some much needed air, the heiress moved in closer to the brawler, wriggling both sets of toes at her newfound servant. \u201cGood girl, but I wouldn\u2019t want my left foot to get lonely.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing face down on the bed had warmed Weiss\u2019s left sole more than the left, and Yang could smell the difference as it closed in, more than doubling the intense aroma that now enveloped her and resulting in a notable rise in the local temperature. Her hands had already been coated in the sickly gunk from Weiss\u2019s right sole to such an extent they were almost black and it only took at glance at the new arrival to tell that it was even dirtier than the first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking closer, the shrunken blonde\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cOh geez.\u201d Looking closer at Weiss\u2019s left sole, Yang sighed heavily as she spotted the flattened and mangled form of her partner, blending in almost perfectly with the rest of the detritus picked up in the short trip from the bathroom to the bed. The Faunus was dripping in the sweat of the heiress\u2019s sole and from what Yang could make out her expression was twisted in a pained grimace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove, Weiss took note of the blonde\u2019s sudden lack of action, swinging down the big toe of her right foot to not so gently nudge her head. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask you to stop did I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising her voice for the first time since her original attempt to reason with the aggravated giant, Yang pointed one sweaty palm at the stricken girl. \u201cIt\u2019s Blake, she\u2019s stuck to your sole Weiss!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Raising her foot away from Yang and lifting it to her face, Weiss took a brief sniff before turning her head away, unaware of how sweaty the foot had gotten from its brief time being pressed into the sheets. Forcing her eyes back to the sole, she carefully examined the myriad specks of dirt, more carefully then she had before, and finally set eyes on her smallest teammate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning loudly, she started to scratch at her sole, trying to get her fingernail under the little Faunus even while her mind turned to darker places. Although she had difficulty making out the miniature girl at the best of times, and wasn\u2019t always able to tell her intentions, Weiss was pretty sure that Blake wasn\u2019t being as deliberately difficult as Yang. But even so, her smaller side had led to her getting in all kinds of trouble, nearly having the heiress pulling her hair out in worry. Even beyond incidents caused by Yang, the Faunus had managed to independently get into trouble a number of times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the little girls had been introduced to Team JNPR, Blake had somehow managed to fall into Pyrrha\u2019s cleavage and had been lost in there for hours, carried around by the redhead through a day of classes and training before finally coming loose in the showers. Then, just the other day, she\u2019d walked out into the hallway by herself, or at least that had been the way it seemed to Weiss, and been trampled over by several students before sticking to the treads of Velvet\u2019s shoes. That time it had taken Weiss, with some help from Yang, a whole day to find and free her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankly, it was an endless headache she could do without.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally catching the edge of Blake\u2019s flattened body, Weiss\u2019s nails ripped the tiny girl from her sole in one motion, producing a wet slurping sound as the sodden Faunus came free. Frowning in disgust at the sweat-soaked form, Weiss sighed as she balanced Blake on one finger, thinking for a moment before pushing the finger into her own ear, scrapping off its tiny passenger deep within her ear canal. \u201cSo talk, how\u2019d you get like that?\u201d Shooting a quick glare down at the still staring Yang, she pointedly wriggled her toes again. \u201cAnd you, I still didn\u2019t say you could stop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Yang reluctantly resumed her ministrations, Blake struggled to reform, her battered body slowly returning to its ordinary shape as she took in deep breaths of air and wiped the thick layer of sweat from her face. Though it wasn\u2019t the worse experience she\u2019d had since being shrunken, her time under Weiss\u2019s foot had not been pleasant, the smell and heat amplified several times over at her scale as compared to Yang\u2019s. \u201cI\u2026\u201d She knew even here she had to speak loudly if she was to be heard by Weiss, taking a deep breath before continuing. \u201cYang was messing around again. She stretched me and I snapped back. Went flying across the room and then you\u2026 stepped on me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake could tell that Weiss was not in a good mood, so she was hesitant in her words, though she hoped that the heiress\u2019s discontent would be turned more towards her partner then herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing loudly, Weiss quickly dug the tiny Faunus out of her ear, staring down at the little girl as she momentarily distanced herself from the sensation of Yang tending to her soles, before eventually\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Because of course it had been Yang\u2019s fault, and of course Blake had neither managed to get out of the way or to get Weiss\u2019s attention when she specifically checked her sole. Really, what the hell was she supposed to do to keep them safe it they wouldn\u2019t put in the effort to stay out of danger themselves? Right then and there Weiss decided that enough was enough. She was going to teach both of them a lesson and make sure they\u2019d never again even think of disobeying her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was for their own good. And just slightly for her own. Her feet were still killing her after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFocusing her gaze on Blake, Weiss could tell the shrunken student was trying to say something to her, but all she could hear were little squeaks. It didn\u2019t matter anyway, she\u2019d already made her decision. Curling back one finger she casually flicked the tiny Faunus off her fingertip, sending her careening towards Yang with pinpoint accuracy. \u201cHere, I think you both owe me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaught off-guard, Yang only had time to take a single step back from Weiss\u2019s foot before her partner slammed into her, instantly disappearing into her expansive cleavage. With both Blake\u2019s body and Yang\u2019s top covered in the heiress\u2019s foot sweat, there was no resistance to the Faunus\u2019 path, and the blonde was forced to go fishing between her own breasts before finally pulling the now very disgruntled girl free. \u201cHeh, sorry about that partner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her part, Blake just glared half-heartedly at Yang as she focused once again on reforming, distinctly aware that the layer of sweat from Weiss\u2019s foot had now been joined by her larger partner\u2019s boob sweat, leaving her feeling like she\u2019d taken a bath in an ocean of sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reunion of the tiny girls, such as it was, was interrupted as Weiss extended her feet towards them once more, her cold eyes looking down on them without remorse. \u201cIt\u2019s time that you two learned the consequences of your actions. I\u2019m not letting you get any sleep until my feet have been thoroughly tended to.\u201d Predicting their objections before they could even be spoken, she raised one foot menacingly over her teammates. \u201cOr\u2026 I could just flatten you both right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang knew better than to try and argue with Weiss while she was like this. Better to just let her do her thing and hope she would come to her senses later. Sighing deeply, the blonde went to place Blake on the bed, only to be interrupted by Weiss once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot there.\u201d The heiress wiggled her toes invitingly, already looking forward to the return of Yang\u2019s hands, plus a new little addition. \u201cPut her up with my toes. She\u2019s so tiny I wouldn\u2019t feel her anywhere else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake didn\u2019t like the sound of that, but she liked the thought of being stepped on deliberately even less, so she nodded reluctantly at the questioning look from Yang, her viewpoint elevating quickly as her partner stretched up and set her at the base of Weiss\u2019s toes. It was the smell that hit her first, magnified at her smaller scale and so much worse near the toes than it had been under the sole. As the Faunus struggled to keep her balance on the slick skin the toes shifted before her, sliding against one another as the grit between them moved back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow, Yang reluctantly returned to her earlier task, finding the sole of Weiss\u2019s foot no less damp and odorous than it had been when she last touched it, the sweat pooling between her palms and bubbling up between her fingers as her hands moved back and forth. To make matters worse, the larger girl kept her other foot menacingly close, occasionally going so far as to bump it against her in a not so subtle encouragement to continue her efforts, each time leaving a giant sweaty footprint all over Yang\u2019s clothes and skin. The sweat and the grime was even starting to get into her luscious hair, something she was going to have a serious word to Weiss about later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it was bad for Yang though, it was worse for Blake. The moment the Faunus\u2019s hands made contact with the heiress\u2019s largest toe they nearly slid straight off, her left hand nearly getting caught in the gap between the toes and coming away covered in something she\u2019d prefer not to think about. Unprepared to face the price of failure she pushed on, running her hands along the toes while simultaneously trying to keep the rest of her body away from their looming embrace. She was only marginally successful at best, the massive toes dripping sweat down on her no matter where she tried to stand, and there was only so far back she could go without risking falling off completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile her teammates were in hell, Weiss was hovering somewhere closer to heaven. Yang\u2019s strong hands were doing wonders for the sureness in her feet, and in only took a little bit more gentle \u2018encouragement\u2019 to convince the brawler to switch her attention between both feet. Meanwhile, Blake\u2019s ministrations, while minor in comparison, produced a pleasant sensation across her toes, akin to the feeling of scratching a deep and persistent itch. The urge to just bring her feet together and rub both of them into oblivion was almost overwhelming, but she held off\u2026 for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe desire to feel something more, however, would not be denied. If she couldn\u2019t crush them, then she\u2019d have to try something else. It was difficult to see Blake from this range, especially while peering between her own toes, but with a little bit of skill she managed to use one toe to not so gently nudge the tiny brunette face-first into another, while simultaneously pressing the big toe of her other foot against the back of Yang\u2019s head, pushing the brawler\u2019s face against her sweaty sole. \u201cNow, both of you. Lick!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly finding herself with a face-full of foot flesh, Yang gulped at the forceful command from above. Some of the heiress\u2019s sweat had already leaked into her mouth, but the thought of deliberately licking the foot was almost enough to make her turn and run. It was clear, however, that Weiss wasn\u2019t giving her an option, so she reluctantly stuck out her tongue and ran it across the sweat-soaked skin. Instantly, Yang\u2019s mouth was filled with the horrid taste of sweat and grime, every instinct in her body telling her to spit it out even as she forced herself to swallow and lick again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove, Blake was having similar problems. Knowing it would be pointless to fight she carefully ran her tongue along the inside of Weiss\u2019s toe, shuddering at the combination of sweat, grime and toejam that she picked up in the process. Swallowing with extreme effort, the Faunus could feel the fowl concoction coating her throat and stomach, screaming at her not to re-open her mouth and take another lick. She did it anyway of course, well aware that she was at the mercy of her teammate\u2019s toes. Just a brief moment of hesitation saw her getting nudged again, more violently this time, and she quickly found herself facedown between two of the heiress\u2019s digits, her next mouthful coming with a significantly greater amount of toejam than the last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiting her lip, Weiss had to suppress the urge to outright moan as her unfortunate teammates continued to serve her feet. If the feeling of their hands had been close to heavenly, then their tongues had definitely pushed her beyond that. Part of it was the sensation, but mostly it was the knowledge of how much at her mercy the two girls were. Before they\u2019d shrunken they\u2019d both been taller and physically stronger than her, but now they were insignificant bugs before her overwhelming power, unable to resist even her most unreasonable whims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd even now, she had the ability to make it so much worse for them.</span></div></div>",

There was a satisfying lack of resistance as her soles came together and her toes clenched down, Yang reduced to a rag between her feet and Blake little more than a pleasant itch between her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to enjoy her power to its fullest, the heiress began sliding her feet back and forth against one another, further flattening and stretching Yang\u2019s now thoroughly sweat-soaked body as it was smeared between the shifting soles. Simultaneously her toes began scrunching and un-scrunching around the stricken Faunus, happily moving Blake back and forth between their unforgiving embraces, smearing her deep into the crevices between each toe before passing her to the next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust a few short hours ago, Weiss would never have even considered doing something like this. She would have yelled at anyone who even suggested it as a possibility. Now all she could think about is what she\u2019d been missing these last few months. Seriously, if she\u2019d known how good this would feel she would have let Ruby go on thinking that Yang and Blake were just a doll and sticker respectively so that she\u2019d never have to share them with anyone else ever again. As it was, she was going to do her best to keep them with her whenever possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaware of the heiress\u2019s thoughts, Yang and Blake could do nothing but struggle to maintain their consciousness as their defenceless bodies were battered and squished from every direction. Yang had been reduced to little more than a flat sticker, now stuck almost completely to Weiss\u2019s left sole, face-down, even as the right one continued to run across her, ironing her further and further into the warm flesh. All of her senses had been consumed by the heiress, unable to smell or taste anything other than Weiss\u2019s sole, unable to hear anything but the sound of the blood pumping through the larger girl\u2019s veins, unable to see anything but darkness, and unable to feel anything but the agonising sensation of being slowly turned completely two-dimensional.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake meanwhile was being thrown back and forth between her former friends\u2019 toes like a tiny ragdoll, one moment crushed to a disk between the big and second toe of one foot, the next buried deep within the crevice between the third and fourth toe of the other. Occasionally she\u2019d be smeared so thoroughly into one spot that the questing toes would temporarily lose track of her, only to find her once again as a toenail scrapped her away from her latest prison and sent her plunging into another. It had only been a couple of minutes since this torture began, but already Blake had lost all sense of up and down, her senses jumbled all over the place as her body was slowly caked in an ever increasing mass of toejam, so much so that soon Weiss was playing with a ball of toejam composed less of the Faunus than it was the random bits of grime that ended up between her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither girl could truly fathom how this was happening. Sure Weiss had been irritated, angry even, but this, this was beyond anything they could have expected. Their teammate was stubborn and competitive, and enjoyed being in control, but for her to completely dominate them like this, to disregard their feelings and treat them as nothing more than playthings was insane. And yet that was the reality they were faced with, endlessly squished by the heiress\u2019s smelly and sweaty feet.</span></div></div>",

Both shrunken girls looked on in concern as the surface of the bed was depressed under the weight of the larger girls while they themselves made no impact, the difference in mass becoming all the more apparent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a few deep breaths to collect herself, Weiss allowed a brief glance at Ruby to ensure the younger girl was listening before focusing on her shrunken friends. \u201cOkay, it\u2019s getting late and I think this has been a long day for all of us, so I suggest we get some sleep for now and worry about how we\u2019re going to handle this\u2026 situation tomorrow morning.\u201d She paused for a moment as Yang and Blake had a brief discussion and then nodded their approval. \u201cGood, so that just leaves the issue of where you two are going to spend the night.

I\u2019m against it, but I won\u2019t stop you.\u201d Her eyes flicked to Blake, but at this range she still couldn\u2019t make out the Faunus\u2019 expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang turned her head slightly to make eye contact with her partner, still standing on her shoulder.

You\u2019ll be safer I\u2019m sure.\u201d Despite their concerns, both girls made a valiant effort to smile back, trying to put their friend at ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving a small nod to herself Weiss ushered Ruby off her bed and started rummaging around in her dresser for her night clothes. Of course it was only then that she realised that the two shrunken students didn\u2019t have any night clothes of their own to wear, other than what they\u2019d been shrunk in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her part, Blake had just reached the same conclusion. Yang didn\u2019t seem phased, suggesting they just sleep in their underwear if their clothes were too uncomfortable. The idea didn\u2019t really appeal to Blake who, as much as she hated to admit it, was used to hiding herself, but it was better than the alternative. Reluctantly, the two small girls stripped off, Yang wrapping her own clothes and Blake\u2019s, as well as their miniature weapons, in her jacket, and handing it to Ruby to be placed gently on the nearby desk. At their scale it wasn\u2019t like their weapons would be much use in any case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving finished changing herself, Weiss tried to carefully climb into bed as Ruby flicked the lights and ascended to the higher bunk in a blur. The shift in weight on the bed nearly sent Yang tumbling towards the larger girl, and it was only her hand around Blake\u2019s waist that stopped the Faunus from tumbling down the bed and under Weiss\u2019s shifting body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the way the sheets and mattress gave way instantly to the larger girl\u2019s weight, both girls knew that getting caught up in that wouldn\u2019t have been a pleasant experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorryingly, the heiress didn\u2019t seem to have noticed her friend\u2019s movement, merely laying her head down on the pillow beside them, giving them a soft smile and quiet goodnight before closing her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of sight, out of mind seemed to be in full effect as it had barely been a minute since Weiss closed her eyes when she rolled over completely to face the opposite direction, the violent movement of the bed nearly sending Yang, let alone Blake, into danger. It was only the blonde\u2019s quick reflexes grabbing a fistful of sheets, and her continuing grip around the Faunus\u2019 waist that stopped them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was shivering again, and Yang belatedly released she\u2019d squeezed a bit too hard and slightly flattened the smaller girl\u2019s abdomen. With a quick apology, the blonde lay the Faunus down beside her, opposite from Weiss, knowing the brunette\u2019s night vision would allow her to see the apologetic smile directed towards her. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll stay between you and Weiss. Everything will be fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a small comfort only, given Yang\u2019s own size in comparison, but Blake tried to feel comforted by it. At least she wasn\u2019t alone. Though she dared not put voice to her thoughts, the tiny Faunus feared that, without Yang, she would end up lost entirely in a now unfathomably large world, or unknowingly squished into oblivion by her giant teammates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her part, Yang wasn\u2019t as concerned with getting lost but still feared what would happen if Weiss or Ruby lost track of her, or worse if she was found by someone with less benevolent intentions. She feared for Blake as well, knowing how easy it would be to lose her partner now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFitfully, the two shrunken girls feel into a restless sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of hours later, Yang awoke to find\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yang was rudely awakened by a sudden sensation like a vice closing around her chest, her eyes darting down to see the manicured fingers of the heiress curling around her like steel cables. She had barely a moment to note Blake still sleeping fitfully near the edge of the bed before the hand retracted, lifting her from the sheets and drawing her back towards Weiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning her head slightly, Yang prepared to give her captive a piece of her mind for the rough treatment, only to see Weiss\u2019s sleeping face through the sliver of moonlight that filtered through the curtains. She attempted to raise her voice to alert Weiss to her actions but found that the tight grip on her chest was compressing her lungs and made any vocalisation impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA soft sound escaped Weiss\u2019s throat as her fingers began to roam across Yang\u2019s body, stretching and squishing her shrunken friend without hesitation. What her teammates didn\u2019t know was that Weiss was a fidgety person by nature, who dealt with stress best by manipulating things with her fingers or toes, but found such conduct far too unladylike to do while awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut today had been a stressful day and her unconscious mind had no such concerns about appearances, happily directing her pointer finger to wrap around Yang\u2019s head and squeeze tight, flattening her friend\u2019s skull and unintentionally removing any chance of immediate retaliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore, Yang had admittedly found Blake\u2019s squishy nature kind of funny, and though she\u2019d been sorry about it, she hadn\u2019t been too concerned when she\u2019d accidentally crushed the girl\u2019s chest. Now though, with the chance to experience herself just how much this hurt, she figured she\u2019d really have to apologise later. The crushing of her head left her disoriented, even as she felt the rest of her body being pulled in every direction, feeling almost like she was being torn apart. Rather than tear, however, her body flattened and stretched between the heiress\u2019s nimble fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnjoying the feeling of what her unconsciousness mind interpreted as nothing more than a piece of putty, Weiss quickly added her second hand to the first, pinching and stretching the putty between her hands, thoroughly enjoyed the texture of her new toy. Her nails quickly snagged on the brawler\u2019s panties and bra, ripping away Yang\u2019s last shred of clothing without remorse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Yang this was agony. She could feel Weiss\u2019s fingertips pressing through her skin, the sharp nails threatening, but never quite managing, to tear through her. As one leg was caught in a gap between the fingers of Weiss\u2019s right hand, her arms were gripped tightly between the palm and thumb of the girls\u2019 left hand and a simple pull saw her body stretched impossible thin for a moment before the hands came smashing back together, easily pancaking her between them. This action was repeated over and over, even as the heiress\u2019s fingers continued to pinch at her skin, catching one limb at a time and stretching hem in directions they were never meant to stretch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while Weiss hummed happily, even as she forced her friend\u2019s head between the gaps of each finger, picking out the small amounts of sweat and grime between each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to feel that texture closer, Weiss soon switched from simply playing with Yang in her hands to rubbing the girl against her body, trailing the flattened, and now almost unrecognisable, form of her teammate along her shoulders and neck, soaking up the small amount of sweat on her skin with the surprisingly absorbent girl. Through a cruel twitch of fate, Yang was facedown for this experience, her mouth and tongue forced to give her friend an impromptu tongue bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Yang things seemed like they couldn\u2019t get much worse. The bony ridges of Weiss\u2019s clavicle and shoulders were helping to flatten her out even further and there was nothing she could do to stop the heiress\u2019s sweat from soaking into her skin. The worse came when Weiss casually slipped her under the top of her nightie and used her flattened body to scratch deep within her armpits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Weiss was someone who valued cleanliness, but in her worry over Blake and Yang she\u2019d neglected to take her customary shower before bed and her armpits maintained a deep coating of sweat and grime that would usually be absent. Fortunately for Weiss, and unfortunately for Yang, the shrunken girl\u2019s body made the perfect little sweat rag, thoroughly cleaning the heiress\u2019s body as she was mercilessly ground into the larger girl\u2019s flesh, the fingers at her back continuing to pinch and knead her squishy body and ensure no possibility of reforming any time soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more the sleeping girl scrubbed, the cleaner her armpits became, while her shrunken teammate became increasingly dirty and unrecognisable, her features obscured by a thick layer of grime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally done with her armpits, but not with her prey, Weiss shifted the flattened girl once again, pushing her hand further under her nightie and beginning to rub Yang against the underside of her breasts, a soft moan escaping her throat at the stimulating contact. Although Weiss\u2019s endowments were notably smaller than Yang\u2019s, and Blake\u2019s for that matter, at their current scale difference each breast was several times the brawler\u2019s size and she quickly found herself drowning in the slightly sweaty flesh of the heiress\u2019s chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed that Weiss had found her favourite location for Yang as she continued to rub her friend under and between her breasts, quiet sounds of pleasure escaping her throat as she continued her unintentional torment. Stimulated further by the contact, she began rubbing Yang\u2019s face into her stiffening nipples, alternating between them at a languid pace, even as she continued to rub the little huntress-in-training across the entirety of her now slightly heaving chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn several occasions the tiny student almost got left behind on Weiss\u2019s skin, her increasingly sticky body adhering itself to the quickly warming flesh, only to get peeled off again by the heiress\u2019 insistent fingers and subjected to more agonising minutes of being dragged across her friend\u2019s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually after nearly 30 minutes of this torment Weiss finally settled down, breathing deeply as she returned to a deeper state of rest. With one last moment of energy she lifted her arm and\u2026</span></div></div>",

She shut her eyes the second she hit the ground, but as she rolled to a standstill the putty ball finally relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquinting through the darkness, Yang thought she saw something move. A feeling of dread started to bubble up inside her as she began to struggle to reform- only to feel an immesurable weight slowly steam roll over her. The little ball gave a deflated puff as she quickly worked out that her sister's rump was the one rolling over her tiny form.<br>\r\n\"MFFF!\" She winced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby rolled over on her back, drooling from her mouth as she happily dreamed on. Her mouth cooed open happily as she wiggled her hips over the warm, bouncy object between her cheeks.<br>\r\n\"Bouncy Jello-\" She mumbled, grinding her ass onto the little blob while she dreamed of jumping on giant puddings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang screamed internally as the thick smell of the giant girls unwashed pajamas was pounded into her- a damp spot in the battered clothes showed how much Ruby had moved around in the night, causing her to sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA breath of relief fluttered on the tiny Yang as Ruby rolled off. She felt thankful that her sister had such a short attention span, but also worried that she would get flattened again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby's drooling smile turned into a frown, shivering slightly as she moved from the warm spot in the bed. Lifting her rear up, she shuffled over the flattened Yang before dropping her hip down. Poor Yang didn't stand a chance as she wiggled in place, the rear now much harder with Ruby flipped on the side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBouncing a few times to get comfortable, she accidentally obliterated her sister.<br>\r\n\"Warm...\" Ruby sighed, happily mumbing in her sleep. Yang groaned with the bed springs as she was pinned in place for all of five minutes before the giant girl was on the move again- flipping back onto her back she hovered her ass menacingly over Yangs body. The flattened ball shuddered- wondering what was going on- before feeling a drop of fear enter her as a pair of hands slid down to grab her pajama's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby yawned, her eyes half open as she slid down her pajamas.<br>\r\n\"There... we... go...\" She stumbled with her words, dropping her sweaty ass onto the warm spot once more. She cooed happily as nostalgic warmth flooded her tired body. Barely functioning and half asleep, her eyes slowly fluttered to a close as she tried to curl her feet up onto the warm bit. Her dreams turning to the times when her and Yang used to share a bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did she know, they actually where sharing a bed. Yang rolled her eyes upwards in disgust as she felt Ruby's toes grab and stretch her tongue out. The hard working feet dumping the days workout onto her sensitive taste buds while the rest of her was ground up by Ruby's swamp ass. Yang tried to call out in desperation as she was forced to give  a tongue bath to her sister, unable to stop the event that was happening as Ruby's dreams switched up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang was obliterated as Ruby rolled over- her disgust rising as she tasted the taste of sex upon her lips while her head was slammed into the bed by her toned abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 18 year old girl frowned, grinding softly down on the bed as the warmth teased her. The dreams in her head flicked between naughty thoughts and candy as she unconsciously struggled to decide on which dream to have.</span></div></div>",

Groaning slightly, she rolled over to face the other way and tried to go back to sleep, only for her eyes to snap open again as she realised that her other bed-mate, her tiny partner Blake, wasn\u2019t where she left her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStumbling slightly as Weiss shifted behind her, Yang sprung to her feet and looked around desperately for her little friend. Carefully stepping to the edge of the bed, she attempted to scan the floor, only to find that her eyes couldn\u2019t penetrate the deep shadows below. But in any case Yang doubted Blake would have just fallen off the bed like that, not with how ninja the girl usually was. Besides, at her size it would have been quite a distance to travel to even reach the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne possibility crossed off her list, the blonde brawler turn to get a proper look at her now giant teammate, and for the first time realised just why the bed was slightly rocking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point Weiss had shifted off her side to lay on her back, her hands fisted in her sheets as her head lolled to the side and slight pants and quite moans escaped her throat. If Yang didn\u2019t know any better she would have said the giant girl was pleasuring herself. But that wouldn\u2019t be like Weiss, and in any case both hands were accounted for as far as Yang could see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn contrast to her mostly still upper body, the heiress\u2019s lower body was in constant movement, her feet alternating between rubbing furiously into the sheets and sliding against one another either sole to sole or one atop the other. From this distance, Yang couldn\u2019t see the details of what was going on down there, but for some reason she had a bad feeling about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss\u2019s issues weren\u2019t her priority right now though, she needed to find out what happened to Blake.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Half an hour before Yang woke up, Weiss\u2019s left hand had begun roaming over the sheets, looking for something to grip and play with as the heiress slept. Ordinarily such an action would simply result in the hand fisting in the sheets, grabbing the edge of Weiss\u2019s own pillow or perhaps trailing across her own flesh. On this night however, as the hand ran along the edge of her bed, it found something peculiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss\u2019s fingertips bumped against a small object near the edge of the bed, nearly knocking it off the precipice and into the darkness below. An unconscious desire not to lose this new potential toy however sent the heiress\u2019s hand into immediate action, extending slightly further and pushing down on the mystery object to keep it in place. It was then that the object\u2019s squishy nature became apparent, compacting without resistance under the weight of the sweaty palm even as the curious fingers closed in to engage in further investigation, the entire hand quickly retracting back towards its owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Blake she had been sleeping fitfully when an immense force suddenly ran into her, jolting her awake even as it sent her careening towards the end of the bed. Panicking, the little Faunus reached for a weapon that wasn\u2019t there but barely had time to acknowledge its absence before a massive weight suddenly slammed down on top of her, a feeling not unlike all of her bones breaking at once filling her body as she found herself rendered nearly two dimensional in an instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever it was that had landed on her lifted away, but much to her displeasure Blake found herself going with it, her flattened form struck to the slightly moist object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only when five long shadows fell across her that Blake finally realised where she was and what had happened. Whimpering quietly as the fingers of her supposed friend descended upon her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout mercy or hesitation Weiss\u2019s playful fingers quickly caught the little Faunus between the tips of her middle and index fingers, immediately clamping down and squishing her friend into an almost unrecognisable blob of flesh, which she proceeded to happily roll between her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat her teammates didn\u2019t know was that Weiss was a fidgety person by nature, who dealt with stress best by manipulating things with her fingers or toes, but found such conduct far too unladylike to do while awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut today had been a stressful day and the heiress\u2019s unconscious mind had no such concerns about appearances, her thumb quickly moving to join her fingers and vigorously rubbing the unfortunate Blake into a thin disk of flesh, unknowingly ripping away her undergarments in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately to Blake, the sudden discovery of this little ball of putty had roused Weiss into a half-awake state, just not enough for her to recognise or remember her little friend. Awake enough now to prioritise her actions, the sleepy heiress rolled the flattened Faunus between her thumb and index finger for a moment before casually flicking her towards the end of the bed and her waiting feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScared and disoriented, Blake threw through the air with no concept of where she was going or what fate awaited her. Crashing down on the bedding with what should have been a sickening crunch but was more of a disheartening splat, she tried desperately to reform enough to get away, to run\u2026 somewhere, anywhere before Weiss got her hands on her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe needn\u2019t have worried about the last part though, because it wasn\u2019t Weiss\u2019s hands that were coming for her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Faunus\u2019 excellent night vision allowed her to see as the heiress\u2019s foot slammed down beside her, narrowly missing her stricken form as it ground into the bedsheets and shifted from side to side, searching for its prey. Limbs partially reformed, Blake dragged her body across the bed away from the hungry toes, only to freeze in terror as another shadow fell across her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss\u2019s second foot came down without remorse, instantly flattened her helpless teammate beneath her toes. The sensation of Blake\u2019s tiny body being squished into the gap between her toes and the ball of her foot brought a deep moan to the sleeping girl\u2019s throat, her toes immediately shifting to squish the Faunus further, rhythmically crushing her friend between and beneath their mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust crushing her just this wasn\u2019t enough though, and the heiress began grinding her toes and her entire foot into the bed, placing as much of her weight as possible onto Blake as she happily ground the little Faunus into the gunk between her toes and the sweat and dirt beneath her feet. Weiss had skipped her shower in her concern over her friends, and the sweat and grime from wearing her shoes all day was still present between her toes and beneath her soles, though it was now slowly being transferred from her feet to the unfortunate Blake, staining deep into her pale skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Blake she was in a world of agony and constant crushing movement. She had been squished so badly that she could now longer even make sense of what was happening to her, her senses rattled and her body a never ending mass of painful sensations. The poor Faunus barely even noticed as she was gripped and lifted between the toes as the foot under which she was trapped turned on its side, her vision returning for just a moment to see the heiress\u2019s other foot before the two appendages crashed together, the toes of the previously neglected foot happily snapping her up and grinding her into the fleshy sole of her original captor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis torture seemed to go for an eternity, with Weiss happily mewling above while Blake was squished and flattened beneath her feet, until eventually\u2026</span></div></div>",

The toes on either side of her still had a grip on her body, and shifted slightly every time she tried to move, frequently undoing what little progress she had made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the Faunus was painfully aware that the opposite foot was still idly scratching at the side of the foot she was stuck to, possibly only a moment away from squishing her once again, and redoubled her efforts to escape, managing to squirm one arm free from the crushing embrace of the heiress\u2019s toes and using to help pry the rest of her upper body out of her smelly prison. It was only thanks to the thick layer of gunk now covering Blake\u2019s body that she was able to escape at all, her moist body sliding disgustingly against the equally moist flesh of the larger girl\u2019s toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling her left leg free, the Faunus focused all of her attention on pulling out her right leg, knowing that it was now all that stood between her and freedom. Unfortunately, the limb was still crushed tightly between her friend\u2019s toes, which had only tightened their grip now that the rest of her had slipped free. Starting to become desperate, Blake placed a hand on either toe and attempted to pry them open by force, sliding her hands all over the sweaty flesh as she tried to get a good grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the tiny girl was so focused on freeing her leg that she didn\u2019t even notice as the heiress\u2019s other foot stopped its scratching movements and started to shift towards her, and the slight \u2018itch\u2019 she was now creating. Blake only warnings were the foot she was attached to suddenly turning sideways and the casting of an ominous shadow before Weiss\u2019s right big toe rammed into her back, forcing her entire body back into the toes she had just been removing herself from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorse, Weiss\u2019s unconscious mind was now laser-focused on removing the itch between her toes and the entire set of toes of her right foot began rubbing back and forth along the toe crevice of her left foot. Each toe ran over Blake, pressing down brutally as they smeared her across the gap between the heiress\u2019s left toes, stretching her body across the warm flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimultaneously, the toes of the left foot began curling and clenching, grabbing any bit of the Faunus they could reach and happily crushing her within their sweaty folds. In just a few moments Blake was in worse shape then she\u2019d been before she tried to escape, and in a few moments more she was wishing she could return to the ways things had been then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Weiss\u2019s toes were unrelenting, and they continuing to grind and squish their unlucky prisoner until eventually\u2026</span></div></div>",

Her hand flopped around in search of her pillow without luck before finally giving up and opening her eyes. Her eyes attempted to adjust to the darkness of the room as her hand searched lazily for the edge of the bed. The texture felt slightly off for some reason, her hand also couldn't reach the edge of the bed. Sensing trouble, she slowly stood up, finding a low ceiling locking her in place.<br>\r\n\"What the- Ruby? Blake? Weiss?\" Yang yelled, pushing against the fabric above her to discover it was malleable. Confused, she wandered forward, wisking her way through the strange material before eventually reaching the light. She suddenly realised with shock as to where she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the room, on the top bunk, Blake was having the same dialema. Being a more quiet sleeper then Yang, there were no gaps in the covers to come out of other then by her pillow.<br>\r\n\"I thought that mosquito looked weird\" She muttered, carefully wandering through the darkness. Unsure of what actually happened, she was taken by surprise as the floor gave way. Even with her cat like reflexes, she was unable to prevent her fall off the edge of the bed without her gear. Not even Yang, who stood on the other side of the room, could see her falling down towards Weiss's level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo caught up with where she should go, Yang simply gathered her thoughts, thinking through how she was going to be found. Looking over the edge of her bed, Yang gulped. After being catapulted and launched in the air multiple times, even Yang found the height distressing. She scanned the floor for some kind of landing pad, or something to help her climb down but with Weiss's nagging everything that could of been used had been tucked under her bed.<br>\r\n\"This is why slobbing out every now and then isn't a bad thing...!\" Yang joked nervously, stepping away from the edge of the bed. Sunlight was flooding into the room from the curtains, it would only be a matter of time before someone woke up and checked her bed. Sighing with relief, she stood as far in the open as she could to help her be spotted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Blake tried to guide herself towards the soft matruss of Weiss's bed, the long drop gave her only a few moments to comprehend what was happening before crashing into the cover. Her hand slipped briefly as she almost tumbled fully out of bed, glancing behind her she saw Weiss's open boot. At Blakes size, without any tools, she realised it would be a struggle to escape the long boot before everyone woke up.<br>\r\n\"Weiss!\" She called out, grasping at the material in an attempt to get a better grip. Her hand couldn't make much of a dent though and her fingers couldn't fit in between the gaps of thread very well. Sighing, she began to climb towards the sleeping goddess before her- </span></div></div>",

Unable to regain her self in time, her vision tunnelled out as she slid directly into the boot, bouncing down Weiss's insole with little control before coming to rest at the toe section. The faint smell of perfume wafted up her nose as she slid to a stop, while unnoticable by a normal sized person, to a tiny nose it was relatively strong. Not wasting any time, Blake yanked up her shrunken clothes over her face, she gave thanks for Weiss's obsessive cleanness as she set off climbing up the sloped insole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner had she reached the top had she noticed a shower stop running. Blake felt her heart jump in her mouth as she realised how little time she had left.<br>\r\n\"This day sucks-\" Blake sighed, squinting upwards towards the light. Without boots or gear, the climb seemed near impossible from here, even with her skilled climbing skills. Looking at the slight wear and tear of the insole convinced her that it had to me made though, and quickly. As clean as Weiss was, Blake doubted she would last long under the weight of Weiss's steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hardly started climbing before Weiss ominously loomed over the boot, swearing under her breath, Blake immediatly let go.

Mimicking the colour, the cold toes wiggled comfortably into position, crushing Blake between the second and third toes.<br>\r\n\"Oh- god\" Blake shivered, almost glad the foot was heating up in the enclosed boot, she struggled to get away while the foot lay at rest but the icy grip Weiss had on her body prevented all movement. Blake almost gagged as the strawberry lotion Weiss used this morning coated her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before the pressure began to increase, having done up her shoes it sounded like the unaware jailer to her prison was about to leave. Trying to bang on the huge wall that grinded into her, Blake tried one last time to get Weiss's attention before the pressure got to high. With her entire body pinned, she opened her mouth and attempted to bite into the sensitive skin yet she couldn't get a grip. \"WEISS!\" Blake cried out once more before the toes curled up, pushing her into the lotion smothered toes as the world tilted. Even with the pressure, the g-force managed to push the tiny cat further into the compressed toes as Weiss lifted her foot up, not given time to process this event, the foot uncurled, plummeting down to the insole with devistating force. Blake could only so much as groan as the foot steam rolled up the insole, all of Weiss's weight focused on the tip of the shoe as she prepared to kick off again. Clenched, released, pounded, Blake fearfully worried that she would fall under the heel at any point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weiss!\" Yang yelled from the bed, \"Ruby!\" She gazed back and forth to the two girls, watching them wander past. Thankfully Weiss stood close enough for her skirt to touch the bed. With bated breath, Yang ran and dived for it, almost rolling off the moving surface as Weiss walked along. The blond bomshell gave a whistle of relief as she started her struggle up the battle skirt. She listened to the thud of Ruby's boots and the clack of Weiss's boots as the thought of getting crushed suddenly occurred to her. \"Don't think Yang, climb!\" She muttered to herself, gazing up at the long stretch of material she had to traverse to make it close to the hip. To calm herself, she listened to the two bickering about lectures, shivering when they mentioned training. The fact that Blake hadn't been seen yet made her a bit nervous, what if she was shrunk too? Trapped on the top bunk of her own bed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did anyone know, Blake was a lot closer then they thought. Wedged tightly between Weiss's toes, she had already started to sweat. The heat had slowly started to rise as Weiss navigated around, swirling the stained Blake up and down her toes. The gforces occasionally forced her out before being recaptured by the unaware captor, the lotion used assisting Blake getting tossed around. Not having the energy to keep up, the black haired fauna could only weakly flail as she was used as a tiny foot rag. Eventually, she ended up slipping out, slowly sliding under the ball of the foot. Without much energy left, she was tossed and squeezed by the slender toes above her, it was only a matter of time before she became a tattoo on Weiss's foot at this rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the foot came to a standstill. The exhausted Blake panted under the toes, to tired to move. The temperature of the foot was bordering uncomfortable as it loomed above her. \"That was close\" Blake sighed, shakily wiping the sweat and lotion from her eye. She worried what would happen when  Weiss started to sweat as well. Not even 30 seconds passed before the foot started to shift, realising she wasn't out of it yet, Blake tried to get to a safer place.</span></div></div>",

Yang waved her arms, hopping up and down towards Weiss as she passed without luck. \"How on earth am I meant to get anyones attention from here?\" Yang sighed, peering over the edge of the bed again before wandering towards the makeshift staircase they had built for the upper bunks. It was a long trek that Yang wanted to avoid but it had to be done if she wanted any help. She peeked over to the bathroom as she listened to the shower turning on, secretly cursing herself for not showering before going to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for a fully clothed Weiss to burst from the shower, her eyes finally gazed over at Yangs bed with a minor amount of shock.<br>\r\n\"Yang beat me out of bed? That's new... still didn't bother to make it...\" She gave a little sigh, resisting the urge to clean up after her dorm mate as she climbed up to wake Ruby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang rolled her eyes at the comment, they both liked eachother but there were some things that they could clash over every now and then.<br>\r\n\"I did leave my coat on her bed once... hehe\" Yang nervously laughed, watching the giant wake up her sister. The blonde slowed down, she was no where near the makeshift ladder, but she still felt nervous watching Weiss hop down from it. After a few seconds, a panicking Ruby dove from the top bunk, thudding loudly on the ground with a little 'ouch' before stumbling quickly towards her clothes draw to get dressed. It looked like she was late again. Yang shook her head playfully, happy to see somethings as 'normal'. The shower turned on and off quickly before a semi dressed Ruby ran out with a tooth brush in her mouth, muttering something along the lines of being late. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of watching her sister, she noticed Ruby stopping to look towards her,<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Yang yelled, suddenly remembering her situation as Ruby approached, her voice boomed overhead as she did the typical question of 'where's Yang' followed by Weiss's own explanation. Yang sighed once more, wondering how she would ever get out of this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was until Ruby turned round, her black panties not hesitating to bare down it's full weight on the tiny tank,<br>\r\n\"Wh-\" Yang yelled, before the crushing might of her leader and sister flattened her out onto the titanic left cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm leaving without you!\" Called Weiss, as Ruby roughly jammed her nylons over her feet.<br>\r\n\"No,no,no! I'll be like- five seconds!\" Ruby yelled, hopping up with her new 'Yang' panties design. She finished pulling up her nylons, covering the shocked figure before dashing into the bathroom to spit/ return her tooth brush. \"Ready! Is Blake already out too?\" Ruby called, slipping on her boots and jogging to catch up. All the while not noticing the Yang tattoo bouncing perfectly with her bubble butt. Yang could barely make any noise as she lay flat on her sisters cheeks, as she bounced though, she could feel herself slowly peeling off.</span></div></div>",

She heard the voice of one of the members of team RWBY booming in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Pyrrha, it's Yang. Sorry to wake you up, but me and Blake are going to the gym. I can't find my sports bra, so I figured since you have the breasts closest in size to mine, taking your bra would work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha rolled over to get a better look at her neighbor, and noticed the blonde was wearing a pair of short black running shorts and a lowcut golden tanktop. Pyrrha also noticed that her bed looked a little different, but paid no mind to it as she was still half asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang walked into the dorm, wondering wear all the JNPR members were. \"I wonder where all the JNPR members are\" Yang said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about, Yang?\" Pyrrha stretched as she questioned Yang. \"I'm right here, and Jaune's over there.\" Looking over to the bed next to her, she noticed there was seemingly no one in the bed. Looking around more at her bed, Pyrrha screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing a light highpitched noise coming from Pyrrhas sheets, Yang glanced over, seeing nothing. \"Oh well. Hmm, if JNPR, and more importantly Pyrrha isn't here, then that means she won't know that I 'borrowed' her bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha screamed again as she nearly had a mental breakdown. \"Why is everything so big? Did I shrink? Did others shrink? Is that why I can't see Jaune?\" Looking over at Jaune's bed, Pyrrha was relieved to see Jaune, and then angry to see him watching Yang take off her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune had been woken up when he heard Yang talking about bras, and then freaked out when he found out he had been shrunk. But his nerves were calmed, and other parts excited, as he noticed Yang bending down to rumage through Pyrrhas bras. Getting a great view of Yang's large butt, Jaune's penis stiffened up. Then seeing Yang's big breasts jiggling free above him, Jaune forgot all about the situation and unbuckled his pants. \"I shouldn't do this. This is Yang, our friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha turned beet red as she watched Jaune masterbating to Yang struggling to fit Pyrrhas massive bra onto her behemoth breasts. \"Oh, it's too tight. My boobs are just too big!\" Not wasting any time, Pyrrha slid down her bed sheets down to the floor, and hopped onto Jaunes sheets, climbing up to his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune simply enjoyed the show, trying to hold back as his strokes got harder and faster. But then her heard a voice behind him. Turning around, he noticed Pyrrha stomping up to him. Jumping to his feet, trying to pull up his pants, Jaune turned to greet Pyrrha, very embarrased. However, when she got near, he noticed he had to look up at her.<br>\r\nWhere she was just a little smaller than a mouse, Jaune was a lot smaller.<br>\r\nHow big was she compared to him?</span></div></div>",

She had such a late night last night, and she needed her beauty rest. While her friends from teams RWBY and JNPR decided to have a relaxing night of board game and girl talk, something Ren and Jaune seemed unusually okay with, Yang decided to go out and see where the night took her. After one too many drinks with her bar buddies, she tumbled back to the dorm and passed out immediately. No it a morning, and she was exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking her eyes open, she looked across the room to Weiss' bed, only to find the ice heiress missing. \"Huh, early riser as always\" she mused to herself. She swung herself out of bed and stood up, stretching. She looked to check on her little sister, who'd normally be snuggling next to Zwei, but Ruby's bed was empty as well. \"Probably mooching cookies away from JNPR.\" As she adjusted her tight pajama top, she turned around hoping to find her partner, the cat faunas, sleeping on the top bunk, but she was also nowhere to be seen. \"Lil' kitty's probably reading some dumb book in the library.\" She shrug it off and goes to her dresser to put on some fresh clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby Rose was in bed, snuggly, cuddling with Zwei, dreaming of cookies and beating Grimm to a messy pulp.

She was the size of a doll, shrunk right out of her clothes, ontop of her pillow. She knew she needed help, and fast.<br>\r\nBeing on the top bunk proved to be a problem, because it was incredibly terrifying trying to climb down to the desk to hopefully get attention. She only made it to one of the books holding her bed up when she tripped, and fell down, down, and down. She was just happy she got to look at Yang one last time, grumbling in her sleep, before she...<br>\r\nSPLAT! She turned into a splatter in some sort of soft material. But she was okay... Well, not okay, just not dead.<br>\r\n\"Did it hurt when you fell from heaven? More like did it hurt when you fell from the top bunk!\" The answer was yes, painfully yes. Every nerve in her body told her 'ow' as her gooed body slowly scrutched back together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like an hour of reforming, but was more like five minutes, Blake was finally in a humanoid shape. She was still gooey, but she could move her arms. Unfortunately, this couldn't save her from the events to come.<br>\r\nHer partner, the buxom boxer was in plain view as she got up. The blonde was gigantic, finally putting a perspective on how small Blake really was. She couldn't believe it, she was probably not even as tall as Yang's foot was long.<br>\r\nThe faunus' existential crisis was short lived, however, as she was distracted by a large pair of breasts freely bouncing above her. And then was distracted further as Yang turned around, revealing an impressive butt to the squished huntress. Blake was so entranced by Yang's naked form that she barely even noticed the giant reaching down at her.<br>\r\n\"Did she she me?\" Blake asked herself, \"Is she mad at me for, <i>um</i>, respectfully admiring her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the world seemed to shift as Yang picked up the golden cup she was stuck to. \"What's happening? Why is everything changing!\"<br>\r\nWith all the bouncing, Blake managed to notice a similar cup she was stuck to attatched my a small strap. And after coming face to breast with Yang, Blake realized where she was, and where she was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Yang! Please! I'm in here! Don't put your bra on!\" Blake pleaded and pleaded, but all for naught as Yang was to focused on trying to untangle the bra straps to hear her. Blake figured her only option was trying to become unstuck from her cupped prison.<br>\r\nShe struggled and pulled with all her might, but Yang figured out the straps, and the beasts were coming closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, almost unstuck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut does she make it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</div></span></div></div>",

Blake looked down below, mostly noticing the lack of soft landing available.<br>\r\nShe reached Yang's waist when she decided it would be best not to splat again. As luck, and writing convenience, would have it, Blake was mere inches away from Yang's long, slender legs. She drove her falling form towards the legs and grabbed on, sliding down the smooth surface. Unfortunately, the momentum built by the time she grabbed on was too great to allow a graceful landing, instead roughly landing on her butt at the destination: Yang's foot.<br>\r\nLuckily for Blake, she was on top of the foot, unable to be squished by hungry soles. Unfortunately for Blake, Yang started walking around, looking for some clean shorts, making Blake hold on for dear life as she was constantly almost thrown off to the cruel floor.<br>\r\nHowever, with each step, she heard what sort of sounded like a muffled scream. When Yang finally stopped moving, Blake decided to investigate. \"Hello?\" Blake asked. \"Anyone there?\" <br>\r\n\"MMMPH! MPH MMMPH!\" Muffled screaming again! But from where?<br>\r\nUsing her cat-like hearing, she tracked the source of the screams to... Under Yang's foot? Oh no.<br>\r\n\"Anyone there? Hello?\" Blake tried to lift the giantess' foot, unsuccessfully. \"Look, I'm sorry about your prediciment, and I wish I could help, but I don't know how to help you!\"<br>\r\nAs if the universe heard this, or more rather me, Yang shifted her heel up, revealing most of her sole to the world. Blake heard a loud coughing coming from a pale speck attatched to it, and promptly investigated. Peeling off the splattered speck, and unfolding it, she realized it was a chewing gum version of none other than Weiss Schnee, only a lot smaller.<br>\r\nAt full height, the new Weiss would only be about waist level to Blake's shrunken form, putting her about 3\". And she would have loved to complain about it, but she was too tuckered out from being flattened and such.<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, Weiss! I've got to get her out of here, and fast!\"<br>\r\nTieing Weiss around her waist like a sweater, Blake struggled to climb Mount Foot, the only safe place to be when you're on the floor. Successfully making it, Blake found Weiss' face and brought it to her chest. \"It's okay, now. You're safe here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Blake, she was dead wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, these shorts are A-OK\" the goddess above said, inspecting a pair of black booty shorts. Lifting her foot, with Blake and Weiss with her, Yang soon brought it down through the leg hole, throwing Blake off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does she, and Weiss, end up?</span></div></div>",

Blake had found the box about a week ago while cleaning, but Weiss snatched it away before anybody could have looked inside, turning as red as Ruby's hood.<br>\r\nGetting down on all fours, Yang brought her butt into the air as she scrounged the space underneath Weiss' bed, pushing aside this and that, before she grabbed the oak box they found from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on the edge of Weiss' bed, she flung the top of the box. And woo-Nelly, did it make Yang red!<br>\r\n--------------------<br>\r\nIt was bad enough Yang had thought she was a wedgie. It was worse when Yang's slingshot shots whipped against her, pushing Weiss' face more and more into her anus through the cotton fabric. And it was even worse still when Yang's simple walking caused her big butt to squish her like a can, squeezing against her like two big, firm, but soft...<br>\r\nBut the worst for Weiss, at least for now, was Yangs sudden change in position, which brought her ass into the air.<br>\r\nIn addition to the sudden movement feeling like the space shuttle launching, Weiss was also greeted with Yang's cheeks collapsing in on her, the pressure pushing them all over Weiss' back as they pushed and rubbed her more into Yangs back hole.<br>\r\n\"Why, world? Why?\" Weiss was having an unpleasant time, to say the least.<br>\r\n--------------------<br>\r\nYang grazed her finger across the collection of 'toys' Weiss had hidden in the box. A deep blush smothering her face, she picked one up, holding it by its base, admiring it.<br>\r\n\"Long, white and slender. Interesting choice, Weiss. Naughty girl!\" Yang couldn't keep herself from rubbing her thighs together, thinking about Weiss' vibrator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shouldn't, I really shouldn't.\" Yang eyed the length of the toy, about 6\" long. \"Well, Phyrrah might still be 'getting ready,' so I have some time to kill. But it's Weiss, it's been <i>in</i> her.\" She gripped it by it's base, licking her lips, and shifting in her seat. \"But, really, is that such a bad thing?\"<br>\r\n--------------------<br>\r\nBlake was trying hard not to enjoy this, being pressed against her best friends panties. She should have been scared, trying desperately to escape, but her feral side made her want it.<br>\r\nAs Yang's body shufted and moved, she was only pushed more against it, making her animalistic hormones crazy. Hesitantly, she pushed her face into the moistening fabric and breathed a long sniff of her womanhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she was forced into the spot as Yang's muscular thighs were brought together, bringing Blake closer to it. Blake tried to control herself, but with sex drive kicking in, the trapped faunus wiggled her thighs, trying desperately to feel something against Yang's body. The moistening fabric only drew Blake into a deeper frenzy, barely able to stop herself from biting.<br>\r\n--------------------<br>\r\nRuby knew that this was likely her only opportunity to find a friendly face, even if that face was contorted into a weird smile and was desperately try<span class=\"cgrey\">ing not to lick one of weiss' back massagers. So in a swan dive, she fell off the bed. The winds hurt her eyes, but she was determi</span>ned to get Yang's attention.<br>\r\nWith a plomp and squinch, Ruby opened her eyes to see where she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was...</div></span></div></div>",

The pain!\" Ruby sat between her sister's feet, groaning in pain.<br>\r\nShe tried to scream out at Yang, but it looked like she was to preoccupided testing out Weiss's back massager to notice.<br>\r\n\"Well, what do I do now? I'm to scrunchy to get up, and Yang's leaving soon.\"<br>\r\nBefore she could make a plan, however, Ruby noticed Yang's scrunching feet moving irradically.

An aroused smile spread across her lips as it stimulated her sensitive breasts.<br>\r\nDeciding to take it further, Yang brought the buzzing tip to the moistening spot on her shorts, quiet moans escaping her mouth.<br>\r\nShifting her thighs around the point of pleasure, her legs and feet squirmed across the floor. She bit her lower lip and arched her back.<br>\r\n--------------------<br>\r\nBlake first felt the salty juices beginning to moisten the fabric. Then she felt the powerful grinding of a buzzing goddess push her suddenly into her warden's pussy through soaked panties.<br>\r\nThe vibrations did more than tingle Blake; it nearly sent her over the edge. </span></div></div>",

As she was forced closer to the larger orb, her torso began stretching across the rounded front, flattening like Jell-O in a compactor. Her limbs and head were the next to flatten, initially simply being pushed into flesh, the forceful pull of the bra dug her face into the breast, flattening like a grape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Blake started, \"there are worse places to be crushed and flattened.

Why isn't this cup fitting like usual?\"<br>\r\nAttempting to remedy the discomfort, Yang shifted the bra straps, pulling the bra up, left, right, left again, rubbing the cups against her breasts.

It's not like anything bad's going to happen.\" Yang adjusted her bra one more time before throwing on her signature yellow top, showing off her form well.<br>\r\nShe picked up some shorts that were probably dirty, and then remembered that Ruby had a secret stash of cookies. \"Well, just a few wouldn't hurt. I'm going down to the gym anyways.\"<br>\r\nShe waltzed her way to the bedfort Ruby had set-up, throwing the shorts away for later.<br>\r\n--------------------<br>\r\nRuby couldn't believe it. Yang was going to steal her cookies!? How could she? \"Yang, if I ever get big again I'm kicking your butt!\" Ruby yelled at Yang, knowing she wouldn't hear.<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Ruby's fiestiness would soon falter as Yang climbed onto her bed, nearly knocking down one of the sticks holding the bedfort up, and nearly crushing Ruby right then and there. Zwei cowered behind little red's legs as she looked up to the immense bottom of her sister, nearly bare save for a golden strip of fabric being swallowed by her cheeks.<br>\r\n\"Uh oh...\"<br>\r\n--------------------<br>\r\n\"Where are those cookies?\" Yang asked no one, \"How does she always hide them so well?\"<br>\r\nCrawling on all fours, her chest pressed into the mattress, dragging along as she scuttled forward, checking every pillow Ruby had in her bedfort.<br>\r\n\"Does... <i>This one</i> have cookies? No. How about..<i>. This one</i>, Ha ha! No.\" She checked pillow after pillow, until, finally...<br>\r\n\"This one has a box in it! Jackpot!\" She got up, sitting down on the bed, triumphantly holding up the pillow full of cookies.<br>\r\n--------------------<br>\r\nThe bouncing of her chest was hell for Blake. It was like being shaken in a pepper shaker that was also a water balloon. (Not as fun as it sounds) Her head spun with each up and down Yang forced on her. The tight-fitting shirt didn't help, simply just pushing her deeper into the Yang.<br>\r\nThe prison sentence - or rather the bouncing portion - got to its worst part as Yangs boobs felt like they were launching Blake to space and back. Yang's jumping onto the bed had caused her breasts to slingshot around, jumping with such force in each direction.<br>\r\nAnd then, if that wasn't enough, the flattening by the breasts, bra, and shirt was apparently not enough, as Blake's prison was slammed into a mattress, making Blake flatten across her breasts more that she thought possible. The dragging certainly didn't make it better for Blake.<br>\r\nShe just wanted to leave here, go back to bed, and never leave there again.<br>\r\n--------------------<br>\r\nRuby tried to run away as her sisters mountainous ass fell, but she didn't have time, and was forced up with the panties between her cheeks. Luckily, Zwei got away, and ran to Ruby's head pillow.<br>\r\n\"At least he made it. Good luck, little buddy.\" Ruby gave a Zwei a nod, an appropriate alternative to saluting, seeings how her arms were being squeezed into her sides by Yangs soft, yet firm butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby watched from her prison as the world shifted, Yang's butt moving with its owner as she climbed out of the bed and landed on the floor below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next sight horrified Ruby, as she watched below Yang's tight, black exercise shorts came into view. She tried to squirm out, but the girl was unable to escape her sisters cheeks. The pressure from each cheek was enormous and painful, as was the sight of the shorts slowly inching their way up Yang's slender legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby knew she was done for, when...</div></span></div></div>",

Sighing, Yang dropped her shorts and grabbed it.<br>\r\n\"Wow, it's like the universe wants me to have my pants off. Not that I can't see why!\" Yang slapped her ass, noticing something scrunched up back there. Ignoring it, Yang answered the call.<br>\r\n\"Hello? What's that? The gym's been closed? Due to a gypsy curse, and lazy writing? Alright, thanks.\"<br>\r\nClosing her scroll and setting it down, Yang fell back onto her bed with her stolen cookies. \"No exercise? Fine by me. I'll just eat these. And since no one's home... Heh heh heh.\"<br>\r\n--------------------<br>\r\nThe sight of the shorts coming down was a blessing for Ruby. Hearing Yang say there wasn't going to be any gym today was too. The universe must have felt this was too good for the little girl, and gave her the sight of falling darkness as Yang laid back, crushing Ruby further.<br>\r\n\"Ow. Universe, I'm sorry for whatever I did!\" Ruby was not having it. She was near tears from not only the pain and humiliation of being in a butt (even if it was admittedly a nice one), but also losing her precious cookies!<br>\r\n--------------------<br>\r\nBlake was on the breaking point, nearly having a mental breakdown. Her partners rolling hills were always a place of affection, and staring at for Blake, but she never wanted to explore it! And just one was so painful, she would have clawed her way out if she wasn't essentially a puddle at this point.<br>\r\nHowever, light shined to her heart as the blinding light told her she wasn't going to be stuck her any longer. Hopefully.<br>\r\n--------------------<br>\r\nTaking off the bra felt so releaving for Yang, despite it only being on for about ten minutes. It felt so freeing, she didn't even notice the surface of tanned mesh on the inside of her bra. Dropping it to the floor, Yang swayed her hips over to her 'special compartment,' a hole behind the actual cabinet that had Yang's more 'personal' belongings hidden away.<br>\r\n\"Now which do I want for today? Golden Glory? Snow White? Ooh, how about Black Cat? I think you're 'coming' with me.\"<br>\r\nPulling Black Cat out, she clentched her everything in anticipation, making her way to her bed and shimmying out of her panties, the last piece of clothing.<br>\r\n--------------------<br>\r\nThe light would have been almost welcoming if the cheeks didn't compress around her as Yang bent down, nearly fully engulfing Ruby.<br>\r\n\"I am SO kicking your butt!\" Ruby was near tantrum levels of emotion. \"It's SO kickable! I should know, I've become very intimate with it!\"<br>\r\nHer once response was Yang rambling on about some Golden White Cat or something, and an excited cheek clentch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Ruby soon found herself with a shred of joy as she saw Yang's fingers sliding her panties down her legs.<br>\r\n--------------------<br>\r\nBringing her foot out of the panties, she tossed them into the air, musing to herself. \"I won't be needing you for my 'special plans'.\"<br>\r\nChuckling to herself, she caught the painties out of the air, and looked at them. And then stared at them with a blank, shocked expression possessing her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Ruby? Is... Is that you?\"<br>\r\n--------------------<br>\r\nYang's lilac eyes staring down at her gave Ruby all the joy in the world, so much more than a dumb box of cookies. Slightly squished on her sides, Ruby stood up, presenting herself.<br>\r\n\"Yang! Yang, I'm here!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, Ruby! What happened? How... how are you so small? And squished?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, the shrinking I'm not entirely sure. But being squished, that was because you, uh...\"<br>\r\nWith a look of concern, Yang tried to understang. \"What did I do? Did I hurt you?\"<br>\r\n\"Well... You sat on me... And carried me in your... Butt.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, I'm so sorry! Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?\"<br>\r\n\"Can you, I don't know, try and not steal my cookies next time!?\" Ruby had a sudden rage in her voice.<br>\r\n--------------------<br>\r\nThe bickering between the two girls above, about cookies or something, gave Blake enough time to sort of reform, arms and legs becoming distiguishable from the rest of the mess stuck to the bra.<br>\r\nIt also gave time for Blake to stare at her partner, fully naked. She avoided looking at the breasts for too long, fully remembering the trauma just minutes prior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she spyed the black object known as 'Black Cat' in her hand, and gave a deep blush.<br>\r\n\"Yang, you dirty girl\" was all she could muster as she reformed slightly more.</span></div></div>",

The Grimm had attacked a village on the outskirts of Vale\u2019s territory on mass two days ago and Teams RWBY, JNPR and CFVY had been deployed to handle the incursion, together with gratefully received support from the visiting Teams SSSN and ABRN.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had taken several gruelling hours of combat to fight their way to the lead Grimm, a massive mutant Wyvern that had peppered them with razor-sharp feathers as they approached. Pyrrha had been lucky, with her shield and skill allowing her to avoid the feathers, while each of the others had been cut by the deadly projectiles at least once but fought through it to face the beast head-on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Teams SSSN and ABRN distracted the Wyvern, Team RWBY had taken out its right wing and foreleg with a combination attack and CFVY had taken care of the left. With the Wyvern grounded and crippled Team JNPR had broken open its jaw and put Mil\u00f3\u2019s spear form through its open mouth and out the back of its skull. With the monster dead the other Grimm had scattered and either fled or been mowed down by the pursuing students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long flight back to Beacon and a quick medical examination Pyrrha had been allowed to return to her dorm to get some much needed rest and was out like a light the moment she hit the sheets. She hadn\u2019t even had the energy to change properly, simply stripping down to her panties and throwing on an oversized shirt before falling into bed, too tired to be mindful of potential exposure to Ren and Jaune. Now awake, she stretched happily as she felt her joints click back into place and the relief in her muscles after far too much use. Rubbing her eyes, she looked over the rest of the room to greet her teammates, only to find that they had apparently already left the dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the redhead didn\u2019t know, and could not possibly have guessed, was that her teammates were very much still in the room, just shrunken to a much smaller size. The compound in the mutant Wyvern\u2019s blood that had fuelled its own growth had been transferred to the other students through the tips of its feathers, and had had quite the opposite effect on the physiology of humans. Whereas Pyrrha had gone to sleep and woken up as her usual self, her friends had fallen to sleep at one size and woken at another, thoroughly shocked and confused at their giant surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what size are the shrunken members of Team JNPR?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When the Beacon and visiting students had attacked the Wyvern some had only been hit once by the feathers, while others had taken multiple hits. The depth and locations of the wounds had also varied significantly, from glancing blows to the limbs leaving a shallow scratch, to deep abdominal cuts requiring binding. As such, the amount of mutagen in each student\u2019s blood stream had varied, and the resulting shrinking had been more severe in some cases than others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf the members of Team JNPR other than Pyrrha, Nora had taken the fewest hits and, as such, remained the tallest of the shrunken team members at approximately five inches in height. Ren, on the other hand, had taken more damage and had been reduced to approximately three and a half inches. The quiet boy had been the first to wake up, and had taken in his changed surroundings with his usual calm, noting his greatly reduced size and that the swell and dips of Pyrrha\u2019s body beneath her sheets were the only sign that any of his other teammates were still in the room. With no conceivable means of contacting the redhead at this range, he had scaled down his own sheets to the floor and then climbed his partner\u2019s bed, finding Nora still asleep at her own greatly reduced size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon being woken by Ren, Nora\u2019s first reaction had been to coo over her partner\u2019s comparatively smaller height, loudly proclaiming how cute he\u2019d become. The two had quickly discovered the squishy nature of their new forms when the excitable girl had pulled on Ren\u2019s cheeks and they\u2019d stretched out far more than should have been humanly possible before snapping back to shape. Now, with Pyrrha stirring and rising from her bed, they focused on getting the bigger girls\u2019 attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove, Pyrrha hopped out of bed and started to move towards their shared dresser to grab a change of clothes when her eyes fell upon her teammate\u2019s bed. For a moment she wondered when Nora had gotten dolls of herself and Ren, before she realised that those dolls were waving at her and that she could hear tiny voices calling her name. She very nearly fainted on the spot. \u201cWh\u2026 what? How? What happened!?\u201d Falling to her knees, she shuffled over to bed to see her friends eye to eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Pyrrha! We got small!\u201d Nora chirped, seemingly heedless of the severity of their situation, while Ren shook his head, raising his voice slightly to ensure he was sufficiently heard. \u201cWhat Nora is trying to say is that we don\u2019t known how this happened. Both of us just woke up like this.\u201d What followed was a quick summary of their experiences that morning, as Pyrrha looked more and more concerned over the fate of her friends, her mind quickly turning to their missing leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t had a chance to check on Jaune yet,\u201d Ren explained, \u201cif he\u2019s like us he\u2019ll probably be on his bed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune, however, had taken more damage than anyone else on the battlefield, with multiple cuts and a significant abdominal wound that may have done some major damage if Weiss hadn\u2019t frozen it over to prevent him bleeding out. As a result the mutagen level in his blood was much higher than any of the other students, and he had unfortunately been reduced to around one fifth of an inch. Now no larger than an ant, he could only stare up in terror and awe as Pyrrha loomed large above him, the entire room seemingly vibrating in time with her gargantuan footsteps as she approached his bed and caste her impossibly vast eyes down towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealising that this may be his one and only chance of getting his partner\u2019s attention and hopefully escaping from this nightmare, Jaune started jumping up and down, waving his arms and yelling like a mad man, hoping beyond hope that he would be seen and rescued.</span></div></div>",

Her gaze swept right over her tiny partner but she didn\u2019t notice him as anything more than an insignificant speck, not even worth a moment of her attention. After a few more moments of fruitless searching she sighed in frustration and turned back towards her other teammates, unaware of the disheartened expression on Jaune\u2019s face as she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha was a devoted teammate and friend. If she had seen Jaune she would have done everything in her power to help him. Unfortunately however, her failure to spot him on the bed had convinced her that he was not present and had left him at the mercy of the unaware giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot sure what she should do next, Pyrrha bent over to bring her upper body down to the same level as her friends and carefully reached out to grab them, one in each hand. With her teammates secure she allowed herself to fall backwards onto Jaune\u2019s bed, landing heavily on her panty-clad rear and bouncing slightly on the spongy surface of the mattress. As she did so the redhead was completely oblivious to her bug-sized partner disappearing under her generous rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune had had no time to react as Pyrrha\u2019s body had fallen upon him. At his scale even if he had time to move there was little ground he could cover, and in any case he was frozen in place as the redhead\u2019s right buttock crashed down on-top of him, instantly burying him beneath what seemed like thousands of tons of flesh. His squishy body offered no resistance whatsoever, instantly flattening beneath the crushing weight even as the bed compacted beneath him. By the time the mattress sprung back he had already been reduced to nothing more than a tiny sticker on his partner\u2019s ass cheek, able to do nothing to defend himself as Pyrrha bounced slightly in place, smashing him again and again beneath her. By the time the bed settled, Jaune had been smeared across the amazonian beauty\u2019s buttock, little more than a nondescript blur of flesh and torn PJs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove, Pyrrha placed her two friends in her lap and chewed her lip in worry. \u201cIf we can\u2019t find Jaune then we\u2019ll focus on figuring out what\u2019s happened. He will be fine\u2026 I\u2019m sure of it.\u201d Nervous, she subconsciously shifted slightly, rubbing her butt against the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow sitting on their giant teammate\u2019s legs, Nora and Ren did their best to put the redhead at ease. The hammer-wielder in particular was enthusiastic in her support. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it Pyrrha, we\u2019re practically invincible. You could fall right on top of us and we\u2019d probably be fine.\u201d Beside her, Ren could only shake his head, mumbling under his breath so neither of his friends would hear. \u201cIt\u2019s the \u2018probably\u2019 bit that I\u2019m worried about.\u201d Raising his voice higher, he looked up into looming emerald eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that this has something to do with the mission. You should probably check on Team RWBY.\u201d His partner nodded enthusiastically in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing her eyes for a moment to gather herself, Pyrrha took a moment to quickly readjust her panties, shifting as minimally as possible as she pulled the bunched out fabric out of her crack and across her cheeks, unknowingly obscuring Jaune\u2019s tiny crushed form in the process. Reaching down again she grabbed her two friends and rose back to her feet. \u201cRight, but I better take the two of you with me. I don\u2019t want anything to happen while I\u2019m gone.\u201d No matter if they were invincible or not there was any number of horrible things that could happen to them at their size and Pyrrha wasn\u2019t willing to leave them at the mercy of such things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRWBY\u2019s room was right across the hallway from JNPR. The redhead didn\u2019t even bother changing as she skilfully manipulated the door handle with her foot and made her way into the hallway before urgently knocking on the other team\u2019s door, forgetting for a moment that she was still holding Ren in that hand and shaking him around like a rag doll. \u201cHello! It\u2019s Pyrrha! Can I come in?\u201d She paused to listen for a response and hearing nothing tried the handle with her foot again. Fortunately it wasn\u2019t locked and with a little more manipulated swung open to allow the four teens inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the door was open, Pyrrha brought her foot back down and\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As soon as Pyrrha entered the room she swept her eyes across the entire expanse, searching for any sign of her friends. It didn\u2019t take long for her emerald orbs to zero in on a shrunken Ruby, Blake and Yang standing right in the middle of the desks, though it took her a moment longer to realise the little white shape now standing between the black and yellow pair was in fact an even tinier Weiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike most of the members of Team JNPR, Team RWBY had woken to find themselves greatly reduced in size and utterly surrounded by their own bedding. With no obvious signs of their teammates in the room, each had sought out their nearest companion with varying levels of success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Blake and Yang had been only mildly injured in the fight against the Wyvern, only a few scratches marring their forms. As such they had been left at the fairly significant height of six inches and large enough for the blonde to attempt to descend some of her own bedding and the books that made up its supports to reach her partner\u2019s bed. For her part, Blake had also started to ascend the books when she saw Yang working her way down and with a bit of work the two had managed to convene at the head of the Faunus\u2019 bed, within jumping distance of the desks between the bunks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby had been more fortunate in her injuries and diminishment, standing at a relatively towering eight inches, but less fortunate in her attempts to locate her partner. As her own bed and Weiss\u2019s were not connected she had taken the risk of leaping down from her own bed onto the heiress\u2019s and had been pleasantly surprised to find herself unharmed as she landed on her butt, and directly on top of an extra little bit of padding that remained stuck to the seat of her pants for nearly a minute as she searched fruitlessly for Weiss. Eventually whatever had stuck to her peeled off and fell to the bedding, at which time the team leader discovered that she had in fact landed on her much smaller partner, at just one inch in height, and temporarily flattened her. Of course, she\u2019d only made this discovery after trampling over the flattened heiress as she retraced her steps. Naturally the tiny girl was supremely unimpressed with Ruby\u2019s carelessness and had spent the rest of the trip to the desks chewing the younger girl\u2019s ear off even as she was given a ride on her partner\u2019s shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the four of them had managed to meet on the desks and get a chance to discuss just how this had all happened, though with no small amount of frustration on the part of the heiress as the bumblebee duo tried, and failed, not to chuckle over her greatly reduced size. That was when Pyrrha had come knocking and burst into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaving happily, Ruby took quick note of Nora and Ren clasped in their teammate\u2019s hands and shot them all a brilliant smile. \u201cHey guys! Guess we weren\u2019t the only ones huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha was only able to give the shrunken scythe-wielder a weak smile in return, her worry over the entire situation rising considerably now that she had discovered that Team RWBY had been shrunken as well. Stumbling over to the desk, and placing Nora and Ren on its surface, she pulled out the solid wooden chair and plopped into it listlessly, giving Weiss an apologetic look as the vibrations from the impact knocked the tiny heiress over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken members of Team JNPR, sans Jaune, quickly got themselves reacquainted with Team RWBY, with no small amount of height comparisons between the more enthusiastic members. The little fencer was annoyed to find herself the smallest by a decent margin, making doubly sure to keep between her own teammates where she would be relatively safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was the first to broach the subject of what exactly had happened to them, having already taken the time to consider their circumstances before Team JNPR had arrived. \u201cThe one thing that the six of us have in common is that we were all injured by that Grimm. More importantly Pyrrha wasn\u2019t and as far as we know she\u2019s the only one of us not affected.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang nodded slightly in agreement, though frowned slightly as a thought occurred to her. \u201cBut wait a sec, Jaune was definitely hit too, like a lot.\u201d She glanced up at the looming redhead. \u201cYou said you didn\u2019t see him at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI looked.\u201d Pyrrha shifted again in nervousness, unintentionally grinding her butt, and her partner, into the chair. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be heard, Weiss had to raise her voice to a near-shout. \u201cWhat about me?\u201d She rolled her eyes at the questioning looks she received. \u201cI mean look at my size. I\u2019m smaller than any of you. And I received a deeper wound from one of those feathers. Jaune got it even worse than me so, logically, we might expect him to be my size or smaller.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d Pyrrha hesitated, but eventually shook her head. \u201cEven like that I would have seen him.\u201d But despite her words she wasn\u2019t certain and doubt began to gnaw at her. In the end she decided to\u2026</span></div></div>",

If Weiss is right I may have missed him.\u201d The others nodded in agreement and the redhead quickly reached down to gather them in her arms. With only two hands, and being in too much of a hurry to really think things through she scooped them up and held them tightly against her chest, but in doing so failed to take account of their varying sizes or her own lack of a bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss had been standing between Blake and Yang when the three of them had been scooped up by Pyrrha. With no time for any of them to react they had each been rammed into the giant girl\u2019s amble left breast. The Faunus had hit first, pushed face first into the thin fabric of Pyrrha\u2019s shirt, and the heiress had been quickly pressed into her side before their blonde teammate hit as well, trapping their smallest teammate between their bodies. Needless to say Weiss\u2019s body offered no resistance as she was squished and flattened between her friends. Pushed upwards by the redhead\u2019s arm, her head was caught between Yang and Blake\u2019s chests, even as the rest of her was crammed between their abdomens, and the arm at their back crushed all three of them against the bouncing flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgainst Pyrrha\u2019s other breast Ren had been trapped between his two female teammates, face to breast with Nora as his partner was held in place with the amazon\u2019s crossed arms, and the warmth of the bigger girl\u2019s chest at his back. The mischievous hammer-wielder for one seemed to be enjoying this, chuckling joyfully at the unfortunate boy\u2019s predicament. Nearby, Ruby had perhaps been the most fortunate, having been caught right between her friend\u2019s breasts, though this did still leave her to be battered from either side as the fleshy globes moved around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach shrunken student\u2019s predicament only got worse as their unintentional capture strode out of the room, her substantial bosom attempting to bounce free of the confines of her limbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill completely unaware of what she had done to her other friends, let alone Jaune, Pyrrha made it back to her own dorm and deposited her arms\u2019 contents on her own bed. As her friends slowly got back to their feet she realised with a gasp what had happened, watching with sorrowful eyes as Blake and Yang peeled themselves apart from each other and Weiss, the heiress left lying on the bed for a few moments as she slowly reformed, and Ren waited for his partially flattened chest to inflate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry! I didn\u2019t realise you would\u2026\u201d Pyrrha trailed off, unsure of what more she could say. She was at least relieved to see that no permanent damage had been done, being the first time she herself had witnessed the capacity of her little friends to reform after being crushed. Unwilling to risk crushing any of her friends further, she sat heavily on the ground, shaking the room slightly with the force of the impact and unintentionally smearing Jaune further between her panties and cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others waved off Pyrrha\u2019s apologies, though not without a few grumbles of discontent from Weiss, and Ruby suggested that they might as well get straight to searching for Jaune. Nodding in agreement, the giant girl moved each of them to different locations around the room, though this time being much more careful not to crush any of them, especially the still aggravated Schnee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Pyrrha walked back and forth across the room her panties began to ride up into her crack and Jaune was dragged along with them, sliding across her increasingly moist cheek. Having been crushed thoroughly by his partner\u2019s previous sittings and grindings, the little knight had been left a broken delirious mess and could do nothing to stop himself as he was dumped into the redhead\u2019s crack and ground up between her buttocks as she continued to stride around the dorm. Above, his towering teammate was far too busy worrying about her missing partner to concern herself with her panties, paying no attention as they, and Jaune, were progressively eaten by her hungry cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of searching, the two teams were no closer to finding their missing friend and Pyrrha was becoming increasingly concerned over his fate, still failing to notice the tiny ball of putty that had found its way into her ass as was now being thoroughly smeared across the walls of her crack. In fact, she was so distracted by her concerns that she ceased to pay an appropriate amount of attention to where she placed her feet, and didn\u2019t even hear the faintly audible squish as her foot came down just beside Jaune\u2019s bed and flattened Weiss into a fleshy pancake. Nor did she hear the subsequent squishes as the heiress lifted with her foot, only to be driven back into the ground again and again as she strode back to the bookshelves to check them once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smallest member of Team RWBY had been looking around under the missing boy\u2019s bed, in the hopes that he may have hidden down there and had emerged to advise the others that there was no trace of him. Unfortunately she hadn\u2019t managed to get anyone else\u2019s attention before Pyrrha\u2019s foot had fallen upon her and now found herself thoroughly squished into the moist flesh of her friend\u2019s increasingly dirty sole with her head trapped in the bigger girl\u2019s toe crevice while the rest of her body was crushed beneath the ball of the redhead\u2019s foot. Her only hope now was that either Pyrrha or one of her other friends would notice her and free her from this smelly, sweaty torment.</span></div></div>",

Sighing loudly she dropped back to her feet, only to look down in confusion as she felt, and heard, a small squish as the ball of her right foot hit the ground. Shifting her foot around she heard the sound again, and felt something odd being squished between her second and third toes as they clamped down. Curious, she started tapping her foot, hearing the sound again and again as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally deciding that a more thorough investigation was in order, Pyrrha sat down on the closest bed and raised her foot up to her face, staring in confusion for a moment at the white smear across the ball of her foot before she realised what she was looking at with a sudden sense of horror and shock. Nearly hyperventilating, the redhead desperately attempted to peel the flattened heiress from her sole, leaning back further into the bed as she did so and unknowingly clenching her cheeks even harder around Jaune as she worked to free Weiss. Her actions had drawn the attention of the other shrunken students, who watched on with varying levels of concern and amusement as the inch tall girl was finally peeled off, her head staying stuck for a moment longer before finally popping free from between Pyrrha\u2019s toes, having been thoroughly squished during the bookshelf examination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPractically on the verge of tears, the larger girl gently laid Weiss\u2019s squished body on the bed, leaning down quickly to grab the rest of Team RWBY, who had congregated near her feet, and placing them beside the heiress. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry! I didn\u2019t even see her there! Please tell me she\u2019s okay.\u201d While the reforming, particularly of Weiss\u2019s head, was slow, Ruby shot Pyrrha a quick thumbs-up to let her know that the tiny girl was going to be fine. The fencer herself had less pleasant things to say as her face finally reformed, but kept her complaints below the level of the bigger girl\u2019s hearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen and Nora joined them quickly, the smaller redhead chuckling at Weiss\u2019s now sweat-soaked form and attempting to grab at the little girl\u2019s cheeks only to receive an angry glare for her troubles as the smaller girl promptly hid behind Blake. All of the shrinkees reported that they had seen no sign of Jaune anywhere in the room and the group reluctantly concluded that he either wasn\u2019t there, or had shrunken to such a small size as to be beneath their notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDetermining that now was the time to seek outside assistance, Pyrrha rose back to her feet and crossed to the dresser, foregoing her usual combat outfit to pull out a casual change of clothes. Pulling off her sleep shirt without a thought for her audience, she quickly clipped on a bra and reached for a skin-tight pair of jeans and tight t-shirt, as well as her nearby sneakers and a well-worn pair of socks. While Ren pointedly looked the other way, Yang gave a low whistle at the display, only to receive a chop to the head and punch to the shin from Blake and Weiss respectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Pyrrha changes, what happens to the tiny Jaune stuck within her crack?</span></div></div>",

They weren't the typical loose fitting kind she would normally wear, and as such  forcing them over her hips was a hassle. Eventually frustration seemed to be getting to the girl. With one more mighty tug she was finally able to fit into the skin-tight jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her it was a small victory, but for Jaune it was a great loss. He'd already been pulverized by Pyrrha's ass when she took a seat and now the very same cheeks that entombed him were threatening to grind what little remained of him to dust. The redhead's crack was already a tight fit, but now it was akin to that of a compactor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was being compressed from all sides and there was nothing he could do to protect himself. Each and every step his partner took served to mash him up even more. He was literally a living mass of ass cream that was below anyone's notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was made all the worse by the heat Pyrrha was also generating. Her crack was already warm place and now it was beginning to feel like the inside of a oven. If his body was still in one piece he'd be sweating like a pig. Unfortunately for him, Pyrrha was the only one sweating. Her salty sweat slowly mixing in with the Jello that was his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a nightmare. Why was this happening? Was this Karma finally catching up with him? It must be. Why else was he being subjected to such torture? He should've never faked his way into Beacon. His lies and selfish desire to become a hero stole a spot from someone who actually worked hard get here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was his punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jaune continued to suffer at the hands of his unaware partner, Pyrrha had finally zipped up her jeans and slipped on her shoes. \"Alright. I'm going to go find the headmaster. While I'm gone you keep looking. I won't be long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her peace said the redhead opened the door vanished from sight.

Unknown to the redhead when she had pulled the panties a few loose threads had pulled taunt around her tiny partner and ripped him from the abyss of her booty, flinging him clear to collide solidly with the lip of her jeans as she secured them around her hips. Crushed completely flat and soaked deeply in Pyrrha\u2019s booty sweat, Jaune could do nothing to save himself as he slid wetly over the hem of the jeans and then came loose as his partner shifted to pull on her shirt, fluttering towards the ground and remaining completely unseen by both the giant girl and her tiny audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the mercy of the minuscule air currents within the room, the tortured knight could do nothing to correct his course as he slowly descended towards Pyrrha\u2019s feet, only to have view filled with a sea of white cotton as the redhead lowered a sock to her foot and he slipped helplessly within its warm and fragrant embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove, Pyrrha had just finished checking the inside of her socks to make sure that Jaune hadn\u2019t somehow managed to find himself inside, as unlikely as that was. Satisfied that there was no sign of her partner or anything that might be mistaken for him she lowered one sock and quickly slipped it onto her left foot, completely unaware as the unfortunate boy vanished between her third and forth toe, joining her toejam and other detritus deep between the shifting digits. Pulling on the other sock she checked her sneakers as well and, satisfied once again that there was no sign of Jaune, slide her feet into the shoes and stomped them a few times to make sure they were on correctly before tying the laces. She was aware of the moisture rising from the soles as her socks sank slightly into the well-worn sneakers, but paid it no mind. She had more important things to worry about right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll stay here,\u201d Yang offered, motioning to herself, Blake and Weiss. She was still looking up at Pyrrha as the larger girl finished getting dressed and turned back towards them. \u201cDepending on how small he got, Jaune could still be hidden somewhere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough reluctant to leave any of them behind, her earlier mistake when carrying them all caused Pyrrha to agree to the compromise and reach down to pick up her teammates and Ruby, transferring her teammates to her shoulders and gripping the leader of Team RWBY in her left hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door with her free hand and making sure to lock it behind her, she headed down the hallway in search of help, making sure to keep her shoulders level and maintaining a loose but secure grip around Ruby\u2019s waist. Pyrrha\u2019s care, however, did not extend to her feet, as she obliviously allowed her toes to play with the tiny body of her partner as she strode down the halls of the academy, squishing his insignificant form deep into the crevice of her toes and grinding him between them as they shifted around in the increasingly humid swamp of her sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Jaune things didn\u2019t seem like they could get much worse. He was still soaked with Pyrrha\u2019s butt sweat, lint and grime, and now he was being caked again in toejam and the sweat of her feet. The toes on either side of him were relentless as they squeezed him from all sides, forcing him deeper and deeper into the crevice and ensuring no hope of reforming any time soon.</span></div></div>",

Her toes wiggled down the leg wholes as she bent over to help yank up the skin tight material, a blush fluttering over her face as she felt the panties acting like a thong. Before Yang could notice, she casually stretched out her panties to recover her rear before continuing to get dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one noticed the paper thin Jaune flutter out of the sweaty hell, his body quickly taken up by the gentle breeze of the room as his tiny flattened body slipped unnoticed behind Weiss who was still wringing out Pyrrha's sweat from her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha slipped some socks on after checking them for signs of her partner before turning to the rest of her team mates with a worried look,<br>\r\n\"Don't worry- Jaune will show up eventually!\" Ruby spoke up, giving the thumbs up to her large friend, <br>\r\n\"Yeah- he's tougher then he looks! For now- there were a few other teams that were injured by the attack, we might need to check up on them\" Yang spoke with a confident grin, trying to keep the spirits up of the giant girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant girl in question gave a gentle smile down, speaking softly as gazed at everyone,<br>\r\n\"Are you all going to be alright on your own? It might be safer to keep you in a locked room then on me-\" Her large eyes scanned her friends, not able to pick up the flattened Jaune from behind Weiss's tiny form.<br>\r\n\"We'll be fine- we'll continue the search- or... they will-\" Weiss started, tugging at her ruined clothes to try and cover herself before stepping back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune slowly tried to reform before his bad luck kicked in, his tired body making slow progress as he looked longingly up towards Weiss, quickly realizing she would be his best bet at being noticed. He was sad to note that comparing sizes he was still only as big as one of the feet of the inch tall girl, perhaps slightly bigger if he fully reformed. Sadly for him, that day was not to come as the tiny girls bare foot quickly flattened him out before stepping off again. He dizzily looked up towards the sky as Weiss blotted out his light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss sat down with a huff, wriggling her rear down to get comfortable before shooting annoyed looks around,<br>\r\n\"No one forget I'm here-\" She huffed, compressing the tiny beneath the torn fabric of her dress as she fiddled with the holes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha gave a nervous wave as she left, careful to lock the door behind her as she left the tinies to continue to search for Jaune/ wait for her return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune almost managed to groan as they quickly marked the desk they were standing on a clear zone, none of the girls would bother to look down if Weiss wasn't there. He was almost fearful when Weiss got up to join in with the search, announcing that she wouldn't be on the desk any more and to 'Watch out for her or else'-</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While his experiences on and in his partner\u2019s butt had been hellish to say the least, Jaune had only truly come to realise just how insignificant he was when Weiss\u2019s ass had fallen upon him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough he\u2019d gotten only a little time to look around the room during his descent and the few moments he had before the heiress squished him into paste, he\u2019d still seen enough to take note that the Schnee girl had herself been shrunken to a miniscule size, significantly smaller than any of the others, and certainly much smaller than Pyrrha. The damaged nature of the dressing gown she\u2019d worn to bed, and the fact she was dripping with sweat that was unlikely to be her own, suggested Weiss had had her own misfortunes that morning but had eventually been found. Even then she seemed concerned that she could still be crushed at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, even to this tiny girl he was nothing more than a twisted piece of gum, beneath her rear and beneath her notice. All the crushing he had endured between Pyrrha\u2019s mountainous buttocks had compressed him even further, to the extent that Weiss didn\u2019t even feel him as she squirmed to get comfortable and unknowingly plunged his tortured body through the tears in her gown. If even she could not see him, then what hope did Jaune ever have of being rescued from this nightmare?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe underwear the heiress had worn to bed was little more than a thin string of fabric buried deep between her cheeks, leaving Jaune\u2019s moist and grimy body to be smeared across the small girl\u2019s buttocks, mixing with both Weiss\u2019s own sweat and the copious amount of foot sweat that Pyrrha had left behind when she flattened the unfortunate fencer. To the casual observer peering through the gaps of the torn dressing gown it would look like the girl\u2019s own panties had become a crumpled grimy mess. Only a prolonged look might reveal that there was something odd about those panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after taking a few minutes to catch her breath and properly reform, Weiss raised herself to her feet and approached the edge of the desk, catching Ruby\u2019s eyes and motioning towards Jaune\u2019s own bed. Catching her partner\u2019s intentions, the scythe-wielder ascended the desk to grab the smaller girl and transported her to the lost knight\u2019s bed for a closer examination. If the boy really had been shrunken worse than she herself had been, then Weiss had the best chance of finding him, and she figured that she might as well start on his own bed, since that had been the last place he had been seen at full size. Of course if she had known that Pyrrha had sat on this bed that morning she may have suggested another location. Not that it would do Jaune any good right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning quickly to look at her partner as she went to leave, the heiress narrowed her eyes. \u201cYou better not forget I\u2019m here Ruby! And make sure everyone else knows as well. If I get crushed again I\u2019m taking it out on you.\u201d Even at her tiny size she managed to glare with sufficient force to get a quick gulp from the younger girl, and a firm promise not to forget. Satisfied for now, Weiss turned her attention to the task of finding her little friend, unaware of how close he truly was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill plastered to his crush\u2019s ass, Jaune could feel the heiress\u2019s movements as she walked around the bed, her cheeks shifting beneath him and progressively stretching him out to conform to their shape. The bits of him that had been left closest to her crack, including the left side of his face were being slowly pulled into the sweaty crevice, chewed up like a piece of gum as they were drawn inexorably inwards. Simultaneously the right side of his face, part of his chest and a flattened arm had become partially adhered to the inside of her dress and were being stretched out across Weiss\u2019s left buttock, one bloodshot eye at the very centre of her cheek staring out from his otherwise indistinguishable body. On the other side the remainder of his body, including most of his lower half, was being similarly dragged across her right cheek. More and more he was coming to look like little more than the seat of a pair of abused panties, if a somewhat oddly designed pair. Worse, his captor was working up a sweat in her search for him and his already soaked form was picking up a new layer of perspiration, flowing both from the crack that was eating him alive and down the heiress\u2019s back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill completely oblivious to what she was putting Jaune through, Weiss eventually determined that Jaune either wasn\u2019t on the bed or was too small to be seen by even her. Somewhat depressed by her failure she peered over the side of the bed, noting how the sheets had fallen partially to the floor. Figuring it was easier than waiting for one of the others to move within earshot, she plopped down on the edge of the sheets and pushed off, sliding down to the floor like she was riding a giant water slide, and having to repress the urge to squeal at the sudden rush of speed and adrenaline. She had been concerned she would feel some friction or burning in her butt, but the trip was surprisingly comfortable, oddly moist even, like she really was taking a trip on a water slide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune of course had significantly less fun as the heiress slid her way to the floor. His vision had turned black once again as Weiss had crushed him beneath her weight, and then everything had become a blur of movement and pain as she had slid down the sheets. At his size she may as well have been sliding on concrete, and the knight felt as if he was being grinded beneath a steam roller as his friend unknowingly used him as a make-shift toboggan. What bits of him may have been previously recognisable were now smeared into nothing and the force was cramming more of his body into Weiss\u2019s crack, even as the rest of him was spread further across her cheeks. It got even worse when his captor finally reached the floor, the smooth fabric of the sheets being replaced with the rough and dirty texture of the carpet, tearing mercilessly at Jaune\u2019s skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResisting the urge to try that again, Weiss managed to maintain some composure as she rose to her feet and slowly brushed herself off, shuddering slightly as she was reminded of her previous experiences when her hands came away covered in the lingering puddles of Pyrrha\u2019s sweat, now irrecoverably mixed with her own. Her ass felt particularly moist and oddly squishy, but she attributed that merely to her own pliable nature and had to admit that all that sweat had made for a good lubricant when sliding down the sheets. Thinking of the sheets, she supposed that perhaps Jaune may have descended by the same means, and with that in mind fell to her hands and knees to more closely examine the area in which she had landed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Weiss crawled around she tucked her knees up under her abdomen and pulled her hands in tight, angling her body so that her face was near the carpet and her butt stuck up in the air to maximise her chances of seeing the potentially microscopic member of Team JNPR. In doing so she was unknowingly pulling Jaune taunt across her hips and pointing his tortured body at the ceiling, his one visible eye staring up through a gap in her dress as he hoped desperately for salvation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom this position it was Jaune, and Jaune alone, who saw what was about to happen next. With her head in her own shadow, Weiss was heedless to the much larger shadow falling across her, whereas her new cushion saw it all, his one eye struggling to focus as the shadow drew inexorably closer.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>An hour slowly ticked by on the giant clock that Weiss used to hit in the morning. Her body lazily clicked into gear as the inch tall girl slowly got off her flattened cushion to wander towards the side, leaving Jaune in a puddle of both her and Pyrrha's ass and foot sweat.<br>\r\n\"Hey- I'm going to help look too, he might be smaller then we think-!\" Weiss yelled down, noticing the keen eared Blakes nod of approval, \"Blake! Relay that message- I-Am-Coming-Down, I reaaally don't want to get stepped on\" the ice haired girl shuddered as she remembered her previous experiences, her foot ironically splatting down on Jaune as she took her leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot 5 minutes passed before the voices of Ruby and Nora fluttered into earshot, Jaune could do nothing but panic as his least likely saviors approached, Nora's sing song voice rejoiced about the clear zone while Ruby commented that her neck hurt from looking down for so long. Struggling to reform, Jaune quickly found himself between Nora's socks and Ruby's bare feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are lucky you sleep in socks- I actually kinda wish I fell asleep fully dressed\" Ruby complained, stomping her large feet down beside the shivering rag while Nora's feet gloated it's warmth with a wiggle, <br>\r\n\"Aaaaallllways come prepared in case the evil heat demons steal your warmth-!\" She grinned, her lucky socks hovering over Jaunes disgusted body before stepping down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 5 inch girl completely covered the one fifth of an inch flattened sticker with her well worn sock, the unwashed fabric quickly kneading poor Jaune into Nora's toe space, painfully squeezing him tight before lifting off with it's passenger in toe. Jaune weakly groaned as the iron grip of the hammer wielder suddenly shot him forward onto another damp surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora held Ruby's waist as she easily balanced on the much bigger girl, her socked feet rubbing back and forth on-top of Ruby's,<br>\r\n\"There! Now it's like we're both wearing socks-!\" Nora hopped, not noticing any difference between Ruby and Jaune as she casually demolished him beneath her. Ruby shook her head at her smaller friend as she felt her feet actually start to warm up, not noticing Jaune getting deposited between her toes as Nora hopped off. Ruby glanced up as Blake and Yang approached, a tiny Weiss followed behind with a small Ren.<br>\r\n\"Any luck?\" Ruby quipped, clenching her toes as she subconsciously missed the heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune weakly shuddered as he was minced into toe jam, the giant girl obliviously compressing him smaller and smaller with her large toes. He thankfully fell too deep and collapsed onto the ground beneath Ruby's cruel clutching toes, just out of reach. His mind felt hopeful for a fleeting second until the large girl shuffled forward, crushing him into a flat disk in seconds before lifting up. He wanted to cry out as the dirty ball took him for a few steps only to release him mid air. Landing with a splat- he could only watch as Ruby's heel replaced the ball, crushing him down harshly a few times before depositing him next to Blake, Yang and Weiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think he's here-\" Ruby huffed, gazing down off the edge of the dresser. Yang, quick to keep the team together, stepped over the defeated leader of JNPR to comfort her sister while Blake carefully shifted in place, her pudgy toes landing dangerously close to the misshapen form of Jaune. It wasn't long before the usually attentive girls toes touched down on his leg, subtly curling and dragging the poor boy into her toe space. Unable to yell or shout, he sadly accepted his fate as Blake dragged him under her toes, his eyes looked desperately upwards towards Weiss- slowly processing the eye's looking back at him. Hope set in as the poor battered Jaune attempted to get the giant girls attention before it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss had given up looking like everyone else, her eyes instead drawn to the supplies around her. A few scraps here and there from her left out sewing kit that she had used to fix a few holes from one of their missions, a pin that might come in handy if Ruby was big enough to wield it. Her eyes scanned around, slowly falling on a tiny blackened disk disappearing under her teammates playful toes. She shrugged, assuming it was a rag, but- something was nagging her-</span></div></div>",

What could be seen was mostly just a black mangled lump of flesh and clothing, still recovering from the successive crushing he had endured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt should have been nothing to Weiss, so why did she feel like there was something different about this particular rag, other than being an impossibly tiny thing? She watched one of Blake\u2019s toes come down on it, witnessed the way it squished out beneath her weight. The way it almost seemed to be trying, and utterly failing, to twitch away from its merciless captor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever it was, it might be worth investigating before it became a permanent resident of her teammate\u2019s toes. As it was it had almost completely disappeared by the time the heiress raised her voice. \u201cBlake stop, there\u2019s something at your feet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d The larger girl had no idea what her tiny friend was talking about but obediently froze on the spot, ceasing the nervous movements she hadn\u2019t even been aware of before that point and casting her gaze down to her feet. Even with her enhanced vision she couldn\u2019t see what Weiss was talking about but she trusted the girl enough to wait obediently as the fencer approached her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss had to suppress unpleasant memories of her experiences with Pyrrha as she approached Blake\u2019s feet, all too aware of the shadows cast by the rest of her team as Yang and Ruby closed in to see what she had found. The black rag had been reduced to a single scrap sticking out from between the brunette\u2019s second and third toes and it took a few solid pulls before the taller girl got the message and separated the digits far enough for the wet piece of fabric to slowly slide free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the heiress had started to pull on him, Jaune\u2019s head had already been pulled between Blake\u2019s toes, only one crushed arm extending out to secure his freedom. His entire body and face slid across the moist flesh of the Faunus as he was slowly pulled free, ensuring that by the time he was raised to look Weiss in the face a fresh layer of toe jam had completely obscured any features that had remained recognisable through his previous torment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss\u2019s first instinct was to throw this putrid thing away. It was wet and slimy beneath her hands and smelled like a dumpster full of sweat, not to mention that the grime with which it was covered was starting to come off on her hands, staining her pale flesh black. Yet she still couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that this was something worth investigating further. Turning her gaze up to meet the towering forms of her teammates she stuck the slowly reforming Jaune out in their general direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been the intention of the heiress to hand the dirty thing over to Blake, or possibly Yang, but instead she found it snatched from her hands from behind by an enthusiastic Nora, who instantly began playing with her battered teammate. \u201cWhat is this thing? It\u2019s so squishy!\u201d Unaware what she was really holding, the redhead stretched out the tortured student before crushing him back together with her hands, marvelling at the elasticity of this new toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking sure not to crush her smallest teammate in the process, Yang stepped forward to get a closer look, noting the sheer quantity of grime coming off on Nora\u2019s hands. \u201cHey, give it here.\u201d Snatching the redhead\u2019s toy with a quick smile, she stretched it out into a sheet and tried to rub off some of the grime with her thumbs. Seeing something paler underneath she redoubled her efforts, eventually resorting to spitting on her defenceless friend and rubbing his body vigorously against the front of her pyjama top. It took some doing but eventually she\u2019d managed to clean off the majority of the mess, though her top was now filthy itself and her mouth was unpleasantly dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was revealed was a twisted mess of tan flesh and torn fabric, which Yang stared at in confusion for a few moments before her partner made a surprised noise and stepped forward, keen eyes zeroing in on the mop of blonde hair visible at the base of the upside down mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s Jaune.\u201d Taking the unfortunate boy off her partner, Blake turned to face the quizzical expressions of the others. \u201cLook closely, he\u2019s been pretty badly squashed but it\u2019s him.\u201d Careful not to do more harm than good she held up the rag of a boy, still wet from Yang\u2019s spit, for the others to see, Nora shooting her little teammate a bashful smile as she recalled her former actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf all of them Ruby seemed the most enthusiastic about their discovery. \u201cWow, he\u2019s so tiny! I mean he\u2019s even smaller than Weiss. Way smaller.\u201d She either ignored, or more likely didn\u2019t notice, the annoyed look the heiress shot her at that comment. Watching as Blake laid the boy gently on the table she took a moment to poke him with her comparatively gargantuan toe, noting the complete lack of resistance as her toe tip sank into his body. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t he reforming though?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing her partner\u2019s foot out the way, Weiss bent down for a closer look, glad that the boy at least smelled better than he did before. \u201cGiven his state he\u2019s obviously been squished quite a bit. Possibly even by Pyrrha. It may take him longer to reform.\u201d Shaking her head she turned her back on the tiny knight. \u201cLet\u2019s just give him some space for a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others nodded in agreement, shuffling away from Jaune as their conversation turned to their next course of action. With all members of Team JNPR and Team RWBY now accounted for they had the opportunity to try to find a way out of this situation, or maybe just see what they could do with their new bodies. Yang and Nora in particular were keen to explore, while Ren and Weiss argued strongly for staying where they were until Pyrrha returned. There was also debate over whether their tiniest friend should be left peacefully to reform, or carried along with them if they left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Jaune the conversations of his companions were just a dull blur of noise at the edge of his perception, his aching body slowly but surely beginning to morph back into shape. At this point all he cared about was that he was free and currently lying a comparatively safe distance from the still shifting feet of his friends, even if the smell of feet and ass still filled his noise and his body was unpleasantly moist from Yang\u2019s rather enthusiastic cleaning procedure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end though, Jaune\u2019s fate remained in the hands of his friends and their final decision.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the sextet of shrunken students discussed what they would do next, the largest of them began to pace in thought. Always a bundle of energy, Ruby could consider things better when she was on the move, though she did tend to get a bit distracted while doing so. She was careful enough at least to step around Weiss, or more accurately the little heiress had taken to hiding behind her other teammates and glaring balefully at her partner as the larger girl stomped past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fifteen year old\u2019s footsteps, however, were falling dangerously close to Jaune, his own teammates too distracted by the discussion to keep track of the tiny knight. With each pass Ruby\u2019s feet drew inexorably closer to her stricken friend, vibrating the desk beneath him as his eyes shifted around in a desperate attempt to see what it was that was approaching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was almost completely on top of him when the door to the room suddenly swung open, the noise and motion startling everyone and instantly drawing their attention to the door. Caught in mid-stride, Ruby faltered in her step, her foot sweeping across the desk slightly and catching Jaune\u2019s edge. It was only a glancing blow but it was enough to unstick him slightly from the desk and send him sliding across the surface, his body stopping just short of the very edge and the drop beyond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaware of her partner\u2019s position, Pyrrha strode back into the room, the shadow she cast over the desk joined by two others as Glynda Goodwitch and Winter Schnee entered the room behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile her friends had searched for Jaune, Pyrrha had headed across campus to the headmaster\u2019s office, where she\u2019d interrupted a meeting between Professor Ozpin and General Ironwood regarding the security for the upcoming Vytal Tournament. Professor Goodwitch had also been present, as well as Ironwood\u2019s offsider Winter, who had apparently come to Beacon earlier than scheduled after hearing that her younger sister had been injured in a battle against the Grimm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Pyrrha had advised them that Team RWBY and the remainder of Team JNPR had been shrunken both Glynda and Winter had volunteered to check on the situation while Ozpin and Ironwood continued their discussion. The older Schnee in particular had been quite keen to investigate, though it was only on the trip back that Pyrrha had discovered her relationship to Weiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the congregation of her friend\u2019s on the desk, Pyrrha stepped closer, concerned green eyes checking that everyone was present and accounted for, though still failing to spot her insignificant speck of a partner. To her left Glynda looked down at the shrunken students with an expression of fascination, while Winter frowned on her right, eyes flicking around in search of her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill hiding behind her taller teammates, Weiss remained out of sight from her larger sibling, not out of fear but because she was embarrassed to be seen like this by the only family member she was truly close to. She respected Winter, and she didn\u2019t want to seem weak in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot aware of their teammate\u2019s thoughts, Yang and Blake noted the searching look on Winter\u2019s face and her striking similarities to Weiss. Putting two and two together, the bumblebee duo stepped aside and exposed the heiress to her sister\u2019s line of sight and instantly concerned expression. Leaning down to get a closer look, the older Schnee pressed her ample chest into the edge of the table right in front of the Team RWBY girls, bending herself at an uncomfortable-looking angle to get as close as possible to her tiny sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Jaune, the descent of Winter\u2019s chest cast a vast shadow as he was\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For the second time that day Jaune witnessed the descent of an impossibly large mass zeroing in on his insignificant form. Even at normal size Winter\u2019s impressive rack would have been large enough to cause pause to most people, but from the tiny knight\u2019s perspective it was an endless shelf of breasts that blocked out all light as it crashed down upon him. The initial impact instantly reduced his partially reformed body back to a two-dimensional smear and the pressure only got worse as Winter continued to lower herself, her heavy chest compacting against the table, and Jaune, as it spread out in all directions and threatened to burst from her tight blouse and vest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile their friend suffered beneath the colossal weight of the older Schnee\u2019s bust, Team RWBY was dealing with issues of their own. Weiss had still been standing slightly behind her teammates as Winter lent down, which had led to the larger girl\u2019s boobs being practically shoved in Blake and Yang\u2019s faces. Slightly further behind and too young to really think about it, Ruby remained oblivious, but the older girls couldn\u2019t help but stare in awe for a moment before shaking it off and taking a tentative step back with a nervous chuckle and blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying, and only somewhat succeeding, at averting their gazes without obviously looking the other way, the two partners wondering idly how this could be the diminutive Weiss\u2019s sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearby, Nora laughed openly at the scene, while Pyrrha looked down in concern, worrying her lip and wondering if she should say something to Winter about the unsafe proximity. Neither noticed as Glynda stepped around behind Pyrrha and snatched up Ren, who had chosen to stand further way from his energetic friends. The shrunken boy\u2019s decision had put him a safe distance from the other giants but left him vulnerable to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha had advised the older woman of the shrunken students\u2019 squishy nature on the way back to the dorms, and the professor\u2019s inquisitive side had been triggered. Having seen her chance to snatch one of them up unseen she instantly began playing with Ren like a piece of dough, kneading and stretching him between her hands. This was utter agony for her captive but such things weren\u2019t of much interest to the massive blonde once her academic curiosity had been piqued. Utterly fascinated, she took a step back from the desk and back towards the centre of the room, continuing to play with her new toy away from the immediate sight of his teammates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, staring down at her sister, Winter noted her ragged appearance and wet clothing, not to mention the grime in her hair. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d She frowned slightly at the smaller Schnee\u2019s visible wince, and lowered the volume of her voice. \u201cWhy are you so\u2026 messed up?\u201d Keen to hear the answer she somehow managed to compress herself even closer to the table, her twin mounds spreading out yet further as they completely obliterated Jaune beneath their weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question brought an instant blush to Pyrrha\u2019s face, thankfully unseen by the protective big sis, while the other members of Team RWBY fidgeted awkwardly as they recalled their own crushing of Weiss. The heiress ignored them all and played off the whole situation as an unfortunate incident that wasn\u2019t worth going into detail over, ensuring her sister that she was fine now. Winter seemed unconvinced but eventually nodded and straightened, her breasts bouncing visibly as they expanded back to their original size, and unknowingly carrying the utterly smashed Jaune into the air, reduced to little more than an insignificant smear against the blue vest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Blake and Yang tried not to stare at the still bouncing bosom now handing high above their heads, and Pyrrha sighed in relief that she was not going to face Winter\u2019s wrath, Glynda had escalated her behaviour to stomping Ren into the carpeted floor, practically marching in place as she pummelled the boy beneath her nylons in an effort to determine just how much damage he could take. If left to her own devices she may have continued such torment for hours, but the giant blonde was snapped out of her fun by a sudden cry from the smaller of Team JNPR\u2019s redheads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRen\u2019s gone!\u201d Still laughing over Winter\u2019s interactions with Team RWBY, the hammer-wielder had turned to share her mirth with her partner, only to finally notice his absence and yell up to her larger teammate in alarm. Focused on Pyrrha, she hadn\u2019t noticed Glynda flinch at her cry, nor did she see the look of relief as the professor realised she had not been noticed and quietly shifted her right foot to obscure the now utterly flattened teen from sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha instantly began to panic, and Weiss finally had the presence of mind to look back to where they had left Jaune, frowning when she realised that he too was missing. Needless to say the revelation of just how small her partner was only made the redhead panic further as she began desperately scanning the desk and surrounding furniture for any sight of her missing teammates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing a potential chance to expand her collection and/or make Ren a more permanent test subject, Glynda \u2018helpfully\u2019 suggested that perhaps Winter had crushed the unfortunate boys under her boobs when she\u2019d dropped them onto the table, though not actually believing it herself. Predictably the giant white haired woman obediently grabbed her own chest and probed the fabric for any sign of a squishy boy or two while Pyrrha (and Team RWBY) looked on with varying degrees of concern and awe. Unfortunately for Glynda the giant redhead had at least had the presence of mind to move closer to Nora before becoming too distracted, leaving the massive blonde with only one test subject as she casually dumped the flattened Ren into her right heel and reinserted her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad the larger of JNPR\u2019s shrunken males really been trapped to Winter\u2019s bosom she may have felt him as she squeezed the massive orbs, but as it was the tiny Jaune was just far too small to be detected by such massive fingers. The digits brushed over him without slowing, succeeding only in weakening the tenuous bond between his shrunken body and the texture of her vest and propelling him out into the air to flutter down on an insignificant breeze and land unseen on the desk\u2019s chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Jaune, rendered utterly delirious from his experience beneath the specialist\u2019s breasts, there was no time to reform at all as the shadow of [Name]\u2019s tremendous rump fell over him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When she had suggested that Winter may have flattened the men of JNPR, Glynda hadn\u2019t really believed it. After all she\u2019d known exactly where Ren was and had no particular reason to suspect that Jaune may have been stuck to the curvaceous girl\u2019s chest. Yet as she watched the other girls closely to ensure they didn\u2019t see what she was doing with Ren, she was the only one who saw the tiny flattened thing flutter down from the massive curves and land on the nearby chair. It took a moment for the situation to click in her mind but when it did she wasted no time in slamming her full ass down on the hapless tiny, disguising the motion as a tired and defeated slump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be wrong to say that Glynda hated Jaune, but she\u2019d never been particularly fond of the boy that she knew full-well had lied his way into the academy. She didn\u2019t know that she was returning him to a hell he had already experienced as she annihilated him beneath her tremendous rear, and she didn\u2019t particularly care either. There\u2019s was no way she could pass up the chance to experiment on what was clearly the smallest of the shrunken students, though she was disappointed to find that even squirming quietly in the seat did not allow her to feel the speck of a boy buried beneath her. In contrast, Ren\u2019s constant squirming was like a gentle massage against her foot, ceasing only briefly to recover each time her toes clenched down on his vulnerable form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jaune and Ren continued to suffer, their blonde tormentor pondered her next course of action. Pyrrha was still looking frantically for her lost friends, and was glancing fearfully back at Nora every other second, while Winter continued to hover protectively over Team RWBY as an imposing and immovable guardian. As much as she didn\u2019t want to admit it, Glynda knew it would not be possible to grab everyone, and that maybe she\u2019d have to settle just for the two she\u2019d already managed to acquire, at least for now. Although, if she gave up on some of them entirely, maybe she could make an opportunity to expand her collection\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMs Nikos.\u201d The authoritative tone was enough to stop the redhead in her tracks, and drew curious eyes in Glynda\u2019s direction. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that we will make no progress searching like this. The best course of action now is to remove as many variables as possible and shift the odds in our favour.\u201d She had to hide her grin at the hopeful look that came over Pyrrha\u2019s face. \u201cTeam RWBY are accounted for so I suggest that Ms Schnee take them elsewhere while the two of us focus on recovering the rest of your team. Doctor Oobleck has some aura scanning equipment in his lab. If you can obtain it for me we can use it to search for your friends. Meanwhile, I\u2019ll make some calls.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinter eyes flicked between her sister\u2019s team and Beacon\u2019s vice-principal, experiencing somewhat mixed feelings as her eyes lingered on Weiss\u2019s teammates. \u201cThere\u2019s a full lab facility on the General\u2019s airship. I could take them there for observation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former heiress had never told anyone, could never, but she had a \u2018preference\u2019 for playing with tiny little things. Maybe it was her father\u2019s controlling upbringing, or maybe it was just something inherent to herself, but Winter enjoyed domination, especially the idea of dominating people who were smaller than herself (so long as they were of age of course). The concept of being a literal giantess had occurred to her more than once, but prior to this very moment had seemed nothing more than a foolish fantasy that was well and truly beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow however, she could see not one but four tiny people standing right before her. Of course she\u2019d never consider doing anything with Weiss and to her mind Ruby was too young and na\u00efve to partake in such things, but she couldn\u2019t help flicking lustful eyes towards Blake and Yang. She was perfectly aware of the way they had been staring at her chest, in fact she had deliberately flaunted it for their benefit. Winter would take Ruby and Weiss for help, but with Blake and Yang she figured this was the best chance she was ever going to get to take a shot at fulfilling her fantasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the members of Team RWBY noticed the way that Winter was looking at them, they didn\u2019t say anything, just quickly conferring among themselves and agreeing with her proposal. None of them batted an eye as the white-haired woman casually noted that she\u2019d have to carry the bumblebee duo in her pockets as she only had two hands, but that was before they realised that the \u2018pockets\u2019 in question were located on the inside of the specialist\u2019s vest, right up against her luscious bosom. The Faunus and brawler were too shocked to object as they suddenly found themselves pressed gently against the warmth of the older Schnee\u2019s chest, hidden from the view of a now very flustered Weiss and confused Ruby as the last two members of Team RWBY were lifted from the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her part, Pyrrha barely even noticed what Winter was doing with her little prizes, still focused on thinking through Glynda\u2019s proposal while staring down at the only teammate she had managed to keep track of. She said nothing as the taller woman left the room with little more than a nod in their direction, though the sound of the door closing did snap her out of her thoughts enough to finally posit a response. \u201cI understand. If you think that\u2019s what\u2019s best then let\u2019s do it.\u201d Bright green eyes flicked down to Nora with a soft smile. \u201cTry to find the guys okay, I\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d She received a nod and a smile in return, not to mention a brief and unseen smirk from the watching professor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Pyrrha left the room with one final wave and promise to return as quickly as possible, Glynda could hardly believe her luck, turning inquisitive eyes to her latest acquisition as the oblivious Nora returned to a pointless search for her missing partner, unaware of the danger that loomed above.</span></div></div>",

The approach had run the risk that the last normal-sized member of Team JNPR would take her little teammate with her for protection, but fortunately the amazon\u2019s trust in her professor had won out, and the blonde was now left with three diverse test subjects for her experiments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Pyrrha left the room Glynda\u2019s gaze shifted to Nora, watching as the girl continued to search fruitlessly for her partner and contemplating her next step. She could just grab the girl right now, but a part of her wanted to have some fun with this first. Wanted to take her time enjoying the feeling of power she now had, before proceeding to more experiments. \u201cMs Valkyrie, do you know how much weight your average aura-enhanced human can take without being killed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha\u2026\u201d Confused at the sudden question, Nora took a moment to formulate her response, slightly uneasy at the cold calculating look she was receiving. \u201cI, uh\u2026 I don\u2019t really know.\u201d Academics were never exactly her strong point, especially when it came to pop quizzes like this. \u201cA lot I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually it\u2019s not really that much. Aura can only absorb so much, and once it\u2019s depleted the body is just weak flesh and bone. Whereas\u2026\u201d Grinding her foot down for a moment, she pulled her right foot out of her heel and raised it up to Nora\u2019s level, showing the little redhead the flattened form of Ren adhered to the sole of her sweaty black nylons. \u201cYour new bodies appear to be much more durable. Even now I can feel Mr Lie starting to reform.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say Nora was shocked would be an extreme understatement. Here was the partner she had been looking for, flattened cartoonishly to the sole of a woman she had trusted. \u201cRen! Why did you\u2026 what have you done to him?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m experimenting.\u201d Glynda\u2019s reply was cold and clinical, completely ignoring the hammer-wielder\u2019s increasingly furious gaze. \u201cThe potential benefits if I can figure out how your new bodies work are incredible. If we could find a way to make it work at normal scale we could drastically increase the survivability of hunters.\u201d Still talking, she casually reached down to peel Ren from her foot and starting stretching the boy with her hands, removing the twists that had developed over his body. \u201cNot only are you able to be squished but your malleability is quite impressive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit more stretching, the massive professor paused to examine her tiny captive, noting that the boy had almost completely regained his original shape and was starting to reclaim his third dimension. She could now distinctly hear his groans of pain, and noted in satisfaction that he was not only still breathing but conscious as well. The potential combat applications were immense. Still deep in thought Glynda\u2019s eyes flicked down to Nora again and for a moment the incensed redhead thought her partner would be returned, but then the blonde casually stuffed the squishy boy deep into her open cleavage, his tortured body disappearing completely into the embrace of her massive bosom as she stored him away for later use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! Give him back!\u201d Reaching her breaking point, the hammer-wielder tried to charge the clearly antagonistic woman sitting before her, only to be knocked back by a casual flick of a finger. Knocked on her butt she could only look up in abject horror as Glynda started to massage her own breasts, squishing them together and subjecting Ren to his own personal marshmallow hell as he was almost instantly reduced to putty between the warm and sweaty mounds. Simultaneously the giant blonde starting to grind her massive rump into the chair, though a frown crossed her face at the feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s odd. I can feel your partner just fine but Mr Arc is having no effect whatsoever. I wonder if he\u2019s just unable to move beneath my weight, or is he so insignificant I just can\u2019t feel him at all?\u201d She ignored the renewed protests from her largest test subject as she started grinding her ass with great vigour, disappointed to find that nothing she did would allow her to feel the smallest member of JNPR buried beneath her left buttock. Jaune meanwhile could feel her movements all too well as he was practically ironed onto the tight fabric of her pencil skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora couldn\u2019t believe what she was hearing. Not just Ren, but Jaune as well was being crushed by this woman? It didn\u2019t make any sense. Throwing all caution to the wind she screamed and charged again, making it slightly further this time before Glynda\u2019s hand fell from above, instantly flattening her into a fleshy pancake as it slammed down on the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing in exasperation at the uncooperative student, Glynda picked up the shrunken girl and started stretching her with her hands. Putting aside her annoyance at the rude behaviour, she noted that Nora was less pliant than Ren had been, and wondered if she was less malleable as well. The redhead\u2019s greater size would make her easier to experiment on than her smaller partner, and any results from the test could then be compared to the JNPR boys. Still, she also wanted to check how absorbent their new bodies were, and see just how flat they could become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter considering for a moment, Glynda eventually decided to\u2026</span></div></div>",

I wonder\u2026\u201d Wrapping her hand around the reforming Nora\u2019s head, Glynda squeezed down to stop any potential complaints, smearing the poor girl\u2019s face all over the folds of her palm as the fingers of her other hand wrapped around one of the redhead\u2019s legs and started to pull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Nora this was agony. For Glynda it was fascinating as the leg easily began to stretch between her hands, nearly tripling in length before the resistance became more intense. Even with the greater resistance she continued to pull, noting with fascination as the limb stretched most around the knee, the squishiness seemingly multiplied around structural weak points. Perhaps it was an adaption to avoid lasting damage to such locations. Fascinating as well was the fact that the rest of Nora\u2019s body resisted stretching until the leg was nearly five times its original length. Only then did the poor girl\u2019s waist and neck begin to stretch as well, gradually elongating her entire body out from her trapped head. By the time the professor\u2019s hands had reached as far apart as possible the little redhead looked more like a piece of stretched gum than the human she had once been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally satisfied, Glynda released the leg and watched the tortured teen quickly snap back towards her other hand. For a few moments the stretched out body hung listlessly from her closed fist, but then it began to twitch and quickly started to reform to its original shape. It was captivating to watch as Nora\u2019s body regained its original form, her body pulling back to its original dimensions as the leg pulled back up and the neck retracted. In all the process was remarkably quick, taking less than a minute to undo the significant damage that had been inflicted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, well if that\u2019s not enough.\u201d Glynda wasn\u2019t really trying to be cruel or anything, and she didn\u2019t have anything against Nora, but right now the most important thing was figuring out how the shrunken students\u2019 bodies worked. After she\u2019d done that she could consider their comfort. Right now what she wanted to find out was whether she could fundamentally alter the shape of the unfortunate girl\u2019s body and meaningfully affect her ability to reform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Nora\u2019s perspective the moment that Glynda released her head was one of precious freedom, but it ended all too quickly as pinching fingers descended over her entire body, ripping off her clothes and nipping at her skin. She groaned in agony as her blonde tormentor starting to stretch her out in every direction at once, squishing her limbs back into her central mass as her body was slowly morphed into a flat disk. The hammer-wielder did her best to plead for mercy through a partially reformed mouth but it fell on death-ears as her face was quickly crushed as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more moments the professor succeeded in reducing her unfortunate captive to a flat disk of flesh, individual features barely identifiable. Placing the girl on the desk she watched with rapt attention as she twitched fitfully, her ability to reform seemingly slowed significantly from the altered state. A squirming from her bosom reminded Glynda that they were not alone, and she casually removed Ren from her cleavage as she waited for his partner to reform. Ripping off the boy\u2019s cloths in one swift motion she nonchalantly rolled him into a sphere, noting as she did so that he did indeed appear to be more easily malleable than Nora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding the sphere in her hand, Glynda looked down at the still slowly reforming redhead, contemplating her next course of action as she casually played with Ren like a squishy stress toy.</span></div></div>",

With each step her large chest bounced visibly, barely constrained within the confines of her bra and tight vest. The heavy mounds of flesh pressed tightly against her other two passengers, separated only by the thin fabric of her bra and blouse, and each bounce pushed them deeper into the warm embrace of her bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom a young age, Winter had been raised as the original heiress to the Schnee Dust Company, and after being disowned by her father she had become a high-ranking specialist under General Ironwood, so she knew a thing or two about keeping her composure under pressure. That was why she was able to maintain a neutral expression and converse freely with the inquisitive Ruby as she headed towards the docks, never once letting on just what was on her mind, nor giving in to the almost overwhelming desire to use her free hand to massage her little prizes against her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile her partner seemed oblivious, Weiss was not so young as to not catch the implications of her sister\u2019s actions, but Ruby\u2019s rapid questions about a variety of mundane topics were preventing her from raising her own concerns. Soon enough questions about her own childhood distracted her from the issue entirely as she glared at her partner and looked to Winter with a look that told her to stop indulging the inquisitive teen, though at her size the older Schnee could barely make it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Team RWBY and their transport were stepping off a flyer and into the loading dock of Ironwood\u2019s personal airship. A quick and somewhat awkward security check later and they entered the ship\u2019s main lab, currently occupied by a single familiar face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSalutations! What brings you to the lab Specialist Schnee?\u201d Always happy to have company, even from the usually taciturn woman, Penny grinned broadly at her guest before her advanced scanners alerted her to the form of Ruby clutched in her hand. \u201cWhat is that? It looks like friend Ruby!\u201d The android girl had a whole subsection of programming devoted to handling social interactions with her first real friend, but this current situation was not computing properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she hadn\u2019t necessary expected the lab to be empty, Winter hadn\u2019t expected to see the young redhead here. She never knew how to deal with this\u2026 girl, but it seemed like she was at least familiar with Team RWBY so perhaps she could trust her with what had happened. \u201cActually Penny, this is in fact Ruby Rose, there\u2019s been an accident and we\u2019re trying to get to the bottom of it.\u201d She motioned with one finger towards the even tinier girl still clutched in Ruby\u2019s arms. \u201cMy sister was shrunken as well, though it appears the effect was worse for her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see.\u201d She didn\u2019t really, there was nothing in the database that covered this scenario, but she\u2019d made enough exceptions for her friend already. A few more wouldn\u2019t matter. Emerald eyes shimmered for a moment as magnification was increased, zeroing in on Weiss and confirming that the heiress had, in fact, been shrunken to a truly tiny size. \u201cMay I be of assistance?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPossibly.\u201d Temporarily placing Ruby and Weiss on the nearest bench, Winter bent over to rummage around in the cabinets beneath, allowing herself a soft smile as the full weight of her breasts bore down on Blake and Yang, provoking a pleasurable squirming from her little captives. Temporarily out of sight from her sister, she gave her chest a quick and reassuring rub to let them know she meant no harm, before straightening up and giving the bumblebee duo a chance to breathe again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss frowned as she saw the large container her sister was now holding, looking like something between a hamster cage and a terrarium, complete with in-built water source and temperature control. \u201cWhat, exactly, is that?\u201d She wasn\u2019t sure if her sister had heard what she said or just read her body language, but the response of \u201cit\u2019s a specimen container\u201d wasn\u2019t exactly to her liking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling her eyes at the younger girl\u2019s disgruntlement, Winter lifted the two students and placed them in the container. She bent down again to look through the thick glass as she secured the lid and noted Penny doing the same on the other side, the younger girl having a look of wonderment on her face. \u201cThis is for your own safety you two. There\u2019s water and some food in the dispenser and the floor is padded.\u201d A pause. \u201cPenny will look after you.\u201d Resting her chest on the edge of the bench, she made sure to keep her weight on her arms to avoid actually crushing her pocket passengers but couldn\u2019t resist a slight twist that grinded them against her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her part, the android seemed highly excited at her latest task, saluting her superior with obvious glee. \u201cDo not worry. I will guard them carefully.\u201d Of course she would. Friend Ruby was precious to her, and even if they hadn\u2019t interacted as much she considered the rest of Team RWBY her friends by proxy, so she would be happy to look after Weiss as well. Already her head was literally buzzing with ways she could help the two feel safe, or maybe even help to make them better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss attempted to protest but was interrupted by her partner. \u201cWhat about Yang and Blake?\u201d Ruby wasn\u2019t as disappointed as the heiress with their new surroundings, and she would be happy to get some more time with Penny. But she did wonder what was happening with her other teammates, her eyes briefly drifting down to Winter\u2019s chest and wondering if they were still okay down there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u201d, standing up straight, the specialist glanced down at her chest, before smiling fondly at Ruby. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. They\u2019re\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

One is going to be trouble enough.\u201d She playfully glared at Ruby to add weight to her words, already fairly sure the shrunken leader would be sufficiently careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping back from the bench, Winter raised a hand in a slight wave. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be back soon to check on you all. I\u2019m sure Penny will keep you safe while I\u2019m gone.\u201d Not waiting for a response and confident in their safety, she left the lab and quickly locked the door behind her. A brisk walk across the ship then brought her to her own temporary living quarters, a quick bit of reprogramming on the door ensuring that no-one would interrupt what came next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a strong temptation to remove the bumblebee duo right now and make them an offer they couldn\u2019t refuse, but if she was going to do this then Winter wanted to do it right. Shrugging off her coat she folded it over her chair, together with her long gloves, her detachable sleeves and the long trail at her back. Her tight boots came off in one fluid practiced motion, joined quickly thereafter by the leather belts which had held them in place, leaving the tall woman standing in her shorts, blouse and vest. As a final touch she reached up to pull her hair out of its bun, shaking the long tresses free to fall gently across her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow feeling sufficiently ready to meet her potential playmates, Winter gently began massaging her own breasts, taking a few moments to make sure her intentions were absolutely clear before reaching into her vest and removing the two thoroughly flustered girls. By now both Blake and Yang were blushing noticeably, and were surprised to see the soft and gentle smile that they were receiving from the giant Schnee, having expected perhaps less than benevolent intentions. Yet the gentleness with which they were set on the bedside table was clearly sincere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharing a confused glance with her more reticent partner, Yang took the initiative and stepped forward. \u201cUmm, why are you\u2026 No, first, where are Ruby and Weiss?\u201d It was hard to get her priorities straight when she was mostly just wondering why she had just spent the last several minutes getting intimate with the massive girl\u2019s chest, and why that same girl had shed half of her previous clothing. Beside her Blake nodded in wordless agreement with her query, struggling to maintain her own composure at the not-exactly unpleasant situation she had just experienced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpressed at the question, Winter casually waved her hand. \u201cThey\u2019re safe, don\u2019t worry. I dropped them off at the lab on the way here. I wouldn\u2019t put my sister in harm\u2019s way.\u201d Taking the chance to take control of the conversation she dropped herself onto the bed, spreading herself out provocatively and noting with satisfaction the way the shrunken girls\u2019 eyes followed the lines of her body. \u201cAs for the two of you, I have a proposition to make. I\u2019m not the kind to beat around the bush so I\u2019ll cut straight to the chase. I\u2019ve seen the way the two of you have been looking at me\u2026\u201d She raised a hand to fend off the responses she could already see coming. \u201cI\u2019m not annoyed. In fact, I am\u2026 receptive. I would not be opposed to the two of you servicing my body, so to speak. I would be a kind mistress of course, but I would still expect you both to do as told.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the partners had been blushing before then they were practically scarlet now, their composure all but broken in the face of this choice. As thoroughly flustered as she was though, Blake maintained enough composure to reach out and grab Yang\u2019s hand, squeezing slightly and drawing her partner\u2019s attention so they could have a silent conversation with their eyes. For her part the brawler looked back at the Faunus in concern, knowing that the girl had more reason than most to be nervous giving herself to a Schnee, no matter how attractive she happened to be. Yet neither of them could help their attraction to the former heiress and it didn\u2019t seem like she had any malicious intent\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to the lounging Winter, Yang stepped forward once again, though she maintained her grip on Blake\u2019s hand. \u201cAlright, we\u2019re\u2026 not opposed to having some fun.\u201d She licked her lips briefly, fighting to maintain her composure under the positively sultry gaze she was now receiving, and fixed a firm expression on her face. \u201cBut just to be absolutely clear Ruby is off limits.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she was positively thrilled at the response she had received, Winter was calm enough to nod quickly in agreement with the blonde\u2019s demand. \u201cOf course, I had already decided that myself.\u201d Her eyes flicked to Blake. \u201cIs there anything else I should know?\u201d Though she presumed the girl was just quiet, she was slightly concerned that she had not received a direct response from the brunette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question left Blake at an impasse. On the one hand she wanted to do this, and she knew that honesty was important in situations like this. On the other, this was still a Schnee they were talking about, but\u2026 she had to take the chance. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 a Faunus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her credit Winter didn\u2019t even pause before responding. \u201cI see. Does that mean your sense of smell is going to be a problem? I\u2019ll have you know I keep myself quite clean.\u201d She knew that wasn\u2019t what the Faunus girl had been getting at, as she was fully aware of her family history, but this wasn\u2019t the time to be dwelling on things neither of them could change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang beamed, and Blake heaved a sigh of relief, shaking her head and ensuring the giant girl that everything would be fine. Taking them at their word, Winter shifted herself closer to her prizes, pausing only for a moment to remind them that they could say no at any time before reaching down to scoop them up. With no further reservations the shrunken partner\u2019s allowed themselves to be lifted and pulled closer to Winter\u2019s massive body, both wondering just what they had gotten themselves into as they waited for their new \u2018owner\u2019 to give her first command.</span></div></div>",

No longer concerned with perhaps coming on too strongly, the specialist also removed her vest and undid the top few buttons of her blouse before sauntering over to her waiting playmates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt a quick request from Winter, Blake and Yang gripped the sheets and secured themselves as the giant woman crawled onto the bed, turning to place a nylon-clad leg on either side of the bumblebee duo as her full ass hovered above. They\u2019d known from the start that Weiss\u2019s sister had impressive proportions, but seeing her rear up-close like this, especially at their size, was something else. Like her sister, Winter\u2019s flesh was creamy and smooth, born both from impeccable breeding and a life which until recently had brought little physical adversity. But unlike her sister, the older Schnee also had a lot more weight in her curves, her toned cheeks barely contained by thin white panties. The sight of the giant mass hanging above them was\u2026 mesmerising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly and carefully, Winter lowered her derriere onto the shrunken pair, pausing a moment with the mass just within reach to make sure she could feel them as they obediently reached up to run their hands over the warm buttocks. Confident that they were sufficiently cable of alerting her to any problems she allowed herself to drop back further, each student disappearing completely beneath a voluminous cheek. Though the giant specialist was careful to keep most of her weight on her legs there was still enough force to press the partners deep into the mattress, smothering them beneath the warm doughy flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Blake and Yang the sensation was better than anything they had imagined, like being buried beneath an indescribably comfortable and warm mass that quickly began to vibrate above them as Winter started to shift her hips side to side. Completely unable to resist, both girls started to rub their hands and bodies across every reachable part of the giant posterior, moaning in pleasure as every inch of them was massaged by the shifting cheeks above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensation of her little friends rubbing up against her was enough for Winter to bite her lip in pleasure, pressing down a bit harder for a moment and allowing more of her weight onto her ass before rising back up and giving Blake and Yang a chance to breathe. A glance over her shoulder revealed only her own butt, so she raised herself further and looked down between her legs to get a look at the bumblebee duo. The giant Schnee couldn\u2019t help but smirk at the flustered faces of the two shrunken girls, a thin sheen of sweat now covering their bodies as their chests heaved from a combination of excitement and an almost unheeded need for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoting the raised eyebrow being shot in their direction, Blake managed a weak wave. \u201cDon\u2019t worry we\u2019re\u2026 fine. Again\u2026 please.\u201d Beside her Yang was beyond words, but nodded quickly in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease with that response, Winter dropped herself back onto her playmates with slightly more force then she had intended, bouncing slightly in place as she landed and momentarily worried that she may have done some damage, only to smile in relief as the pleasurable squirming restarted. Confident now that their little bodies could take the pressure, the massive beauty began bouncing in place, allowing much more of her weight to fall on her rump as she really started to move. The feeling of the two defenceless teens being battered all over the place by her fabulous rear was simultaneously indescribable and everything Winter had ever dreamed of. If she\u2019d known it would be like this\u2026 well, she was just glad that they\u2019d agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeneath the bouncing specialist, Blake and Yang were experiencing pleasure of their own. For the blonde the increased pressure was just revving her up, much the same way as a fight usually did, driving her systems into overdrive as she began massaging the cheeks above her with even greater force. Beside her, the Faunus girl took full advantage of the rare opportunity to let her base instincts take over out of sight from prying eyes, opening her mouth to lick and nip at the creamy flesh. Both girls were starting to get completely into their roles as Winter\u2019s tiny servants, unbothered by the slight squishing of their bodies under the giant girl\u2019s ceaseless barrage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more moments, the older Schnee raised herself to give the shrunken partners another chance to breathe, but how do things progress for the trio?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Winter saw the the partners lay smushed into the mattress, she could not help but feel like an all powerful goddess. The sight of some of her younger sisters best friend, lying almost flattened, as a result of her generous backside, was thrilling for the larger specialist, and she was ecstatic to continue with her playthings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready for round two, my little worshippers?\" She cooed at the exhausted pair, tauntingly gyrating her hips, causing her cheeks to wobble happily in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just need... A few more minutes.. To catch our breath\" Blake panted, eyes following the colossal pantyclad posterior, teasing her from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... Your big butt really did a number on us... It's hard to breathe under all that mass.\" Yang followed up, gesturing towards Winter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinter stopped her gyrating, and quickly looked back, at the now confused pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You dare speak back so casually to your goddess?\" Winter angrily glared at Blake \"And you, how dare you insult the object of YOUR desire. It's not easy to maintain a small posterior when you have to go trough the training i do\" Winter sneered at Yang, grabbing her two cheeks, and pushing into the soft flesh, lifting them and dropping them to further prove the point of her sizeable behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two need a lesson in humility\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinter forcefully slammed her ass down onto the exhausted pair, who had no energy left to run, and was forced to embrace the plump butt, that crashed into them. Yang tried her best to retaliate at the doughy mountains that was now enveloping them on all sides, and unleashed her semblance, but to no avail, as the sheer size and weight of Winter, couple with the softness of the cheeks, just made Yangs arms sink into the smooth flesh. Blake tried her best to reach out to Yang, completely immobilized by the large flesh mass above her, only getting a glimpse of her partner, every time the cheeks rippled at the impact of Yangs futile punches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large Schnee was in heaven, the furious punches from the angry brawler, sending ripples of orgasm trough her cheeks, and up trough her body. The large Schnee in her sex fueled craze, grabbed on to the sides of her struggling underwear, and wiggled her ass around on top of the duo, furiously trying to remove her underwear, to fully enjoy her time as a goddess. With each wiggle she however felt the pair getting flung around by her wobbling cheeks, and this prompted Winter to further pick up her pace, to get the busty blonde back on track with her forceful \"massage\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she managed to slide out of her skimpy underwear, and her cheeks happily bounced out, and spilled onto the mattress, free from their tiny containment. Blake recoiled at the smell coming from above. Her feline instincts made her more susceptible to the stench emanating from deep withing the cheeks. Yang was unphased by the scent from the larger Schnees crack, buried under a flower smelling cheek, and without the same instincts as her partner, but she felt the mattress at her feet, getting slightly damp, damning the larger Schnee crushing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinter resumed her gyrating, flinging the poor duo underneath her around her doughy behind, getting more and more wet with each kick or punch she took to her sizable behind. The giant Schnee was in ecstasy, clenching her every muscle in delight, and clutching onto the covers of her now war ravaged bed. She was moving her butt in every direction she could, giving the partners at least some delight with her unleashed behind, occasionally lifting it up, and slamming it down fast again, to simultaneously punish them for their insubordination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, a deep rumble from withing the bowels of the large Schnne, quickly alerted both her, and the duo beneath. Winter quickly stopped her assault on the tiny pair, giving a slight smirk. Underneath her ass, the tiny duo had also noticed the rumble from above them, and only feared the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinter still smirking to herself, announced to the pair</span></div></div>",

I think you too should get more used to my heavenly gas.\u201d Winter said as she sat her bare ass back on her little slaves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang, unable to speak due to still being in a coughing fit from Winters first sulfur blast, barely mangaged to choke out her joke,<br>\r\n\u201cHeavenly gas? More like hellish gas...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake, however, was in fear. If that was just the first one and each one is going worse than the last, 'Will I\u2019ll even be able to survive this?' popped into her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>PfffffffffFFFFT</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWheeew, if you thought the the last one was bad, wait till you catch a wiff of that one.\u201d Winter said laughing but not getting up this time to ensure her little slaves got every last bit of it.

Blake, however, threw up again despite thinking she already expelled all the contents of her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>PFFFFFFF</b>. \u201cI\u2019m going to need to get a cloths pin if I want to continue... which I do!\u201d Yang couldn\u2019t hold back her vomit this time and added hers to the already huge puddle of vomit made by Blake. Blake also threw up from both the sight and smell of Yangs vomit as well as the ungodly stench that was burning her nose hairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hours of torturing Blake and Yang with her \u201cheavenly gas\u201d, Winter finally stood up.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Unfortunately for Weiss, Pyrrha remained utterly oblivious to the torment she was putting the tiny girl through as she continued to stomp around the room in a fruitless search for her partner. If any of the others had taken the time to look up at the redhead\u2019s soles as she stalked across the room they may have seen the crushed body of the heiress slowly slipping completely into the embrace of their friend\u2019s toes, but everyone was too preoccupied with the search for Jaune to witness Weiss\u2019s fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her part Pyrrha didn\u2019t even consciously notice her toes\u2019 new companion. She dimly registered a slight itch beneath the toes of her right foot, but pushed it quickly from her mind as she continued her search, subconsciously allowing her toes to shift and grind against each other to relieve the itch. By the time she had once again risen on her toes to check the highest bookshelf in the room, the feeling had vanished completely, the heiress\u2019s body reduced to little more than a sweat-soaked tattoo, completely at the mercy of her unaware captor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Weiss suffered in silent agony beneath Pyrrha\u2019s toes and Jaune continued to be chewed up by her shifting buttocks, the remaining members of Team RWBY and Team JNPR continued to scan the room, in a search that had been doomed to failure the moment it began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter nearly twenty minutes of searching, Pyrrha finally reached her limit, her concern for Jaune reaching a critical point as she whirled back to face the dresser she shared with Nora. If her partner wasn\u2019t in the room then perhaps he had ended up somewhere else, somewhere worse. Maybe he needed her help right now, and if that was the case she couldn\u2019t just stay here. If she was unable to find him herself than she would just have to seek the help of someone else. And while she was at it she could find some way to help her other friends, or at least a way to look after them better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bigger members of Team RWBY were one thing, and Nora and Ren should be relatively okay, at least as long as Nora kept an eye on her own partner, but Pyrrha was worried about Weiss. The girl was so tiny that she could easily be crushed without anyone noticing, and probably wouldn\u2019t even be able to cause an irritation if she was. The thought was enough for the redhead to shudder in fear, unconsciously clenching her toes as she dwelt on the possible dangers to her little friend, completely unaware of the agony she was inflicting on that very same friend with her careless actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quick shake of her head, Pyrrha shook those thoughts from her mind and pulled open the top drawer of her dresser with more force than strictly necessary as she focused on the task at hand. So sharp was her focus that she hadn\u2019t even seen Ren standing on top of the dresser as she approached, her teammate\u2019s casual gaze turning into one of shock as the piece of furniture shuddered beneath him from the redhead\u2019s violent opening and he tipped over the edge into the drawer below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeedless of Ren\u2019s fall, Pyrrha whipped off her T-shirt and tossed it to the side, narrowly missing Ruby in the process, and then reached down to grab a bra. Grabbing a plain green sports bra with nothing more than a glance, she failed to take note of the tiny green-clad passenger in the left cup. The shrunken boy had less than a second to cry out, struggling to find his voice in the wake of his fall, and failed to make so much as a peep before being slammed face-first into the underside of his teammate\u2019s giant chest, his squishy body offering no resistance as it was instantly flattened by the massive orb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn ordinary circumstances, Ren\u2019s size would likely have been sufficient for Pyrrha to notice his location, even as the weight of her left boob fell fully upon him and smeared him across the cup, but unfortunately he had come to line up perfectly with a seam in the fabric, and any irritation he caused was dismissed as a by-product of the seam\u2019s location. Blissfully oblivious, the redhead secured the clasp and pulled the straps tight, unknowingly amplifying the pressure on her unfortunate friend even as she successfully squashed any lingering irritation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFace covered with the creamy flesh of his teammate\u2019s chest, Ren could do nothing to save himself as the heavy mass heaved in and out in time with Pyrrha\u2019s breathing, the tight bra ensuring that he experienced no relief from the overwhelming pressure. It only became worse as the redhead leant down to retrieve some socks from a lower drawer, the full weight of her chest bearing down on the tiny boy. To add insult to injury the boobs began to jiggle slightly as the giant girl briefly moved to one foot, unknowingly crushing Weiss even further as she bore all of her weight down on the toes holding the shrunken fencer while she slipped a well-worn sock over her left foot, only to repeat the process with her right foot, hiding the little heiress from sight behind a wall of white cotton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently not content with the pain she had so far inflicted on her vulnerable friends, Pyrrha straightened quickly and donned a loose shirt before grabbing a pair of skin-tight jeans. She hadn\u2019t put any particular thought into the choice of clothing. The jeans had merely been on top of her pile of pants, but the consequences of the choice would be dire indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jeans were only halfway up the redhead\u2019s legs when their tightness began to hinder her progress. Used to this issue, Pyrrha didn\u2019t let it bother her much and merely redoubled her efforts, hopping slightly in place as she fought her own personal battle against the reluctant garment. It was no issue to her that she was bouncing on her toes, driving the digits into the ground over and over again as the coarse fabric of her socks was rubbed against their underside. Nor was the bouncing of her chest any great concern, the overworked bra struggling to keep them contained as they threatened to burst from its confines. She certainly didn\u2019t pay any attention to the way her hips were moving side-to-side, her meaty buttocks sliding against each other freely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she couldn\u2019t ignore, however, was the moment she stepped down too hard with her right foot and lost her balance all at once, stumbling backwards and nearly crushing Blake and Yang in the process before landing heavily on Ren\u2019s bed. For Nora, standing on that very bed as she searched for Jaune, there was no warning to herald the massive weight of Pyrrha\u2019s rear as it crashed down upon her, mercilessly reducing the hammer-wielder to paper-thinness as the springy surface of the mattress left the redhead bouncing in place for a few moments while she regained her bearings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a moment for what had just happened to sink in completely, but when it did Pyrrha blushed furiously as she sprung back to her feet, utterly heedless of the continued bouncing of her chest, yet painfully aware that her shrunken friends had undoubtedly seen her fall. As she rose up she momentarily revealed the squished Nora spread-eagled across her left ass cheek before obscuring the girl completely from sight as she finally managed to pull the jeans up and over her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Nora, who was still trying to process what exactly had happened, the momentary relief of being out from under Pyrrha\u2019s weight was replaced with pressure and pain as the coarse fabric of the jeans bore down upon her, pressing her deep into the soft mass of her teammate\u2019s ass flesh. For Jaune the experience was even worse. He had been pounded mercilessly when his partner had fallen and now the cheeks were squeezing him worse than ever, seemingly doing their outmost best to squash him into nothing. Then they began to grind him into dust as the redhead moved across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing around the room, Pyrrha noted Ruby standing near the foot of her own bed, catching the girl\u2019s eyes as she grabbed her sneakers. \u201cI\u2019m going to go get some help okay.\u201d Slipping her feet into the sneakers she gave them a good few stomps to make sure they were straight. \u201cYou guys stay here and see if you can find Jaune for me.\u201d Tying her laces she briefly ran her hands over her outfit, pausing with her hands on her hips as she saw Blake and Yang approaching from her left. \u201cI\u2019ll be back as soon as I can. I\u2019ll lock the door so you should be safe while I\u2019m gone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Pyrrha turned to leave the room, the remaining members of Team RWBY\u2026</span></div></div>",

Had they been more aware beforehand they would've stopped the tournament champion from leaving as fast as she did. But unfortunately that wasn't case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeam RWBY would continue their fruitless search for the microscopic blonde. They searched drawers, beds, the floor, umder the beds, and there was still no sign of team JNPR's leader. Maybe he was even smaller then they initially though? Or maybe he just wasn't in here. Either way he remained missing,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright everyone, let's regroup!\" ruby called out. It took a while but the rest of team RBY assembled, with noticeable absences. \"Where Ren and Nora?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake and Yang shrugged. Not that Ruby mentioned it, there was a distinct lack of energy in the room that would normally come from team JNPR's hyperactive hammer wielder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a quick scan, Ruby noticed something else. \"Where's Weiss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone began to grow nervous now, Team JNPR might've shrunk, but they were still big enough to noticed by people as people, Weiss on the other hand was small enough to be mistaken for a bug at a first glance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone scatter and search around!\" Ruby ordered. The rest of her team nodded. Speeding through the dorm with her semblance, Ruby began to call out. \"Weiss!? Ren!? Nora!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis process was repeated by Blake and Yang, only at a much slower pace. \"Ren!? Nora!? Weiss!? Is anybody in here!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weiss if you're in here just yell!?\" Yang shouted, No response. The blonde even lifted her foot just in case and was relieved to find no Weiss splatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually everyone regrouped in the center of the room. \"Any luck?\" Ruby asked, clearly worried for her partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None.\" Yang frowned. \"I don't think their even in the room anymore sis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then where did they all go?\" Ruby sulked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake who remained silent began to ponder. Where had their friends run off too, and how did they disappear without anyone's notice? Could it be that... They shrank again? Blake shuddered at the idea but quickly pushed it aside. If that were the case then she'd be a bug or a speck by now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" She hummed, tuning out Ruby and Yang's conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then thought about Pyrrha. Could the redhead have accidently crushed them and they were stuck to her like stickers right now? She did accidently step on Weiss earlier. It was plausible, though Pyrrha wasn't known for making the same mistake twice. The more Blake pondered this the more ridiculous it sounded. Pyrrha could be clumsy she wasn't that clumsy. So that still begged the question... Where did everybody go?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Training with the rest of team JNPR really did take it's toll at times. After giving his arms a good stretch and rubbing the sleep from his eyes, Ren finally got a good look at his surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he did his eyes bulged. Surely he must still be dreaming? The last time he checked he was in his dorm, not some soft green desert. Hold a moment?! Soft... Green... Desert! Upon closer inspection Ren realized that this abnormally soft surface was in fact his own bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is this possible?\" He wondered whilst trying to remain calm. He steadily rose to his feet before giving his arm a good pinch. He winced in slight discomfort before reality came crashing down. This was no dream! He's somehow shrunk. Looking down at himself he hazard to guess he was at least three inches tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorry filled him as he turned to look at his other teammates bunks. He couldn't see anyone in either Jaune or Pyrrha's beds. Could they have shrunk as well. He then turned his attention to his friend Nora's bed. Much to his relief and surprise, she appeared to be normal sized and snoring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well at least Nora's alright. But still I have to check on the others.\" Ren reasoned to himself. Once he knew everyone was okay they could all put their heads together and figure out what was going on. Hopefully everything would go smooth and their would be no unfortunate accidents. At this size anything could happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his thoughts cleared and his breathing steady... Ren leapt into action.</span></div></div>",

Once he reached the ground level he could only marvel at his dorm. At his three inch height everything was the equivalent of a castle or skyscraper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is amazing.\" Ren mused before getting his mind back on track. He couldn't afford to get distracted by this new change in perspective, even if his shoes were now like that of a bullhead. He needed to stay focused. He'd already made up his mind to check on his team leader first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune would probably need the most aid of everyone in the room. Though he would never admit that out loud. The blonde had the least ability on the team, though with Pyrrha's aid he was steadily improving. But given his base personality he was probably freaking out right now. Well, if he were awake that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, Ren regained himself and bean to sprint across the hardwood floor. Every once in a while though he had to maneuver around the occasion garbage that littered the floor. Things ranging from discarded syrup bottles from Nora's pancake binge, discarded boots, or much to his own shock... A bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's definitely not Nora's.\" Ren commented before continuing his trek. He would have to make a mental note to his team about their bad habits. Especially Pyrrha if that bra was anything to go by. Leaving your unmentionables out on the floor was unacceptable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen finally made it to Jaune's bed. The whole structure looked twice as big as Beacon Academy it this size. It would no doubt be a pain to climb, but it had to be done. Before Ren could make a move however, the voice of his still normal sized teammate filled his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned his head to the side to see Nora cradling her pillow while trying to bit the top. She must be having the pancake world dream again. It was the only time she tried to bite anything in her sleep. Her knew from personal experience. Aura or not, getting bit hurt. With a sigh, Ren started his climb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt must've taken him a while because once he reached the top he felt his muscles burn. It was as if he was back in the training room sparing with his teammates. Ren took a moment to catch his breath and continued he Journey through Jaune's bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he reached the center he began to call out for his leader. Jaune! Jaune! Are you up here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to call out again until a familiar voice greeted him over the horizon of green. \"Ren! Ren! Is that you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Are you okay!\" Ren answered, relieved to know his leader was okay. He ran over the horizon to meet up with his teammate and when he did he instantly stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen was not expecting this.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You\u2019d arrived at Beacon Academy, home to Vale\u2019s best and brightest hunters and huntresses in training. Now that you were here you could finally commence your grand plan to meet the legendary Ruby Rose, woo her with your carefully thought out confession, and score yourself a famous girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a year since the defeat of Salem and the pushing back of the Grimm to the edge of human civilisation, an effort in which Team RWBY had been instrumental. Though they had returned to Beacon as third year students, Weiss Schnee, Blake Belladonna and Yang Xiao Long were now household names across Remnant, and Ruby, who had dealt the final blow that finally slew the Grimm\u2019s Queen, was widely considered the most important hunter of the modern age despite still being just seventeen. To you she was beyond beautiful, and more importantly while rumours and half-truths abounded about the romantic entanglements of her teammates, the younger huntress had remained single, focused on her training and the protection of innocents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour family and friends had said you were crazy to think you\u2019d ever have a shot with someone like that, but Ruby presented as so down to earth that you were convinced it wasn\u2019t crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf nothing else you had confidence. Confidence that you could make this work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour original plan had been to gain entry to Beacon as a student, but unfortunately you\u2019d failed to make the necessary grade to obtain entry, so now you were going with plan B. Sneaking in and praying to Oum that you didn\u2019t get caught, or at least not before getting the chance to meet Ruby. Civilians were allowed to visit Beacon, but the areas they could access were limited, and you\u2019d already moved into parts of the grounds that were supposed to be off limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis meant keeping to the shadows and as low to the ground as possible, so when you heard raised voices as you slunk across one of the Academy\u2019s courtyards, you immediately hit the ground, slipping behind a bench as dust-fuelled blasts started exploding all around you. Apparently two of the older students were engaging in a duel, authorised or otherwise, and you now found yourself stuck in the middle as they hurled large quantities of dust all over the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad you just revealed yourself they certainly would have stopped, but you\u2019d also have been thrown out of Beacon immediately, so you kept your head down. And you paid the price when two particularly powerful blasts struck the bench, fire and lightning combining in a maelstrom of destruction that left a crater in its wake and set your nerves ablaze with pain. Though your Aura protected you from the worst of it, your vision still went black as you hit the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no idea how much time had passed by the time you regained consciousness, though the shift in the shadows suggested it had been several hours. You were still surrounded by the scenery of the courtyard, but somehow you hadn\u2019t been discovered or moved. It took you a few moments to realise why, but eventually the sheer size of your surroundings sunk in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, impossibly, the combination of the dust that had flooded your system had reduced your height to barely a couple of inches, well hidden among the rubble of the unfortunate bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearful for your safety, your first thought was to get help from the closest available person, but after a few seconds to consider you decided you\u2019d much rather seek help from Ruby and her team and headed off in the direction of the third-year dorms.</span></div></div>",

It was hard to cross that much ground in your reduced state but on the up side it was much easier to keep out of sight of the passing students and faculty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course even if you were able to avoid the giants while staying off the paths, approaching a doorway was an entirely different matter. No sooner had you crossed the threshold than a shadow fell upon you, instinct alone allowing you to leap to the right just as a massive boot crashed to the ground where you had been standing. Heart in your throat, your eyes trailed up and up, until finally coming to meet silver orbs that peered down at you with curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhysically speaking, the last two years had been good to Ruby. Though still smaller than her sister and Blake she\u2019d gained a few inches, and filled out slightly in the usual places. Her facial features had matured somewhat but maintained their youthful vigour and curiosity as she gazed down upon your tiny form. Shoulder-length hair shifted as she bent forward, and long slender fingers wrapped around your body before bringing you face-to-face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor several long moments you just stared at each other. For your part you were too in awe at being this close to your crush to find any words, while Ruby looked like she was just trying to process what exactly was going on. Eventually, it was the young huntress who broke the silence. \u201cSo\u2026 is this some kind of semblance or are you a mutant or something? You\u2019re okay aren\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever in your wildest dreams had you pictured yourself in a scenario like this. Cupped gently in the hands of your crush, at a size difference in which she could probably literally crush you. Gentle eyes looked down at you, while her body warmth flowed through you, and all you wanted to do was bare your heart and try to get a kiss from those luscious lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 I\u2026 I\u2019ve always.\u201d The plan had been to marvellously confess the moment you managed to come face-to-face with this girl, but now that you were actually here you couldn\u2019t find the words. Your jumbled response only made Ruby look more concerned, which wasn\u2019t exactly helping you feel any less enamoured. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m not sure how this happened. I was normal, and then I got hit by some dust and I\u2026 became this. By the way, big fan.\u201d You blushed at the lame finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bright smile and giggle you received in return made it all worth it. \u201cDon\u2019t you mean small fan? Aha, sorry, Yang joke.\u201d Glancing to the side quickly she stepped into the nearest alcove, giving you both some privacy. \u201cYou\u2019re really okay though?\u201d You nodded. \u201cOkay then, should I take you to the professors? Goodwitch may know how to help, or maybe Oobleck. Or, I guess if it has to do with dust Weiss may be able to help. Her family are kind of the experts in this stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you were at an impasse. Your first instinct was to go with Weiss, since she was Ruby\u2019s partner and time with the heiress would mean time with your crush as well. But then again, if you really wanted to get out of this mess the professors might be a better bet. Or maybe, just maybe, you could take this chance to\u2026 experience something else you\u2019d always wanted to experience.</span></div></div>",

In particular you\u2019d spent hours scouring news and publicity footage of Team RWBY for those rare glimpses of their bare or nylon-clad feet, with a particularly keen eye for any picture showing the usually hidden feet of Ruby herself. It would be nice to say that there wasn\u2019t a folder on your scroll just for those pictures, but that would be a lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOriginally, the plan had been to confess to Ruby, go on a few dates, and then maybe raise the possibility of tending to her feet. But your current situation just raised too many possibilities for you to ignore. If you couldn\u2019t bring yourself to confess, maybe you could go for something else instead. \u201cActually, before that, would it be possible to talk to you somewhere else\u2026 somewhere private.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby raised an eyebrow but didn\u2019t object, looking around quickly before basically teleporting to a nearby classroom and closing the door behind her. Her control over her semblance had improved remarkably over the years and you barely felt the acceleration as she moved. One moment you were cradled protectively in her hands and the next you were standing on a desk looking up at the towering brunette, struggling to find the right words to make your request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis may sound strange but I\u2026 I would really appreciate it if you could let me\u2026 let me touch your feet.\u201d Ruby frowned slightly and for a moment you were sure you had offended her, but the look in her eyes was more one of confusion than distress. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to if you\u2019d rather not, but if you let me try just once, I promise we can stop if you don\u2019t like it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few years ago Ruby may not have understood what you were getting at, but years of interactions with her more\u2026 active teammates had taught her a thing or two about the world. \u201cThis is a sexual thing isn\u2019t it? You\u2019ve got a thing for feet?\u201d Your sudden furious blush was all the answer she needed. \u201cI see. Well\u2026 if you really want. I\u2019ve got to warn you though my feet get pretty sweaty when I use my semblance.\u201d A quick flick of eyes down to her heavy boots. \u201cIt\u2019s like a sauna in there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point it was difficult to believe what you were hearing. You had thought there was no way you could be any more attracted to this girl, yet here she was actually agreeing to let you at her feet. \u201cSweaty is fine. I really appreciate just getting the chance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby just nodded in response, hoping up onto the desk and tugging off her boots. She quickly pulled off her leggings as well, bunching them up and throwing them into the boots before propping up her feet, sole-first, on the desk in front of you. She hadn\u2019t been lying about the sweat either, a light sheen across her soles speaking to the accumulated moisture. Surprisingly enough the smell was actually kind of nice, at least at this range, and sweatiness aside they appeared to be quite clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery instinct in your body was screaming at you to jump right in and take full advantage of the treasure that had been identified to you, while the rational part of your brain warned you not to take too much advantage of Ruby\u2019s kindness.

The fact that she was letting you touch her feet suggested she at least had some interest, but you\u2019d only asked about touching. If you suddenly started licking the soles or asking for something more she might get weirded out, or worse yet become angry. So you were going to start things slow with a nice gentle massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApproaching the towering girl\u2019s left foot you reached out to touch the skin of her sole, your heart beating a mile a minute as your hands slowly pressed against the sweaty flesh. The feeling of it was difficult to describe. Her feet were warm and moist, the sheen of sweat pooling between your fingers and flowing over the back of your hands, and her flesh was incredibly smooth. Quickly you began moving your hands around in a massaging motion, doing your best to be felt as you pressed against the slightly springy texture of her soles. At your current height you couldn\u2019t reach much higher than her heel, though you were able to run the very tips of your fingers along her arch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019d dreamed of doing this, full-sized or otherwise, more times than you could count. Yet actually doing this, really touching your crush\u2019s soles, was beyond anything you could have imagined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHigh above, Ruby bit her lip at the feeling of your little hands running across her foot. Whether as a by-product of her semblance or just by coincidence, she\u2019d always had quite sensitive feet, eternally irritated by even the smallest twigs or stones that found their way into her shoes. Her semblance certainly didn\u2019t help matters, since its use frequently led to her feet overheating and producing copious sweat, which combined with her sensitivity to leave her feeling unpleasantly warm and moist. Right now though, as her toes gently curled at the feeling of your tiny ministrations, she considered that maybe having sensitive soles wasn\u2019t so bad after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough you were unaware of Ruby\u2019s thoughts you were encouraged by the fact that she had yet to pull away or raise any obvious objection to your actions. From your position in front of her sole you couldn\u2019t see her face but the slight shift in her foot suggested she was enjoying the experience. By now your hands were covered in a thick layer of sweat, sliding more easily across her sole as you diligently tended to every inch of flesh within reach. Once you felt that her left sole had been sufficiently tended to you jogged over to the right, not wanting it to feel left out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf anything the right sole was even sweatier than the left, to the extent that your already slick hands had trouble finding purchase, but you pressed on regardless, determined to tend to both soles equally. To you, the warm flesh beneath your hands felt like heaven and it was a constant battle to keep your focus and not get too carried away. As much as you were enjoying this you wanted to make sure that Ruby enjoyed it as well, or else all of your plans would go out the window. In the end though, it seemed your concerns were unwarranted as a soft moan emanated from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm\u2026 you\u2019re actually pretty good at this you know.\u201d Sighing in appreciation, Ruby temporarily pulled back her right foot, allowing her to look at you directly for a moment and shoot you a gentle smile. \u201cBut you\u2019re so short your only getting half of it you know. How about this?\u201d Raising her foot into the air slightly she hovered it above you, so close that it sat just above your head and caste a deep shadow over your body. \u201cThink you can get the rest of it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy bubbled up inside you as your goddess made her pleasure known and presented to you a new prize to explore. From this position some of the sweat from her foot dripped down on you, allowing you a taste of the sweet, if somewhat salty, nectar as it made its way down your throat. Instantly your hands reached up to rub and squeeze at the ball of her foot and the upper part of her arch, eager to lavish attention on those parts of her sole you had so far neglected. Soon the shadows around you deepened as Ruby moved her left foot next to the right, completely obscuring you from view beneath the joined soles as you began to split your attention between both marvellous feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor several minutes you lost yourself in a world where there was only you and Ruby\u2019s feet. The manner in which they were arched above you amplified their warmth, subjecting you to sauna-like conditions as you continued your ministrations. After finishing with the soles you moved your hands further upwards towards the toes, rubbing your hands over each in turn, and taking particular care to ensure that that you gave attention to the crevices beneath and between them. The flesh of those tight confines was even warmer than the rest of Ruby\u2019s feet, and the accumulated sweat and toejam quickly began to coat your hands. Above, the giant brunette seemed to particularly appreciate the attention her toes were receiving, clenching them slightly around your hands and moaning softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll to soon however, it appeared that Ruby had received her full, as she casually retracted her feet and laid them flat on the desk, allowing her to once again gaze at you directly, quirking an eyebrow as she noted your sweat-drenched form. On the inside she had actually become quite flustered, and was just taking a moment to compose herself, but to you her expression was unreadable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to let the silence drag on as it had before, you quickly attempted to assuage your own fears. \u201cUmm\u2026 Miss Ruby, did you enjoy it? If you did than perhaps we\u2026 could do it again some time.\u201d You were sweating yourself now, both from the residual heat of those wonderful feet, and from the mounting trepidation that was crawling its way up your spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your relief, rather than become angry or distressed, Ruby just smiled gently, shifting her feet slightly in apparent nervousness that somehow managed to still be cute despite how much she towered above you. \u201cYes, I enjoyed it. And it doesn\u2019t have to be some time, we can do some more now if you want. I just\u2026 needed a moment.\u201d Her eyes shifted to the side evasively but the smile remained on her face. \u201cActually I was wondering if you wanted to\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cActually I was wondering if you wanted to see what my feet taste like.\u201d Though she managed to force out the words without stuttering, Ruby blushed crimson as soon as she finished, drawing up her knees to obscure her face, and peeking over her kneecaps to gauge your reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor your part you found yourself temporarily stupefied by the question, actually having to pinch yourself just to make sure you were still awake. All things considered you\u2019d wanted the chance to lick her sweaty soles from the start, and now they were being offered to you without question. \u201cYe\u2026 Yeah! Definitely! Uh, I mean, if that\u2019s really okay with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling in relief, Ruby extended her feet back over you, allowing the sweaty soles to hover just short of your face. \u201cOf course. I suggested it after all. Go ahead\u2026\u201d She paused for a moment, as if seriously considering her next words, before apparently deciding to go with it anyway. \u201cDig in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou needed no further encouragement than that, immediately reaching up to gently coax her right sole a little lower before extending your tongue and taking a first tentative lick. You\u2019d already gotten a taste of her sweat earlier when some of it had dripped onto your face, but the feeling of running your tongue along her sole was something altogether different. Even before you swallowed the first mouthful, just the feel of your tongue running over her warm flesh was already enough to drive you crazy. The salty texture set your taste buds buzzing and the feeling of the thick liquid running down your throat as you greedily gulped it down was one of the greatest things you had ever felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough you\u2019d dreamed of this before, you\u2019d never really paused to consider what Ruby\u2019s sweat would actually taste like, more interested in the action than the result. Surprisingly enough it was sweeter than you\u2019d expected. It was still salty but it seemed the young huntress did not have an abundance of impurities to flush out of her system, possibly due to the sheer volume of her sweat. Good news for you since you\u2019d already swallowed enough to make you sick otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough you\u2019d lovingly tended to both soles and switched your attention to the toes, running your tongue along and between them, and happily lapping up the sweat together with the toe jam. Admittedly the grime was harder to swallow than the sweat and sat heavily in your stomach but you couldn\u2019t bring yourself to care much. To you it still tasted better than anything you\u2019d ever eaten before, and you started to press soft kisses to your crush\u2019s toes in thanks for the meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby bit her lip again as she looked down at you through the gaps between her spread toes, savouring the feeling of your tongue and the little kisses as you dutifully pampered her feet. Despite the influence of the rest of her team this was the first time she\u2019d really turned her mind to whether or not she had a fetish for such things, or anything for that matter, but now that she was actually experiencing your ministrations she felt like she could really get used to this. The feeling of your hands had been bliss, but the feeling of your tongue was heaven itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey.\u201d Again a pause as Ruby waited for your attention. \u201cDo you think maybe you want to make this a more permanent arrangement? I\u2019ll keep you safe and in return you\u2026\u201d She wiggled her toes, briefly rubbing one of them against your face. \u201cYou tend to my feet. I could keep you in my boots when I\u2019m too busy to tend to you personally, and when I\u2019m free we could do more of this. You\u2019d be like my own personal foot pet.\u201d It wasn\u2019t that she wanted to enslave you or anything, but she suddenly found herself deeply interested in the idea of having you tend to her feet on a more long-term basis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019d lost count already of the number of times today this girl had surprised you, yet this was easily the most surprised you\u2019d been all day. Your first instinct was to immediately accept your idol\u2019s suggestion, and devote yourself mind body and soul to the care of her feet, but you managed to contain yourself long enough to consider your other options. When you\u2019d come to Beacon your goal had been to confess your love to Ruby, and even now you hadn\u2019t yet lost sight of that goal. Maybe it would be better if you confessed now, lest your relationship become one of physical contact only, but then again maybe it was too soon for that and it would be better to take up the offer for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter consideration, you decide that the best course of action is to\u2026</span></div></div>",

Sure, your ultimate goal was to confess to Ruby, but there was no need to rush into it. By agreeing to be her pet for now you would not only get the chance to get closer to her but you\u2019d be able to endear yourself to her enough that your chance of having your love accepted would go up significantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby blushed at her impromptu title, but smiled widely nonetheless. If someone had told her this morning that by the end of the day she\u2019d have a living breathing human as a tiny foot pet she\u2019d probably have taken them to a hospital for possible head trauma, yet here she was looking down at her own personal servant as he returned to diligently pampering her soles and toes. \u201cMmm\u2026 good. Serve me well and I\u2019ll make your life as comfortable as possible.\u201d The brunette giggled at her own attempt at a regal tone, trying to get into her new found role as your master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContent in your new arrangement and spurred on by your new owner\u2019s words, you continued to tend to Ruby\u2019s soles with your hands, tongue and lips as she sat back and enjoyed the sensations, the both of your drifting off into pleasurable thoughts as the minutes tick by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time, Ruby noted that she really needed to get back to her team before they became suspicious, shooting you a devious smirk as she carefully snatched you up and held you over the opening of her left boot. \u201cIt\u2019s time for you to go home for now. Make sure you head to the toe so you don\u2019t get crushed.\u201d Though she tried to maintain a persona of authority, she did pause long enough to receive your nod of approval before dropping you into the footwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small part of you was worried that falling the length of the boot would lead to serious injury but as you landed on the moist insole you found yourself slightly winded but otherwise unharmed. You took a moment just to breath in the strong scent of sweat that surrounded you, before a sudden shadow reminded you that time was a factor. Glancing up quickly to see the toes of Ruby\u2019s still bare foot descending into the boot, you quickly sprinted towards the toe-end, needing to tuck and role for the last few inches but successfully making your way to the very end of the boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere the smell was even stronger than at the heel, leaving you surrounded on all sides by a thick miasma of lingering sweat and Ruby\u2019s mild foot scent, not to mention the palpable heat that felt like a gentle sauna. You breathed in deep as the shadows around you grew darker and the grasping toes of your mistress filled your vision before falling upon you with gleeful enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling the boot all the way on, Ruby smiled softly at the feeling of your tiny body as she gently dragged it into the grasp of her toes, pulling it up and into the crevice between the digits and her sole. She giggled at the feeling of the sweat pooling up from her insole as her foot pressed down, wondering just how badly soaked her little friend was going to get. Though a part of her was concerned at the possibility of drowning, the slight tickle she had come to recognise as the feeling of a tiny tongue running over her flesh reassured her that her pet was doing just fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecuring the other boot, Ruby pushed herself off the desk and onto her feet. Though she took care to ensure that her full weight did not fall on the toes of her left foot she was still aware of the sole sinking slightly deeper into the insole. Momentarily concerned, she clenched her toes down slightly, relieved to feel her new toy wiggling in response and the gentle kisses being pressed to her sole, before taking her first tentative step and striding out of the room with increasing confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar below, you found yourself surrounding by warm flesh and overflowing sweat, trapped in a constant cycle of weightlessness and crushing force as the mighty toes above you rose and fell. It would be an exaggeration to say that the pressure was pleasant, but it was worth it for the chance to keep worshipping your crush\u2019s feet as she went about her day, and it didn\u2019t seem like you were at any risk of being killed. Though who knew how long it would be until you got out.</span></div></div>",

You\u2019d spent most of that day in the boot, playfully stroked by the huntress\u2019s toes as she went about her business, before being released later that night for another round of worship out of sight of the other members of Team RWBY.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the days that followed the two of you tested the limits of your newfound durability, quickly finding that you could take the full force of Ruby\u2019s foot without being crushed, allowing you to be freely shifted between her sole and toes as she walked around the academy. Your nutritional requirements also appeared to have been reduced significantly, able to get by just on the sweat and toejam you were able to salvage from the brunette\u2019s feet, supplemented by crumbs and such that Ruby would occasionally slip into her boots for you to enjoy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spent most nights squeezed between your goddess\u2019s toes, lathering them with attention until both of you fell asleep, though a couple of nights had been spent rolled up in a used nylon if Ruby had to stay up particularly late or was otherwise too tired to play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough for the most part you were willing to try anything, the two of you had agreed that it was best if you weren\u2019t in the boots for combat exercises and training. Even though you could take the pressure of many steps the amount of force that was exerted when Ruby ran with her semblance was enough to crack the ground itself, and there was no telling what that would do to you. On the other hand, you appreciated the affect her semblance had on her feet, and more than once had been given the honour of licking clean the intensely warm and sweaty soles that resulted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver time, the young huntress had become more and more actively involved in your worship sessions, moving from passively watching you pamper her soles to actively pressing you against them, squeezing you between her toes or rolling you between both sweaty soles like an oversized marble. Of course there were still plenty of occasions where she\u2019d leave you to your own devices but you found yourself really enjoying it when she became a more active participant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this manner two full weeks had passed and you now found yourself once again tending to Ruby\u2019s sweaty post-workout feet as she went over some last minute revisions for the next day\u2019s classes. To the casual observer it would seem like she was ignoring you entirely, but the occasional shift in her toes to touch your head told you otherwise. Every while and then her eyes would flick down to look at you, and her lips would quirk up slightly as she returned to her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you occupied yourself tending to her feet, inhaling the sweet scent as you pampered her precious soles with your hands and tongue. This was all second-nature to you by now, which gave your mind plenty of time to wander to more complex matters, such as where exactly you wanted your relationship with Ruby to go from here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you had certainly grown closer, so now might be your best opportunity to finally confess your true feelings and take a shot at being upgraded from foot pet to boyfriend. But on the other hand, you really had gotten used to your current role, and you couldn\u2019t help but wonder if becoming Ruby\u2019s boyfriend would actually be a demotion. If the two of you were dating then presumably you\u2019d be doing other things than just tending to her feet, like going on dates and such, and that would mean an overall decrease in the amount of time you could spend pampering her soles and toes. Was that really what you wanted right now?</span></div></div>",

You nearly faltered before those beautiful silver eyes but took a deep breath and forged onwards. \u201cCan we talk seriously for a moment? Without any role play.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby\u2019s eyebrow shot up and her lips quirked in confusion but she nodded slowly. \u201cOkay. Is something wrong?\u201d That was just like her. Even after everything that you\u2019d done and the amount of times she\u2019d happily rubbed you against her feet, she was still concerned for your safety. It was that kindness that had drawn you to her in the first place, and which now made your heart throb once again. You had to do this. There really was no other choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen I\u2026 the truth is I came to this academy just to meet you. I tried to get in as a student and when I was rejected I snuck in instead, which ended up leading to my current state. I knew it was stupid, and I knew how much trouble I could get in, but I didn\u2019t care. I just wanted to meet you.\u201d You could see Ruby opening her mouth to respond but hurriedly cut her off, wanting to make your position clear. \u201cI know I already said I was a fan but\u2026 it\u2019s not just that. I\u2019m not just a fan. I\u2019ve idolised you since the first time I saw you on the news. You were so strong, and so kind, even though you were just a kid like me. Everyone said I was stupid, that nothing would ever come of it, but I\u2026 I had the hugest crush on you. It was all I could ever think about. That\u2019s why I needed to meet you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed and looked down, not trusting yourself to meet her eyes right now. \u201cI\u2019ll admit when I first came here I was just being foolish. I was just one of those guys who crushed on their idol from afar, without really knowing anything about you.\u201d Mustering your courage you looked up, noting Ruby\u2019s widened eyes and shocked expression. \u201cBut that\u2019s not the case anymore. I know you now. Even if it\u2019s just as your foot pet we\u2019ve been together almost every minute of the last two weeks. And in that time my\u2026 my feelings have only grown stronger. It\u2019s not just a crush anymore I\u2026 I think I really like you.\u201d You paused to take a breath, once again diverting your gaze as the massive brunette continued to stare down at you. \u201cI\u2019ve really enjoyed being your foot pet, and it\u2019s not like I want that to stop but\u2026 I would really appreciate it if you\u2019d give me the chance to date you as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silence that dragged on from that point was suffocating, long seconds ticking by as you waited for the rejection you were increasingly sure was going to come. You realised too late that this had been a mistake. Obviously this girl who had reduced you to the status of a pet would have no interest in actually dating such a tiny pathetic thing as you. How stupid could you get?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you suffered in silence, high above Ruby was having her own internal crisis. She\u2019d never expected this, though in hindsight she realised that the signs had all been there. This little guy had said from the start that he was a fan and he\u2019d happily accepted tending to her feet, so it really wasn\u2019t much of a stretch at all that he\u2019d have that kind of interest. And it wasn\u2019t like it was something she didn\u2019t have experience with. More than one guy had confessed to her over the last few years and her response had always been a polite thanks, but no thanks. It just wasn\u2019t something she\u2019d been personally interested in and, honestly, if this one had succeeded in his initial plan to meet with her and confess at full size then he would have received the same response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this was different. It would no longer be accurate to describe her little friend as a stranger. His physical intimacy with her feet aside, they\u2019d spoken for hours. They\u2019d become close. And Ruby would be lying if she said she didn\u2019t hold significant affection for her tiny companion. She wasn\u2019t sure if this affection was the same as that which had been directed towards her, but as she watched the clearly dejected boy turn to retreat further across the bed, she knew that she had to act. \u201cWait! I wouldn\u2019t mind. Let\u2019s do it, you know, let\u2019s, err\u2026 let\u2019s go out.\u201d She blushed at her jumbled sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked, you felt your heart jackhammering in your chest as you spun to confirm what you had heard, blushing yourself at the incredibly embarrassed look you were met with. \u201cReally! I\u2026 good, I really, thanks, err\u2026 I mean, please be good to me.\u201d Wait, that wasn\u2019t right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a long moment the two of you held each other\u2019s gazes, blushing furiously, then Ruby giggled, her tight lips cracking into a smile as her shoulder\u2019s hunched over. That was all it took to crack your composure as well and soon the two of you were laughing uncontrollably over your shared awkwardness. Your heart, which had been beating out of control, now felt light as you looked up at your frien\u2026 no, your girlfriend\u2019s mirthful expression. \u201cWhat now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiping briefly at her eyes as she finally managed to stifle her giggles, Ruby\u2019s smile only widened as she considered the possibilities that now lay before you both. \u201cHow about\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

They were all attractive in their own rights, and if the opportunity arose you\u2019d be happy to tend to any of them, provided of course your girlfriend was comfortable with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, because they should be back pretty soon.\u201d Truth be told, Ruby had been a few moments away from dumping you back in your boot when you\u2019d decided to make your confession, precisely because she was aware that her sister and friends would soon be returning. The three of them had headed into Vale earlier that morning for something or other, and though they\u2019d invited their leader she\u2019d politely declined with the excuse of needing to study.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow though it was as if her words had summoned them forth and a soft click heralded the electronic lock on the door being released, the door swinging open to admit the room\u2019s other occupants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang entered first, holding the door for her two companions as they stepped inside. The last two years hadn\u2019t changed the blonde as much as her sister. She\u2019d gained a couple of inches and her muscles were somewhat more prominent then they had been previously but she was otherwise unchanged, her hair and chest as voluminous as ever and her smile still bright. Their day on the town had seen her don a simple checked flannel shirt, strategically undone just enough to show a tantalising amount of cleavage and complimented by a pair of loose jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake followed her partner into the room and stood by her side as she waited for Weiss to enter. She hadn\u2019t gained much height either, now just narrowly edging out Ruby as the second tallest member of the team, though like Yang she\u2019d gained some more definition to her physique. Although her curves had remained static she still maintained the best butt on the team, crammed into some tight black slacks topped off with a properly buttoned shirt. The most significant change was that her ears were now uncovered, sitting up proudly from her long black hair as her perpetually calm gaze challenged anyone to take a shot at her heritage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last to enter the room was Weiss, her slender form slipping through the gap left for her by her teammates. Much to her own chagrin, the heiress hadn\u2019t gained any height since she started at Beacon, and though she continued to wear heels to address this, she was now clearly the shortest member of the team, her head only coming to around the same height as Yang and Blake\u2019s chests. Her physique had remained as slender as ever, shown off with a simple white dress and blue vest. At present she was wearing her hair down, allowing he long locks to run over her delicate shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou observed all of this from your perch on the edge of Ruby\u2019s bed, aware of the deep shadow being cast over you as your newfound girlfriend leant forward to look down at her team. Though each of the girls glanced up as they entered, not even Blake paid enough attention to notice your miniscule form peering down at them as the three casually gathered at the centre of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the first thing Weiss noticed was that her leader did not have her face buried in a book. \u201cYou better have been studying properly while we were out Ruby. If we don\u2019t all pass the next test it will disrupt our mission schedule.\u201d Hands on hips she looked at her partner with a stern expression, while Blake and Yang lost interest and started drifting back towards their own bunks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsed to this by now, Ruby let the comment roll off her, responding with a simple wave of her hand as a broad smile crossed her face. \u201cNever mind that. I\u2019ve got something to show you guys.\u201d Maintaining eye contact with her partner she reached down and snatched you up, catching the rest of her team\u2019s attention as she hopped off the bed and displayed you proudly in her cupped hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLess than a second later you were looking up at three pairs of curious eyes as the older girls leaned in to see what Ruby had to show. Silence raining for a few moments before\u2026</span></div></div>",

They had a fresh coat of yellow nail polish and smelled of lavender. She tilted her feet so that they faced upwards, revealing her somewhat sweaty soles. You couldn't believe it, they were slightly bigger, and less sweaty, but just as good as Ruby's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Yang was getting prepared to be pampered the youngest of the 4 switched on their game console, handing Blake and Weiss a controller each, and put in Lane Combatant, a side view fighting game. \"How about this, the winner gets him next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prepare to lose Schnee.\" Blake confidently said, whilst selecting her favorite character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is on Belladonna.\" The former heiress retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang wiggled her toes, catching your attention. \"Well buddy, gonna begin?\" Yang teased, while poking you in the chest with her big toe, you quickly went to the nearest foot and started rubbing, causing Yang to moan with pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ROUND TWO. FIGHT\" blasted from the TV, Weiss had won the first round. \"Prepare to eat your words, Blake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prepare to face defeat, Weiss!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang's face suddenly lit up, as if she got an idea. \"Yeah Weiss, prepare to face... de-feet!\" She snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others sighed. Leaving you and Yang being the only ones to actually find it funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are the worst!\" Ruby shouted at her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meh. What about you, little guy, like my puns?\" Yang asked you as she moved her foot forward and on top of you, flattening you out just a little as she squished you into the mattress.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Yang, he may immune to being squished but you still shouldn't do that.\" her sister said, annoyed. Weiss curiously perked up at this, causing her to become distracted allowing Blake to get in a lot of hits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Yang responded, unaware how far she'd gone. \"Oh! Whoops! Sorry, little guy!\" She immediately moved her foot off of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ROUND THREE. FIGHT\" You heard as the large foot moved off your small body. Blake and Weiss were both one round away from a victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, little guy, wanna start licking? Show me what you got!\" Yang excitedly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh. Yeah, sure!\" You nervously responded, unsure whether or not she could even hear you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alrighty then, start with this one then!\" she said moving her right foot forward, Curling the toes of her left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Ruby's was salty tasting from the amount of sweat she had on her feet, Yang's tasted so much more delightful, just like strawberries, probably from the same lotion making them smell so well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhilst worshiping the massive feet before you, you failed to notice from behind you one of the other girls had won.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That night, she managed to stay awake while all the members of her team RWBY and team JNPR slept. Quitely pulling herself from her bed, Weiss pulled out the wrapped package that would bring her so much fun.<br>\r\nShe pulled out a knife and sliced the corners off with no crunckling paper noises. Opening the box withing the wrap, she found a sealed bag as big as her head, filled to the brim with a grey-green dust powder. There was also a package of deep, deep blue dust, but that's for a different story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe I'm going to do this,\" Weiss whispered, \"I can't believe it. I'm finally going to fufill my fantasy.\" She had butterflies in her stomach following the stream of thoughts flooding her head.<br>\r\nWeiss brought her right hand down to her nether regions while her left hand pushed into the green bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping herself from going any further, with sweat on her brow despite the cool night, she tried to regain composure. \"Focus, Weiss. Focus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFilling a bowl with dust, she tried to remember the procedure for shrinking people. \"Step one, safety first. Don't let the dust touch you, don't breath it in. Step two, gather only enough that's needed for your optimized shrunken height. It has to be precise, as the dust is fickle.\" She pulled out a half-teaspoon, remembering that was roughly what she needed for her ideal height. \"Step three, gently blow dust into targets face. Wait one or so minutes for effects to take place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScooping out dust like it was sugar, she climbed the side of her bed to meet Ruby's sleeping face. She took in a small breath, readying herself to do it. But she hesitated.<br>\r\n\"I can't do this. These are my friends, not toys or playthings. They're not sex dolls.\" She pulled back before the heat between her legs told her otherwise. \"But... It is just a little fun, a great time to fufill my fantasies. Plus, it's not like I can't grow them back. I wonder how I do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before she could balance her moral options, she unexpectedly sneezed, blasting the dust into Ruby's face.<br>\r\nWith utter shock staining her face, her arousal was staining her panties. Leaning over in worry and expectation, Weiss watched as her partner's body began vibrating, glowing very faintly.<br>\r\nSlowly, Weiss noticed her partners clothes, once tight around her body, were drooping around Ruby's young body. Eventually, the shrinking girl's chin nudged the collar of the t-shirt she was wearing, which soon seemingly swallowed the rest of her head. Her feet at this time were enveloped by her leggings, only showing her little toes poking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss could hardly believe it. The young girl who, even at her short stature still stood above her, could now probably only reach the heiress's pelvic area. But as much as Weis loved this, she loved it even more when Ruby was fully enveloped in her clothes, leaving only a slight bulge at the top of her leggings as proof she was still there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss shifted through the clothes, grabbing the shrunken, and still wide asleep Ruby. Weiss fought with all her strength not to drop her in her boot at that very moment. But she still had work to do. She left Ruby at the foot of her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling out another teaspoon of dust, she blew without hesitation into the sleeping faces of Blake and Yang, and waited before the shrinking began.<br>\r\nReaching into the piles of clothes, Weiss grabbed a naked Blake in her left hand and a nude Yang in the other.<br>\r\nWeiss had to squeeze her thighs together looking at the impressive curves each girl had. Never having much of her own, Weiss always envied girls like Yang, with breasts large enough to suffocate.<br>\r\nRunning her thumbs over the soft bust of her two sleeping captives, middle fingers caressing their bottoms, Weiss resisted with all her strength not to play with them right then and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding what to do next, Weiss decides to...</span></div></div>",

Plus she loved the idea of them all waking up on their own like tinies do in all of her fetish stories. If she woke them up now, it would ruin the surprise. Setting the buxom blonde and wide-hipped kitty dolls to their respective beds, Weiss quietly slipped under her covers, pulling up a story to pleasure herself before sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby woke up with an itch in her nose, as if she just snorted up house dust. It was also very dark, which was weird because Ruby usually woke-up late.<br>\r\n\"Ugh, must be too early. Back to sleep!\"<br>\r\nBut right as she was about to enter back into dreamland, Ruby heard Weiss humming. Never one to miss a chance to see Weiss waking up, Ruby rolled over to the edge of her bed and... where was the edge?<br>\r\nRuby patted the bed looking for an edge but found none, no matter how far she reached her hand out. She git up on all fours and started crawling to where the edge <i>should</i> be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeisses humming was getting louder, and Ruby was getting more desperate. She crawled faster and faster, quicker and quicker, before she smushed her face into a light fabric. Confused, she noticed the fabric also laid below and above her, covering nearly all sides.<br>\r\n\"Ruby? Oh Ruby!\" Sang a... louder than usual voice.<br>\r\n\"Weiss is calling for me?!\" Ruby started getting flustered. \"Oh, but how do I get to her?\"<br>\r\nIt was only when Ruby looked to her left that she noticed a slight line of light emerging not to far away. She went for it, crawling as fast as she could in her just-woken-up state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she gets near the edge, Ruby can hear Weiss calling for her again. Pushing the ceiling fabric over her head, Ruby climbed out, the morning light blinding her eyes. Her eyes adjusting, she glanced over at Weiss and smiled, quickly looking back as something was just not right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTowering above her was the gigantic face of Weiss Schnee. Ruby fell back in shock, looking all around to see what else was different. The ceilings were taller, her pillows were farther, and it looked like the fabric she just climbed out were her pajama leggings. It was only noticing that last one that she realized she was naked, and covered herself with her hands in front of Weisses all-seeing eyes.<br>\r\n\"W-What happened?\" Ruby was chocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss looked down at the panicking Ruby, her freshly changed panties becoming quickly less fresh. Below Ruby's bed Weiss traced her nipple with her finger, getting ready for the show.<br>\r\nBut does Weiss reveal her true intentions, or does she play dumb to the whole thing?</div></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Team RWBY was getting ready for bed, Ruby and Yang getting changed into their pajamas, Blake happily reading on her bed, and Weiss calmly doing some late night studying in the corner. While the other 3 were too busy to notice, Weiss heard a knock at their door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOdd,\u201d she began to speak to herself. \u201cit\u2019s almost 9 pm who could that be?\u201d Weiss then got up and walked straight to the door, only to be greeted by no one on the other side, nothing more than a box with the Schnee Dust Company logo, no doubt the experimental shrinking dust she ordered. Filled with excitement she dragged the box in and slid it under her bed, which caught Yang\u2019s attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWatch\u2019a got there ice queen?\u201d The blonde asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it Yang, just some new type of dust,\u201d Weiss responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, Ooh! Can I try it out this time? The last time you brought a new dust type here it was so much fun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it could be highly dangerous, or even lethal, do not touch it, Yang!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing in defeat, Yang pretended to drop the subject, in reality, she started to plan when she would steal it behind Weiss\u2019 back the next day, much to the amusement of the blonde\u2019s sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Weiss and Blake out studying, Ruby and Yang stayed in the dorm, not having to go to any classes it being spring break. Dragging the box from underneath Weiss\u2019 bunk, they opened it to grab the dust crystal\u2019s inside. The dust itself was an aqua color, each crystal individually cased in clear plastic, with warnings saying things from \u2018Do not touch\u2019 to \u2018do not let touch skin\u2019 which of course both sisters ignored. Removing one of the dozen crystals from its casing, Ruby held it in her hand, waiting to see its effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, feel anything?\u201d Yang asked excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really, I don't think it really does anything from simply holding it, maybe we should test it by-\u201d Ruby responded, however before she could finish her sentence, suddenly disappeared. Yang was dumbstruck, just a second ago her sister was here talking to her, and just like that she was gone, nowhere to be seen, Yang tried calling her name but got no response or one that she could hear anyway. Confused, she made her way to the exit, to get Weiss\u2019 help, fearing her little sister's safety, however, she trod barefoot straight onto the dust crystal Ruby was just holding, Yang also suffering the same fate as Ruby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe we should test it by firing it?\u201d Ruby asked, and just as she finished suddenly felt really off, with a pounding headache and upset stomach, she clutched her eyes shut grabbing her head from the pain. \u201cAaah! Dust that hurt, I guess it\u2019s used to disorientate Grimm or something.\u201d Ruby informed her big sister, however when she got no response from Yang she opened her eyes, seeing 2 massive walls of flesh, that resembled that of a pair of feet, only 20x larger, Looking further up at who the feet belonged to, Ruby saw her own big sister, emphasis on big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting to panic, Ruby immediately started yelling up at her sister for help, who unfortunately for her, didn\u2019t seem to hear her. Instead of looking down at Ruby as the redhead hoped, Yang instead started to panic herself, calling out her name over and over. The massive blonde started to stand up, placing her gigantic feet on the ground before her, almost stepping on Ruby, which would almost certainly lead to her demise, barely being the same size as Yang\u2019s heel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYang no wait!\u201d Ruby tried calling out to her sister as she began to leave before she could reach the exit, however, Ruby saw her older sister go from giant to nothing, looking down Ruby saw her again in the distance, now almost the same height as Ruby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time both Ruby and Yang had calmed themselves down, and their nausea from the sudden transformation had gone away, the sisters had to plan what they were going to do to get help, Yang sat on blake\u2019s bed, while Ruby waited on Weiss\u2019 studying desk, awaiting their teammates to return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take long for Blake to walk in the door, who simply walked straight to her bed, reading silently to herself as she walked, slipping off her shoes and stockings, she sat down on her bed calmly, way to intrigued in her book to notice that A) Yang and Ruby weren\u2019t home and B) She had just sat on the former of the two<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang assumed that Blake spotted her the second the cat girl went to her bed, picking up her tiny voice with her excellent Faunus hearing, Unfortunately that simply wasn\u2019t what happened, instead Yang looked up in horror as Blake turned around, and as the faunas\u2019 rear started to plummet towards her \"WAI-\", Yang screamed, unheard by her teammate, who continued to grind her ass onto the spot to get comfortable, which Yang would also have to do, seeing as Blake was nearly at chapter 4 of 40 in her book, and would probably be reading it for the rest of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach bounce and twist and grind caused Yang excruciating pain, which luckily upped her semblance, hoping not to harm blake, she realized that her only options were to either endure this torture for much longer or to strike blake\u2019s ass cheek with her semblance. With a mighty scream and her hair glowing, Yang punched as hard as she could, catching Blakes attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhilst reading Blake had felt a disturbance underneath her rear, she then ground her ass onto the bed over and over, applying pressure to whatever disturbed her, however, it only got more annoying, deciding to ignore it as she was too invested in her novel, Blake continued reading. However, when the slight disturbance suddenly changed into a painful pinching sensation, Blake immediately stood up to see what was causing her such annoyance. Going immediately from an expression of anger and annoyance to one of shock and remorse, as she realized the thing she was torturing under her own ass was in fact, her teammate, Yang Xiao Long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlakes entire worldview was shattered as she saw Yang in pain, groaning and getting herself up, Blake began to tear up, knowing she had caused her own best friend so much injury, all the while to herself she was doing no more than dealing with an annoyance, Blake had to have had her underneath her rear for half an hour at this point, the thought of knowing if she had just done something more about it so much earlier no doubt would yang\u2019s pain be way less severe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlake?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Y-Yang?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake started to hyperventilate, her mind racing with guilt, starting to doubt whether or not this actually was Yang, or a figment of her imagination, until the tiny girl said her name again \u201cBlake?\u201d defiantly Yang\u2019s voice, it sounded too real to be a hallucination, she had really hurt her best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite Yang\u2019s small injuries, she could tell Blake was panicking, and immediately attempted to calm her down, saying things such as \u201cBreath, its gonna be okay!\u201d trying her best to calm down the giantess. Managing to do so after a few minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-Okay,\u201d Blake began, still slightly shaken up. \u201cDespite the fact you\u2019re utterly adorable at this size, we should figure out how to return you back to normal, how did this happen?\u201d and so Yang told her the whole story, although when it got to the part Ruby was also shrunken, Blake immediately checked Weiss\u2019 desk, not finding anything that even resembled a tiny version of her own leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby decided that Weiss would be at the library until midnight most likely, as was the norm for her to do on a Saturday, looking up at the clock that read 7 pm, Ruby chose that it would be better to go to Weiss now, rather than sit and wait for hours on end with nothing to do, sliding underneath her dorm\u2019s door, she made her way down the hall and the stairs, using her semblance to reach the library in almost 20 minutes time, for someone normal that would be an absurdly amount of time, however with ruby\u2019s size, it was a great accomplishment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, we can find and worry about your sister later, what we should do is find a cure for that dust first, there's no use finding Ruby with no way to fix her yet.\u201d Blake convinced her tiny partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, I guess you\u2019re right,\u201d Yang grumbled, still worrying for her sister despite Blake\u2019s reasoning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake grabbed her scroll, laying down on her stomach with her feet crossed in the air, and with Yang right by her chin as they looked at the scroll together, trying to research this type of dust and to see if there was any kind of resolution for their crisis. Blake had a weird habit of whenever she would focus really hard on reading, her tongue would slightly pop out and lick at the air from time to time, which unfortunately for yang, meant that if Blake got too intrigued, soon that tongue would come out and cover her in saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, basically it says here that- aah!\u201d Yang began to explain, before feeling cold and wet on her back from Blakes massive tongue. Letting out a small squeal before retaliating by yelling at the massive girl before her \u201cHey! What\u2019s the big idea blakey? I had no idea you were gonna be this playful.\u201d Yang continued, her angry retaliation almost immediately changing into playful flirting, Blake, however, didn\u2019t respond, her pupil\u2019s slightly dilating, looking more feline-like, unbeknownst to Yang, her somewhat playful lick had triggered her primal senses.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Dropping down, Yang full on sprinted towards the exit, knowing that if blake caught her, she\u2019d be done for, turning around seeing Blake crawl towards the end of the bed, and in a flash leap off the bed, snapping her jaw mid-air right before Yang, barely missing as she landed in front of the door, blocking Yang\u2019s escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang turned around, running back towards the center of the room, before hearing Blake pounce again, only this time, a massive hand had gotten Yang in its clutches, and drew her closer to Blake\u2019s maw. Yang began to kick aggressively trying desperately to fight Blake\u2019s grasp, she screamed and screamed for blake to stop, however, the giant Faunus simply dropped Yang into her mouth and began to throw her around from one side to the other, enjoying her taste. Yang tried desperately to fight being eaten, however, Blake\u2019s tongue was the better fighter, slamming Yang onto the roof of her mouth, then slowly bringing her to the back of her throat, ready to swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to both girls, however, Blake was currently stood with her left foot right on one of the discarded shrinking dust crystals, in a flash Yang went from in the giant girl\u2019s maw, to mid-air falling towards the ground. landing with a soft impact on the carpet of their room, Looking forward she saw a tiny black and white clad girl in the distance, thankful of what had happened, knowing if Blake hadn\u2019t shrunk when she did, Yang would\u2019ve been digested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang rushed over to help Blake up, trying to soothe her nausea, as it seemed the sudden pain from her headache had knocked blake back into her senses.

These thoughts plagued her mind so much so she had to run to the library\u2019s bathroom to \u201cplay\u201d a little bit just to get the spot between her legs from becoming more of a distraction, as it was already, from her studying. On her way back to her spot, however, Weiss failed to notice the already tiny Ruby Rose in her path, as she raised her heel, the shadow of her footwear covering Ruby\u2019s whole body, as it plummeted to the ground and onto the tiny huntress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up in the nick of time, Ruby leaped out of the way of the giant heel, landing on her side Ruby looked up to see who had almost crushed her flat. \u201cHuh? Weiss!\u201d Ruby squealed, Happy she had finally found her teammate. Ruby made a leap for the heiress\u2019 other shoe, right before it took off, securing herself on top of Weiss\u2019 toes, she could feel them move up and down from inside the shoe with each step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to her seat, Weiss crossed her legs, suspending her left foot and Ruby, in the air. Ruby, well aware she couldn\u2019t just sit there and wait for Weiss to check out her own foot, decided to try and climb her leg, and get her attention face-to-face. It was pretty difficult to get a foothold on the side of Weiss\u2019 heeled boot, but Ruby made it manage quite well, for the most part, the much harder thing to do would be to climb the heiress\u2019 skin. Upon reaching the top of the thigh high boot, Ruby tried her best to climb the actual skin of Weiss\u2019 legs, slipping and almost losing her grip while letting out a short yelp, she looked down to the seemingly bottomless hole that was the entrance to Weiss\u2019 shoe. Ruby knew falling down there meant the likely-hood of not getting out, the thought of being trapped beneath the foot of her own best friend scared her greatly. Shaking her head Ruby tried not to think about it, and continued her climb of Weiss\u2019 leg.</span></div></div>",

Bracing herself, Ruby hung onto the leg as hard as she could, not wanting to fall off whatsoever, unfortunately for Ruby, Weiss didn\u2019t have time to play with this bug, and just wanted to squish it and be done with it, The impact of the heiress\u2019 handmade Ruby begin to slip, trying desperately to claw onto anything to stop her from falling, however, there was simply nothing to hold onto, screaming, Ruby plummeted into the dark abyss of Weiss\u2019 shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTumbling down into the toe section, Ruby slipped right under Weiss\u2019 toes, becoming pinned by them as they clenched together. Raising her foot up, Weiss made Ruby fall beneath her sole, as she then brought her foot down to the ground, causing Ruby much pain, who flattened out from the pressure. Not only was Ruby scared of the fact her best friend was seemingly unaware of her existence, or the fact she was now in Weiss\u2019 shoe, ready to be crushed and killed, but Ruby was also scared of how she suddenly flattened out slightly under the pressure of being under the heiress\u2019 sole. Ruby thought she was safe for the moment, until the pressure went away, the feeling of weightlessness for a few moments, then the sudden pressure that flattened like a piece of gum under her best friends foot. Then suddenly, the feeling of weightlessness again, then the pressure again. Weiss had gotten up and begun walking, crushing Ruby one step after the other, over and over.<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough her mind still had lingering thoughts of her teeny teammates, Weiss\u2019 studying pace picked up, until her hormones started also picking up their pace too, when she felt a bug crawling on her leg, it had been a while since she had played the giant role while toying with a bug. However, she was in public, and her studying was much more important, deciding to simply slap it off her leg, or squish it instantaneously, unaware the \u201cbug\u201d causing her some minor annoyance was actually in-fact, her best friend and team leader, Ruby Rose. Trying to resume her studying, Weiss went back to it. Immediately stopping once more as she felt the same bug enter her shoe, and onto her toes. Weiss just couldn\u2019t take it anymore. Throwing the bug beneath her toes with a quick flick of her foot, Weiss began to pack up to return to her dorm, to finally masturbate from all of her sexual thoughts of her tiny team. Imagining the bug as her team leader, a huge coincidence, since it in-fact, actually was her team leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening up the door to her dorm room, Weiss assumed at least one of them would still be here, and that she\u2019d have to express herself in the bathroom, luckily for her however, it seemed no one was home, so Weiss, ignoring the fact her shrinking dust was thrown about the room, then jumped onto her bed, to begin flicking her bean, as she scrunched and un-scrunched her toes over and over, playing with the bug, imagining in her head Ruby\u2019s pleas as she was being crushed over and over. \u201cWeiss! Please! Stop! You\u2019re crushing me!\u201d among other things, as the heiress quickened the movement of her hand, before\u2026</span></div></div>",

I think she noticed us!\u201d Yang said tapping her partner, as Weiss stopped her masturbation and reached over for the two with her other hand, picking both of them up as she sat up in their bed, bringing them in for a closer look, the black and yellow duo were very happy to have been found.

Rolling her head over to the left Weiss saw two little bugs on her nightstand, getting a naughty idea, Weiss reached over for them with her free hand, deciding to throw them into the action of her current session. bringing them up to her face to inspect them, Weiss couldn\u2019t tell what species they were, they almost looked human even, Weiss didn\u2019t care enough to think more on the topic as she then brought the hand holding the two bugs in her palm down back towards her vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Yang and Blake were very much confused at this sudden action. They both thought they had been recognized, so why was Weiss going to just put them back down? They tried to figure out what was happening before Yang turned around, looking at where Weiss\u2019 hand was headed, clicking in her mind what was about to happen to them both. \u201cB-Blake\u2026\u201d she muttered out turning her partner around so they could both see Weiss lifting her panties for her hand to enter, both tiny girls screaming as they entered the fabric layer, trying to hold on to each other as they fell into the giant girl's vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith both bugs running about, giving her much pleasure, Weiss continued to insert her hand to help them stimulate her, continuing her toe scrunching and imagining the two bugs as Ruby and Blake, not too far off the truth. </span></div></div>",

The three bugs doing their work stimulated Weiss greatly, as she caught the two out of her vagina as they were carried by the stream of cum into her hand. Kicking off her shoes using her feet, she clenched down on the third bug with her toes and brought her foot towards her, dropping the third bug next to the other two. Weiss thought of what she'd do to them, perhaps she could dispose of them, eating them alive could work wonders, after all when she soon would shrink her teammates, she wouldn't be able to just kill them, so killing these bugs would be a great way to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blake! Are you okay?\" Yang asked worried, clutching her partner in a deep hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, we just need to get Weiss to realise that we're not just some bugs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what is she doing with her shoes! Oh crap, what if she tosses us in her shoes!\" Yang panicked, her panic increasing as Weiss' barefoot came towards her, only to drop off the blonde's sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh! Hey gu- Ew what are you two covered with?\" Ruby asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Blake began, wiping off Weiss' cum from her arms, \"Exactly what you'd think...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three began to yell and beg at Weiss, pleading for her to notice they were humans and her friends. all the while Weiss didn't pay that much attention to them, simply thinking of many ways for her to dispose of them, thinking of how she'd squish them flat or consume them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... What to do, with you?\" Weiss softly whispered, staring down at the three tiny girls in the palm of her hand. For the first time, Weiss properly looked at them up close, studying the characteristics of each bug, the Blake and white one, the yellow one, and the black and red one... Weiss' eyes started to widen as she put two and two together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... N-No it can't be... Oh, my dust... G-Guys? Ruby? Blake? Yang? Is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Weiss, it's us!\" All 3 girls began to chant together. Weiss suddenly realised that all the things she did today were to humans, other people. She blushed hard as she was suddenly flustered over the fact she had successfully made her fantasy, a reality. Her best friends were in the palm of her hand, she could do to them whatever she pleased. But for now, Weiss decided to be a nice giantess...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-Uh... Quick, let me wash you two off. Oh my dust, I'm so so sorry!\" Weiss hurriedly apologised, trying to hide her embarrassment, as she sat Ruby down next to the sink, and tossed Yang and Blake inside it as she put in a plug, and started the tap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ice queen, if you wanted to hook up you only needed to ask~\" Yang teased, enjoying that Weiss somehow got even more flustered from her comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Yang, see this is the exact thing I said would happen to you if you touched my dust!\" Weiss suddenly outbursted, as the three hopped back into Weiss' hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax ice queen, I'm sorry... Wait, how did you know it was your dust that shrunk us?\" Yang asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-Uh...\" Weiss blanked on a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Blake added. \"Is there something you mean to tell us, Weiss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Okay, I may have ordered shrinking dust, so what? It's just dust! You still had no right to go through my stuff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But then, why did you try and hide what it was, and pretend you didn't know?\" Yang asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what would you have used it for anyway?\" Ruby questioned. Weiss' blush increasing was all the answer they needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... You planned to shrink us?\" Yang asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-But, why?\" Ruby also asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... No one outside of my mansion knows this but... I'm really into giantess stuff... Being a giant surrounded by puny tiny people, that I've either shrunk them or grown myself. Squishing them! Playing with them! Forcing them to worship me! Hell, even eating them!\" Weiss suddenly ranted, explaining her fetish far too much... \"Heh... eating them... Hehe... Hehehe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-W-Weiss?\" Blake stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, just calm down Weiss.\" Yang tried to help the situation, not wanting to be eaten alive any time soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Don't do anything you'll regret!\" Ruby yelled, not liking how Weiss' hand was inching closer to her mouth, and Weiss' flustered smile turned to an evil smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I won't have to worry about any of you telling anyone of my fetish if you're too busy digesting in my belly~\" Weiss teased, licking her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weiss! STOP!\" Yang yelled as Weiss' hand began to tip forward, and the three tiny girls started to slide down her palm slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Yang, I just can't help it!\" Weiss yelled as she dropped them from her palm, into her open awaiting maw...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake and Yang managed to grab onto the sides of Weiss' lips, but unfortunately for Ruby, she plummeted straight down into the centre of the cavern that was Weiss' mouth. The tongue instantly began to play with Ruby. Her was throbbing sensationally. The many of teeth in her maw were cleaned to perfection, glimmering in what small amount of light entered the mouth. Saliva strands hung from the roof of Weiss' mouth. Ruby began to scream as she stared at the uvula dangling effortlessly above the cavernous throat that led to Weiss' stomach, and to Ruby's demise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss closed her mouth, using her tongue to scoop up Blake and Yang and toss them inside as well. Weiss moaned as she played with all 3 girls, enjoying their flavour. Tears streamed down all 3 girls faces, as they thought this would be the end of them. They tried hard to fight back the constant assault from Weiss' tongue, which continuously tossed all three girls against every crevice inside the mouth. As Weiss continued to moan, the three girls cried and plead that Weiss wouldn't go through with swallowing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInitially, Weiss had no such plan, she simply wanted to play around. But feeling them inside her mouth reignited the spark of when she would often eat ants, enjoying them crawling around in her mouth, and then swallowing them whole, it felt practically the same, only better due to the fact they were actual humans. Weiss was having a hard time fighting her urge to swallow. Looking over to her newly opened package of shrinking dust, she also saw inside the other types of dust she ordered to go with it. So with a sinister smile, Weiss flicks all 3 girls to the back of her mouth, swallowing them all, as all 3 girls screamed and cried as they slowly made their way down Weiss' oesophagus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss quickly grabbed one of the many vile\u2019s of dust, quickly taking a small dose herself, shivering at the taste, but then suddenly felt really good, as she felt the 3 girls fall into her stomach. Blake, Yang and Ruby fell into the stomach acid with a soft splash, all 3 girls immediately attempting to get to safety, taking refuge on a piece of bread Weiss had eaten earlier, as it floated in the acid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d Ruby softly spoke. \u201cI can't believe she did this\u2026 She\u2019s going to murder us\u2026 and she got sexual pleasure from this? Like a cannibal?\u201d Ruby continued, slowly starting to cry over the thought of her best friend intentionally killing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s gonna be okay sis, I promise, it\u2019s gonna be okay.\u201d Yang lied, as she comforted both her sister and her partner. Holding both Blake and Ruby in a tight hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them were slightly burnt from the acid, which slowly began to rise and consume the whole stomach. Accepting this was it for them, the hug got tighter, as they prepared for death. Only instead of feeling stomach acid consuming them, along with the bread, they felt bits of Dust land on them, bounce off, and fall into the stomach acid. Slowly, the stomach acid began to drain, and although they were all greatly confused, each girl began to celebrate, as the pressure of death went away. Eventually, the entire stomach had drained. and the 3 girls ran to the wall of Weiss\u2019 stomach and began banging on it hard. only for the stomach to completely flip onto its side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss ingested the anti-acid dust, feeling a little weird as her stomach acid disappeared in order to let her friends survive. Weiss made her way to the bathroom, and stood before the toilet, feeling her team pound on the inside of her stomach before leaning over, and putting two fingers down her throat. Ruby Blake and Yang were winded at their sudden lunge forward, but became even more winded, as they suddenly were shot up from inside the stomach, to rising back up into Weiss\u2019 mouth, along with all the other bits of food from inside the stomach with them, and being shot out of Weiss\u2019 maw, and into the toilet bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, guys~ How was it?\u201d Weiss casually asked, getting severely turned on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2018How was it\u2019? \u2018How was it\u2019?! It was utterly terrifying! It was horrible! I thought we were all going to die!\u201d Ruby yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell were you thinking! If you messed up that dust that made your stomach acid go away, we would all be dead!\u201d Yang added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax, relax. I never had any intention of killing you guys, you\u2019re my friends!\u201d Weiss attempted to tone down the situation. \u201cTrust me, all I want is to have a little night of fun. Trust me, you guys may not share my fetish, but you\u2019ll still enjoy this, I promise!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! I swear to dust when I get big again, I am going to KILL you! Do you hear me ice queen!? I\u2019ll kill you!\u201d Yang yelled, eyes turning from a dark lilac to a deep red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss sighed, \u201cWell, looks like you just need to \u2018cool off\u2019, Bye bye Yang, ill see you on the other side!\u201d Weiss teased, as she picked up Ruby and Blake from inside the toilet bowl, dropping them next to the sink, before reaching back down. But instead of Yang, Weiss\u2019 hand drifted towards the toilet\u2019s flusher\u2026</span></div></div>",

Raising herself up, she felt a sharp pain at her temple.<br>\r\nWaiting for it to subside, she rolled onto the floor, landing on all fours.<br>\r\nTrying to remember what happened, she found something on the floor that... Did not help.<br>\r\n\"Is that Weiss' dress?\" Taking a step back, she also found Ruby's attire on the floor. \"What is this all doing on the floor? Where is-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cut herself off as she spied a ruffling in the redhood of Ruby's cape. Spotting something poking out with her superior faunus vision, she recognized that face as none other than Ruby Rose.<br>\r\n\"But... Why is she small?\"<br>\r\nBlake's amazement was interrupted by the sharp pain again, causing her to recoil. Struggling against the pain, it eventually vanished.<br>\r\nGrateful to see her friend, Ruby jumped out of the pile of clothes, uncaring of herself being undressed, and ran to Blake.<br>\r\n\"Blake, down here! Please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake looked down at the tiny Ruby with a look of, less amazement, and more feral drive. Slowly lowering herself onto all fours, stared at the tiny creature before her.<br>\r\nBefore Ruby had a chance to understand what was happening, Blake pounced, grabbing Ruby in her soft hands. Presenting her teeth, and looking down with a much greater aggressiveness, Blake purred at her captured prey.<br>\r\n\"Blake? What are you doing? Y-You're scaring me!\" Ruby's feelings of hope and uncare were smashed and replaced with fear and dread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising herself onto her feet, the feral faunus extended her arm above her head, raising her face to match. Opening her gaping maw, Ruby had a clear view of Blake's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blake? Blake, I don't like this. What are you doing?!\" Watching Blake lick her lips, Ruby had a sudden realization hit her like a truck. \"Wait, Blake, you can't do this! Stop! No, I'm your friend!

Satisfied with her catch, Blake's tongue pushed Ruby to her throat, trying to swallow her.<br>\r\nRuby, however, had too much moxie to simply go out like that. She took an iron grip onto Blake's uvula, swinging her way to the lips, causing Blake to slightly choke. Seeing her opportunity, Ruby hopped out of the acking mouth and slid down Blake's bloused breasts, grabbing her way onto one of her straps and swinging to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecovered from her hacking attack, the big cat found her prey out of her mouth, and on the floor below her. Hungry for her meal, Blake lifted her bare foot above the naked girl and stomped down. Luckily, Ruby's speed let her dodge it, just barely though.<br>\r\nBlake lifted her foot again, stomping at Ruby again, missing again narrowly. The giantess was getting fed up by the prey's constant dodging around, and soon realized stomping wasn't enough. Blake's feral insticts made her want her meal no matter what, by any means.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumping in the air, Blake fell front first on the ground, bodyslamming with every part of herself. For good measure, she pushed herself off the floor only to fall right back down to make sure Ruby was especially flattened.<br>\r\nRaising to her feet, Blake dusted off the dust and looked down to the sticker that was once Ruby Rose, too exhausted from running around to try and run away. Looking down at her prey, Blake heard a tiny noise from behind her.<br>\r\n\"Stay away from my sister, you kitty bitch!\" Yang was standing on a pile of her clothes on her bed, only an inch or two tall, screaming at what used to be her friend. \"What the hell are you doing, Blake? This isn't you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Weiss climbed out of the hiding spot that was her clothes and ran to Ruby. Weiss bent down and grabbed at a deflatted arm, yanking on it to tear Ruby off.<br>\r\n\"Come on, Ruby,\" whispered Weiss, \"get up! Get up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, remembering her prey, the feral Blake turned back to Ruby, seeing Weiss now try and help her. Unnoticed by the white-haired girl, Blake went onto all fours and crept silently towards the pair on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning her head to check on the once distracted giant, Weiss soon finds Blake ready to pounce.

When Blake was safely over her prey, she collapsed, pinning the heiress underneath her clothed mounds.<br>\r\nBouncing herself to ensure Weiss was made docile, Blake lifted herself to her knees, kneeling infront of a tasty, icecream dessert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around to grab her first victim, the animal notice Ruby was reinflated enough to crawl away, slowly.<br>\r\nPicking her up with little effort, Blake placed the girl onto her tongue, quickly pinning her to the roof of her mouth. Sliding her tongue roughly on what was once her friend, tasting every inch of her body, Blake lifted her chin and swallowed.<br>\r\nRuby wanted to fight, to beat up the tingue that pushed her down her new prison, but she was too tired. She had nothing left in her, except for shivers and suddering from the violating touch of her throat muscles.<br>\r\n</div></span></div></div>",

Fully satisfied, Blake turned to see empty carpet where her other prey had layed. She clenched her teeth and jerked her head left right and down searching for the pale-skinned tiny, who she found running away towards Ruby's bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake readied her hands and hind legs and pounced at her escaping prey, her fingers nearly clasping around Weisses naked body. The force from Blake's landing made Weiss stumble, her crossing legs nearly throwing her onto her face. Weiss looked back to see the animal eyes of the giant faunas, her tongue escaping between her teeth to smack her lips.<br>\r\nBlake jumped a second pounce at Weiss, this time going too far and landing chest to the floor, in such a way that Weiss was between her arms, and an inch away from being smashed by Blake's entrapping breasts. Blake didn't see where the pale girl was, however, and showed such in her aggressive growling. She whipped her head back and forth, looking for her escaped prey.<br>\r\nWeiss, looking up at the furious faunas, stood perfectly still. Her heart raced a thousand miles an hour as her heard the powerful heartbeat from Blake's chest. But she saw Blake's head angle more and more down, towards her. She slowly backed up in an effort to remain out of her hungry sight. But she went one step too far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss felt the soft fabric of Blake's blouse against her back as Weiss accidentally bumped into her hunter's boobs. Her eyes watered as she knew that this was the end; she was going to be noticed. But she covered her mouth with her hand to keep from screaming, just in case the hungry kitty didn't feel her. She shut her eyes as her adrenaline pumped through her veins, readying her for one final sprint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas she noticed?</span></div></div>",

Finding the first room, she found Blake and Sun Wukong sleeping on seperate couches. Taking a pinch of powder into her hand, Ilia blew some into each of their face's.<br>\r\nWaiting a moment to see what the powder would do, she watched as the two slowly began to shrink, stiffling an excited giggle. \"<i>That's</i> what it does? That'll make this <i>super</i> easy!\"<br>\r\nMoving on to the next room, she noticed the loud, hulking Ghira Belladonna wrapped in sheets, but no Kali. \"She probably left because of his snoring. Ugh.\" Kneeling infront of his face, she blew another splash of dust into his face. Standing back up, she watched as the sheets slowly began to go down.<br>\r\n\"And now to find the mama\" Ilia mused to herself.<br>\r\nAs the assassin creeped through the hall of the house, she noticed a door creaked open, just enough to see her final target sleeping soundly on a spare couch. Sliding through the doorway and to the cat faunus, Ilia prepared another dose of shrinking dust in her hand.<br>\r\nBut right as she was about to blow it, the sleeping Kali sneezed, blowing the dust into Ilia's face.<br>\r\nPanicking, while also trying to stay silent, Ilia speed-crept through the house, feeling her clothes slowly loosen. The dust was also making her vision foggy, and her sense of direction was gone. Eventually, the dust made her pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake woke up the next morning with a headache and an upset stomache. Opening her eyes, she didn't see her monkey partner as she expected, but instead a wall of black. Startled, she quickly looked around to find everything was black. Feeling around, she realized she was surrounded by fabric, but that there was an opening infront of her. Unsure of what was going on, Blake crawled her way forward, feeling the corse fabric rub against her now naked skin. A million things were going through her mind as she attempted escape. \"Where am I? Was I kidnapped? Where's Sun, snd my Parents? Why don't I have clothes?\"<br>\r\nFinally seeing a shred of light, she emerged from her flowy prison, the light blinding her as she stood up. Her eyes adjusted eventually, but she was sure they weren't working right. She looked around, and saw her family's living room. But it was big. Very big. Gigantic even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow small was she?</span></div></div>",

She couldn't believe it, she refused to believe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked and turned around, seeing everything do much bigger. The back cushions of the couch touched the immense sky, that was now her family's ceiling. The dark prison she dragged herself out of looked just like her clothes.<br>\r\nHolding her panicking heart, she dropped to her knees, her brain refusing to process it. Tears of dread flowed from her wide eyes.<br>\r\n-------------<br>\r\nKali woke up with a big stretch and a smile slapped on her face from a fantastic sleep. She recalled a fuzzy memory of a dream that she quite enjoyed, where she was on all fours chasing tiny people. She had a chuckle about it before getting out of bed and slipping on her morning robe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the door, grabbing a towel on the way out. With a hop in her step, she made her way to the bathroom.<br>\r\n-------------<br>\r\nCalming down, tears drying off her face, Blake stood herself up.<br>\r\n\"Crying isn't going to solve anything. And neither is denying what's going on. I don't know how it happened, but I've shrunk.\" Looking over at Sun's bed, she noticed only his open shirt and pants were there. \"And by the looks of it, so did Sun. No matter what, we've got to find a way to fix this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing onto the cuff of her sleve, she jumped down, the shirt's arm lessening the force as it rubbed against the couch. Finally, landing on the floor, Blake eyed up her target: the other couch.<br>\r\n\"Don't worrry, Sun. I'm coming.\"<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\nKali, humming to her self and swinging her hips to the rhythem, made her way through the house to get to the bathroom.

She slowly lowered herself in, allowing the water to cover nearly her whole body, stopping just short of the tops of her breasts.<br>\r\nAs she got comfortable, she could feel her muscles loosen, and she fell deeper in. She could also begin to feel the squishy thing under her foot start to peel off already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning her head back, she decided to relax for a bit.<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\nIlia woke up that morning very abruptly, with the force of a house falling on top of her. Opening her eyes, she could see the ground beneath her grow farther and farther away, before finally plummeting back into it. She felt her body squish and flatten, and then she floated back off the ground, then smashed back into it. It wasn't hell, due to her plush form, but it sure wasn't daisy sweet.<br>\r\nRemembering what happened last night, and seeing a foot way in the distance, she knew exactly what happened.<br>\r\n\"Grr, I must have...\" SMUSH! \"Shrunk from Blake's mom.. \" CRASH! \"Sneezing the dust in my face.\" SQUISH! \"Seeings how she was the only...\" SMUSH! \"One I didn't shrink, I...\" CRASH! \"Must be on <i>her</i> foot.\" SQUISH! \"Great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the cycle of smushing stopped as the unaware giantess stopped. Ilia was face to face with a slab of tile, feeling the pressure become greater and less as Kali readjust her stance. But the tile she was just getting to know began to fly away as her warden carried her across the sky, meeting a new tile every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next step she had expected to feel the cold, crushing surface of tile, but instead she felt her body become steam boiled from the hot, hot water below. Feeling the world begin to fall, she held her breath for the shared bath she was about to hate. Her body plunged into the boiling water, feeling pain all across her skin from the sudden temperature change.<br>\r\nThe world was flipping and changing, swirling around every direction as her captor moved and floated the foot in the water bringing the chameleon along for the ride before finally, finally settling down. Ilia could feel the world stabilize as Kali the giant finally settled in.<br>\r\nThis was finally Ilia's chance for escape.<br>\r\nShe began tugging on her arms, still stuck and reforming on the giant sole. Her legs her also stuck, however much less deformed as they were positioned in the arch of mother faunas' foot. She pulled and pulled, feeling as though she was about to rip herself like paper. She was almost out of breath, she began to panic. Bubbles escaped her mouth as she screamed, desperately pulling herself away.<br>\r\nEventually, her lungs couldn't take it anymore. She passed out.<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\nKali enjoyed the hot water soak her skin. It was soothing. She felt like she could stay in this tub forever. But something was... Off.<br>\r\n\"Oh, right!\" Kali said to herself, \"This little smushy stain on my foot. It's almost off, but I wonder if I could...\" She floated her other foot to the stain, fiddling at it with her toe. She tried to push it off with the bottom of her toe, scrape it off with her painted toe nail, even pluck it off between her big and second toe.<br>\r\nEventually, the stain unstuck itself, and Kali could finally continue relaxing.<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n\"Hmph, kmph, kmph, Cough!\"<br>\r\nIlia woke up as she spat water out of her lungs. Rolling onto her hands and knees, she coughed up more water, gasping in air.<br>\r\nFinally breathing again, she fell in her back and looked around. To her forward, she saw a hill of medium tan and a pair of black cat ears in the distance. To her left, a long smooth leg. To her back, a big foot with pretty purple toenails. <br>\r\n\"I must have somehow floated onto the Belladonna's ankle while I was passed out.\" Ilia said to herself. \"What am I going to do now?\"<br>\r\nShe leaned her head to the left to see past the knee, looking over and past a pair of floating hills, to look at the giant's face. Her eyes were closed, and her lips were in a smile.<br>\r\n\"She must be sleeping. This could be my chance to escape. I have a vial of the antidote in my bag, but it would have fallen off somewhere while I was shrinking. And at this size I doubt I'd make it there anytime soon.<br>\r\nI could get Mrs. Belladonna to help me, she probably doesn't know what I look like since attacking Sun and Blake. But if she did, and she found out what I was doing here...\" The thought of what Kali would do sent a shiver down Ilia's spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally weighing her two options, she decides to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</div></span></div></div>",

She strutted along Kali's leg, making sure to admire the scenery. Her eyes were tantalized by Kali's wide hips, far off in the distance still, and the looming breasts that could have been big enough to smother the fallen tower at Beacon.<br>\r\nShe knew it wasn't Blake, but Ilia stilled loved it, her bare body shivering and her chameleon skin turning red. As she reached the pelvis, she had to stop herself from jumping at the big kitty's kitty. \"Stay focused Ilia, soon she'll be shrunken and staring at your pussy real soon. You just got to stay focused.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIlia marched past the lower regions of Kali's gigantic body, keeping her head dead straight away from Kali's womanhood, and instead towards the gigantic mountains ahead.

Viewing one of the Belladonna's (Specifically Bella-momma) from such a unique view was exciting and very erotic, but Ilia wanted a different view of the Belladonnas. So she went through, as going over would add a dangerous extra few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIlia's feet slapped against the wet chest of Kali, her surrounding naked breasts acting like an echo chamber, amplifying every puddled step into the ears of the tiny, nude chameleon, and to the ears of the sleeping kitty.<br>\r\nIlia couldn't see from the angle she was at, but Kali's pointed ears twitched with every noisy step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroggy from her rest, Kali lightly muttered something under her breath. She was about to open her eyes and get up from out of the tub, but she heard a rhythmic slapping and felt a faint, tickling scuttle running a line up her skin.<br>\r\n\"Oh great,\" she thought to herself, \"another bug.\"<br>\r\nHer arms raised themselves from floating on the water's surface, her hands positioned to hold each of her heavy breasts.<br>\r\n\"When will they learn that they can't survive Kali Belladonna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was only half way across Booby-Valley when it happened.

I gotta get out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer once careful creeping quickly turned into a desperate sprint, her legs carrying her as fast as they could as the walls came closing in. The giant, once tantalizing orbs turned into a collapsing cave ready to eat her up. Ilia burned red as her heart started to give out, her lungs incapable of giving her the air she needed. She saw the exit, the escape-zone to avoid this crushing fate. She thought she might actually be able to make it! And then she slipped on the wet skin of the giant kitty, her fate sealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIlia was crushed as the two gigantic breasts smashed into each other, the impact sending jiggly ripples throughout the soft skin of the curvy mother and the trapped chameleon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKali smiled as she crushed her, thinking of her as only a bug. \"Another bug killed by my boobies!\" she giggled. She released her breasts, letting them fall apart only to crash them into each other again, making sure to finish the job. \"Careful boys, I'm carrying two dangerous weapons!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIlia screamed in agony as her body was slammed again by Kali's breasts, her voice insulated by the massive mounds continuing to squeeze her. Ilia couldn't think through the pain, her animal instincts kicked through. Desperate to get out, she opened her mouth and bit down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!

Kali at the thing on her chest only to see a tan smear in between her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKali decided to get a closer look at it by peeling it out from her breasts after looking at it for a few moments,It seemed to Kali what she was squishing wasn't a bug but seemed to be a small towel that happened to fall in the bathtub with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Kali remember why she was here in the first place,and that was so that she could clean herself off. Kali had grabbed a bar of soap she had on the side of the bathtub as she rubbed the 'towel' that she had making sure it was covered in soap before she cleaned herself off with it. As she ran Ilia's squishy body over her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIlia had briefly fallen unconscious after being squashed painfully by Kali's breasts but was soon woken up as she felt herself being rubbed with soap the sour taste getting in her mouth.As her body was coated with soap she then felt her body being rubbed right against Kali's chest.Confused about what was happening Ilia tried to scream as she felt her body being moved all over Kali's chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then felt herself being rubbed right against Kali's boobs bringing back horrible memories that had just happened moments ago, She then heard some words coming out of Kali's mouth answering her question about why she was doing this to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow this towels really soft it also seems quite stretchy to\" She said as she stretched Ilia's body between her boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis filled Ilia with much dread as she had now realized that Kali had thought she was a towel. Ilia tried to move in her body to try and escape the giant Faunus's grip but it happened to have no effect as she was just weak in her shrunken and squashed form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKali then brought Ilia between her toes moving The Ilia towel between each of them to make sure that they were nice and clean as she then rubbed Ilia against her foot. Scrubbing extra hard to make her foot was clean.Kali then brought Ilia up the rest of her leg clean the rest of it before doing the same with the other leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe experience had been far from pleasurable for Ilia as she was rubbed against Kali's legs and feet but the worst was about to come as she felt herself being brought to Kali's ass. Pulled straight in the middle of the gargantuan cheeks the smell and the taste being agonizing for the poor chameleon Faunus and just to rub it in Kali was moaning in pleasure up above enjoying Ilia soft form being rubbed against her butt cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter making sure the rest of her body was nice and clean.Kali drained the water from the tub holding Ilia's demolished body in her right hand as she used her left to grab a towel to dry herself off. Kali had decided to take the towel with her after squeezing most off the water out of it as she held it over the sink decided that she could make other use of it. As Kali walked to her room to get her clothes on.</span></div></div>",

Ruby?\" She figured Ruby must have been in the bathroom, too, as Ruby left her clothes on her bed as well.<br>\r\nNoticing both Ruby and Weiss gone, with their clothes definately not on their bodies, Yang smirked. \"You dirty girls. Right under our noses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang stumbled her way back to her bed, snuggling back with Blake.<br>\r\n--------------------<br>\r\nWeiss screamed as the feet of the busty blonde approached her. She read enough giantess stories to realize where this was going. She ducked her head and prepared for the crushing as the feet neared.<br>\r\nShe looked up as she noticed she wasn't being smeared across the feet of the giant, and saw that Yang managed to neel with her legs on either side of her. She looked up and saw that Yangs body covered her sky, replacing it with yellow fabric and dangling spheres. She was grateful to be roofed by her rather than crushed by her, and was brought into a trance by the sight of her.<br>\r\nSuddenly, she was brought back from staring at Yang's assets as Yang said \"her clothes are here.\"<br>\r\n\"Why would my clothes be there?\" Weiss asked no one. \"They should be on me, right?\" Looking down, Weiss realized for the first time that clothes do not shrink. Instinctivly, she blushed and covered herself with her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Yang's body was shifting, raising to her feet. The view of a fleshy roof was replaced with descending toes. \"No, please! No!\" Weiss was squished my Yang's toes as she got up. It was painful, dreadfully so. The toes dug into every part of her body, flattening her like a pancake - luckily Nora isn't here - as the toes dragged her across the carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Yang was done with Ruby's bed, Weiss felt her world raise as Yang brought her foot up, taking her along like chewed gum. Her world soon fell as Yang stepped down. And her world was brought up again, and swiftly brought down, the cycle repeating until Yang slumpt into bed again, her foot revealed to the world, and Weiss stretched across the toes. Ouch.<br>\r\n--------------------<br>\r\nRuby Rose woke up to near-drunken rambling and lilac eyes sraring at her. Still groggy from sleep, she passed it off as Yang staring at her sleep again. But slowly waking up, she realized they were bigger than usual, and so was everything else.<br>\r\nPanicking, she yelled out for Yang to help her. \"Yang! I'm scared! You're so huge! Make sure my cookies are still normal, goant cookies are surprisongly bad!\" But due to Yangs current state, she was unaware of her little sisters pleas, and walked away.<br>\r\nDesperate for attention, and help, the little red hood jumped and caught the bouncing golden locks, clinging on for dear life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho do we follow?</span></div></div>",

The monsters were fought off by team RWBY, JNPR, CSSL, and the new foreign exchange students that mysteriously showed up. Interestingly enough, the new students weren't attacked by the Grimm at all. Weird.<br>\r\nAnyways, pushing that aside, the attack showed the students of Beacon some brand new Grimm, including what appeared to be a witch doctor. Before having it's head chopped off by Phyrra Nikos, it cast out a wave of turqoise energy across the entire block, hitting all the junior and senior hunters and huntress', with the exception of the new students. Hmm... Well, the magic VooDoo wave seemed to have no effect, other than Nora thinking she had magic powers now.<br>\r\nAfter a hard fought battle, and getting a free dinner on the house (free dessert in the case of one Ruby Rose), everyone simply went home and rested up for another big day of studying, training, and trying not to die. However, it would mostly be the latter, as they may soon find out.<br>\r\n-----------------------------<br>\r\nAfter their evil, ingenius plan failed, team CRME went back to their dorm room, ranted angrily about it, and maybe made a few holes in the wall. But after a long day, they were to tuckered out to not fall like rocks after the fourth hole has punched. They slepted like evil babies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe morning after, or rather the noon after (they wanted to sleep in after failing, again), the dark skinned Emerald Sustrai rolled out of bed, and face first onto the floor. She got up and looked around to see if her team was also up.<br>\r\nCinder and Neo were fast asleep still, with her partner Mercury nowhere to be found. \"Huh. Must have gotten lunch.\"<br>\r\nEmerald exited the dorm in her regular sleep attire, her green top and white shorts, and headed down to the cafeteria. But it was eerily quite. \"It's normally super busy around this time, why is no one here?\"<br>\r\nShe eventually decided to go to the RWBY and JNPR dorms to do a little reconasence.<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Cinder and Neo were both waking up, wondering where their team was. Emerald left a note saying \"Got lunch. Bye\" but Mercury had no trace. Even his bed was sort of made, as if he never got out of it anyways. Or he was trying to hide something.<br>\r\nThis last possibilty got Cinder incredibly curious. She strutted her way to the bed of her minion, leaned down and yanked the covers off. And Mercury was, indeed, hiding something.</span></div></div>",

It seemed to be made of a soft material, even what would be robotic metal legs on the real thing was soft on this doll.<br>\r\nSuddenly, Neo swooped in and took the doll, throwing it up and down, up and down. \"Neo, stop playing with it,\" Cinder commanded, \"If Mercury finds out we knew about his doll he's going to be pouty for months!\" Neo, of course, ignored this and continued throwing it around, prompting Cinder to step in and grab the doll away from her.<br>\r\nBut as she extended her arm to catch it, the doll fumbled and bounced off her hand, to her lowcut shirt. It landed head first into her cleavage, causing Neo to laugh uncontrollably, only on mute. \"Shut up, Neo.\"<br>\r\n---------------------------------------<br>\r\nMercury was having the nicest dream. Flowers, candy, beating team RWBY with Emerald locked into his loving gaze. They were about to kiss when the once blue sky turned a dark red.<br>\r\nOver a once beautiful hill came a giant shadow, with burning orange eyes. As colour began to fill in the misty, black void, he began to recognize it. The shadows shape began to morph to, into a more human, hourglass form. Then, it was clear to him, the shadow revealed itself to be Cinder, only gigantic and, oddly under-dressed.<br>\r\nThe giant Cinder reached for his comparatively tiny form, and hovered him in-front of her face. The dream giant laughed at his tiny form as it began to crush him in it's hands. He tried to scream, but the dream kept him silent. The only real good that came from this was he had a great view of her cleavage, even if it was just a dream.<br>\r\nSuddenly, he began to fall, and fall in a black void of nothing, thankful he wasn't being crushed anymore. But also terrified as falling indefinitely isn't quite that enjoyable. His dream body went splat against an invisible floor. He woke up, but it was dark, he was being squeezed on both sides, all of his blood was rushing to his head. He tried to scream for help, but the soft mass kept his voice inside his prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, his leg was grabbed, and he was blinded by light as he was dragged out his prison. After his eyes adjusted, he realized that he's looking directly into the face of Cinder again, only now it feels much more real. He looked down to where he was pulled, and realizes his prison was her ample breasts.<br>\r\nHe could only sit there in shock as Cinder had a one sided fight with Neo.</span></div></div>",

'Interesting choice,' he thought, slightly jealous, 'I guess she just invites any guy in there.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, his jealousy was subsidded as he noticed her, cough<i>, in a state of undress</i>. He couldn't help but stare as she moved around, grabbing this, getting that, her bare breasts shaking with every movement.<br>\r\nBut when she went for her panties and bra, he turned as red as her eyes as she looked at him. It certainly didn't help that he was sotting in her bra, which was an issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment of silence went by as they stared at eachother, with him in her bra, and her shocked and embarrased with nothing on.<br>\r\nFinally, she spoke.</div></span></div></div>",

Penny flew in front of Ruby,\"Hey friend Ruby its me Penny!\" Penny said in delighted tone,\"Eww a bug\" Ruby said not paying attention to the fact that this bug look much different then others bugs as she swatted Penny with her hand, causing her to hit the ground with a splat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately things weren't over for the poor android girl as Ruby continued to walk forward she ended up stepping on Penny who just happened to be in her path, squashing down the robot girl as she attached to Ruby's boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ruby continued to walk she felt something strange on her one boot that was flattening out onto her sole, unsure of what this was Ruby decided to take a break in her search sitting down and seeing what had adhered to her boot.Cinder meanwhile was relieved to finally get a break from this torture as Ruby sat down only for a different feeling off pain to come as Ruby peeled her off her boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby wasn't sure what this was but what she was sure off was that she was going to find out, moving her red fingernails under the cinder blob to get a good grip as she peeled her off her boot. Ruby pressed her hands against Cinders body amazed as she felt how soft it was, as she started to play with it like a piece of putty stretching Cinder gooey mass between her hands, as Cinder silently groaned in agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby smiled at her find,\"Wow I can't believe I've been walking without noticing this amazing thing that got stuck to my boot\" Ruby said squeezing down on Cinders blobby found with her right hand blushing as she saw I squeeze out of her fingers from her closed palm. Ruby then got an amazing idea if this thing was so soft maybe she could put this in her sock as she continued her walk drooling at how awesome that would be,Ruby then enacted her plan taking her right boot off unaware off the blob that lay adheared to it as she put the blob her sock and put it on.\"OH goodness that feels good\" Ruby said as her whole foot entered the sock and eventually her boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby stomped down a few times to get a good feel of it as she continued her walk through the courtyard blushing in happiness as she feel Cinder flatten against her foot, as Cinder silently screamed inside the boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould we continue with Ruby, or see what the tiny in the courtyard are up to?</span></div></div>",

Kali said trying to desperately get Ruby to hear her pleases, Kali words went silent as the relentless squashed basically demolished Kali's ability to vocalize and once Kali thought the torture was over Ruby then scrapped Kali harshly against the rough pavement, reducing Kali and her clothes which were miraculously not ripped to shreds a blob of tortured flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe torment was far from over for the poor Faunus mother as Ruby started to walk through the courtyard as Kali was compressed and smeared being put through utter agonizing pain.

Uh i forgot your name but your still as top heavy as I remember\" Neon said with a smile, upon hearing this Yang was quite angry remembering all the taunting and being annoying that this girl had been when they fought, not only that but this girl didn't even remember her name only remembering her by an insult that she called her by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang was quite angered upon hearing this and decided to get a little revenge on this girl, Neon meanwhile hadn't been paying attention to Yang and instead went on a tangent about random things, this only fueled Yang anger as she dropped her on the floor with a squash.\"Hey what gives\" Neon said in annoyance, only to be stepped on my Yang who was currently enraged.Yang stomped down on Neon over and over again reducing her to a blobb as she picked her up and cleaned her off a little wit a nearby water fountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Neon, do you like gum because I'm gonna make you feel like it\" Yang said with a smirk, as she put the blobby kitty in her mouth chewing her up like gum as she started to blow a bubble with Neon.a pop was heard as Neon spread over Yang face.<br>\r\nYang peeled Neon off her face to get a good look of the damage that had been done, only for to laugh in amusement as Neon blobby form had a goofy dazed look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang decided that she was going to play with Neon some more having a blast with playing with her gooey body, as she thought what she was going to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang decided she would...</span></div></div>",

Just then Neon had realized her mistake but could do anything as she was quickly placed on an unknown weight machine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope you don\u2019t have any plans today because my schedule is wide open and I feel like working out for hours\u201d. Yang said as she set the machines weight as high as it would go. Underneath the blonde bombshells tone asscheeks that were barely contain in her black spandex shorts, Neons senses started to be assaulted by the taste and stench of Yangs sweaty swamp ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like ages, Neon felt Yang get up but her joy was short lived as Yang placed right in the centre of a vacant rowing machine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you think my ass smelt bad before, you are in for a rude awakening\u201d. Yang said with a chuckle. Neon started to wince in pain as she was ground into a pulp by the blonde powerhouses extreme toned ass. Neon tried to scream but was only met with a river of sweat which threatened to drown her if she didn\u2019t swallow it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI bet you really regret what you said before, but of course you had to be an Ass and make fun of my weight\u201d. Said with a laugh proud of her pun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeon once again felt Yangs crushing weight being lifted off her. However, her torment was far from over as Yang brought her over to a bench press and placed her where here ass would be and forcefully sat down while she got ready to start lifting the bar. After a few reps, Neon finally passed out from the pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Neon woke up, a very sweaty and nude Yang blocked her vision. Before she could say anything she was roughly picked up and was held to her tormentors face, she wanted to gag as Yangs awful breath washed over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what it is about you, but you look like you would make a very good sweat rag\u201d. Yang said. Neon looked on in horror as she was swiftly brought face to face with Yangs extremely sweaty armpit. Neon gagged as the taste and the smell assaulted the tiny girls senses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Neons horror, Yang took her time making sure her human sweat rag didn\u2019t miss a spot. After she was done with her first armpit, Yang plunged Neon face first into her other armpit. After she was done, she notice Neon was unconscious. Not wanting her to miss out, Yang have a super wet smooch to wake up sleeping beauty(Neon). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeon woke up to find her face being engulfed by Yangs puckered lips. Once Yang noticed Neons limbs flailing as she struggled to breath she finish her kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, that not even the worst part yet\u201d. Yang said. Neon was then introduced to Yangs sweaty mountain range of chest and was forced to give her captor a very disgusting motorboat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Yang was done with her chest, she moved onto the worst part of her body, between the legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeon was introduced to a whole new stench as she was used as Yangs booty floss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like ages, Yang was finally done using Neon as a sweat rag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know I still really want to play with you but it\u2019s getting late. Why don\u2019t you come with me. But I will need to hide you, but where should I put you\u201d? </span></div></div>",

It's morning already\" Ren had as he got up. The boy then noticed that things seemed to be different,for one thing his bed had happened to be giant compared another thing he noticed was,*SNOOORE* his partner Nora who was sleeping in the bed next to him had been also giant,snoring quite loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon realizing that he had been shrunken Ren decided that he need to get help, As he walked over to his partners bed (which had been moved next to his due to Nora wanting him to sleep close by her) he then had made his way to the girls face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NORA ITS ME REN CAN YOU PLEASE WAKE UP\" Ren yelled to the sleeping girl. Unfortunately this didn't wake Nora instead she had grabbed Ren and threw him off her bed. Ren screamed as he was hurled through the air eventually landing to the ground with a splat. Ren felt immense pain cover his body despite this he had still been alive somehow flattening out into a gum like form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile at the other side of the room Jaune had just woke up and way taking into realization what had happened. \"What the heck! I've been shrunken, how is this even possible!\" Jaune said in panic!\" Okay get a hold of yourself Jaune there got to be away to get yourself back to normal size\"Jaune said to himself. Suddenly,Jaune had noticed Nora started to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yaaaawn oh it's morning time already\" Nora said still being quite tired as she got off her bed, unintentionally landing on the shrunk Ren who was currently trying to reform, only for it to be undone as she landed on him.\" Morning Jaune and Ren\" Nora said loudly to wake the two boys who had slept in the same room as her up. To her confusion Ren hadn't been in his bed, assuming he had gotten up early and hadn't woken her Nora rushed out of the room. \"LEAVE SOME PANCAKES FOR ME REN\". Nora yelled down the hall waking up team RWBY, who had slept in the room next to them as she ran down the hall for breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... Don't go!\" Yelled Jaune as he saw Nora run off.\"Oh now what am i going to do\" Jaune said in a disappointed tone.\" Well I have 2 options I could either stay here and wait for Nora to realize she didn't check to see if I was up and find me, or I could go out of this room to the room next to here were Ruby and the others are to try to get help from them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about his choices Jaune decides to...</span></div></div>",

Do I have to get up now*yawn* can't I just sleep some more... Oh hey tiny Jaune how you doing...!\" Ruby eyes then widen up\" Wait... Tiny Jaune!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby was shocked to see her friend Jaune on the ground having only being much smaller. Ruby put her hand down on Jaune's small body touching it to make sure she wasn't still dreaming, to her surprise she could feel his body on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JAUNE\" Ruby yelled instantly grabbing the tiny boy off the ground, only to find out that he was paper thin.\"Oh god you must off been stepped on by the others, oh god Juane  please be okay\" Ruby said looking like she was about to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her relief Juane body started to reform to it normal shape now holding a tiny not flat Jaune in her hands.Jaune was quite happy when Ruby found him\"thanks Rubyyy!\"Jaune was pressed against Ruby's cheek\" *sniff* I'm so glad that your okay\" Ruby said crying tears of joy about him being alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sis are you okay\" Yang said concerned as she heard her sister sobbing. Upon hearing Yang, Ruby brought the tiny Juane she was pressing towards her cheek and showed it to her big sis.\"Yang look it's Jaune!\", Yang was dumbfounded as she saw the tiny Juane in Ruby hand. \"Weiss, Blake get over hear\" Yang called after the 2 made it to the three Ruby showed them the shrunk Jaune in her hand both having similar reaction to Yang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Ruby told her the others of how she found Juane mentioning how she found him squashed flat making the other 3 girls feel guilty about potentially having stepped on him, as they apologized to Jaune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 4 girls then let Jaune explain how he shrunk.\"Well if Ruby would stop squeezing me then I could explain\" Jaune said,\"oops sorry about that\" Ruby said letting Jaune go as she dropped him in her other opened hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting up on his feet Jaune started to explain what he knew.\" Alright well.. Honestly I'm not sure how I got shrunk, all that happened was I woke up and I was 2 inches tall, then I walked to your guy's room and to get help, only to be stepped on by Yang,Weiss, and Blake and get found by Ruby\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well unfortunately since we don't know how this happened,where not going to be able to figure out how to return you to normal until we find out what caused this\" Weiss said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could search my bed to potentially find some clues\"Jaune suggested. \"Alright let's go then\" Blake said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Should we stay with team RWBY and Jaune, or see what Nora and Ren are up to?)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jacques Schnee was angry, then again that wasn't anything new. He was always angry in some compacity. If it wasn't White Fang stealing dust shipments from him, then it was Ironwood's dust embargo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDay after day the world's number one dust industry leader was losing more and more money. Sure the SDC had more than enough profit to stay afloat, but the losses themselves were still infuriating for the CEO.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn James and this damned embargo.\" Jacques seethed. He was currently trying to calm his nerves with a glass of wine. This what he normally did when he needed to take the edge off. Just him, his private study, and a cool glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he took a sip of his wine he looked back at the paperwork that littered his desk. Seeing the redline of progress skewing downward only served to remind him why he was so frustrated to begin with. It was all James fault! He and his little tin toys couldn't protect Beacon themselves and now he was he one having to suffer for it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only he had a seat on the damn council. He'd send James and his army of failures packing. Maybe he'd do better playing shield for a backwater village somewhere? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome to think of it... he could take his rebellious daughter Winter with him while he was at it. Damn brat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss was a bit of a rebel as well, but with the proper guidance and a little discipline, he could iron her out. Whitley was shaping up to fine man much like himself, why couldn't his other children be more like him? Then there was his wife, Willow. The less he thought about her the better. He just hoped he wouldn't find her passed out again on the floor with bottle in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph!\" The snow-haired CEO grunted. He took another swig before dumping the offending papers in a drawer. Just looking at them sickened him. \"What to do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn excellent question. He canceled all his appointments for the day, so he was essentially free. Weiss was locked away in her room, Whitely was probably cooped up in the Schnee library, Willow was no doubt in the gardens, and Winter was off with Ironwood somewhere last he checked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gripped his glass tighter as he polished off his wine. Maybe he'd go for a walk around the premises. He still did that from time to time. Maybe he'd even put a few of those 'animals' in their place while he was at it. Those mutants were always good for a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his mind made up, the Schnee patriarch rose to his feet to take a walk. But not before pouring himself one more glass for the trip. He took a long sip before making his way into the hall. As he did he began to feel rather strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's odd. I suddenly don't feel to...\" His sentence halted as a bizarre aftertaste struck his taste-buds. He looked back at the wine in his hand before his vision suddenly went dark. The last thing he heard was the sound of shattering glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter nearly an hour, the aging CEO began to awaken. He groaned in discomfort as he wasn't used to sleeping on a hardwood floor. He was a Schnee damn it! Schnee slept on the finest bedding possible. \"Where...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe propped himself up on his knees before taking a look around. What he saw nearly made his heart stop. Everything around him was so... big! This was one of many hallways in Schnee manor, and knew this one intimately as it lead to his office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-Impossible!\" Jacques stuttered. His breathing began to grow heavy as he continued to take in his surroundings. Looking behind him he could see the shattered remains of his wine glass. Even shattered it stood above him. He had somehow shrunken. Either that or the world just got bigger. But he knew deep down it was the former and not the latter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust how small was he? If had to guess, a 1/2 inch maybe? He was a damn bug!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No! No! No! No!\" The ant-man panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when he felt it. The largest tremor in recorded history. The shockwave was so powerful it sent him falling on his back. That was going to be sore in the morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother tremor....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026and another!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain and again the ground quaked. There was rhythm to it. Could it be? Nervously the mite of a man looked up towards the sky and what he saw made his jaw drop. Fear filled his very sole as he saw the giant form of...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Weiss Schnee was not in a good mood. But then again how could she be being back at Schnee manor? This place was more of a prison than it was a happy home. Here the Schnee's were cut off from the rest of the world and her father was seemingly the only one entering and exiting as he pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since she ''returned'' to this place, and she used the world loosely, she'd been constantly reminded why she left. Her mother's over reliance on the sauce, her brother's barely hidden resentment, and her father's manipulative and controlling nature. All of these things were major factors in her decision to got to Beacon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively the Schnee heiress's finger traced down the scar by her eye. It was just another reminder of her initial decision and her success. Success that had now been flushed down the toilet as Beacon was now in ruins and she was back to square one. All of her hard work was now meaningless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, maybe not completely meaningless. She might still be able to do some good, hence why she was striding to her father's office. The man was suborn to a fault and almost never listen to anything she wanted, but he had the resources to do a great many things. If she could just convince him to give her a platform to tell her story about the events that transpired at Beacon Academy then just maybe...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts soon halted as she cut a corner. Something was very out of place about this picture. This was the hallway that lead to her father's private study, so why was there a broken glass in the center of the hall? And... was that red wine staining the carpet? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething clearly wasn't right here. \"The servants would never let something like this escape their notice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the truth, they really wouldn't under the threat of her father's fury. This must have been broken recently then. If so then that meant her father must really be in a bad mood. Although she'd never seen the man break anything, even in his foulest of moods. He opted to take out his frustrations on his family instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to write this off as her father being pissed off, but the huntress in her said otherwise. Though her stint at Beacon may have been brief, she'd learned to trust this feeling. With her curiosity piqued, the snow-haired girl began to investigate. She crouched down over the scene and began examining the glass. She never even noticed the \"bug\" at her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacques was practically screaming as Weiss crouched down over the scene. Her heel had nearly killed him. If he hadn't jumped out the way when he did... he didn't even want to think about it. He was so insignificant now that anyone could step on him and be none the wiser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides that however, he could still hardly believe how massive Weiss was. Her colossal form took up ninety-nine percent of his vision. That scared him, but at the same time this might have been fate presenting him with an opportunity. He had survived his youngest daughter's footfalls and now she was positioned right in front of him. If he could somehow grab her attention then she could get him some damn help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacques hated relying on others, but even he knew he was going to need help on this one. He just couldn't wrap his brain around how all this happened. Was this the result of one of those cursed semblances? Or was this something more? He did distinctly remember a bizarre aftertaste he received from his wine. Was he poisoned? Did someone poison him? If so then who? Who dared to try and poison him? One of those sub-human faunus no doubt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damned animals!\" Jacques seethed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd worry about them later. For now had to try and get his daughter's attention. Looking at her hunched over form, he tried to think of the way to go about doing that. He could try screaming and waving his arms. Childish, but it just might do the trick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could also try climbing her until he reached her ear. If he made it there then their was no question she'd be aware of his presence. But if she started moving while he was climbing then who knows what could happen. This idea was very risky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacques cursed. \"Damn it all!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a deep breath... and made his move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jacques really didn't like this, but what choice did he have? Yelling and waving his arms had net him nothing, so that left only one other option. The SDC CEO gulped nervously as he stared down the enormous heel of his daughter. The very same heel that almost killed him not five minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he wanted to get help he was going to have scale it and by extension the rest of his daughter. The older man felt the sweat beginning to form on his brow as he eyes the large blue footwear. His gaze soon followed up the rest of the way to where his daughter remained stationary. If he was really going to do this, now was the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mini CEO moved in closer and felt his heart begin to hammer in his chest. It was obvious he didn't want to do this, but the situation was now out of his hands. This was life or death, do or die. He cautiously reached out his hand and felt the smooth surface of the heel. It would be a difficult climb, but he could manage. He was a Schnee damn it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Jacques breathed. \"Here we go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached up and began his climb. He stared from the toe section as it would be the easiest place to start. Hopefully Weiss would be moving anytime soon. She seemed to be lost in thought about something. What that something was he didn't really care. All he hoped was that it would keep her occupied ling enough for him to make some real headway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this was going on, Weiss was lost in her own head. Nothing about this made any sense? For anyone else a broken glass would be nothing, but her family was far from normal. There had to be some great piece to the puzzle here that she was missing? There just had to be. Her instincts were practically screaming to her something was amiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas she just couldn't figure out what it was. Maybe it would do well for her to forget about the spilled wine and broken glass and come back to it later. Either that or just inform one of the servants that there was a mess down the main hall. With a sigh, Weiss began to stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis action didn't go unnoticed by Jacques as the shadow that loomed over him began to recede. Fearfully the man looked up to see his mountain of a daughter had finished her investigation. This wasn't good. He'd just reached the top of her foot. If she started walking now then... \"Oh no!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a force Jacques never knew existed, he found himself flung onto the straps of his daughter's massive heel. She must have turned around or something. Had it not been for his aura he would have no doubt been turned into a blood smear. His eyes then widened as he felt a sudden weightlessness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss had started walking!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No! Weiss, don't!\" Jacques pleaded. Unfortunately for him his voice was too small to register. Higher and higher he ascended into the air as Weiss raised her foot. In this moment it appeared as if the world around him was moving in slow motion. Perhaps this was karma's way of messing with him for being a \"resourceful\" business man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling of weightlessness hung in the air for another minute... then time resumed. It was as if someone had cut the wire of an elevator and left it freefalling down the shaft. His world was rapidly descending at speeds that rivaled that of a bullhead. He hung on to the heel straps for dear life as he silent prayed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon he was met with an earth shattering bang. The sheer power of the tremor left his bones rattling. How in the seven hells had his body not shattered!? Shouldn't his bones and muscles been torn apart from such force!? How the hell was he still alive, not that he was complaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weightless feeling returned... and the cycle repeated itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss had no idea that her father was struggling for dear life from such an action as simple as walking. Regardless, she remained unaware of his predicament and continued down the hall to his office. Each step she took only put her miniscule father in pore peril. Each time her foot connected with the ground the man his grip threating to loosen. If let go now he'd be flung off somewhere or worse!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down the insignificant patriarch of the Schnee family could see what the or worse was. There was a thin gap bellow him that he was just small enough to squeeze through. If he fell down there then he would be face to face with Weiss bare foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. My. God.\" Jacques cringed in fear. No matter what he couldn't let go. He just had to hang on until Weiss reached his office. Once she reached his door she would stop to knock and he could use those precious seconds to right himself. He just needed to hang on. He would not fall and die like this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was a Schnee goddamn it!</span></div></div>",

With their son Adrian being watched by a babysitter, the two ladies had the whole day completely to themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked through the city, gently holding hands, they made there way across the street, deciding to start their day with a walk in the city park, unfortunately it seemed fate other plans as the two woman were splashed in the face with a bunch of dust that some person who had been working at the dust shop was throwing out, only for part of the dust in the bag to get blown out into the woman's faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aggh, what the heck was that?!\" Terra complained taking off her glasses to wipe of the excess dust, *cough* \"It's seems like some type of dust blown by the wind\" Saphron said also in a bit of annoyance. The two ladies were about to walk over to the shop and complain to the employee who had carelessly gotten them covered with dust only to feel weird as the world seemed to get bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what's.. Happening\" Sapghron said as she felt her body and clothes slowly start to shrink. \"I'm not sure it must be a side effect of that dust\" Terra exclaimed also surprised as her body also got smaller. Before the two woman new it they were shrunk down to 2 inches tall much to their shock and concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh goodness we've have been made tiny!\" Terra shouted in panic as Saphron walked towards her with words to try and calm her down. \"Wait, don't panic, we just need to talk to the person at the dust shop, I'm sure they know of some type of dust that can restore us to normal\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever upon saying this the two Moms suddenly heard a loud sound as they looked behind them fear as a crowd as people passed by. This of course was a cue for the woman to run as they ran away from the crowd, unfortunately their small size made out running the footfalls ineffective as a shoe hovered over and slammed down on the two ladies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAIT!!-\" Saphron shouted before the large shoe crushed her, \"SAPHR- ACK\" Terra shouted before another came and trampled her too. Upon being crushed however the woman learned the other affect the dust now had on them, not only were they small but it seemed to increase the durability of their body and seemingly made them squishy as the two Moms were simply flattened under the soles of the shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis hardly made the experience better as after being crushed they then were pulled up with the shoe and slammed on the hard concrete sidewalk with various squashing and splat sounds, this process repeated over and over until the two females detached from the shoe surprisingly right next to each other as they look ahead and now saw where they had landed...  </span></div></div>",

She whined to herself as she slowly sat up, really wanting to just fall back asleep. She kicked her blankets back, letting out a yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to the young girl, nobody in Beacon would be doing the same thing as her today. They had all turned into various objects throughout the school,  some of which were even in the room with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she hopped down from her bunk, she was surprised to notice nobody else in the room.<br>\r\n\"Did they forget to get me up?\" She asked herself, stretching her arms into the air. Figuring she was late for whatever was planned today, the silver-eyed girl slipped her pajamas off, putting some panties on. The pleading screams of the soul within the fabric went unheard as she slipped her legs through the holes, pulling them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang found herself in a heap on the floor. As she tried to push herself up, she was horrified to find that movement was impossible. She cried out for help, unaware that her voice didn't exist anywhere but in her mind. She continued to shout as her 'little' sister entered her fixed field of view, she was enormous! Yang shut her eyes as she recognized that the giantess was getting dressed, still calling out to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, where are my socks?\" She heard the large voice, continuing to call out to her sister regardless, \"There's one,\" She heard Ruby again as a large hand curled around her, lifting her into the air. Yang tried to fight the grip, but she still found herself unable to move. Her eyes opened as she felt warm breath on her front, she stared into her disinterested silver eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ruby!\" She screamed, but the lack of expression on her sister's face proved that she was going unheard. Yang felt air rush past her as she was brought down, her panic heightening as she saw flexing toes before her. Her screaming stopped briefly as she felt Ruby's limb force her body apart, the feeling made her 'skin' crawl, it was horrible. Then, the realization came, it kept her just as stunned as the feeling did, she was her sister's sock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sock-girl cried out as she felt the pressure of Ruby's foot press onto her, she tried everything she could to squirm away, but it proved futile. She slowly stopped screaming as the hopelessness of her situation dawned on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm too late to find a clean one,\" Ruby murmured to herself as she noticed her other sock just poking out from under another bed. She slipped it on just as carelessly as the last, before going over to the drawers for a bra.</span></div></div>",

She tried to look around, finding that her head was fixed in place, looking up in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a scream as the cheery face of her team leader entered her field of view. Feeling a force pressing around her, she was lifted into the air, feeling her immobile body flop around the centre of the force. Of course, the girl's expression remained neutral, she hadn't been hearing this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ruby! Let me down!\" She demanded, but the silver-eyed girl didn't listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby quickly put her bra on, before taking her dress from another closet. Now hurrying, she put it on, figuring that her teammates would be waiting for her.

Welcome to the first RWBY interactive shrink story on writing.com! I'm amazed there isn't already one out there! Sorry in advance to the creators of the show &gt;_&lt; This would probably be pretty darn weird if you see this interactive!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, the characters are listed here: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://rwby.wikia.com/wiki/RWBY/Characters\" target=\"_blank\">http://rwby.wikia.com/wiki/RWBY/Characters</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMAIN CHARACTER CANT DIE, at least not in the first couple of chapters, when crushed they just flatten out or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><i><b>A Few Small Rules! &lt;Sorry!&gt;-</b></i></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is just for writers, I don't want to put anyone off buuuuut there are a few things I want to keep out of the story-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. The main character can't die unless specified in the starting text. The default as a whole- flatten out and stretch- kind of thing. Vore deaths are an exception-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. OC's- I don't want a tiny OC running in to save the day- try and stick with the main cast as much as possible, perhaps throwing in a random student here and there without going into it too much. This includes naming the nameless main character in the stories where you play yourself (Sorry if you wished to be female in these chapters, it's not possible to make a 100% blank canvas character)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. I won't allow diapers- it's just not my cup of tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Transformations are object based only! Sorry if you came here for Age regression or something like that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>5. Toilet stuff, fart and such, are allowed</b> but only if you add a bold T to the title of the chapter. Not everyone likes that stuff<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. Try and keep it fairly close to cannon at the start of stories/ try and keep shippings subtle. I've allowed a few arks to go up with this before I made the rule as the contents pretty good but I don't want a shipping war spread across the interactive ^_^<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. No unbirthing- insertions fine, going into the womb is fine, but turning into a baby is classed as age regression to me :P<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8. Finally- small chapters or chapters that I feel aren't good enough shall be deleted if I think it doesn't fit. I'll also block off chapters if I think it's going to go into a constant stream of 'How about this character?' with a bunch of empty chapters in between.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHope the rules don't put you off! Any questions and such, please don't hesitate to message me :P<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Special thanks to:</span> <b>Azazel8</b> for adding many awesome additions</td>",
