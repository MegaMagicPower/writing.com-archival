We have a very special ale today, all the way from the dwarven stronghold of Davek-Anar!\"<br>\r\n     \"Just wine, please,\" you reply. You do not want to become too drunk today.<br>\r\n     \"Oh, come on!\" Says Gorm, \"You're 18 today! You need to know what a true drink is!<br>\r\nWithout further ado, he starts to pour you a tankard of the dwarven ale. You begin to protest, but he shakes off your complaints, saying, \"This one is on the house! Don't bother paying for this one!\"<br>\r\nWhat the heck, you think. What could possibly go wrong?<br>\r\nYou gulp down the dwarven ale.</span></div></div>",

I'll put this oaf in a decent room.\"<br>\r\nYou thank Gorm for the ale, and leave the Tavern. You begin walking home, but you haven't gone far when someone bumps into you.<br>\r\nThe man has to be at least 70 years old.
