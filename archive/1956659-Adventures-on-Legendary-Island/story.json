I didn't think I would meet one here\" said Jodi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have come to you because you wanted to make a wish\" said Jirachi. \"A wish? I didn't say anything about a wish\" said Jodi. \"You might not but your heart did\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then begins to circle around her. \"So what do you want human? Is there something you always wanted? Was there someone you want to impress?\" Jirachi ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJodi thought hard about what she wanted. Then she knew the answer. She wanted Damon. She had always wanted to impress him and now was her chance to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought and always wanted to see what it would be like as a pokemon. Jodi made up her mind. \"Jirachi I have thought over it and yes I want to make a wish\" said Jodi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" He ask. \"I wish me and Damon becomes the cutest pokemon couple ever and that we both love each other no matter what\" said Jodi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Become a cute pokemon couple with Damon? Okay then\" Jirachi close his eyes and grants her wish. Jodi was excited and couldn't wait. Meanwhile with Damon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon continues to look through out the Island. Then he begins to feel funny. His mind was a little hazy. He begins to feel dizzy as Damon collapse on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe eventually woke up. He felt different. \"What happen to me?\" His vision was still blurry. But he did see someone. But he couldn't make out who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good your awake Damon\" Damon could almost recognize the voice. His vision clear up and he saw.</span></div></div>",

But I feel nervous every time I do. If only there was a way I can tell Damon how I feel about him\" said Jodi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I can help you\" Jodi then heard a voice and looks around. \"Who's there?\" She ask. \"You love this human boy right. Well your in luck. I can help you out\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJodi was confuse. \"That's nice and everything. But how are you going to help me if I can't see you\" said Jodi. The mysterious pokemon then appears before Jodi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a handsome strong looking Latios. The Latios smile. \"I know how it feels that you love someone and you don't tell them how you feel. I'm in love with a beautiful Latias. But I never told her how I felt about her\" said Latios.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your a Latios. How will you help me?\" She ask.

You wanted to show Damon you love him. So your heart told me to show how beautiful you are. I only change people into a Latios, or Latias, if they need help with someone they love\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJodi looks over her new body and admits she does look beautiful. \"Do you think this will help me win Damon's heart?\" She ask. \"If it doesn't then I don't know what to do\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJodi then thank Latios and left. \"I bet Damon would look handsome as a Latios\" She eventually found Damon sitting alone enjoying some lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's alone. Perfect now's my chance\" Jodi then goes behind Damon and plays peek a boo with him. \"Hey who turn off the lights?\" He ask. \"Me silly\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then uncovers Damon's eyes. Damon looks behind and see's Jodi as a beautiful Latias. \"Whoa a Latias and a beautiful one as well\" said Damon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJodi finds herself blushing. She then kiss Damon. This surprise him. \"Oh wow. I didn't think I would get kiss from a legendary pokemon. Do you like me or something he ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJodi nods. \"Wow I didn't think I find a pokemon that likes me\" said Damon. \"Hmm maybe he can't understand what I'm saying. Maybe I should change him into a Latios\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJodi then grabs Damon's arms. \"Um what are you doing Latias?\" Jodi close her eyes and transfer her power over to Damon changing him in the process.</span></div></div>",
