Not the Philosopher's Stone; a different one.<br>\r\nImbued with immense magical power, the stone would give the alchemist the power to change, alter and transform everything around him as he pleased, whenever he held the stone tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever; fearing that unscrupulous mammals might use it for evil purposes, the alchemist hid the stone somewhere and managed to find a way to depower the stone for centuries. He then disappeared, never to be heard from again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo every mammal in Zootopia, this was nothing more than an old legend. However; what nobody knew, was that the story was actually real!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only reason the stone had not been discovered before, was thanks to the alchemist rendering it powerless. But now the enchantment was about to wear off and it did so in the paws of two of Zootopia's finest police officers: the bunny Judy Hopps and her partner Nick Wilde!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two mammals were in for a truly crazy adventure; filled with alterations, swaps, transformations and all kind of awkward situations...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how exactly did these two mammals find the stone?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStory 1: After a raid on a crooked collector, Judy discovers that the stone has fallen into her pocket. Showing it to Nick, the two friends quickly find out what the stone can do, but in an awkward way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStory 2: Acting on a tip from Fennic, Nick single-pawed busts a jewelry-smuggling operation. However, one of the jewels is really the stone and when the ZPD can't find an owner, Nick brings it home with him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStory 3: While on vacation on her own, Judy suddenly stumbles across some ancient ruins, finding the stone inside...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStory 4: Getting a call from a construction site, Judy and Nick discover that the crew have dug up some ancient artifacts. Whith all the artifacts identified, exept for the stone, Chief Bogo allow Judy and Nick to keep it as a souvenir of sorts. But they are in for a surprise when they come home...</span></div></div>",

Today had been a very busy day for the ZPD's bunny officer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA raid on a crooked antiques dealer, which the First Precinct had been setting up for months, had gone down today and while the dealer and his henchmen had all been arrested, the sheer amount of adrenaline she had experienced during the raid, had left her really tired. So tired, that her partner, the fox Nick Wilde, had had to drive her home to her new apartment. (A gift from the re-instated Mayor Lionheart for saving Zootopia from Bellwether's plot.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrived, Nick followed Judy inside. While Judy was still wearing her police uniform, Nick had already switched to his casual outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShooting a glance at his partner, Nick playfully said: \"What's the matter, Carrots? I thought rabbits had lots of energy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please; no rabbit-jokes tonight, Nick,\" groaned Judy. \"Not like you can talk; I can see that the raid took it's toll on you, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you got me there,\" admitted Nick. \"But I really eanted to make sure you got home okay before going home myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Nick,\" said Judy. \"But I'm just tired, not injured. You didn't have to...\" She trailed off as she suddenly felt something in one of her pockets. Pulling it out, she saw that it was some kind of shiny stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'cha got there, Carrots?\" asked Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" said Judy. \"It must have fallen into my pocket when I bumped into that shelf during the raid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy studied the stone a bit more. 'I'm sure I've heard something about a stone before, but I can't quite remember where...' thought Judy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, stone or not, I'd better get back home,\" said Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet,\" replied Judy. \"We have to figure out what kind of antique this is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't we do that tomorrow,\" asked Nick. \"Besides, I thought you were tired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am,\" replied Judy, \"but it's important that we identify this stone as fast as possible, to determine whether it's stolen or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Nick let out another groan, Judy began to get a little annoyed with her friend and partner. Gripping the stone hard, she thought: ' That dumb fox. If only...'<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\nWhat did Judy think? It determines what kind of change will happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: '...he knew what I was going through sometimes!' This causes Nick and Judy to somehow become each other! Could be through body-swapping, life-swapping, or something even crazier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: '...he knew what it was like to be a bunny!' This causes Nick and Judy to swap species; making Nick a bunny and Judy a fox!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, do you want a different kind of change?</span></div></div>",

As soon as Judy had thought those words, she suddenly noticed that the stone was starting to glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Carrots?\" asked Nick, who had also seen the glow of the stone. \"What's with the light-show?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy just managed to say: \"I have no idea,\" before the light from the stone grew so bright that it completely filled the apartment and forcing the two mammals to shut their eyes in the face of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strange feeling enveloped the two mammals. It was like they were being sucked up into a vacuum cleaner and then spit back out again. As the strange feeling disappeared, so did the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy was the first to recover. She opened her eyes, but couldn't see anything other than a vague, gray blob. Since her vision was still blurry, so she blinked a few times to make it go away. She noticed how the gray blob became gradually clearer, until she was looking at.... herself???<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a weird situation for Judy. How could she be looking at herself? Even more puzzling was the fact that the other Judy seemed to be smaller than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy watched as the other her stared up at her and then asked: \"Why am I seeing myself?\" It was such a strange question; but it was even stranger that the other Judy suddenly moved her paw to her throat, like she was surprised by her own voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could be asking the same...\" was all Judy managed to say before she apruptly cut off. Her voice sounded a lot deeper than it usually did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Judy stood pondering over this, she watched the other Judy first looking at her, then looking down at herself, before turning wide-eyed and white as though the other her had just seen a ghost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look of dawning realization flickered across the other Judy's face, before being replaced with a look of nervousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy watched as the other Judy looked up at her again and said: \"Is that you, Carrots?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy's eyes went wide. There was only one mammal in Zootopia that called her that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nick?\" she asked the other bunny in her new voice. The other Judy nodded. \"But... how come you look like me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was about to ask you that, too,\" said Judy's clone, whom she now knew to be Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a moment before the full meaning of Nick's words sank in. And it lead Judy to see a very disturbing pattern. The fact that her 'other self'/Nick seemed to be smaller than udual, the strange feeling from when they were in the light, her new deeper voice, Nick now looking like her... it all added up to one undeniable solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing, Judy looked down at herself and gasped. Instead of the ZPD uniform and grey-furred foot-paws that she was used to seeing, she instead saw a green Hawaiian shirt, an indigo necktie, khaki pants and red-furred foot-paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe realization hit Judy like a ton of bricks. Somehow, she and her partner had swapped bodies!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following scream could be heard across all of Zootopia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

We need to do something about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right,\" Nick replied, placing the floor while trying not to trip over his new giant rabbit feet. \"People swap bodies all the time! I'm sure there's a perfectly logical explanation to all this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was bizarre to hear Nick's usual sarcastic quips coming out of her own mouth. Though he was making some sense. There had to be a reason for the sudden change, it shouldn't have happened for no reason. Judy shifted on her own new feet, trying to become more comfortable in the idea that she was a taller and slimmer fox. Being male was also something that was going to take some getting used to. She hoped that they could solve this problem before one of them had to go to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Judy flexed her new paws, she suddenly found them rather empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The stone...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Nick asked, rabbit ears picking up what she had quietly mumbled. \"The stone we found? Carrots, you don't think...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had wished that you could know what I was going through sometimes,\" Judy explained. \"But it was in my own head! I didn't think it would actually do...This!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then all we have to do is find it and undo this by wishing the opposite. Problem solved. Where did you put it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just had it in my paw when I made the wish. But that was when I was in your body. I mean, my body. You don't have it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick checked both of his paws but was holding nothing. \"It must have gotten dropped when that flash of light happened. Or maybe it just evaporate entirely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say things like that! Let's look around, we'll find it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they could both go to the floor, there was a familiar ringtone humming in the apartment. Nick felt around his back pockets and produced Judy's cellphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's your parents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, answer it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you crazy? The last time I talked to them, I'm pretty sure your dad thought I was trying to eat you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nick, you're me now. And unless we want everyone freaking out, you need to suck it up and work out your problems with dad. I'll look for the stone, you talk to my parents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick groaned as the call went to video on NuzzleTime. \"Oh...Hey. It's, uh, it's <i>my </i>parents...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Jude! Is this a good time? We have some big news!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Nick looked to Judy for guidance. She just shooed him along. \"Suuuure. Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Nick was busy pretending to be amazed that someone in the family was having <i>another </i>litter of Hopps, Judy scoured the floor for any signs of the stone. Unfortunately, Judy's apartment wasn't built for foxes and she was feeling more cramped than usual as she ducked under her bed. This entire situation was easily the most bizarre thing that had ever happened to her and it was about to get even worse if she didn't find that stone. Judy shuddered to think what might go wrong if it landed in the wrong paws, even if its only power was swapping bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs their search continued, Judy...</span></div></div>",

This body-swapping thing was giving her a light headache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got back up on her new fox-legs and held up the stone with a big smile so that Nick, who was currently inside her body and pretending to be her while chatting with her parents on the phone, could see that she had got it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick instantly understood the hint. He looked at Judy's parents on the screen and said in her voice: \"Listen... err... Mom and Dad; I'd love to hear more about this, but my partner just recieved a message and it seems to be really important. Is it okay if I call you back later?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh; sure, honey,\" said Judy's dad. Before he could say anything else, Nick quickly said: \"Okay; bye; talk to you later!\" before hanging up.

The first thing she did when she could see properly again was to look at her hand-paws. To her immense relief, she saw that she had her own grey-furred handpaws back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was enough to get her to look herself over. Grey bunny-footpaws? Check. Fluffy white bobtail? Check.

She'd always believed that the legend of the Wishing Stone was just that: a legend.

She knew just what she wanted to wish for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Stone,\" she said out loud. \"First; I wish that when you do make a change with your powers, the flash of light will be over in an instant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Stone flashed in her handpaw and sure enough: this time the bright light lasted for only a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn respone to Nick's perplexed look, she said: \"I wanted to make certain that we didn't have to blink the stars out of our eyes every time we use it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting Nick's nod of approval, she continued. \"Next; I want to have a big mirror here so we can see our changes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Stone flashed again and in an instant, there was a large mirror in front of the two mammals. Judy also noticed that her apartment had grown slightly bigger to accomodate the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all, Carrots?\" Nick said with trepidation. \"I hope so, for my sake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope,\" replied Judy. \"Don't worry; I won't do anything too strange right now,\" she said in response to Nick's terrified expression. \"It'll be a small change to start with. Honestly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick still looked worried, but he nodded in agreement. He knew that his partner always kept her promises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving obtained Nick's approval, Judy continued. \"Okay. Now, Stone; I want to...\"</span></div></div>",

It was almost like someone had poured a bucket of cold water over them, followed by a bucket of warm water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the odd feeling had gone away, the two mammals looked at their reflections in the mirror. They stared at themselves for almost a minute before Nick said in a deadpan tone: \"We look ridiculous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't look quite as ridiculous as I do,\" said Judy, trying to hold back her laughter. \"After all; there are gray foxes, but I have never seen a red bunny before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two mammals had indeed swapped their fur colour with each other; just as Judy had wished for. Her fur was now the reddish-maroon shade that Nick usually was, while Nick had ended up with her own grey colouration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe how powerful this stone is,\" said Judy as she studied her new fur colour in the mirror. \"I'm getting curious as to how powerful it actually is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like the sound of that,\" said the now grey-furred Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, you dumb fox; it wasn't meant that way,\" said Judy. \"I was just wondering what would happen if I were to make a more extreme change to the both of us. With your permission, of course,\" she quickly added after seeing the nervous look on Nick's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick thought about it for a moment. Truthfully, he was starting to get curious as well, but at the same time he was also worried that the change might be a bit too extreme for him to handle. Still, Judy had given her word...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Carrots,\" he finally said. \"You can make a more drastic change; just as long as you remember to change us back to normal as soon as you are done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha,\" commented Judy. \"Speaking of which...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gripped the stone tightly and said: \"Stone, I want Nick and myself to be back to normal.\" The stone let out the familiar flash and instantly the two mammals had their own fur colour back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Cottontail,\" said Nick. \"What kind of change did you have in mind? I hope that you don't want to swap our bodies again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly,\" said Judy with a smirk. \"But; you have to admit, that now that we've had a moment to think about it, it actually was kind of interesting to be someone else, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, maybe just a little bit,\" admitted Nick. \"But, I'm not quite ready to fully swap bodies again for the moment. So, if you wouldn't mind doing something else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" replied Judy. She thought hard about what kind of change to make, before she made up her mind.

She suddenly felt herself getting a bit taller, while hearing a thud and a grunt of pain from Nick's direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the flash was gone, she saw the most bizarre sight in the mirror; her own grey-furred bunny torso on top of Nick's red-furred legs and waist! What was even stranger was that the legs still had their original proportion, which made her upper body look rather tiny on top of Nick's lower body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked over at Nick and had to stifle a laugh at the equally bizarre sight that Nick presented. His own upper body was now attached to her own tiny bunny-legs! And from the looks of it, Nick was having significant problems balancing his upper fox-body on the pair of comparatively small legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the big idea, Carrots?\" asked the equal parts freaked out and angry Nick, as he tried to keep himself somewhat upright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy smirked. \"Well; you did say that you weren't ready to fully swap bodies again, so I chose to swap only half our bodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not what I meant!\" complained Nick as he tried to use his arms to steady himself. \"I want you to change us back, right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Nick,\" pleaded Judy. \"Can't we just stay like this for at least a few moments? I'd like to examine this a bit more closely.\" When Nick still didn't look like he would relent, she added: \"It'll be the last change I'll make for now; I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven Nick's current situation, it was hard him to think while trying to balance his disproportionate body, but he eventually decided that it was acceptable. He could deal with this weird change, if it really was the last one for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Carrots; it's a deal,\" said the troubled fox. \"But, please, do it fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay; I'll try,\" said Judy as she looked into the mirror to get a closer look at her current situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she could get a closer look at her altered body, she noticed a curious little detail; her regular upper body was still clad in the police uniform, but Nick's legs, which her upper body was currently attached to, was still clad in Nick's kahki pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppearently, her wish to swap their lower halves had insured that everything from their waist down had been exchanged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn order to get an even closer look, Judy lifted up her uniform slightly so she could see the where her upper body had fused to Nick's waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy was amazed at how seamless the transition between her own grey fur and Nick's red fur was. It was so fluid, that it seemed as though this was how she had been all her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The Wishing Stone keeps getting more and more incredible each time it is used,' she thought. As she let go of her uniform, she decided it was time to try to walk with her new legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoah; this is weird!\" exclaimed Judy as she took a step. Since Nick's legs were much bigger than her upper body, her sense of balance was off by a mile. It didn't take her long to adjust, however, and she was soon taking big strides around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked over at Nick who had been doing roughly the same thing, with one difference. As Nick had painfully discovered, Judy's lower body, which was still clad in the ZPD uniform, was just not strong enough to hold up the weight of his regular upper body; the end result being that he was currently sitting on his current bunny butt while he performed the same examinations as Judy had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't this incredible?\" said Judy as she used Nick's legs to take enormous steps around him. \"This Stone can change anything we want! Of course, we should only use it for good reasons, but we could have a lot of fun with this in private! I'm actually still stoked by the fact that I now have your lower body, Nick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah; you do have my lower body,\" said Nick with a smug tone of voice. \"My ENTIRE lower body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy looked confused at first, until she realized what he meant. It was only then that she became far too aware of a certain bulge between Nick's legs, causing her to blush more red than the sportscar which Flash, the sloth, had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay; I think that's enough for now,\" said an embarrased Judy. \"Stone; I want me and Nick to go back to normal, please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the obligatory flash, both the bunny and the fox were back to their regular selves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright; that was uncomfortable,\" said Judy as she placed the Stone upon her table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick looked at her with an expression that screamed: 'I told you so'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well; I've had enough of the Stone for one day,\" confessed Judy. \"So; what do you want to do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick didn't hesitate. \"I think that...\"</span></div></div>",

They both covered their eyes instinctively, attempting to save their precious pupils from harm. Yet as quickly as it appeared, the light vanished. They slowly removed their hands, looking around curiously, looking for whatever the stone might have done. As far as they can perceive, the magic it wound was relatively mundane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs far as they could perceive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, would you look at that, Carrots,\" Judy slouched her shoulders, grinning at Nick with a smug grin. \"Your little stone is a magic clothes swapper. What a handy little tool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick's body sighed, resting a hand on his hip. \"We come across magic and you're going to sass about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't sass. I snark. There's a difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Either way, it's clearly done something magical, Nick. That's an important discovery! Something that, as far as I'm concerned, means it gets filled into evidence asap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit shrugged. \"Suit yourself. As long I get changed back into something more my style and can clock off, that's all fine by me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy huffed, crossing Nick's arms. \"You better not stretch my uniform...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could take it off, if you'd prefer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe groaned, already moving to the car. \"Don't even joke about that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy's body laughed. Silly rabbit. With a slightly bigger bounce in his step than he seemed to recall, Nick followed what he believed to be a rabbit into the patrol car. \"Where we stopping first then, Carrots? Your place or mine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure I want to see the state of your place. We'll change at my apartment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick shrugged again, leaning back into the seat. It felt... bigger than usual. But that was ridiculous, so he brushed the thought aside as he unbuttoned a bit of the uniform. It was hard to breathe in such a small thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before the duo arrived at the apartment and trudged up the stairs to to Judy's apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy briefly felt around for her keys before realization struck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dang it Nick, you have my keys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick grinned widely, lifting them out of Judy's pockets. \"So it would seem... What do you want for them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nick, come on, I don't want to be in your stupid shirt longer than I need to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gasped, putting a pawed hand on his tiny chest. \"Carrots, that is a classic. I saved up a while for that little  ensemble, thank you. You've probably been dragging it through the dirt all day, it barely fits you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy paused for a confused second. This shirt and tie really shouldn't fit her... yet she had no trouble at all. Why was that....?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the thought was quickly interrupted by the sound of Judy's annoying neighbors arguing once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm telling you, the yogurt from 3rd street is much better!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBucky shoved a finger at Pronk angrily as they passed the police officers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're insane, you are absolutely out of your mind.

How come you are wearing my uniform?\" she asked. \"I don't know,\" said Nick, \"but perhaps it has something to do with the fact that you are wearing my clothes, too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at herself, Judy saw that she was indeed wearing what looked to be Nick's shirt and pants, only scaled down to fit her body exactly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's not the only strange thing,\" said Nick as he pointed at the wall. Following Nick's finger, Judy saw that their shadows were different, too. Nick appeared to have Judy's shadow, while Judy now had Nick's!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on here, Carrots?\" asked Nick. \"I wish I knew,\" said Judy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused the stone to glow again, only the glow didn't engulf the entire room this time. Instead, Judy's head was filled with information about the stone, how it was activated, and what had happened to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet cheese and crackers!\" exclaimed Judy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" asked Nick. Judy then proceeded to tell him all that she had just learned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" said Nick when Judy had finished, \"The stories of the Wishing Stone are actually real; as evidenced by the fact that you accidentally caused us to swap lives with each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty much,\" said Judy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case,\" continued Nick, \"I have one small request.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" asked Judy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was Nick's reply?</span></div></div>",

The red stone stumbled from her paws and rolled under the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Judy laid sprawled out on the floor, her entire little rabbit body convulsed and jolted. It was like something was tugging at her from ear to tail and stretching her out like taffy. She could hear something rip and tear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then it all stopped in an instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy blinked a few times lying on the floor, before rising to a strange sense of vertigo. As she rose from, she looked down at herself only to find that she was looking quite exposed. Her vest and uniform lay in tatters all around her. It was almost as if she had exploded out of her clothing. At the thought of being indecent, her first instinct was to cover herself with her paws as she realized she hadn't been the only one to be hit by whatever that was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being nearly naked, Judy rose for the door only to find her center of gravity was completely out of whack. She stumbled on her oversized feet and reached for the nearby desk...Only to find it much lower than she thought it would be. In fact, glancing around the room, everything looked a little bit smaller than she remembered it, even despite her apartment's miniature status.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when it dawned on her. It wasn't the apartment that had shrunk. It was she that had grown!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carrots,\" Nick responded from the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" Judy called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would have normally rushed for the door to make sure her friend was alright, but it was for her own safety that she was keeping herself steady. Her head was loopy and she wasn't prepared for the sight she saw in the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she had grown, on the opposite end of the spectrum her partner had seemingly shrunk. He stood before her in a uniform that was far too big for him while the last shreds of her clothing remained pressed to her body to keep her covered. In fact, it was almost like the two of them had...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nick,\" Judy spoke up. \"Did we...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Switch heights?\" asked Nick, tugging his now very loose shirt up his shoulder. \"It certainly looks that way. But how?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething in Judy's keen detective mind clicked and she went down on her knees to reach under her bed. That proved to be an easier feat with such longer arms and her fingers grasped hold of her hunch. The now pulsing red stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Have you ever heard of something like this before?\" asked the now giant bunny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A very long time ago,\" said the shrunken fox. \"When I was a kid from a few crazy hobos. But I certainly didn't think something like this existed. I know I certainly didn't pay attention to rumors about magical stones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know someone who might?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" he shrugged, giving up the fight to wear his shirt and just letting it slide off his shoulder into a heap on the floor. \"Course, if it was just me, I would finagle with the thing and fix this myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out of the question. We need to bring this to the ZPD...I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick just shrugged, standing in a pile of his formerly fitting clothes. \"It's your call, Carrots.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy often had to make the decisions in their pairing. But, in this case, she didn't quite know what to do. She sighed and sat her expanded body down on the floor to think for a moment before deciding to...</span></div></div>",

We should give it another go, maybe it can reset this whole situation?\" Judy said after mulling it over a bit more and wildly gesturing to her and Nick's bodies with her thickened arms and enlarged paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? Ok that sounds like a plan!\" Nick answered with weak confidence sounding shaken by the strangeness of looking up at his formally \"small\" partner to meet her gaze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Judy concured but wore a look of confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how do we activate it?\" Nick asked timidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hummmm, not quite sure. All I remember from last time was thinking what a hard headed fox you were and that you never seem to listen to me\" Judy thought outloud as she gripped the still glowing stone while closing her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she tried to recall how to activate the stones power once again she continued \"I thought if I was larger you would have no choice but to take me seriously, but not only that but if you were meeker than you might find me more commanding maybe even a little indimidating\". All the whlie the glow of the stone intensified and began to shine brightly threw the fox sized rabbit's fingers before setting of a blinding flash once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy raised her free paw up to her eyes to shield them from the brightness as she stumbled backward onto her rear. She managed to hold on to the stone this time but this caused a strange sensation to occur, she phyiscally felt the stone seemingly shrink in her paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was flown back by the discharge again, only this time he was tossed with much more force. He could hear the sound of fabric streching poping and tearing from where Judy was and he aimed his sights there as soon as he was able. \"Carrots! You ok?\" Nick blurted out as his vison slowly retured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy watched in horror/amazement as her body swelled even larger as her rump took up more and more of her apartments real estate upon the floor as it spread in all directions. \"Uh Nick, I've got some bad news.\" Judy said nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick finally able to see was flabberguasted by the sight before him. Judy was HUGE! Now she was big before and Nick hadn't gotten to his feet yet but something definatly didn't look right. \"I think I see what you mean.\" Nick replied with trepidation hoping once he was standing things wouldn't look as bad as they appear to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nick gathered the courage to take the stand and approach the oversized bunny he braced for the worst. Upon donig so he was met with two revelations. One as he got to his feet the rabbits appartment floor wasn't all that far below him and for that matter everything about her appartment was oversized. The countertops were almost as tall as he was and her coffe table was up to the top of his thighs! Two Judy herself was truly MASSIVE he barely cleared the top of her head and she was sitting down! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear Judy had grown again as Nick had shrank even smaller. Judy had been proped up against the wall with one arm over her rasied knee footplanted firmly on the floor while the other lay limp with the pulsating stone loosely in her open palm next to the corosponding leg outstretched and foot strait up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the giant rabbit got to her feet the fox truly felt small indeed, \"Oh boy Nicky, what are we going to do? You seem so tiny now, can you even see over my counters? Ha ha!\" the huge rabbit quiped with levity. Her form rised higher and higher still as she finally reached her \"new\" full height, with Nick comparitively shrinking lower and lower until his eye level settled around her lower abdomen. Now being only inches away form her Nick wasn't quite prepared for the spectacle so he found himself retreat ever so slightly \"Uh y-yeah carrots I guess so. Huh hu.\" Nick stated as he laughed nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her ears merely inches from the ceiling while picking up on Nick's apprehension she tried to put him at ease by proclaiming, \"Holy mackerel Nick, look at me I must be the size anatolain shepherd. This is nuts!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you are quite large Judy especially to me, but I'm not so sure I want to have to look old Finnick in the eye next time I see him.\" Nick stated bluntly wincing at the thought of such a scenario.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or I could use it again and you can police the streets of Little Rodetia, you could be our inside fox. There sure is a whole lot of crime we just don't see in that town, it could really help the ZPD.\" Judy said in a joking tone that got more and more serious as she got lost in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you should worry about covering yourself up first, your not leaving much to the imagination you know!\" Nick scolded her absentmindedness while gesturing to her completely tatered clothing and turning to face away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe towering rabbit turned slightly red at the thought of her exposure and quickly removed her shredded garments and covered herself with a bedsheet. \"You could have spoke up sooner perv.Besides if you hadn't noticed your not exactly decent yourself!\" Judy said angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I know I know, but I'm not nearly 6 feet tall now am I. I think I could get away with it far better than you can. Anyway I'm sorry but I hadn't actually noticed until you stood ALL THE WAY UP! Nick explained while spreading his arms apart vertically sounding truly sorry to calm the behemoth buuny down not wanting to escalate her clear anger further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Nick, I know this must be tough and you did turn away so I was out of line.\" Judy appologized with deep regret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's OK Carrots, what do you want to do? Maybe since you've seemingly figured it out you could use the stone to reset our sizes!\" Nick stated in a hopeful tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah maybe, but don't you think we should look into it first so we don't make a ireversable mistake?\" Judy asked in ernest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could do that, I believe this fits the tale of the Wishing Stone to a T. So we could start there.\" Nick states recalling and old legend he heard as a cub.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wishing Stone eh, that sounds about right. Say I got an idea maybe you could use it to reset our sizes so we don't run into the whole \"it can only grant three wishes\" thing.\" Judy spoke normally until it got to the inner quote whereshe embelished with a silly voice before finishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha, It's not a genie Carrots or at least that's not how the legend goes. Yeah I could do that just to be on the safe side.\" Nick said matter-o-factly clearly amused by the rabbit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's settled then, here take the stone \"little\" fox.\" Judy said with a toothy grin cleary loving this situation, hamming it all the way up with her delivery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she held out the stone out to the dwindled fox he couldn't help but belt out, \"Wow it's so BIG!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What my paw or the stone?\" Judy intriguingly inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well both, I suppose!\" Nick answered quickly even though he hadn't given the stone that much thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I guess to you everything is BIG, however this stone is looking kinda dinky now but you can fix that now can't you?\" Judy idulged sweetly while anticipating Nick's next move.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So, how did this work for you, exactly?\" Nick asked, staring up at Judy. \"What did you do to trigger it again, Carrots?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just thought about what it would be like to be the tall and intimidating one, for a change. It's really strange but you have to really <i>feel </i>the wish or it won't work. Or, at least, that's what it seems like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick pondered Judy's words as he did some quick math. Each wish seemed to drop him at half his size each time. If he wasn't counting his ears, he stood at about 80 centimeters tall while Judy was closer to 60. If Judy made the wish twice, that would mean he went from 40 centimeters to his current height of 20 centimeters. And that 60 centimeters of lost height went straight to Judy, who effectively doubled in her normal size. No wonder Judy looked 6 feet tall! Nick was currently standing at much less than a foot in height, while Judy was just a hair shy of four feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe numbers boggled Nick's mind as he looked up at Judy. At this height, he didn't even come up to her knees! There was a whole lot of bunny to love and the stone, which had been like a billiard ball when Nick first saw it was more like a medicine ball now in his paws. He had to use both of them as he lifted it up for Judy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, Carrots, I think this is better off in your capable paws.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? Don't you want to get big again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, maybe there is something to the idea of policing Rodentia,\" Nick laughed as he tried not to stare too long as Judy's towering form. \"World's first mouse-sized cop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think you're quite mouse-sized yet,\" Judy commented as she effortlessly hoisted what was a giant ball from Nick's paws. \"In fact, what if...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe played with the orb for a moment and was able to now perfectly clench it in her paws. Then Judy gave a wicked smile before she closed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a growing flash again as Nick closed his eyes. Though he was not knocked back this time. Judy had gotten so big that she was able to contain the force of the stone all in the palm of her paw. No sooner than when Nick opened his eyes was he overcome with a familiar sinking sensation as the world around him got a lot more bigger. He dropped deeper into the pile of his own clothes as he lost another half of his dwindling height and he now stood mere inches tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy was doing her own growing in the other corner of the room. Granted, the stone had less mass to transfer over to her, though it was still enough that her ears were pressed down from the ceiling before her head finally bumped it. She giggled slightly as Nick now barely came up to her ankles. The bedsheet wrapped around her was just hanging on by a thread. She was now 130 centimeters tall, while he was a measly 10.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go,\" she said. \"The first mouse-fox.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinnick would be jubilant if he could see Nick in this state. Nick had always given the small fox trouble, now he was barely the size of an action figure. Though, somehow, he really enjoyed seeing Judy tower over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here,\" she said, reaching down with her free paw and opening it like a platform. \"Climb aboard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick swallowed and did as commanded, standing shakily on Judy's paw. He lost his balance as she raised him up to her level. It was like riding the world's fuzziest elevator. From his eyes, Judy was the size of a small apartment building. And the room they were in was like a giant stadium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carrots,\" Nick finally managed to find his tongue. \"This is so...Surreal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Judy replied, holding him up to her face so she could hear him. \"I didn't think I'd wake up today and be able to hold you in my palm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick blushed slightly as he stared at her massive lips. \"Well, uh, I think I figured out what this stone really does. Every time you use it, I seem to lose half of my height. And then it gets transferred to you. So, it's not really a Wishing Stone more than it is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An Absorbing Stone...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy finished his thought as she held up the Stone in her other paw. Nick gawked that it was now about half as big as he was. To think he had be carrying that around like a toy mere moments ago...Now he didn't even think he could lift it up in his state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a theory, anyway,\" Nick said. \"No way to know for sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps...Test it again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to bringing it in, Officer Hopps?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's clearly not harming you or me. And technically we did find it on the street, a public place. So what if we...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick didn't know if he was scared or aroused by the wild look in his partner's giant eyes. Though, at this height, he was powerless to stop her. <i>What kind of monster have I just unleashed?</i> He asked himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was up to Judy and Judy wanted to...</span></div></div>",

I think walking around like this is going to certainly raise a few eyes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt least until we find clothes that fit you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, there was some noise in the hallway. Nick had been to Judy\u2019s place long enough to know that she didn\u2019t have the greatest neighbors when it came to volume. Being mouse-sized, however, the shouting match of Bucky and Pronk was intimidating to hear, especially with the holes in Judy\u2019s wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy\u2019s usual frown whenever the two came home suddenly lightened up as she had an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat if we tried it on them?\u201d Judy whispered. \u201cI could use a bit of revenge on the two of them and them being smaller might quiet things down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBucky and Pronk were a kudu and a gemsbok respectively, each standing roughly 170 centimeters or 5\u20197 each. And they were both about the same height the last time Nick saw them. Judy looked down at Nick in her paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose it could be nice to have some revenge on your noisy neighbors,\u201d Nick started, he still wasn\u2019t sure if he was on board with making Judy a giant or not yet. \u201cBut bursting through the door like this might raise some questions. Granted, you\u2019re still smaller than them. But they\u2019re pretty observant, last I saw.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm,\u201d Judy thought aloud. \u201cWell, if I can\u2019t burst in then why don\u2019t you sneak over and sneak the size for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? Me? How?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy! You\u2019re small enough to fit in through the holes in the wall now! You can just creep over with the stone and catch them by surprise. Then head back with the stone when you\u2019re giant again. Then you can give the stone back and I can take the size you have.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a complicated plan, but Nick could see it working. The problem was, did he want to go through with it or just have Judy burst in and steal their heights? Or maybe there was another way they weren\u2019t thinking of?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had to use two paws before she was forced to drop him on the floor, but by then Nick was nearing the size of her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, shrimp,\" she said, still looming over him but no longer the crushing giantess she had been moments before. \"Welcome to the land of the big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick smiled and nodded along as he approached heights he had been used to before this whole mess with the stone had happened. As he continued to grow skywards, he did the math quickly in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Bucky or Pronk were 170 centimeters and he took half from one of them, that would mean that Nick was about to grow to 95 centimeters, a good head taller than he had been at the start. Despite that extra boost in height, Judy still remained taller than him. He frowned as he finally stopped growing, seeing how he barely came up to her chest in height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw,\" Judy said, rubbing him on the head. \"You look so cute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought rabbits didn't use the word cute...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They do when they're not the ones being looked down on. You're just so tiny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, just keep in mind I'm actually bigger than I once was,\" Nick confirmed by grabbing his shirt and showing that it was now a tight squeeze on him. \"It's you who's actually a giant bunny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to drive that point home, the two's ears perked up at the sound of shouting behind the apartment wall. They both pressed against to hear as the infamous noisy duo of Bucky and Pronk put on their usual show for them. Only with a twist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The heck was that blinding light?\" squeaked a rather stunted sounding Pronk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The heck is with your voice?\" Bucky responded. \"You sound like a hamster on helium.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shut up! I sound just fine! Think you're so cool making yourself all giant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't do anything, dumbo! You think making yourself small is going to make me take pity on you, think again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't need to be big in order to whoop your butt! You shut up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you shut up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy couldn't help but snicker. Even magically shrinking one of them seemed to change nothing in particular about their usual verbal sparring matches with each other. Nick began to wonder what it would take to finally get them to stop fighting with each other before Judy whispered in his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nick, maybe we should mess with them a little more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. Shouldn't we figure out a way to get you back to normal soon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just this one last thing! I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick realized he was still the one with the stone and sighed.

I promise it's last time\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCouple seconds later Judy hold glowing stone in her paw tightly and wish to become even bigger. Bright flash and for her everything around again start to shrink. Her head hit the ceiling despite that she already bend it. Moments her back also press the ceiling, forceing rabbit to take a sit on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"wow... I can't even stand in my flat. It's so awesome\" Judy said. Her long legs press opposite wall so also there she need to bend it, trying not to crush the wall, any furniture or worse - Nick. But it was hard as she take more and more space in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Judy grow, Nick watch in amaze how everything around become much more massive, high. Especially his partner. Fox need to take step back against wall of gray fur. Floor moan under Judy's pressure. It was design to hold rubbit size animal, not three times bigger, and according to math about twenty seven times heavier. Hope it will hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a ride.\" Judy summarize as she finally stops growing. She was big and she now it. But only when she leave the room and stand straight, she could estimate how big she is. She carefully do it, trying not to crush anything. Also she takes couple blankets and bedding. Judy tight them up and make some kind of cover for her most private areas. <br>\r\n\"How do I look?\" She asked miniature fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well... like mountain of fluffiness, carrot\" Nick reply as he leave the room. For now he could reach Judy's knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy knock to noisy neighbors doors. \"Bucky! Pronk! Be quiet please!\"<br>\r\n\"Get out bunny!

Out!\"<br>\r\n\"Yes? maybe you said it face to face?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe lock moan as Bucky open the door. \"I said get....\" He couldn't finish when he realise he isn't stare at small bunny but at her... knees. He looked up... and up... and up to meet her eyes. Judy not even was small bunny at all, she was slightly bigher tham himself. About 180cm tall* but with her ears she looks even bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"listen there. I got hard day today, I'm tired and someone almost shot me during raid. I want to sleep and I got enough your noisy shouting! Also <br>\r\ndisturbing the silence of the night is an offense. understand?\"<br>\r\nCombination her unusual size, almost nudity and confidence completely surprised Bucky and he can only stare. \"okay ma'am. I'm sorry\" He said and closed the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"wow... You did it! that was big\" Nick shout and jump when Judy turns back to her home. \"You wouldn't get problem with them for a long time.

Growing had taken a lot of energy out of him, probably because their body's muscles and bones had to stretch and expand at a rapid rate. Shrinking was kind of the opposite and left Nick feeling very energized like a small child. Judy, however, had been doing nothing but growing the whole time. And growing quite a lot, at that. At 180 centimeters, she was standing three times as tall as she normally did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick could only watch as she leaned back with her head on the bed, now using it as a pillow instead of its intended purpose of a mattress not that she could fit on it anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't be serious,\" Nick stammered at the bunny that was four times as big as he was. \"Carrots, come on now. This has been fun but it's time to get things back to normal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pretended not to hear him, closing her eyes and faking a snore until she actually did fall asleep. She was so exhausted from growing that she almost instantly passed out, the orb still clasped tightly within her paws. Nick was left dumbstruck at the sight of the sleeping giant, now far too small to be wearing any of his clothes and covering his lower body with his tie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't believe that Judy was being this selfish. That rock must have been doing something to her head. Nick sighed as he knew what he had to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta get that thing back,\" he muttered. \"Before this gets even more crazier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForgoing his shame, Nick began his long ascent up Judy's body, starting with her legs. He was careful not to use his claws so he wouldn't wake her, but she was out pretty cold. Though he still froze every time she breathed in funny before continuing his climb. He just had to get to her paw in his pint-sized state and free the orb from her clutches. The only question was if Nick was going to be sneaky enough to get the stone and make his wish to shrink Judy down to size a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would happen?</span></div></div>",

Thankfully, no one gave her a second look as she slipped down to the locker rooms to find herself a bigger uniform she could wear, being 50% bigger than she usually was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she grabbed something for someone 90 centimeters tall, she was greeted by a sly voice around the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see what you mean, Carrots. It's rather nice to be living large for a change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy fought a groan as she once again found herself looking up at Nick. She hated to admit it to herself, but she rather liked having to look down at him. Given that she had been 180 centimeters last night and Nick had been 45 before she went to sleep, that placed him in the range of 135 centimeters. Much larger than what he had previously been at. Judy noted that he seemed to be wearing his own new uniform, meant for more a wolf or ram in sizing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laugh it up,\" Judy replied, adjusting to her new uniform. \"What did you do with the stone anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's for me to know and you to find out. Lucky for you, we have work right now. Else I would take us home and fix this. Double lucky for us that no one seems to notice our little growths. They're so used to looking down at us, even being fifty percent bigger isn't much change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would if we used the stone...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget about the stone. Let's just get through today so we can fix this later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the two of them made their way to the center of the station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was another busy day, with everyone off doing their own things that they didn't notice the oversized bunny and fox respectively. No one, that was, until the pair approached the front where a rather morose looking cheetah sat dejected. Judy broke from Nick to check up on their friend, much to Nick's annoyance who would rather go through the day keeping conversations to a minimum so they wouldn't get caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Clawhauser!\" Judy called, liking the fact that she no longer had to stand on her tippie toes to reach the front desk. \"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh,\" Clawhauser before doing a double take at the two. \"Did you guys get taller?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just because you're sitting down,\" Nick dismissed before changing the subject. \"What's eating you, big guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" blubbered the cheetah. \"It's Bogo, I guess. He caught me listening to the new Gazelle album at work and confiscated it. But I think he's just listening to it himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's horrible,\" Judy said. \"Clawhauser, you need to stand up to him. He shouldn't bully you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would, but have you seen the guy? I mean I know I'm big, but he's a giant compared to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat much was true. Clawhauser stood at around 170 centimeters while Bogo towered over all of them at 250. And even he was on the small size compared to some of the rhinos and elephants in the precinct. As Nick frowned in sympathy for their friend, Judy's face suddenly lit up with an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nick,\" she whispered in his ear. \"Can you bring out the stone again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the last time, we're not using it to make you bigger, Carrots.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't say that!

As she stood, she gasped. whole room around expand in all directions and for her it was as big as whole city. On the one side there was redhair mountain. Judy need to lean up, up and up just to see fox face. He looks massive! for her 5cm height he looks like living mountain. She could finally understand what he could feel as she shrink him to size like that<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NICK! over here!\" He jump and wave her hands. Huge paw come to her from above and carefully takes her just with two claws. After while she meet with her partner eye to eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow carrots... you looks so tiny\" Fox grin, showing his teeth, each half Judy's size. \"Thankfully we are in the one team\".  He carefully place bunny on his paw, next to the stone. \"I think you will need it. just in case... or real wild mouse in the vent\" <br>\r\n\"Thanks Nick. I'll back soon. Just wait\" Judy takes the stone and easly go inside vent system. Couple minutes later she easly find out where the Bogo office is. Sneaking inside was easy. The problem is further.... vent comes from ceiling so as she jump down, she will need to find album plus the way how to get back to vents.</span></div></div>",

Thankfully, her shrunken state meant less mass, even with carrying the stone with her. At 5 centimeters, she was exactly the same height as the orb and yet somehow it was largely light and she could easily lift it up over her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she landed, she put it down behind some books and crept along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Bogo wasn't in at the moment and she was free to hop to and from the various objects laying strewn about the table. She gawked, realizing that she wasn't even as big as one of Bogo's pencil at her size. Each one was like a massive pole to her, which she could use to her advantage. Reaching the edge of the desk, she hung the pencil over the edge and used it to swing into the lock of the drawer where the album was being held.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bingo,\" she said, pleased to find the CD case easily enough. It was unfortunately four times the size of her. \"Maybe we might have shrunken me a little too much...How am I going to get out of here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vent was on the ceiling, and that was a long climb with something so cumbersome in tow. Before she could decide on what she could do, she heard a door open and felt the rumble of loud hoofsteps. Bogo had returned!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her ear pressed against the lock of the drawer, Judy listened to hear the chief grumble to himself as he paced the room for a bit. What if he looked in the drawer for the album? Judy was likely to get caught! Then there was the stone that she had to leave on the desk. Crap! If Bogo found it then she might not have a way to get big again. Worse, Bogo might accidentally use it himself! It might be worth getting caught then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy weighted her options before deciding...</span></div></div>",

The entire office lit up as Bogo dropped the phone to cover his eyes as Judy felt a familiar rush of getting bigger while she held onto the stone for dear life. Luckily, she wasn't sent flying as \"field\" that was Bogo's desk seemed to get smaller and smaller, just as Bogo himself was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopps,\" he called out in a diminished voice. \"What are you--?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe disappeared into his shirt before he could finish his sentence. Judy meanwhile had grown back to her normal rabbit size, though she mean that wasn't going to last for long as she hopped off the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shape of Bogo in his clothes dwindled down and down as Judy almost became as large as his chair. Judging by his curses, he was not happy with the predicament as Judy had the fearful thought that she might be fired over this. In that instinct, she panicked with the stone still in her paws, and it lit up again to fire another blast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy's toes curled as the office seemed to become more fitting for someone of her size as Bogo continued to shrink and battle with his now gigantic clothes. She had fired the stone twice, meaning she had stolen his height twice. If he started at 250 centimeters, that would bring him down to 125 and then to around 60.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly the same height I was,\" Judy realized the irony of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBogo had been a bit of bully to her the moment she first entered the ZPD and used his size to intimidate her. Perhaps it would be good for him to see what it was like from a rabbit's perspective for a change. This, of course, also brought her to around 195 centimeters, the biggest she had gotten so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBogo had finally won the battle with his clothes and his tiny head out from the collar just as Judy stopped her growing. He looked about ready to chew her out until he realized that she was suddenly over three times the size of him. With the stone in her paw, Judy had all the power over her boss, though she could just as easily play dumb as to why this happened and hide the stone from him. Then again, at this size he probably couldn't even get out of the room if Judy locked it up until they figured out what to do with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she thought for a moment, she decided to...</span></div></div>",

Though she was now his height, they weren't exactly form fitting and the shirt dangled loosely over her shoulders while the pants were a little small on her large hips.

She'd worry about it later after she found Nick as she pocketed the stone which was now more like a pebble in her paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, there was a little luck on her side as the call went out for the bullpen meeting.

Where could he have gone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea, but now we have no way of looking for him without risking of being seen by someone. We need to go out there and look around but we're just too big! And someone is going to notice we and Bogo are gone by now. We need a third person so we can go around the station and look for him normally. We need to call for help. And I have an idea!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick crossed his arms, waiting for Judy to explain her big plan except instead she pressed the call button for Bogo's intercom on his desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clawhauser? This is Judy. Do you mind coming to Bogo's office for a moment? And bring two uniforms in my size with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving already ordered Clawhauser to come up, Nick was along with the plan whether he liked it or not. As soon as the chubby cheetah entered Bogo's office, they slammed the door behind him and got the reactions out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Em. Goodness,\" he said, finding he now had to look up at his formerly short friends. \"What happened to you two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat followed was an explanation of the stone and its power. They told Clawhauser that Judy had used it on Bogo to help get Clawhauser's CD back. And now the chief had gone missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can go look for him,\" Clawhauser offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But then folks will notice that <i>we've </i>gone missing,\" Judy explained. \"They're probably wondering where we and Bogo are. None of us ever miss lineup. If you're gone then folks will just assume that you're out on a donut run.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm. That is true. I love donuts. Alright, I'll help you. But what do you need me to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take this,\" Judy offered him the stone. \"Now just look at Nick and imagine yourself bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Nick could protest, there was a flash of light and Nick began to feel his clothes loosen. This was followed by the sound fabric straining as Nick looked across from him and saw the bloated body of Clawhauser begin to swell even bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Clawhauser chirped as he grew higher and higher. \"Em. Goodness!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, Clawhauser exploded out of his clothes while Nick found himself drowning in his. The sensation stopped as the two of them took in their new heights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Judy,\" Clawhauser said, putting a paw to his head then hers. \"Look! I'm bigger than you now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bigger than Bogo too,\" she said. \"I'm 250 centimeters and Nick was 220. You stole half his height though, and you were 170 before, right? Now that'll make you 280.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's over nine feet tall!\" Clawhauser explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're about to get even bigger. Try it on Nick again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother flash and Nick found himself standing in a literal pool of the uniform that once fit him. Meanwhile, across from him Clawhauser swelled even bigger to elephant sized proportions. His clothes had all but been torn to shreds as he practically doubled in his old height, bringing him up to 335 centimeters, which made Nick 55 centimeters tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What gives!\" squeaked Nick. \"I used to be 80 centimeters tall!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The math doesn't check out,\" Judy reminded him as she gathered up the tiny uniforms in her old size. \"Remember, the stone works at only half of the user's size. We'll sort it out properly later. For now, Clawhauser hit me twice with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy stretched out her arms to embrace the change as the stone flashed twice, looking like pebble in Clawhauser's massive paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy's head disappeared into Bogo's uniform as Clawhauser's already massive form took up more and more of the office. He grew beyond anything any normal mammal could achieve in the height department, made even more impressive by the fact that Nick wasn't entirely far off from his usual height to witness the globe-sized cheetah inflating like a parade balloon in the room they were in, which was now feeling more cramped by the minute. When Clawhauser finally stopped growing, all the furniture in the office had been knocked over and he had to sit down to keep his head from hitting the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy crawled out of Bogo's uniform nearby, holding clothes now perfect for someone her height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" she explained. \"Two zaps of the stone would bring me down to 125 and then 60 centimeters, rounded down. Exactly my old height. And now Clawhauser is 525 centimeters tall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How come you're still taller than me!\" Nick exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because of math, Nick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my,\" Clawhauser's voice seemed to shake the whole room. \"You two are so tiny now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat much was true. Neither of them were even the size of one of Clawhauser's paws now as he stared at them from over his globe-like belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not just smaller now,\" Judy shouted back up at the giant. \"You're bigger too, Clawhauser! So, you need to keep in mind of that fact and watch your volume!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oop,\" he said far more quietly now. \"Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy and Nick both dressed themselves in the uniforms Clawhauser had provided, though it annoyed Nick somewhat that even though this was for someone Judy's size, it was still a little big on him. When that was done, Judy asked for the stone, which was more like a bug now to Clawhauser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" she said while pocketing the stone. \"So, we're going to go look for Bogo now. You just stay here and keep quiet, alright Clawhauser?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can do!\" The cheetah was more preoccupied playing with the items around Bogo's office like they were toys to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy and Nick both exited the office and got to work finding their shrunken boss. Ultimately, they would discover that he ended up...</span></div></div>",

She didn't want people to get hurt over it though, and she was determined to make things right now. Even if it meant putting herself in danger to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I were Bogo,\" Nick continued, sounding a bit annoyed. \"I'd want to avoid getting stepped on, first and foremost.

How would he get up there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's more than just the air conditioning vents, Carrots.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick paused and kicked at the grate by their feet. The openings were barely more than a couple of inches wide. And Judy could feel a heat coming out there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The boiler?\" she gawked. \"But it would be suicide going in there with the temperature!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Given the choice between heat and being squashed flat, I'd choose the heat too. You have better ears than I do, do you hear anything in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy closed her eyes and put her ear closer to the grate. Like most rabbits, she had terrific hearing and had learned to tune out the little noises around her else risking going insane. But now that she was focusing, she could hear something scuffling along the metal followed by the faintest cry for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear him,\" she said, putting a paw to the grate. \"I think he's stuck in there!

You want to go crawling around the disgusting vents again, be my guest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Nick,\" Judy said as she looked around the hall. \"Though we should probably do this somewhere private. You're about to grow twice your height and we don't need you running naked around the halls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo that, they both agreed and ran off to the nearest bathroom before locking the door tight behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick immediately starting to strip as he held the stone tight, pressing hard against it so he wouldn't go flying. Once he was naked, he closed his eyes and made the wish twice. Two violent flashes filled the bathroom as Nick felt himself surge upwards while Judy's uniform began to look crumpled and too big on her. By the time Nick was back to his normal height of 80 centimeters, Judy was wearing her shirt like a dress and the pants were a folded mess on the floor. When it all stopped, Nick could see the top of the sinks (this was a bathroom for bigger mammals like wolves and tigers after all and at his new height of 100 centimeters he was still a great deal smaller than all of them). Judy, however, didn't even come up to his knees standing at 15 centimeters tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" she squeaked as she approached the grate on the bathroom floor. \"It's tight, but I should make it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck then,\" Nick leaned over and handed her the stone. \"I'll be waiting in this bathroom when you find him. Then we'll figure out how to fix this. I'm trusting you with this. Don't involve anyone else this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Judy set out carrying the stone over her head like it was a small boulder for her, though again it weighted surprisingly like nothing. Judy focused on her hearing and got to work trying to pinpoint where she could hear Bogo's shouting from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, being smaller also meant that the range of her hearing was also diminished. Not to mention, the vents were sweltering being the ones for the boiler. Thankfully it wasn't fully on or she might end up a tiny toasted marshmallow rabbit. One bad turn too many and she completely lost track of where she was, even with a mental map of the ZPD headquarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chief!\" Judy called out. \"Nick! Can anyone hear me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she was met with silence and the crushing realization that she was now horribly lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy sat down on the stone and pondered what she should do next. That was when...</span></div></div>",

They must have broken into the station.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not a mouse, Fang. Look!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Judy's vision cleared, she found herself in one of the smaller breakrooms at the ZPD, empty of all except two mammals. Both of whom were fellow officers. Officer Wolfard (140 cm), the grey wolf, was standing there gawking at Judy. Meanwhile, the paws Judy found herself wrapped around belonged to the towering tiger, Officer Fangmeyer (225 cm). Even under normal circumstances, Judy felt tiny around these two. But in her stunted state, her fellow officers were truly giants in her eyes. Even in Fang's paws, Judy felt more like a doll than an actual person. Suddenly, she found herself longing to be big again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopps?\" Fang blinked, recognizing the rabbit eyes on the diminutive being in her paws. \"What the heck happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow frantic at being discovered, Judy looked around for the stone and saw its shine in the open vent where Fangmeyer had pried her from. The stone had been left behind and was just sitting there! Judy thought about escaping, but these were her fellow officers who sounded concerned. Maybe she could try reasoning with them?</span></div></div>",

She had been caught and now they had seen and identified her. What would Nick do in this situation? Her swallowed her naked pride and addressed the two giants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, hi, uh, Fangmeyer and Wolfard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello yourself,\" Wolfard said with a laugh. \"I know rabbits are supposed to be small, Hopps, but you're look even more stunted than usual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greg,\" Fangmeyer grunted. \"She's naked. Give her a little bit of privacy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oop, sorry, Hopps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy held on tight as Fangmeyer's paw started to move again. It was quite a rush to be held like a doll, something she'd find rather exciting were it not for the fear of discovery sending her heart into conniptions. Fangmeyer was taking her over to the counter and set her down gently with an open paw. Judy had to gawk at just how small she had become when Fangmeyer then offered her a napkin which could cover her up like a towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Hopps,\" Fang said. \"Do you have a reasonable explanation of why you're suddenly a fourth your normal height?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You aren't going to believe this,\" Judy said knowing she was about to sound crazy. \"But over in the vents there, there's this stone that if you make a wish on someone with it, it saps half of their height and gives it to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What stone?\" Wolfard asked before reaching into the open vent grate and pulling up the red bauble. \"You mean this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful with that! One wrong thought and I might disappear into nothing or Fang might be cub-sized!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And someone else used it on you several times?\" Fang asked with some concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I asked them to! Bogo got shrunk down to 5 centimeters and now he's lost and running through the vents somewhere, only I can't find him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bogo's involved with this,\" Wolfard asked. \"No wonder he wasn't at the bullpen today. Jas, this is serious then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm aware,\" Fangmeyer replied with a stern sense of duty. \"Our priority should be to find and safely return the Chief. Then we can discuss what to do about our magical stone. If he's crawling around in the boiler vent, he's in grave danger should he end up in the actual boiler. Maybe we should check there first and map out our route.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or how about you shrink me, Jas? I can go with Hopps in the vents and help sniff him out. I got a good nose for it, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really want to risk getting stuck like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no danger to it,\" Judy promised. \"You can switch back just as easily. Trust me, I was almost seven and a half feet tall just a little while ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's your call, Greg,\" Fang said. \"I still say we don't play with sizes anymore and start in the boiler room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolfard thought about it before deciding...</span></div></div>",

It's for the Chief...Plus it could be kind of cool to see the world from a new perspective.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy wasn't paying enough attention to notice Wolfard blush as he said that while looking to Fangmeyer. The tigress just rolled her eyes and said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's your decision then so be it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is,\" Wolfard said, tossing the stone around. \"So, should Fang be the one to take my height or...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have an idea for that,\" Judy spoke up from the counter. \"Fangmeyer, can you pick me up and put me in your pocket? Then we can head to Bogo's office.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two predator officers shared a look of confusion but did as Judy ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quite thrilling to be along for the ride as Judy peeked out from Fangmeyer's breast pocket. With her and Wolfard at normal size, no one in the ZPD batted an eye at them even as they went about their normal day. Eventually though, they reached Bogo's office and upon stepping in were greeted by a familiar wall of fatty cheetah fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" said Fangmeyer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My,\" said Wolfard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodness,\" boomed Clawhauser, as he leered down at them. \"Jas and Greg, you two look sooo adorable from up here! I could just pick you up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Wolfard gawked as Clawhauser's chubby paws reached around him and lifted him up effortlessly. \"Hey, hey, hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clawhauser,\" Judy shouted from Fangmeyer's pocket so the giant cheetah could hear her. \"I ran into a problem and Bogo is somewhere in the boiler vents! I need Wolfard's nose to track him down, and I figured you could be the bank for everyone's height until we can sort this mess out properly. I need you to shrink Wolfard down to my size. Three times should do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can do, Jude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClawhauser looked at Wolfard expectantly, who reached out his pocket and dropped the stone into Clawhauser's massive other paw. \"Uh, here you go, big guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Clawhauser set Wolfard, there was a flash and both of them started changing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClawhauser continued to swell bigger and bigger, though he was already so large that most of the growth was barely noticeable save for the furniture that pushed out of the way to fit his flabby body. Wolfard, however, whined slightly as he sunk further into his clothes until they were much too big on him. Once even with Fangmeyer's chest in height, now he only came up to her thighs and looked more like a child than a police officer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother flash and the changes continued. Wolfard crawled out of his clothes before he could lost in them while Clawhauser was becoming so large that his foot paws were almost half the size of Fangmeyer, who was watching the events with a stern expression that masked her fascination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne final flash and Wolfard was now approaching Judy on the floor. He got smaller and smaller and smaller until they stood at the exact same height. Wolfard had gone from his old height of 140 cm to staring eye to eye with Judy at 15 cm. Clawhauser, however, had sucked up all that height to bring him up to 650 cm, or over twenty one feet tall. Even the giant Fangmeyer looked puny in comparison to the planet-sized Clawhauser, giggled in the now much too cramped office space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jas,\" Clawhauser said, raising an even bigger paw in her direction. \"You're like a doll to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFangmeyer wasn't so easy as Wolfard and grabbed hold of the tubby cheetah paw with her claws. \"Don't even think about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Clawhauser pulled back to the corner of his office with a regretful look on his face, Fang walked over to Judy and Wolfard to kneel at them and speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While you guys are searching through the vents, what do you want me to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you're your normal height, can you go to the bathroom on the third floor?\" Judy asked. \"Nick's trapped in there naked. You can bring him Wolfard's clothes and get him back to Bogo's office.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta say,\" said Wolfard. \"It's a little sobering to suddenly have a bunny the same size as you after looking down at them for so long, no offense Hopps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll get used to it,\" Judy replied before shouting again. \"Clawhauser! Give me the stone again for safe keeping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with the stone in paw, the tiny bunny and wolf made their way into the vents to start their adventure.

Eventually, they could hear the sound of running water as they approached another grate on the ventilation floor. Wolfard sniffed closely at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There,\" he said, gesturing down in the slots. \"Look!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were in one of the restrooms down in the basement. Like most bathrooms, it was built for the larger mammals in mind, as Judy had once discovered after slipping into one and even being flushed down one during the Nighthowler case. Though the drop was a long ways away, if Judy squinted she saw something swimming around in one of the toilet bowls far below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bogo!\" Wolfard confirmed. \"Come on, let's jump down and get him out of there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you crazy? We should go turn around and get help from someone who's normal sized, now that we know where he is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey weren't left much time for debate as at that moment, one of the janitors came in. He was one of the ones Judy recognized but regrettably never got the name for, a younger porcupine who was always wearing headphones and blaring music. After briefly scrubbing the floors, he then turned to the toilet stalls and began flushing each of them. Bogo's toilet was further down the line, but it was inevitable that he also get sent down the plumbing. And judging by his panicked splashing, he seemed to know that too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no time, Hopps,\" said Wolfard before he slipped through the grate and dove straight into the toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy was left with the choice. She could dive in after them and try to help them out. But she could also try to shrink the janitor so that she could put his flushing spree to a quick stop, though that might only complicate matters further.

Seeing her co-worker and her boss struggling in the bowl of a toilet about to be flushed, Judy couldn't do anything else but dive in after them with the stone still in arms. She plopped into the water next to them, trying to help Wolfard with the much smaller Bogo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try to pull him up,\" Judy squeaked before she was greeted with the unmistakable sound of a lever being pulled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the three of them were in a massive whirlwind that pushed them off of the sides of the bowl and sent them swirling around in several circles before trailing down the drain. Judy held her breath as she was plunged into a wet darkness that amounted to a water slide. She had been flushed down a toilet once before with Nick, though then she at least knew where she was going to end up. The pipes of the ZPD were a mystery to her as she listened to the terrified screams of Wolfard and Bogo in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the ride was over and they ended up in a pool of the foulest smelling liquid that had ever passed through Judy's nose. Coughing, Judy immediately swam to a nearby edge using the stone as a flotation device and pulled herself out before helping Wolfard and then Bogo close behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopps,\" Bogo growled, that it became comical when he was a third her size. \"You have a lot of explaining to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, sir,\" Judy said, leaning over to meet him closer to eye level. \"We were looking all over for you and we had to do something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and now we seem to all be trapped in the sewers. When we get out of this, Hopps, I am going to have your badge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy winced, though expected as much. The stone was still in her arms and she had to bury the thought of shrinking Bogo down even more to the point where he'd be the size of a bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should probably focus on the problem at paw first,\" Wolfard interrupted the pair. \"Namely how we get out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" said Judy. \"Any exits?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just one. And you're not gonna like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolfard pointed to the narrow shaft above them. It was a mammal-hole cover with a ladder going up to reach it. This of course presented a new problem as Judy and Wolfard were both too short to reach it at 15 centimeters each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're too small,\" Wolfard moaned. \"Even if we managed to climb all the way up there, neither of us would have the strength to push it open.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if one of us was big enough?\" Judy asked, showing the stone still in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely not,\" Bogo growled in a high pitched voice. \"You've done enough damage with whatever that thing is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could always try to look for another way,\" offered Wolfard. \"There are multiple tunnels down here, it looks like. One should lead us out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should find an authority figure,\" Bogo stated plainly. \"The city sewers have dozens of workers around the clock. We should find their main office down here. Explain to them what happened and have them return us to the ZPD.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy gulped. She was the one with the stone and thus felt like the one who could call the shots. Her plan might be quick but might earn more bad points in Bogo. Wolfard's way could work, but would be a dangerous and long walk. Though confronting someone while mouse sized could also be dangerous too. She decided that they should...</span></div></div>",

The already diminutive buffalo shrunk even smaller and Wolfard turned to find that he was now staring up at Judy. Though five extra centimeters wasn't a lot of height, at their size it made enough difference to have Judy now towering over the hapless wolf at 20 centimeters to his 15. Bogo, on the otherhand, had been reduced from the size of a mouse to the size of a bug as there could be high pitched screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopps,\" Wolfard protested. \"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Greg,\" Judy said as she aimed the stone at him. \"This is the quickest way I can think of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy squeezed tightly onto the stone as she blasted Wolfard also twice. As the blinding light cleared, Wolfard found himself shrinking down to the size Bogo had been just a second ago while Judy exploded in height before him. She grew to be twice of what she had previously been, which was still only half of her normal height at 30 centimeters. But before the two shrunken officers, Judy might as well been a giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can reach it now,\" Judy said as she climbed the ladder and tried to push. Though she was much bigger, she was still very small and it took all her strength to even budge it an inch. \"See? An opening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now we're tiny and you're big,\" Wolfard replied as he scooped up the tinier Bogo to hold in his paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was the one with the stone.

He had the easy job in comparison and the poor camel driver in question was looking worse than if he had been in an actual bad accident. Nick finished up early enough and passed the time by looking at the name on the semitrailer. Mumbo's Magical Devices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh,\" Nick couldn't help but say to himself. \"There's a first. A name I <i>don't</i> know in Zootopia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cabin was undamaged, but the back had taken a dent and the doors had swung open. Thankfully, only one box had spilled out onto the street and the driver had been quick to pick it up. A few loose items that looked like TV remotes had scattered on the road, but Nick didn't pay it much mind. The camel looked more concerned about the state of his package rather than his actual truck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...And don't do it again,\" Judy said, putting on her best impression of Bogo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his head hung low, the camel returned to his cabin and pulled out onto the road while Judy continued to direct traffic. Nick went to inspect the hydrant, now that the truck had moved, but thankfully there had been no damage done to the hippo-sized water container. Though Nick noticed something else on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, guess the poor guy missed one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was far too late to flag the driver down, with him having sped off. Nick figured they would trace it back to the company owner eventually as he thumbed at the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt certainly looked like a TV remote at a glance, though it only had two buttons. A plus sign and a negative sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This had to be the worst remote control I've ever seen,\" he muttered to no one in particular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout much of a thought, he thumbed at the buttons. Who wouldn't, after all. Nick absentmindedly clicked the plus sign in a general direction, and that direction just so happened to be Judy Hopps. To his surprise, an almost invisible bolt of lightning shot from the top of the remote and straight at Judy without her even noticing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bolt struck her right in the...</span></div></div>",

There it was absorbed in almost a blink of an eye. Nick quickly hid the remote behind his back, afraid someone might notice what happened. Judy certainly didn't and it was a good thing too as Nick's eyes drifted below the equator. His jaw dropped like when she had busted him for tax evasion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no kind way to say it. Judy's butt was inflating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like someone had taken an air pump and used it several times, like in the cartoons, all focused on her rear end. Her tail went straight up as there was slightly more space for it to be resting on. Indeed, her rump was starting to look more like a shelf for her cottontail. But then, just as suddenly as it had begun, it stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nick?\" Judy must have realized he had been staring at her. \"Is something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow Judy remained blissfully aware that there was significantly more of her down below. Nick to process all that had happened in the span of a few seconds before she starting asking the wrong questions. Somehow, he had gotten his paws on a magical remote that could...Well, inflate people. And he had just used it on his partner, making her more pleasing to the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy looked at him expectantly as he went with the first thing to came to mind...</span></div></div>",

It wasn't right to be manipulating her body like this without her knowledge. But how to approach her on the matter? He couldn't exactly go \"your butt looks big\" without earning himself a slap across the snout, speaking from experience. It just needed to be in the right time and place, not standing in the middle of the street with people watching them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, um, Carrots. Do you mind stepping to the alleyway for just a moment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raised an eye but then shrugged. \"Sure, Nick. What's on your mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her walking in front of him, it took an immense amount of self control to not look down at her inflated tush. Nick passed the time time thumbing at the remote behind his back. When they were out of sight from anyone and Nick was sure that they would not be overheard, he cleared his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I put this...Carrots, do you feel...Bigger in any department?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was the slightest hint of a blush in Judy's ears. \"Bigger? Uh, what do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, turn around. And have a look at that mirror there, looking over your shoulder. That's it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy did as commanded, taking a look over her shoulder at the cracked mirror off in the corner of the alley. Her reaction was predictable, eyes wide with denial until she grabbed hold of her bottom to confirm that there was significantly more cushion in her caboose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet cheese and crackers,\" she shrieked. \"I'm as big as a whale!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'd say you're more chubby in the bottom than an actual whale, Carrots.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know exactly what this is!

Which you should lay off of for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Har har...What we should do is take this straight to the ZPD and contact the owners about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy's voice trailed off, like she was getting another one of her dangerous ideas before she said...</span></div></div>",

Unless you're not into that sort of thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could hear a pin drop in the alleyway as the two gave awkward glances away from each other. While Nick stared at the most fascinating tin can in the world, Judy wiggled her enlarged rump around slightly as if she was getting a better feel for it. Then she cleared her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I be honest too, for a minute?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, no one's gonna stop you, Carrots.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It...Kind of feels good.

There's a million and one regulations on what we're supposed to do in this situation, as bizarre as it is.

Nick, being a canine with a sharp nose, could detect that the clear arousal in her eyes wasn't just a mask. He had never seen Judy quite like this before. Had he accidentally stumbled upon something that finally triggered the stonewall bunny cop? The prude who couldn't even walk through the naturalist colony without a blindfold?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick found the remote in his paws again, aimed as Judy.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Judy continued to keep her eyes shut as a wave of excitement passed over her. She could barely contain herself as she waited patiently for Nick to make his decision, all the while battling with herself. Indeed, her thoughts were something of a war zone. The rational part of her was telling herself that this was impossible. Mammals didn't just inflate. Yet, here it was. The ability to make anyone bigger with just the push of a button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would never admit it to anyone, but she hated the fact that she was always the small one. Even among rabbits, she was rather shorter and skinny. Her parents called it the \"runt of the litter\" syndrome, which is why they attributed it to Judy's need to do dangerous things like being a cop. That deep longing to be seen as one of the bigger mammals developed into something more pronounced when she reached adolescence, like a secret obsession as she found herself drawn to curious things like the scene in the blueberry scene in Willy Woofa and the Chocolate Factory. Though it wasn't until a few months of living in the city that she stumbled across something that truly defined her interest. They didn't have much in the way of internet on the farm, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough careful research, she discovered that there was a society within mammal culture which fantasized about inflating themselves into giant balloons. Judy once laughed at the prospect, until she found it fascinating enough to fall down the literal rabbit hole. Suddenly, she was immersed in what amounted to a secret internet cult, making an anonymous persona and infiltrating several groups for various catered specifics that caught her eye. She approached the matter with the same vigor and determination as she did anything she set her mind to and rather ambitiously made a name for herself rather quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn short, she had become a closet inflation fetishist in the span of a few months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose first few days were intense, scouring the catalogue of various artists and writers who had pooled collective works together in the many unsavory and deviant places on the internet. Over time, she developed a refined taste and could hunt down exactly what she knew scratched her particular itch. More often than not, she would spend her work hours daydreaming of what might await her back at the apartment when she had alone time. She wouldn't dare use the work computer for such activities, after all. It was only when she had become situated enough that she would begin fantasying what it would be like with her as the intended victim. To become bigger, bloated, balloony, full, and swollen. There were several brave mammals she had seen videos of who would actually use a hose in the most inglorious ways to achieve a partial real life effect. But nothing like the dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was for that reason why Judy found herself shaking with anticipation as Nick pulled the trigger and let her wildest fantasies come true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy yelped and brought a paw to her belly. Now that she was really focusing on it, she could feel it happen as the bolt of electricity from the remote settled into her stomach to do its business. What followed was a rising sense of pressure akin to what might happen if one drank a whole liter of soda in one sitting. It was like having a burp that couldn't quite get out. And with that growing pressure came a fullness like eating a very hefty meal. And just when Judy felt like her stomach couldn't hold anymore of whatever she was filling up with, she broke beyond her limit. That was when the swelling started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a tightness in her lower abdomen that caused her to panic slightly until she realized it was her belt cutting into her growing stomach. It looked as if she was taking her deepest breath out, and try as she might she couldn't suck the gut back in. Instead it only pushed forward at a steady and comfortable pace. Judy quickly undid the strap of her utility cord and was met with instant relief as her inflated stomach surged forward a few inches. To the unknowing observer, it might look like she was a few months pregnant. Her fur was tight as a drum beneath her jumpsuit, yet somehow it was able to keep stretching like it was made of elastic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she felt around her growing new addition, she bit back a moan. Her paws traced around her expanding girth, finding unfamiliar curves as she explored herself. The surprise came when she found her hips were also growing outwards, giving her a distinctly pear shaped silhouette. There was the faintest sound of a hiss in the air, if she listened closely enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could feel when the experience stopped, her body settling into place to accommodate her enhanced attributes. It was almost disappointing were it not for how tight and stretched out Judy was feeling already from the experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick looked just as fascinated in the expansion as she was as he lowered the remote. \"How do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy bounced on the balls of her feet, expecting there to be some heavy resistance with so much more of her taking up her point of view. The laws of mass told her that she should be weightier and bulky, but she didn't feel that way at all. More like the opposite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Light,\" Judy commented. \"Almost like I'm filling up with air.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, a pat on her stomach caused a hollow noise to resonate from her touch. Nick continued to step around in the background, looking over his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" he said. \"I pressed the button. Now we gotta get you back to normal before someone sees.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy was suddenly overtaken by an irrational rush of fear, like the thought she might lose something. She had finally gotten to be big, or at least bigger, and the idea of someone taking that away from her was enough to abandon all logical thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" she bargained. \"Just one more press. Then we can go back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. You must <i>really </i>like this, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you?\" Judy asked, showing off her new curves. \"You're the one who picked this part of me to grow, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't you guilt me into this. You were practically begging me for it. How come I gotta be the responsible one here? You're messing with our group dynamics.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Nick,\" she put on the best face she could to warm his heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick groaned and aimed the remote at her again before saying...</span></div></div>",

You know? When we're off duty and not lurking in the alleyway like a couple of goons?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as Judy loathed to admit it, Nick had a point. She had almost lost herself entirely to the rush of fulfilling her deepest fantasy. And now that she was settling down for a minute and thinking rationally, she could look down at herself and feel rather exposed. In that embarrassment, she started to cover herself like she was standing there naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Point taken,\" she muttered, trying to hide the blush in her ears. \"Is this weird, Nick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird doesn't even begin to describe it,\" he replied. \"But the good kind of weird. I didn't think you'd be into this sort of thing. Heck, I didn't even think I would be. But here we are. And it can be our little secret if you want it to be. Or you want to just do it on your own, I would totally get that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" the blush spread from Judy's ears to her face. \"I kinda like having you here. As a measure of control in case I go nuts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we both know that there's no stopping you if you set your mind to something,\" Nick chuckled as he held up the remote. \"Ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy inspected herself one last time. She still felt like a tick ready to pop, but it was rather soothing being like this if a bit strange. Nick had put it best, it was the good kind of weird. Like scratching a particular she didn't even know she had. She gripped a pawful of her bloated belly, letting it wobble in place before sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost bizarre being back to normal, even though she hadn't been inflated for all that long. When she was swollen, she felt bigger like for once she didn't have to worry about getting stepped on in the city. Being deflated left her feeling empty, almost. Everything was heavier again, even if it was only slightly. And it only made the day drag on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat followed was the longest day in the ZPD that Judy had ever experienced, her first day on parking duty being a close second. More than once Judy had felt the urge to go to Nick and find out where he had hidden the remote so she could use it and scratch that deep-seeded itch that seemed to be growing with every passing minute. But she remained professional and dutiful, never once letting her desires take control and completing everything that was assigned to her in her typical speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive o'clock rolled around and Nick did the usual after work ritual. They met at the steps of the ZPD, hopped on the same bus together, and left for home. The difference this time, however, was that Nick got off with Judy at her stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how long have you been into this?\" Nick asked as they entered the relative quiet of her apartment. Buck and Pronk were out on a date tonight, meaning they would have some privacy for a few hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it that obvious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Considering you didn't immediately freak out, you're either remarkably calm and rational all the time, which trust me you're not, or you have an interest what this thing does.\" Nick held up the remote, which he had kept hidden all day. \"Speaking of which, when we're done tonight we should probably done some research into this thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Judy groaned. \"And you're right. About both things. To answer your original question...I dunno. I guess always? But I didn't really know until recently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess we're both novices here then,\" Nick undid the knot of his tie. \"So, how do you want to do this then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy had been thinking about this all day. She suddenly had the power to fulfill her ultimate deviant fantasies right at her fingertips, there was so much she wanted to do with it. To narrow it all down on a place to begin was almost laughable. But she could think of one initial goal in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to be able to float,\" she announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like a balloon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was feeling lighter when I was bigger,\" Judy patted her now flatter stomach. \"I know it's possible, even if it doesn't make physical sense. But there was also a limit I was feeling too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think you'll pop?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Judy admitted. \"But I feel like the first step is going to be to try and see what that limit is. See how big I can get at first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope we have enough space in your apartment then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy appreciated a little humor in all this as she removed her work vest in favor of slipping into something a little more comfortable for the activities they were about to do. She settled for a robe, loose enough not at all constricting so there would be plenty of room to grow without ruining her clothes. As she returned from the bathroom changed, she found Nick waiting for her with his own clothes disheveled to get comfortable. She bit her lip in anticipation of the moment of truth. How big could she get at this stage?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Nick would finally press the button, she would grow to...</span></div></div>",

Just do it already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy knew by now that Nick was just fooling around to relieve some of the tension in the air. She couldn't deny that she was nervous too. They were friends, best friends. But this was the most intimate thing they had ever done together. There certainly was that same level of anticipation in the air. Not that Judy hadn't ever thought about it. Heck, even one of her daydreams had been something akin to this exact situation, only with a pump instead of a remote. Truthfully, she was overjoyed that she could share this with him. It felt close and personal, but he just had to ruin it by talking sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another second of warning, Judy was hit by the same bolt of electricity as in the alleyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer paws shot to her gut, slightly growing beneath her robes, as Judy failed in hiding her surprised yelp. It was a gentler pressure than before, but it nevertheless was foreign. Almost immediately she felt as if she had eaten a very big dinner, despite having skipped the meal to jump into inflating herself. She briefly toyed with the idea of never having to eat again as a balloon before loosening her robe's belt. The speed at which she returned to the size she was before was quicker and even Nick noticed as he lowered the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's happening faster now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Judy said, patting at her exposed belly. \"And I don't feel as full as the last time either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, it's getting easier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" a rather kinky idea crossed Judy's mind. \"Nick, could you do me a favor? Could you just hold the button down until I say stop?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that a little dangerous?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little bit. But that's kind of the fun, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo sweeten the deal, Judy shouldered off her robe and dropped it to the floor. She was still wearing her underwear and sports bra, of course, but it was the most exposure the two of them had with her each other. She wasn't blind and though her nose wasn't as powerful as a canine's, she could detect her own little things too. Try as he might, Nick couldn't hide his own arousal from her as he shifted around on his feet. And even though she felt like a pumpkin with bunny legs, Judy clearly had his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on,\" she cooed with the right tone of voice. \"I want to see how big I can get before it's too much. Don't you want to see that too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick thought for a moment before holding up the remote again. \"Alright. But the safe word is watermelon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy trembled as the bolt struck her again, only this time it continued to splash into her like a beam of violent blue light. It was almost like it was swirling within her before growing out in all directions. She was glad to have removed her robe, doing so allowed for a front row view of the changes going on in her entire body. Not just her potbelly, though that was certainly the epicenter of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put her two paws on her stomach and pressed down into the soft fur as it swelled between her fingertips. In a matter of seconds, she had gone beyond the point of looking pregnant and into the realms of cartoonishly distorted. Her hips and thighs were also starting to see some swelling to accommodate the extra growth, making her look more like a rabbit who had gained a lot of weight in a hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInternally, the feeling was ecstasy. The feeling of fullness magnified a hundredfold, yet despite that there was a deep hollow feeling that kept growing with her size. The hissing she faintly heard earlier that day was steadily increasing in volume and taking a deeper pitch as there was more of the bunny to fill out. It felt like a thousand tiny hands tugging and pulling her skin in all directions like a gentle massage. And it was all so soft. The inflation seemed to make the flesh beneath the fur doughy and stretchy, like she was slowly being molding into rubber as a deeper force within her expanded and made room for itself in her body. Patting her taunt belly, Judy knew it was air that was moving around in her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it wasn't content with lingering around in just her lower body and stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy's feet curled as the air built higher and higher on top of itself, spreading to all corners of her body. It came in the form of her chest looking puffy, when moments before it had been nonexistent. Her breasts were beginning to strain the clasps of her sports bra, which below her underwear was stretching to its very limits to keep up. Three key areas on her body began a focus. Butt, belly, and boobs. But even then, the growing didn't stop there. Her arms were starting to stiffen ever so slightly, all the way down to her fingers which puffed up like she was wearing gloves. Her legs were harder to keep together as her thighs and calves thickened as the swelling muscles in her groin started to inflate too. She even lost a little flexibility with her ears as they straightened up on top of her head and plumpened with the air coursing through her body. And it wasn't just outwards she was growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noticed it when her breasts had expanded a few cup sizes and her torso was starting to look like a beachball. Nick didn't look quite as tall as she was used to seeing him. Judy held her breath, she was actually starting to get taller as well as rounder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inflation process seemed content with keeping her in the proportions she was in as the room around her started to look just a little bit smaller, her tiny apartment seeming just a bit more cramped. The sound of Judy's heartbeat pounded away in her ear, muted only by the continually hiss of air. Her bra was really starting to dig into her torso and her panties starting to look more like a g-string. She wanted to be even bigger, but instead she felt ready to burst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watermelon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick released the button as Judy fell backwards, expecting to land hard on her swollen bottom. Instead she bounce a good foot in the air before hitting the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" Nick asked, tossing the remote to the side and offering her a paw to help her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy took it, noting how puffy her paws in comparison to his. But that wasn't the only thing different when she was brought to her feet. She beamed as Nick looked down at her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not standing on something, are you Carrots?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope,\" she grinned. \"How's it feel to be standing eye to eye with a bunny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm. Pretty good from where I'm standing. How about this then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy let out a slight squeak as Nick grabbed her by the waist and hoisted her straight into the air effortlessly. He had been able to carry her before, but in his paws Judy truly felt like she was weightless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much do you think I weight?\" she had to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were, what? Forty pounds before? Half that now, if I'm any judge. You're lucky we didn't do this outside, you'd go flying away in a strong breeze.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe that's the idea,\" she said, cupping his face with her chubby paws. His eyes were studying her with a certain hunger in them. \"What do you want to do now with your balloon, slick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can think of a few things.\"</span></div></div>",

He glanced down to find Judy in a similar state of undress looking a little smaller than he remembered her being from last night. The memories flashed over him of what they had been doing together and he distinctly remembered Judy being the size of him during all of that. Had Judy deflated in the middle of the night? Or had she managed to slip out of bed and change back with the remote?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't waiting long for an answer as Judy stirred awake herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning,\" she muttered, rubbing her eyes before looking down. \"What happened? I'm small again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess that answers that question,\" Nick chuckled to himself. \"Looks like sleeping it off caused you to lose all your air.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" Judy looked a little upset before smiling. \"Oh, well. It was still fun, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was definitely an experience I won't soon forget. But yes, I had fun. Though we should probably discuss what that means now, between the two of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Judy's voice trailed as she covered herself up with her tossed aside robe. \"Raincheck on that? We should probably shower and get ready for work. But tonight...Tonight I want to talk about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was good enough for Nick. It was a lot to take in all at once and truthfully he didn't know what he wanted out of it. A relationship or friends with benefits, it would require some thought when most of what they had been doing the night before had been pure instinct and sexual drive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she wandered to her shower, Nick passed the time gathering up his clothes and preparation for his turn. They had to wash the scent of themselves off or the whole office was going to start gossiping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time that was done, he needed some coffee and prepped the burner while Judy turned off the water and was drying off. He listened to her pitter-patter of feet through the walls as they did a strange dance, like she was looking for something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, uh, Nick?\" she asked from the bathroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Am I supposed to be able to do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a simple question that carried a lot of concern in her tone. Nick's eyes glanced over to the bathroom door to be greeted by a sight he should have been used to by now, but was surprising all the same. Judy's rump was swollen like a bookshelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, right?\" Judy asked, showing off her inflated rear with a slight dance. \"And where's the remote? There?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick looked over to the nightstand to see the remote right where he had left it in the night before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, wait,\" he said, picking it up. \"If that's here then how did you...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I had a bit of a thought, right? Since last night I've been feeling kind of hollow. I can't explain it, but it's just like how I feel when inflated only muted. And you know how in the cartoons the character puts their thumb in their mouth and blows? And, well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe mimicked the same feat Nick had same a hundred times before on the Saturday morning television. With a deep breath, suddenly her stomach was at the same size it was with one click of the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...,\" Nick slumped down on the bed. \"Do you think this has to do with the fact that you deflated last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. I wonder if I can get back to the same size as I was then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hey, hey, wait a sec, Carrots!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe caught her mid breath as she looked confused for a moment, like it was the most obvious thing in the world to want to be bigger. Nick was wondering if this was a good thing for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" Nick explained, holding up the clock from the nightstand. \"We have like thirty minutes for me to shower and get to work or we'll miss the bullpen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can afford to be five minutes late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carrots, you <i>never </i>miss the bullpen. The minute the two of walk in late together from the same cab, everyone in the whole station is going to know about us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the twitch in Judy's face, Nick could tell that she wasn't quite ready to admit the next level of their relationship to the public yet either. Especially while they were still trying to figure things out for themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides that,\" continued Nick. \"Have you thought about how you're going to get back to normal now that you're like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy looked down at her bloated belly and butt. \"Well...Maybe we can use the remote?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't know if it will work like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what if we called in sick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carrots, you're the star of the ZPD. Now you're looking into playing hooky over this? I don't think that's a good thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know! It's bad, but I just can't help it! Aren't you having fun too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am, and I think that's kind of the problem here. Look, this has been great, it really has. But we gotta be adults here and realize that we gotta keep this under wraps or we're going to get in a lot of trouble. We should have turned this thing in the moment we got it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick aimed the remote at her and pressed the minus button. Judy frowned as her entire returned back to its normal shape and size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right...I'm sorry, Nick. This is just really exciting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it is. But come on, you can make it through the workday without inflating yourself, right? Please tell me you can, because I can't believe I ever I had to say that sentence before in my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright. I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Nick continued to hold onto the remote as he rose from the bed. \"Now, I gotta get in the shower so we can get moving or we might really be late for work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt continued to floor Nick that he was going to have to be the responsible one, though he should have expected it given how Judy was known to behave when hot on a case. But the last thing he wanted to do was watch her get herself fired from the job she had worked so hard to get. He knew deep down she didn't mean to put her career at risk, she was just being distracted by these newfound powers of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick just had to hope that she could control herself and get through the day without submitting to temptation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as the two went into work...</span></div></div>",

At least we're lucky enough to get the follow up to that truck accident yesterday. I've been curious to find out what the deal is with this remote since we found it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick placed the remote in his desk drawer and locked it up, tucking the key in his front pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll keep it from falling into the wrong paws. Now, want to give me some help with the research?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, yeah,\" Judy sighed as she leaned back into her chair. \"I'm going to need some coffee if I'm going to get through this day without going crazy with boredom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, tell us how you really feel, Carrots. Get me a mug though while you're there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grunted and shuffled her way down the stairs to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the things that always bothered her about the ZPD was how it was clearly designed with no regard to smaller mammals in mind. It was cold comfort to think that one day she might be able to inflate herself large enough to be bigger than all of them. Though they would probably never see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she arrived at the kitchen, she grunted trying to climb the counter meant for an elephant to get to the grinder. Then came the long and tedious process of collecting the beans and assembling everything. As she kicked the machine on, she took a careful glance around the room over the loud grinding noise. Surely no one was going to notice if she did a little inflation. She could control it enough to escape notice. She had to master this new power eventually anyway. Just a small one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy took a deep breath and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Judy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden shrill voice of Clawhauser pierced even the coffee grinder. And it was sharp enough that Judy's breath was altered, causing a bit more inflation than she might have intended. The question was, how severe would her accidental inflation be?</span></div></div>",

It was only when he could grab a nearby stool that he could get the full view of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh em goodness,\" he said, putting a concerned paw over his mouth. \"Jude, I had no idea the doughnuts would be that fattening for a little bunny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clawhauser,\" Judy tried to protest before deciding against it. \"...Yes. Bunnies have incredibly high metabolism. You've never seen a rabbit so much as have more than a carrot, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeeeeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll burn all this off in a couple of days.

I'd offer you another doughnut, but...You know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a nervous laugh and forgot about the coffee cups and her whole reason for going to the kitchen in the first. She had a bigger problem to worry about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarching past the refrigerator, she could see a reflection of herself and determine the damage. She was about halfway between her full size when she last tried it the last night. It was clearly noticeable, though not if anyone was looking at her out of the corner of their eye. As she continued out of the kitchen, she determined that she had to get back to Nick and thus get the remote back before someone with enough knowledge of bunny biology saw her. Nick was right, she had been playing too loose and confident with these new powers. She would have to apologize when she saw him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe real problem was getting to him without being seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the bullpen meeting over, the office was in full swing with wandering eyes in every corner. She would have to go in a roundabout way to get back to him, though there was no telling where that might lead. There were some parts of the station Judy had never even been before. But on the plus side, there wouldn't be a lot of through traffic. One of those passages had to go back to the offices where Nick ways. Then again, there was always the vents. Normally, Judy might be able to squeeze into them with no problem.

Plus it ran through every corner of the ZPD, all she would have to do is find the right path and she would literally be right on top of Nick. Without wasting anymore time, she ducked behind a nearby fern just as Fangmeyer and Wolfard passed her by unnoticed. She was going to have to make this quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing her claws, she carefully began to unscrew the door to the shaft before her. She rolled inside as soon as she heard someone approach her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Omph,\" Judy said to herself as she squeezed deeper into the vents. \"Tighter than I thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven that she was mostly filled with air at this point, she felt like a balloon that was being compressed. With her hips being the largest part of her, the cramped space was causing the air to travel to other available areas where there was space. Namely her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy blushed as she saw her typically nonexistent breasts bloomed bigger from the sudden shift in position. She could hear the fabric of her uniform stretch to hold everything together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to have to remember that trick for later,\" Judy whispered to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crawled deeper into the vents, painting a mental image for herself of the station layout. Every so often, she would pass by an opening on the floor or walls, allowing her to glance outside and judge her location. She also couldn't help but notice that the further along she went, the smaller the vents seemed to feel. Before long, she was on her paws and knees struggling to budge through until she couldn't move another inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" she said to herself trying to retreat but finding her new assets wedged between the walls. \"I'm stuck...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy her estimates, she was only a little ways from where Nick's desk was. She could risk calling for help, but that might bring the trouble she was trying to avoid. Judy doubted Bogo would look kindly on her using the vents, inflated or otherwise.

With her cheeks puffed out, she opened her mouth and blew a massive gust of air as she felt the rest of her body begin to deflate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was working!

And further it went along, the less support her own body had until the point were she was starting to collapse in on herself. It was like any structure her form had was disappearing entirely and she was no longer becoming solid anymore.

He raised her up for a moment before taking a deep breath and kissing her on the lips. Judy was caught somewhat off guard by the public display of affection, even if they had stepped all over that boundary the whole night before with each other. But when she could feel Nick's air traveling down her throat, she understood what he was trying to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd strangely enough, it started to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, it took more than a few deep breaths to get the process going, but before long Judy could start to feel her fingers and toes again. It was like she was some pool toy as she felt her torso widen again to be more solid. Despite the air coursing through her body, she felt a bit like her old self again as Nick began to lower her to the floor to stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was finished, the two stood in an embrace, the kiss transforming into a real kiss before they slowly broke away from each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There,\" said Nick. \"Now, no more getting into trouble, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't even mean to,\" Judy replied with a shy smile. \"Clawhauser got the jump on me and caused me to blow up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. That could be quite problematic, especially on the job. The last thing we need is to be chasing a criminal only for you to get a cause of the hiccups and float away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That won't happen!\" Judy said with only some certainty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we need to get this under control then, Carrots. Not now but maybe at lunch or after work. We need to figure out exactly what this new power is all about. And how far it can go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Judy agreed with him and regretted having put Nick through so much trouble already, secretly she was kind of excited. This was the sort of thing she only imagined would happen to her. Now that it was a reality, it was all she could do to not try everything at once, just like her favorite pop song. But Nick was right, they had to know what they were dealing with. She just had to hope that nothing too interesting would happen between now and the time for a private break.

There wasn't even a lost child they had to return to their mother. Under normal circumstances, Judy would be bored to tears. But today, she had plenty of things going on in her bunny brain to keep her busy. Specifically, what she was going to do with Nick as soon as lunch rolled around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoon came and with it, lunch. Instead of heading out to their usual spot in Sahara for Bug Burga, they instead opted to order to the station and have lunch in the quiet of the rooftop. Nick was sure to close the door behind them and block it with a sizeable rock, though he was sure no one would bother looking up here for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Nick, clapping his paws together. \"Shall we have lunch first or--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was interrupted by the sharpness of bunny teeth as Judy jumped into his arms in a passionate kiss. One Nick was all too happy to reciprocate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Does the play come first?\" Nick asked with a smile when she was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've had this idea since you reinflated me,\" Judy said. \"But it's a little weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carrots, I think we're beyond a little weird at this point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My body doesn't behave like it normally does anymore,\" Judy explained. \"Like, right now, I feel normal but I also know in the back of my mind that I could let all my air out with one big breath and go back to being flat. It's almost like my internal organs have all been replaced since last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick suddenly had a nervous look about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax,\" Judy said raising her paws to calm him down. \"I'm the one who chose this and I'm fine with it. It's really cool. But, it also got me thinking, if I'm an empty husk does that mean I can be filled with things other than air.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean like water?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy blushed. \"Water would be fun...But I was thinking what might happen if you wore me like a suit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A <i>suit</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. So, what I was going to do is deflate myself again and you can just...Climb in through my mouth and we can see what happens. Does that sound like fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, Carrots. You being in that state leaves you very vulnerable. I know cartoon logic seems to apply with you now, but this feels like a stretch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the idea,\" Judy winked at him as she put her paws to waist in preparation to squeeze. \"Let's just try and see what happens. I promise, this will be fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was left with no time to reject as he was taken aback by a massive gust of wind coming from Judy's mouth. He stood dumbfounded as his best friend and partner began to shrivel up and fold in on herself, starting with her legs and working its way up. Nick had to reach out and grab her by the deflated wrist before she blew away in the wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know my last name is Wilde,\" he said to the grinning bunny skinsuit. \"But I'm starting to think that's a more appropriate title for you, Carrots.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick sighed as he held out the remains of Judy. Like before, her fur was stretching like it was made of rubber underneath. It felt almost like he could, in fact, squeeze himself inside of her. But who knows what kind of crazy thing might happen there. As Nick began to strip to his boxers, he took a deep breath and made the leap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat <i>would </i>happen to Nick and Judy when he wore her like a suit?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Of all the strange situations Nick had found himself in since meeting Judy Hopps, this was definitely in the top five. Judy didn't even feel like a living being anymore, just a lifeless suit for him to wear. Taking once step inside her gaping mouth, however, Nick could feel that this wasn't a simple empty shell like a Howloween costume. Instead, he could feel a warmth like he was entering something that was living and breathing. It was nice to know his partner hadn't completely turned into an inanimate object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he wiggled his much larger foot to find the bottom, Nick began to feel a strange compression feeling. Judy certainly had some large feet as a rabbit, but his were most certainly bigger and bulkier than hers were, enough that he expected to stretch her legs with his decent. Instead, from the outside, there didn't appear to be any visible distortion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess this might work after all,\" he commented as he brought his other foot inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, both legs fit snugly in their respective holes with it looking like Judy's normal pair of legs from Nick's perspective. He walked around a bit, adjusting to the fact that his feet had apparently shrunk up to his knees. His legs were also starting to dwindle to match Judy's exact body shape while Judy's face stared up at him around his waist. It looked almost comical, like she was a snake eating a much larger prey. Or if Nick was putting on a very realistic looking Judy onesie. From his angle, it looked like Judy was smiling and saying <i>told you so</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can admit when I'm wrong, Carrots. Let's just finish this up first. I don't know how I'm supposed to fit in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer was that his body was supposed to be compressed and squished into Judy's mold. The \"Judy suit\" had absolutely no give to it, despite looking like elastic. Nick could feel his spine fold like an accordion as he pulled the disguise up higher and higher, making sure to tuck his tail in first. While the hips of the suit certainly offered plenty of room, Nick had a much longer torso than Judy did. As he squeezed himself in through the rabbit's mouth, he found it getting tighter and tighter, while the rooftop around him seemed to be getting bigger and bigger. He grunted, it was like someone was trying to squeeze him into a narrowing tube.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt got harder trying to fit his arms into the right spots, or more specifically his paws into the thin fingers where Judy's own would be. More and more, Nick felt like toothpaste trying to be pushed back into its tube. When he was sure something was going to snap as he slipped his other arm into Judy's mouth, he felt something in his own body snap as he suddenly got a whole lot smaller. His entire perspective had just dropped over a foot in height, which when you were already the size of a fox that was a big deal. That's when he realized that he was officially Judy's height, minus her long ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" he had to say, adjusting to the vertigo. \"I never realized just how short you were before, Carrots.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis heights wasn't the only that had altered. Walking around for a bit, Nick recognized that there was a little more 'omph' to his hips. That's when he looked down and saw that his lanky body had been modeled into the curvaceous shape of Judy's distinctly female one. He now had the waist and the butt to match her, as well as the tail which he was able to wiggle around by flexing his own. There was really only their heads as a difference between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith nothing else left to do, Nick grabbed Judy's gaping mouth around his neck and hoisted it up over his snout. This proved challenging in its own right, as he tried to align her eyes with his. Nick's fox muzzle was quite long compared to Judy's and he could feel it scrunch up as the \"mask\" molded his face. All the extra mass traveled up to his ears, much in the way it had to his hips prior. Suddenly, he could hear a lot better as he developed a pair of tall rabbit ears. The rest of him aligned into place as Judy's buck teeth pushed over Nick's sharp canine ones. Standing where he had just moments prior was the perfect clone of Judy Hopps, down to the last hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just unreal,\" Nick said in a voice that was distinctly his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you it would work,\" he found that his mouth moved by itself, speaking exactly in Judy's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Carrots, you're still here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I am! You're only inside me and controlling how I move. But at least I can talk now. Safe to say if you ever needed to hide from the Chief, you could go posing as me for a few hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick let out a nervous laugh, wondering what exactly this new development meant. These powers of Judy seemed to be growing and ever changing. Who was to say what would happen if they were left unchecked, as fun as it was to see things from her perspective for a change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick eyed around the rooftop, wondering what they should do next. He should really climb out of Judy before someone saw them, though Judy didn't seem to be in any hurry for that yet. He had to wonder what had become of his own body during all this. Surely being compressed into a rabbit shape wasn't any good for him. Not to mention the remote was just in sight of them, sticking out of his empty pants pocket on the ground. Nick had a strong desire to climb out of Judy before something wrong happened. This was a police station and an emergency could happen at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next was...</span></div></div>",

Though Judy was being pushy, even she knew that they were treading in uncharted territory here in public where they could get caught and in a lot of trouble. Who knew what someone might say if they caught them like this? Bogo would certainly separate them as partners, after they sent Judy to a local scientist to study what was going with her body. Best just to separate now and they could play with this later. Working backwards, Nick began to peel the \"mask\" he was wearing off until he could expose his true face underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, as soon as he did, he discovered a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the,\" Nick said as he touched at his face where he expected his snout to grow back. Only it didn't. \"Uh, Carrots. We have a problem here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough a careful process of removing the \"Judy suit\" and reinflating her back to normal, the two of them could study what had become of Nick after scrunching himself up into her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuite simply, he looked like an exact clone of Judy save for his fur color, his eyes, and his voice. It was almost as if by wearing her, he had molded his own body into her shape. Even his gender had swapped, much to his horror. And he wasn't exactly thrilled to be pint-sized, though Judy certainly enjoyed teasing him now that they could see eye to eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laugh it up, Carrots,\" he growled, crossing his arms. \"At least you have clothes that fit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick's old uniform was doing a poor job of covering him up. He was sure to make a strange sight, let alone few people ever saw an orange bunny before. Or was he still a fox, only just in the shape of a bunny? It was hard to tell with even his fangs having been reformed into buck teeth. He most certainly didn't like being so short. And he especially didn't like having a woman's body, with the butt to match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Judy replied, covering her mouth. \"We'll fix this somehow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How? I don't think I'm going to exactly be undercover if I'm a neon orange rabbit, Carrots.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe I can go out and get some fur dyer to paint you grey and white, like me. Then I can grab you one of my uniforms and I can have my own clone. Or maybe you can go back to wearing me until we can find a solution, at least so you can hide for now. Or maybe we can find someone else we can turn into a suit so you can get a bigger body, if that's how this works. I have a feeling we can turn someone into a suit if we hold down the minus button.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick couldn't believe Judy was suggesting hijacking someone's body like that, but he had to admit the thought had crossed his mind. Besides, they would make things right once they solved their own problems. He sighed and decided to...</span></div></div>",

I guess I'll pose as you until we can meet up tonight to figure this out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a plan,\" Judy chirped. \"Hang on. Let me go to the undercover department and go get some supplies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick wasn't left waiting as Judy sprinted down the roof and returned in roughly five minutes with all sorts of supplies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first was one of her spare uniforms, with everything from the utility belt to some of her extra underwear. Nick blushed a little at the thought of her going all out like that. There were some cans of fur dye, stuff he had seen a few of the other undercover cops using when they needed a disguise. Nick was ordered to stand still and naked as Judy sprayed him all the way down with the same grey fur color that she sported. His foxy orange glow faded away in an instant as Judy then brought out the can of white spare to highlight his chest, paws, tail, and snout until the pattern of fur matched her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Nick said as the dye dried rather quickly. \"I guess I was always kind of curious to give undercover work a shot, just not quite like this. What's that other stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy held up a box and opened it to reveal a violet colored lens. \"It's a lens that can color your eyes the same shade as mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I hate contact lens,\" Nick commented as he plopped the first one into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he put the second one in, he blinked a few times as Judy held up her camera. On the screen was a perfect, naked version of herself from everything down to the fur and eye color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Nick said. \"As long as I don't say a word, no one is going to know the difference.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy held up another box and opened it to reveal something that looked almost like a retainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A voice changer,\" Judy said as she played with a small knob. \"Just fit it on the roof of your mouth and it should alter your voice to sound like me. Try it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick opened his mouth and moved the device past his new buckteeth before it settled quite comfortably on the top of his mouth as his tongue pushed it into place. The voice changer seemed to adjust to the size of his mouth before locking into place. Nick cleared his throat and asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it work,\" he said a familiar shrill female voice before he clasped his throat. \"Woah...I sound just like you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Close enough. It comes with over a thousand different tones and tenures, just in case we need to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe the R&amp;D guys would let you walk out with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They didn't. We're just 'borrowing' it until we can fix this mess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was about to protest when he suddenly realized he was still very naked on the rooftop of the ZPD building. Judy handed him her spare uniform, which he swiftly slipped into. Before long, there were two perfect Officer Hopps staring at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Officer Hopps,\" said Judy. \"Shall we get to work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's, Officer Hopps,\" replied Nick. \"Though don't let anyone see us in the same place together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy agreed and the two of them split up to begin their work on opposite ends of the building. Nick could do his own paper work in the boiler room, so he gathered it off his desk while Judy remained in her own cubicle. Nick supposed it could be quite fun to pose as someone else, for a change. And being seen as a bunny was earning him quite a lot more warmer looks than he ever received as a fox. Though that might have also had to do with being female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat could go wrong with having two Judys running around the ZPD?</span></div></div>",

He doesn't want any funny business any more after the Nighthowler incident.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy and Nick shared a concerned look with each other. They knew perfectly well that the devices were in fact legitimate. Perhaps people had been purchasing them without knowing what they did.

Though there were less stars in the sky than there were on the farm, she still found it all very beautiful.

Not until she was standing eye to eye with a lady giraffe after knocking on the door to the laboratory. She was a perfectly normal looking giraffe too, with all the right proportions and everything. She just was wearing a lab coat that looked much to big on her and she didn't even come up to Judy's ears in height...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Officer Hopps!\" the giraffe said with more enthusiasm than even Judy was known for giving. \"Welcome to ZR&amp;D! I'm Doctor Hightower, though as you can see, not quite so high anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh, yeah,\" Judy shook her head to remember her manners and took the giraffe's offered hoof. \"Pleased to, uh, meet you. I guess it's safe to say that the briefing <i>wasn't </i>a lie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed! I'm sure you've been told everything already. Top secret and all that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy had indeed, though she had admittedly thought the Chief's idea was his attempt at a joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Big family had been spreading its reach across Zootopia following Bellwether's arrest in an attempt to get a bigger hold with the vacuum of power in disarray. Even with her own ties to the family, Judy couldn't convince Mister Big to back down on this matter. She was a cop, after all, and he was a mobster. Though the shrew was smart. Indeed of expanding his influence in catnip and other drugs using his giant polar bears when the city was already nervous about preds, this time he was using a smaller approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need someone inside Little Rodentia,\" Judy explained as she walked with the shrunken giraffe. \"Someone with police training and that we can trust. Unfortunately, Little Rodentia is something of a tricky place for any of our...Bigger guys to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's where I can come in,\" Doctor Hightower sounded positively thrilled. \"I had been telling Mayor Lionheart for years now that shrinking technology would solve so many of the city's housing and food problems what with such a diverse array of citizens in Zootopia. I think he just gave me a grant to look good in the science crowd for votes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he does that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm sure I've already proven the fruits of my labor. I find I save a bundle being rabbit sized on rent and groceries!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I will be able to grow back to normal...Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" replied the giraffe as she climbed up to a much larger stool to the computer. \"It's all perfectly safe and I've been on every end of the spectrum just to be sure you're no test bunny. Who knows? Maybe when this is all done, I could bump you up a bit so you don't get picked on as much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy could only imagine the look on Nick's face if she suddenly walked into work bigger than he was. \"We'll see about that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, let's begin then shall we?\" the doctor began typing into her computer. \"How tall are you exactly in centimeters?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"81.3.\" Judy had been asked to measure herself before hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And without the ears?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"60.5.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe talks of size measurements continued as Judy fidgeted nervously in place. It slowly occurred to her that this was real. She was really going to be shrunk down to the size of a mouse to infiltrate Mister Big's operation. It was almost like science fiction. Mammals didn't just shrink It was bizarre and...Kind of exciting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor finished up her notes and fiddled with a machine on her desk that hummed. Judy spied a green liquid filling a small glass vial before Hightower produced a syringe and sucked out an exact amount, measuring twice before nodding to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slid up your arm, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy did as commanded as the giraffe hopped onto the floor and injected her with the substance. Judy winced for a moment before she felt a cooling sensation run through her veins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now the goal is to bring you to about 15 centimeters,\" explained the doctor. \"The height of an average rat. But this process isn't an exact science yet, so you may be a little over or under.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How will this work, exactly?\" Judy asked, rubbing at the injection spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you see, that serum I just injected you with...\"</span></div></div>",

It's also similar to how if you keep a goldfish in a larger bowl, it will grow bigger than if you keep it in a tiny tank.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that makes sense,\" Judy replied as there was a cold feeling running through her veins now. \"I feel funny...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the serum working its way through your body. It doesn't happen all at once, you see. It needs some time to spread to every corner, so it will take about a week to leave your system. In the meantime, I recommend taking it easy before then. Like I said, this is not an exact science. You may end up bigger or smaller than intended. From there, I will distill the growth serum to bring you back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I do mean take it easy! I've heard about your antic from Chief Bogo himself. Your body is going to be going through some drastic changes and you might be in danger of wearing yourself out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Nick was along to pick Judy up from the laboratory shortly after Judy had been discharged with a few vitamins to keep up her body's strength during the process. Nick brought his sense of humor with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, this is actually legitimate?\" he asked. \"You don't look any shorter, Carrots.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She said it should take a week and I should measure myself in an hour to confirm that it's working. Then it's just a matter of waiting a week if all goes well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it? Sounds all too easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the hard part is going to be going undercover once I'm there. Don't suppose Finnick has any disguises I could use to pretend to be a mouse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, I'm sure we'll come up with something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy was glad Nick was there as she could feel the serum working its way through her body. It was a cold sensation that burned at her veins, it was hard to know if that was normal or not. If she was going to be cut to a fourth of her size, it was nice to know she at least hard her partner at her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBogo allowed for Judy to go straight home for the rest of the day with her being on desk duty until she couldn't be working.

Judy had heard of the spine decompressing over the course of the day before, but this was different. Now that she really focused, she could feel that her clothes felt slightly bigger. Her uniform, which was normally skintight and hugged her body perfectly was now a little bit loose in some areas. And there was a weird tingle running through her veins. Followed by the itch of excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is amazing,\" she said, going to the closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're taking this a lot better than I would, Carrots,\" Nick said as he watched her dig through a box. \"I'd be freaking out at the prospect of shrinking away into nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't work like that,\" Judy answered. \"And the doctor said it can easily be reversed at any time. So, might as well enjoy it while I can!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled out some clothes sent from home. Judy had asked her parents ahead of time to send her a bunch of old outfits from all her sisters of various ages, she didn't tell them that she would be the one wearing. After all, didn't need them freaking out over this latest new mission. It was just nice to be prepared for being a various sizes she hadn't been since she was a kid as she pulled out a small dress meant for a bunny two years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should get to work though,\" Judy said. \"Planning who I'm going to have to investigate when the real mission begins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plan? Bogo said you should take the day off. Don't you feel tired? You just shrunk over a centimeters, Carrots.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel fine, Nick,\" Judy shooed away his concern. \"Come on, I'd like to get this done before I'm too small to hold a pencil.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the two of them got to work mapping out Judy's apartment into her new workspace and then set to work on getting leads Judy could infiltrate once mouse sized. They worked through the morning and into the afternoon. Before long it was approaching dinner as their stomach grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy had been sitting in her chair the whole time, but she was certain she had shrunk some more. Her uniform was now rather limp on her as she stood up to approach the wall for a measurement before the pair went out to get some dinner.

The line from that afternoon now seemed so much further away than before as it now stretched high above the top of her head. And the line showing her original height she now had to stand up on her tippy toes to reach. It occurred to her that this was <i>really </i>happening. Her body was getting smaller and smaller and her clothes only proved it. Her once skintight suit was now beginning to feel quite limp over her neck and her gloves were starting to slip off her paws. She felt more like a kit wearing her parent's clothes than an actual police officer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding on her toes, however, had left her with a strange sense of vertigo as she stumbled backwards straight into Nick's arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful now, Carrots.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything in her room was now starting to feel just a tiny bit bigger. Three centimeters in total for a day wasn't a lot in the grand scheme of heights, but it was a lot when your normal height was around sixty centimeters. Five percent. Judy Hopps was now five percent smaller than she had been that morning. And that meant everything around her felt five percent bigger, no matter how much she tried to convince her brain that it was actually her getting smaller. Her clothes felt bigger. Her chair felt bigger. Even Nick, who had always been taller than her at around 80 centimeters, felt bigger. Though he was very delicate in how he held her, even moreso than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" Judy apologized as she got to her own feet. \"It's just...Wow. I haven't been this short since...High school, at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you are starting to look smaller now, I'll admit. Don't you think this is a good time to take your vitamins like the doctor ordered?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a minute, I just had an idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy hopped over to the closet, letting her much-too-large belt and boots fall to the floor before searching around for a specific pair of clothes she had requested from her parents. With them in paw, she then entered the bathroom to change in privacy. She stepped out of her uniform with the thought that one day, she might be able to fill it completely again as she turned to her new outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I look?\" Judy said as she stepped out of the bathroom fully changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was wearing a pair of jeans and T-shirt from her freshman year of high school. And though they were still a little tight on her, they were a much better fit than her uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Young,\" Nick admitted with his arms crossed. \"Funny what a change in wardrobe can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're one to talk with your gaudy shirts, slick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough of that. It's time to take your vitamins, little lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, Judy might chastise Nick for calling her little. But knowing now that her height was something she could control, it wasn't so bad. In fact, the prospect of getting even smaller around Nick was...A little exciting, though Judy shook that thought off and accepted the vitamins from Nick before swallowing. Even these were starting to feel a little bigger in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then,\" Nick said. \"Dinner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDinner would be interesting though as the two made their way downtown towards their usual favorite spot, a nice place that catered to both predators and prey equally. Though things would make it so it wasn't a completely quiet dinner as during the meal...</span></div></div>",

How goes the progression with the serum?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's just it Doctor Hightower. The serum was working. I had lost about five percent of my height before we went out for dinner. And then...I just starting growing back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Growing back,\" Hightower blinked a few times before shaking her head. \"Nonsense. The serum should slowly run its course over the week and your body should settle at fifteen centimeters, plus or minus two for margin of error.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that didn't happen and I'm back to normal height now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Preposterous. Come here, step on this scale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy did as was told as the shrunken giraffe struggled with the measuring scale, getting it even with Judy's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see? You are precisely 60.5 centimeters tall. And according to your record from this morning...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHightower crawled up her chair and gathered Judy's folder left there. As she started flipping through it, her face sunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You were precisely 60.5 centimeters before beginning the procedure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy frowned. She had been all sorts of excited when this was all going according to plan and the doctor had some form of control. But now it felt like they were playing with something a little dangerous as Hightower leapt onto the floor and began pacing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How bizarre. Whenever I've tested it on myself, the process was perfect. How could this be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it has something to do with her biology?\" Nick asked from the corner of the office. \"After all, rabbits are different from giraffe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps,\" Hightower said, examining Judy a little closer. \"Your body appears to be fighting off the serum entirely though, rejecting the effects and returning you back to your normal size. It's dispelling the serum to boot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can find out. If you give me several months, I can do enough research with some helpful samples from you to--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Several months?\" Judy squeaked. \"Doctor, our plan for this operation is in a week! It could take years before another opportunity presents itself with Mister Big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case, then I suppose I can propose alternatives. Though I should warn you, they will be dangerous and untested. I won't say it will be impossible to return you to normal. Nothing is impossible in Zootopia, after all. But we're venturing into unknown territory here. I can't make any promises that it will be a flawless experiment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy gulped. \"What do you have in mind then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's see here...\"</span></div></div>",

About how long would you say did it take for the shrinking effects to wear off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick and Judy glanced at each other before she answered her. \"From morning till evening, so about eight hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eight hours with about five percent of your initial height,\" Hightower muttered to herself as she hopped up onto her computer and began typing at the oversized keyboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy watched a series of mathematical equations flash across the screen with super quick calculations being done to determine how much serum she would need. There was a generated graphic of a rabbit her size, only to watch it slowly shrink in eight hour increments over the course of a week until she was about 15 centimeters tall. Then Hightower pushed a button which caused a machine next to her computer to whirl before it began to fill up a series of twenty or so syringes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then,\" Hightower as she collected the serums in a plastic bag. \"I want you to take one of these every eight hours, every time your body starts to grow back. In theory, we can fight the growth effect your body has a result.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that dangerous?\" Nick asked. \"That many drugs being pumped into her body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is. But as you said, there's no other choice for your mission, I'm afraid. I'm sorry, but this is the best I can do without further research. I don't know what will happen exactly. In theory, you should keep shrinking with every dose and grow back when you stop taking it. It's also possible your body may adapt to the serum and start producing it naturally. Or maybe you'll simply become immune to it. Who can say? The choice is up to you, Officer Hopps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHightower handed Judy the plastic bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will say,\" Hightower admitted. \"That I would like for you to return here tomorrow if you decide to go through with it. That will allow me to observe the effects.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you say, Carrots?\" asked Nick. \"I wouldn't do it but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we don't have a choice,\" Judy said, clutching the bag which contained the drug which might decide her fate. \"I'll do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Splendid. Record your results before you begin. You may wish to wait until going to sleep, that should span the whole eight hours. I'm very curious to see what the outcome will be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did any of them know, that outcome would be...</span></div></div>",

True, she was never the largest rabbit to begin with and the serum was only making her shorter, but no would blink an eye at a tiny bunny. And there was a bigger surprise that came following dinner being served to her. The jeans she had been wearing now had a slight give to them around her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me a moment,\" she said to Nick before she could eat her steamed carrots and brussel sprouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy quietly slipped into the women's bathroom, which was an all mammal's sized space that didn't help with her feeling small to begin with as she passed by the giant toilet stalls and approached the wall. She pulled out a measuring tape from her pocket, having thought ahead to bring it with her in case of an emergency. She pressed her back against the wall and marked it with her height before taking the tape out to number the size. Her toes curled as she read the count.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n56.8. She had shrunk half a centimeter over the course of waiting for dinner. No wonder these clothes were fitting better on her. Those vitamins she swallowed must have provided her body with a much needed boost to accelerate the serum's job. Giddy at the thought, she couldn't wait to see how much smaller she'd be upon waking up tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Judy hopped out of the bathroom, however, she bumped right into someone she didn't expect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finnick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little fennec fox growled slightly, though from Judy's eyes he wasn't quite as little anymore. It was almost like he had a growth spurt, no longer lingering around the height of Judy's waist and closer more to her belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rabbit cop,\" Finnick replied before he gave her a look over. \"Why are you smaller?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you smaller?\" he repeated. \"Don't you'd think I'd notice? If you are as short as I am, you tend to pay attention to those around you and their height. And you're not the height you're supposed to be, so what gives?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy thought about a lie she could tell before she remembered something Nick mentioned before. About Finnick being useful to them for the mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" she said. \"You got me. It's for an undercover case. They're shrinking me down to the size of a mouse and having me pose as one so I can get some dirt on Mister Big. I took a new serum that allows for me to get smaller over a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're joking,\" Finnick let out half a laugh. \"You'd serious let them shrink like some test bunny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a test bunny, it's perfectly safe. And there's a growth serum to get me back to normal when this case is over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinnick's eyes widened at that as Judy sighed and lowered her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" she continued. \"The reason I'm telling you this is so that you can help us. You're good at disguises, right? Remember the 'toot toot?'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I remember...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you can help us out there then I promise to make it worth your while in some way. Just ask for anything, and I'll see what I can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinnick thought for a long minute before sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll help you. But on the condition that you do something for me with this little serum of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy flinched but she supposed she couldn't be surprised by that. \"That depends on how dangerous you're being with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing dangerous, rabbit. I just want...\"</span></div></div>",

It's for...A friend of mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean Nick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not <i>that </i>kind of friend, rabbit...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" it took Judy a whole five heartbeats to realize what Finnick meant. \"Oooh. Oh, Finnick, I had no idea you were seeing someone. Does Nick know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He doesn't. And I'd like it to stay that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinnick sighed as he leaned against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, you'll probably realize soon enough that there are complications when it comes to being of the smaller size in this city. Love life is just one of those things. I've never been tall, even as far as fennec foxes go. And the lady I've been seeing...Well, she's not a fox I can tell you that much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my,\" Judy put a paw to her mouth but then smiled. \"Well, that's still great! I'm sure she's wonderful for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is,\" Finnick smiled only slightly. \"Just some problems in the bedroom, if you know what I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Judy's blush could be felt going all the way up her ears. \"Yes, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If there was a way to bring her more to my size, even for a short while, then I would do whatever you needed me to do. No questions asked. You need to look like a mouse, I'll work out a disguise for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll talk to the doctor about it tomorrow and give you a text,\" Judy offered Finnick her paw. \"Just get her exact measurements and I'll get you the serum needed to make her your height.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinnick sighed for a moment before accepting her paws. The deal was made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy filled Nick in on her agreement with Finnick, leaving out the detail about his mysterious significant other. The two enjoyed the remains of their dinner and headed back to Judy's apartment where they planned for the rest of the evening before pulling out Nick's laptop to watch a movie. It had been decided that Nick would stay with Judy until the serum had run it's course, just to be safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was time for bed and the movie was over, Judy stretched only to find that her T-shirt was sliding down her shoulder slightly. And the jeans felt like they needed a belt to go with them. The outfit which had fit her so comfortably at dinner now was beginning to feel like it had outgrown her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, everything was starting to feel slightly bigger in her apartment. Her legs had to reach just a little bit further down to touch the floor. A glass of water was now bigger in her paws and filled her up more. She hadn't even eaten as much as she usually did during dinner, though she forced it down for the extra vitamins to fuel the serum. As Judy walked up against the wall, she could see the line from earlier that evening hover over her as Nick did the measurements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"55.1 centimeters,\" he said, doing the math in his head. \"You're almost 9% smaller than you were when you started the day, Carrots.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo prove that point, as she gathered up some pajamas borrowed from her sisters just starting freshman year in high school, Judy also brought her old uniform into the bathroom with her to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Judy stepped into the dark blue pants and threw over the light blue shirt she had worn that very morning, she couldn't help but laugh at the rabbit staring back at her in the mirror. The uniform was typically skintight but now she truly looked like a little kid trying to be a police officer. And she could almost feel her body compressing and shrinking with every passing minute. It was almost like a gentle pressure all around her and she was being squeezed into a smaller and smaller box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pajamas were more fitting, fuzzy pink pants combined with the T-shirt she had worn at dinner. Judy had to stand on her tippy toes to see the mirror over the sink before she smiled satisfied at herself. To say she found all of this shrinking business thrilling would be an understatement. Though she was being diminished, she felt empowered to have control over her own size like this. As she hopped into bed, having to leap a little higher than usual, she wished Nick good night as he slept on the floor in a sleeping bag and stared up at the ceiling smiling. Even while lying in bed, she could feel the slight compression of her skin and the gentlest tickling of her fur as her body continued shrinking through the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe almost couldn't fall asleep out of the excitement of how much smaller she'd be when she woke up, resisting every temptation to stand up and measure herself against the wall. When she finally did pass out, she woke up in the morning to find...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Judy finally opened to eyes for the sunrise, she didn't move at first. The blankets on top of her felt a good deal heavier than they had the night before. Her clothes also felt weightless, almost like she wasn't wearing any of them at all or they had gotten too big in the process. As she rolled over in bed, she discovered it was the later as her T-shirt was now limping entirely off her shoulder. And, as she sat up, her pajamas and panties now dangled off of her waist. Judy found that with her feet dangling off the bed, they could no longer even reach the ground. Holding her breath, Judy dropped to the floor to take her first step into a much larger world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompared to yesterday, it was like someone had scaled her apartment up a few sizes. No longer could she see over the dresser in the corner nor would any of those clothes fit her. It was a long process to convince her brain that nothing was bigger, it was she that was smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over Nick's empty sleeping bag and towards the wall with markings proved it. Judy grabbed the nearby pencil on the desk, now feeling significantly larger in her paws and not because she had to stand on her toes to reach over the desk, and shuffled over to the measuring wall while trying to keep herself decent. She was practically swimming in her own clothes. Pressing her back against the wall, she marked herself only to discover that this morning's marking was a whole head shorter than when she had started. In fact, it was a decent sized jump too from the markings the night before, though everything appeared on track.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when her apartment door jiggled open and in walked a massive fox with two cups of coffee and a bag containing breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, Carrot--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick paused at the sight of her as Judy nervously waved at him in her shrunken state, letting her pants fall to the floor. Nick looked so much more imposing at this height and Judy felt a little exposed, but in a good way. Her stomach growled, interrupting the awkward moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" she said. \"Safe to say I'm hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"51.4 centimeters,\" said Doctor Hightower. \"That means in exactly 24 hours, you've lost 15% of your height.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy happily munched on a bagel that was 15% larger in her mouth as she sat at a stool. One obvious benefit of getting small was that there came a larger amount of food with every serving. Today she was so short that she had to finally wear full on kids clothes, donned in overalls and a pink shirt that hadn't fit her since the start of middle school but were now comfortable on her. Even the people they passed on the way to the doctor's office seemed to look at her as almost a child before they took a second look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the corner of the lab, the doctor remained at the same stature from the day before as she typed at her oversized computer and talked out loud while she worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good,\" she said. \"Very, very good. Your body is taking to the serum nicely. You're on track to be about...10 centimeters tall. A little shorter than the original goal. But what can you do when this isn't an exact science yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy already felt small enough, she couldn't even imagine what it would be like to be a fifth of her current diminished size. Her toes curled with excitement as Hightower finished with her diagnostics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The process continues steady for five days,\" Hightower explained. \"Then it slows down on the sixth day to about half. Then the seventh day it stops and your body needs a moment to rest. That means at this time tomorrow--stand for a moment please--you will be about this high.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHightower put a hoof to just under Judy's chin as the rabbit swallowed. This morning had already been such a rush in adjustment. She couldn't imagine what it was going to be like doing it every time she woke up for the next four days. That thought was exciting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any questions?\" Hightowered concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy averted her gaze for a moment before jumping into the question on her mind. \"Is it normal to be so...Giddy waking up like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your body is adjusting to the serum by offering your brain dopamine to assure it that nothing is wrong. You have feel like the world around you is growing larger and not you getting smaller. That's because your brain is having a hard time keeping up. Your body is supposed to grow after all, not shrink. So it's completely normal to feel giddy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good then,\" Judy sighed a little. As weird as it was to shrink, it was nice to know everything was going to plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may also experience feelings of arousal, all perfectly normal too. I'd recommend even indulging in them. Sexual activity might prove to be an excellent stimulus, self administration or with a partner. It is rather kinky too, in laymen's terms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy blushed at that thought, though it did make her remember something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One last question. I promised a friend a favor for a favor. I know this is all supposed to be top secret but...Do you think you'd be able to administer the serum to a willing friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHightower's eyes lit up. \"You mean a new test subject?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I wouldn't call them tha--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly,\" she said, immediately turning to her computer. \"If I'm to go forward with this patent, then I'll need all the test runs I can get! Let me get this equipment running and we can even do it today! I just need their measurements and their species. Do you happen to know them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, let me ask...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy pulled out her phone (which felt 15% larger in her paws) as she typed a message to Finnick. She had told him to get his girlfriend's measurements, but he had been quiet on exactly what kind of mammal she was. Definitely not a fox. Maybe Judy would get to even meet her if she hung around the lab. As she waited for a reply from Finn, she discovered that his girlfriend was in fact a...</span></div></div>",

Nick was at the office as he had to get some work done as well as further preparations and paperwork before the Big case could commence. And besides that, Judy was super curious to finally meet Finnick's girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe texted her that they would show up around noon, giving Judy the chance to walk around the city a bit at her new size. Being already a small mammal, Zootopia didn't look too much different especially when almost everyone around her was typically gigantic to begin with. Where things did start getting different was Judy's visit to Little Rodentia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was where the mission was planned to take place. Someone small enough on the inside to weasel their way into a ball Mister Big was planning to have and infiltrate it, checking the dirty dealings in the basement. The mobster figured that because that part of the city was so small, there would be no way for the police to plant a mole in. Or at least one that directly worked with the ZPD.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her first days on the force, Judy could remember one incident where she had jumped the fence to pursue a weasel, causing a scurry among the little buildings and tiny denizens. Judy could recall towering over the buildings, now she was more the size of them. It was a sobering thought to imagine herself walking along the miniature streets with the mice and rats. She might have lingered around longer where it not for her stomach growling and her overalls starting to slip off her shoulder. It was the signal that she had gotten even smaller through her walk around the city and it was time to return to the lab. Though Judy promised herself she'd actually go inside Little Rodentia again once she was of a more appropriate height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"49.8 centimeters,\" Hightower chimed in as she removed the tape measurer from Judy's head. \"Progressing along <i>very </i>nicely. You're at around 18% smaller than your original height.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy's toes curled again, she hadn't expected to drop under 50 centimeters so soon and yet here she was. Standing at a height she hadn't been since the 7th grade. She had to text Nick to pick up some appropriately sized clothes for her when he stopped by the lab at the end of day, plus some consideration for how small she might be by then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then,\" said Hightower as she returned to her desk. \"Where is your friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He should be here any min--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy's now oversized phone buzzed violently in her paws as a message from Finnick that simply read \"were her\" in grossly misspelled fashion. But Judy was honesty too excited to finally meet this mysterious girlfriend of his to give him slack for it as she hopped from her stool and made her way to the lab front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving seen him yesterday, it was a little jarring to find that instead of him coming up to her belly button Finnick was more approaching her chest in height. She had truly lost almost a whole head in height and Finnick had taken notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" he said, his voice laced with sarcasm. \"This really is legit then, huh? Are you going to be my height tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At the rate I'm going, maybe the day after,\" Judy answered before looking around behind Finnick. \"So...Where is she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinnick pointed up. Only then did Judy notice the two massive legs and the dark shadow hovering over the both of them. Judy's jaw dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there,\" said a very accented voice as a hoof was lowered to shake Judy's paw. \"I'm Gazelle, pleased to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery pop song Judy had ever heard suddenly played in her head as she frigidly shook her idol's hoof before facing Finnick and mouthing the words \"How?\" Finnick just rolled his eyes as if to say \"It's a long story.\" But before Judy could fangirl, Doctor Hightower appeared behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be the new patient!\" the miniature giraffe as she offered Gazelle her own hoof. \"Welcome! We're almost all set for you. Come in! Come in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGazelle and Finnick both looked on in stunned silence, it wasn't everyday you got to shake paws with a giraffe who was two and a half feet tall, after all. As all three of them followed Hightower inside, Judy could hear Gazelle mutter in comical aside to her apparent boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess it's safe to say this is the right place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then,\" continued Hightower as if she were giving a tour. \"With the information you provided, you are a gazelle standing at precisely 165.4 centimeters, is that correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" replied Gazelle as she struggled to find a seat in an office built for smaller mammals in mind. \"I don't suppose that's a problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, not at all. Giraffes are distant cousins of gazelles and just look at me! As I told Officer Hopps here, the process will take seven days to run its course and is completely reversible with a secondary dose of a growth serum. Have you thought about what size you'd like the initial dose to make you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGazelle and Finnick shared a glance before she answered. \"Well...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Here's the thing,\" Gazelle went on to explain. \"I have a gig in Little Rodentia from a pretty high paying client. Normally, they have a separate stage for mammals my size. But when Finn came to me with this serum you've created, that's when I had the idea. What if I could show up mouse-sized for the performance? Wouldn't that be the best show ever if I could see my clients up close and personal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that would be splendid,\" Hightower chimed in as she plugged in the number on her computer. \"So, final numbers would be...10 centimeters? 5?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fifteen,\" Gazelle replied. \"That'll fit for the setting and make it so we can have a little fun with each other later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nudged Finnick a little with her hoof and winked. Though Judy had never asked, Finnick was about 30 centimeters tall, maybe a little less. That made Gazelle practically a giantess compared to him. She was huge even to Judy now. It boggled her mind that Gazelle might actually want to become half the size of Finnick and Judy would become even smaller than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent,\" Hightower replied as her machines whirled and a familiar green liquid filled up a larger vial than before. Hightower had to produce a giant syringe from her desk that was almost the size of Judy's head. \"I just need to measure the amount. You're lucky since I've done so much work on myself and our species are practically family. I should be able to be much more precise than I was with Officer Hopps here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way,\" Judy cleared her throat at the reminder that she was a police officer. She grabbed Gazelle's attention. \"You said that you have a gig in Little Rodentia. Do you happen to know what it's for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, yes,\" Gazelle replied as Hightower rubbed alcohol on her thigh. \"It's for a big ball that the Big family is hosting for the birth of his new grandchildren.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the same thing I'm going to,\" Judy realized. \"I'm going there to be undercover and search the premises for illegal substances. Would you be interested in working together? Just to watch each other's backs while there in case something goes wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you normally invite random citizens in on your cases with you, Officer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding? That's how I met my current partner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGazelle laughed before she let out a cry of pain. Hightower had stabbed her with the syringe full of shrinking serum and injected it all into her system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go,\" said Hightower. \"Now like I said, in seven days you should be the height you specified. Like I told Officer Hopps, you might want to arrange for clothes to fit you at the various stages and take plenty of vitamins to fuel the changes happening to your body. Please stop by for a checkup tomorrow and we can confirm your process is proceeding perfectly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Gazelle replied rubbing at her thigh. \"That was easier than getting the flu shot. Do you mind if we pick this up tomorrow then, Officer Hopps? I'd like to speak to my designer for various clothes this week and for the ball.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. I need to talk to Finn about my disguise anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinnick just grumbled though he softened up when Gazelle offered him a hoof. Though they didn't look it at first, they were a surprisingly good couple. Judy could only wonder how the two of them met. Or how it even worked in the bedroom given the sheer differences in size. Such thoughts had Judy burning at the ears, especially when she thought of Nick too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she actually saw Nick, she had to gawk. Over the course of waiting for him, Judy had managed to shrink even more with over a centimeter bringing her to 48.5 now. Her overalls were now constantly falling off her shoulder and the clothes Nick came bearing were a welcome relief, even though they belonged to the age when Judy was in grade school. Pretty soon she'd have to start thinking about wearing doll clothing. Judy stepped out of the lab bathroom wearing jeans and a turtleneck sweater she had worn since she was ten years old. Judy's toes curled a little more when she discovered she no longer came up to Nick's chest in height and was now at eye level with her belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking good, Carrots,\" said Nick towered over her. \"Or small, I guess. What do you want to do tonight then? This might be the last night we can do something out on the town with you looking relatively normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was right. At this rate, tomorrow Judy would seem beyond the size of any normal looking adult rabbit and would start to draw some attention. This might be the last time she got to go out and enjoy herself until she was small enough to visit Little Rodentia. Still...Thinking about  how Finnick and Gazelle made things work made her curious to see what it might be like to have a little \"fun\" at this size. The rush of shrinking made her all giddy too as she decided tonight they would...</span></div></div>",

There was actually a bunny child who was about twelve years old that was taller than Judy currently wave. Judy smiled and gave the girl a wave while the bunny just stood there confused how there could be an adult rabbit smaller than she was. Judy just kept close to Nick on the ride, who was starting to feel more like a giant thus her protector from the growing world around her. She was even holding his paw and had to admire, while big before, how massive they now felt to her own tiny paws. And how high she now had to reach up for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time they got back to the apartment, Judy's clothes were already starting to feel loose and comfortable and they measured her against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"48.1,\" Nick commented. \"Wow, and we were only traveling for like an hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The doctor says excitement speeds up the process,\" Judy explained. \"Because the serum is in my blood, an increased heart rate keeps it moving through my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, every time you get a spike in emotion, you shrink faster? What has you so excited then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll show you,\" Judy said before holding her arms out. \"Pick me up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick furrowed his brow. He wasn't much for muscle and even when Judy was full size, he struggled to lift her off the ground. Still, he obeyed her command, putting both massive paws around her waist and lifted. To his and her surprise, Judy was hoisted straight off the ground with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah,\" Nick commented. \"You're so much lighter than before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About twenty percent lighter,\" Judy replied, doing the math in her head real quick. \"So...If I was twenty pounds before then I'm about sixteen now. A whole four pounds lighter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No kidding,\" Nick continued as he raised Judy up over his head. \"And this...Excites you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda,\" Judy giggled and curled her toes again. \"I just remember coming to the city for the first time and marveling at just how huge everything was to a small bunny like me. It's that same feeling only I have a comparison to stuff I'm familiar with. My apartment. My clothes. You.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy gulped. The rush of being held up like a doll was causing her heart to beat faster and faster. She was sure she had shrunk another tenth of a centimeter. She looked up at Nick and how she was almost half his size now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you?\" she asked. \"Do you...Like holding me like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick pondered the question for a moment before admitting. \"Sometimes its hard to even realize that there's a whole other section with the city of the mice and rats. They're just so small that you can forget they're there. With you though, it's like watching you almost disappear and I realize I have to be delicate and gentle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to disappear though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I know. It's just going to be so much harder to do things together until you're back to normal again, once this mission is over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can think of a few things we could still do together even if I'm the size of a mouse. There's still things we could do now, if you had the mind to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy was suddenly grateful that Nick had already brought her to eye level, it made kissing him that much less awkward. Though his snout and teeth felt so much bigger to her. Though she still feel deeper into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick seemed surprised at first, as he cradled her and brought her onto the bed. He broke away for a moment with a look of concern in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure, Carrots? I don't want to end up hurting you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not going to hurt me, Nick,\" she replied as her paws ran down his chest. \"I want to see what this is like. Having a giant has his way with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was suddenly a hungry, almost predatory look in Nick's eyes as he began to unbutton his shirt. Judy could begin to feel herself shrink again as every part of her body started to compress itself. She had gotten small enough that the jeans were already starting to slip off her waist, which made it easier for her to pull them off before she fell backwards on the bed as Nick continued to tower over her, shirtless and aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe experience was causing Judy's heart to beat in her chest so quickly that Judy was afraid it might bruise her ribs. Rabbits had very fast heart rates, after all. That was one thing Doctor Hightower hadn't accounted for. The serum was about to speed up its process with the nocturnal activities between Judy and Nick. The question was, by how much?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring intercourse, Judy would shrink as much as she would in the span of...</span></div></div>",

Nick's paws were feeling bigger and bigger as he wrapped around her as while as him growing larger inside of her. Her poor little heart almost couldn't take it as it pounded away, fueling her descent in height as she lost another centimeter. And then two. Before long she wasn't able to keep track as she became absorbed in the pleasure of the giant fox on top of her. She was starting to feel like a toy to him and that thought scratched a particular itch that she didn't even know she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick was getting into it too, though he slowed down as she started to notice something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carrots,\" he panted. \"You're getting smaller.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Judy moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, like, a <i>lot </i>smaller.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick lifted her up from the bed with significantly less force needed than usual. Judy was taken into a world that was much larger than it had been a half an hour ago. Standing on the floor, the bed now came up to her chest instead of her thighs. The police uniform on the floor looked like it belonged to some gigantic bunny, when really Judy knew it was hers. And most of all was Nick. He looked so massive to her now that she was on eye level with his groin. That only gave her dirtier thoughts as she felt felt her heart quicken again as she dropped a little more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick brought her to the wall with all the markers as his eyes widened upon witnessing the significant gap between Judy's current size and the one she had been less than an hour ago. He brought out the measuring tape to put a number to that difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"42.3 centimeters,\" he gawked. \"Carrots, you just dropped down almost six centimeters during all that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About half a day's worth,\" Judy replied as she did the math in her head. \"I guess that makes me...Seventy percent my original height?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she had been smaller than a twelve year old before sex, Judy couldn't help but wonder how she might appear now. For a laugh, she tried on the discarded clothes she had ripped off before they had started going at it. The jeans that had already been a little large on her were now like clown pants as Judy had to hold them up to keep them in place. The sleeves of the turtleneck now covered both of her paws in a comical fashion as Judy giggled and looked up at Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you nuts?\" Nick said. \"Carrots, I'm starting to get a little worried about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy put on her best pout, magnified by the oversized outfit she was wearing to make her seem cuter (as much as she despised that word). \"You mean you didn't like being together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha? No, I mean, of course not. It was a lot of fun. But if doing...That is going to trigger another shrinking episode then I'm starting to get a little worried. The doctor said it's supposed to be a gradual change, right? That sudden lose in height can't be good for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's nonsense. I feel just fine. Come on, Nick. Please? Before I get too small to enjoy this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick winced as Judy struck him right in the heartstrings. The choice remained up to him though. Should they do it some more and risk Judy getting too small? Nick decided to...</span></div></div>",

He sighed heavily and lifted Judy up again and dropped her into bed while she squirmed the whole way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" she protested as the jeans fell to the floor and only the sweater remained on her person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Carrots,\" Nick replied solemnly. \"You gotta get to bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bed? But I'm not sleepy at all! I'm not...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy let out a big yawn. Nick suddenly remembered that she had been neglecting her vitamins, which had been supplying her body with energy through the process. It burned an awful lot of energy to be constantly shrinking, after all. On top of the activities they had just done together, Judy must have been exhausted as she struggled less and less while Nick tucker her in. Eventually, after another big yawn, she laid motionless in the bed while gently snoring. She almost looked like a kid who had a long day and passed out as Nick smiled and went for the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night, Carrots.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy woke up with the bed sheets feeling significantly heavier on top of her as she struggled to push it off of her and gave a big yawn. That was when she realized that the turtleneck she was wearing was now huge on her, she couldn't even reach her paws out of the sleeves as she tried to get to the edge of the bed which was a deeper drop than was usual. Bits and pieces of the night before played in her mind as she noticed Nick asleep in the corner, resting on her tiny office chair with a blanket around him. As Judy dropped to the floor, she stood in awe of how much bigger her apartment was while she waddled over to the wall to measure herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n38.8 centimeters, she was now around 64% of her old height and about 10 centimeters shorter than she remembered being the night before. It was all coming back to her that their nighttime adventurers together had sped up the shrinking process by increasing her heart rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy could no longer even see over her desk as she wandered over to Nick, her smaller body allowed for softer footsteps as even her creaky floorboards wouldn't make a sound under her foot. And Nick looked gigantic. While he really hadn't grown an inch, Judy was grappling with the fact that she was now less than half his size of around 80 centimeters. It was a little intimidating if also a bit thrilling to think about. Poor Nick also looked exhausted though, no doubt wiped out from dealing with Judy's bizarre cravings. She had the idea to let him rest a little while she got up to go to the doctors for her check in. Judy had to jump to see the time on the clock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough it might be wise to wake Nick and have him escort her, Judy played with the idea of walking around the city at this size. Then again, she supposed she didn't have to go to the doctor's. Maybe it might do to see how the guys at ZPD might react to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy decided to...</span></div></div>",

I bet he'd get a kick out of this before I head over to the doctor's to get my checkup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that decision, Judy tiptoed over to her closet to pick out her outfit for the trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy got quite the few looks from people as she dressed up in clothes from the first grade, wearing a pink shirt with a flower on it and some shorts that were a little tight given her wide hips, despite her being the size of when she was six years old. This was simply because though she was the height of a child, she had the body of an adult. Though she was able to hide it by being so small. Most people who saw her only saw a little bunny girl who was traveling on the train all by herself. Judy, however, was in awe of everyone and everything looking so much bigger to her. She couldn't even reach the seats normally designated for smaller passengers like rabbits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the sub stopped, she hopped out and headed straight for the front desk. Most of the other officers were so busy that they didn't even notice the tiny bunny girl, not even Ben who was enjoying his breakfast cereal for the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, Judy might try to clear her throat, as at normal size the front desk was large but not so large that it left her unnoticeable. Being about 2/3's of her normal height, however, it meant that it was quite the imposing obstacle to grab Clawhauser's attention. Judy jumped with all her might and just barely managed to grab the top as she scrambled onto the desk. The sight of a small animal clawing its way onto his personal space caused Clawhauser to jump until her saw who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Em. Goodness,\" he said as he stared down at her. \"Judy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven at normal size, Clawhauser was quite large. About 170 centimers if Judy was accurate. And Judy had most definitely shrunk a little bit more on the ride over, if the shorts fitting her more comfortably was any clue. She wagered she was about 38.5 centimeters though she didn't have the tape measurer to prove it. She could only marvel at how large Clawhauser was as he put his face up to her. She was just barely bigger than his whole head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Clawhauser,\" she greeted, casually putting her paws on her hips in an effort to make this all seem like the most normal thing in the world. \"Guess what I've been up to lately?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so small!\" Clawhauser replied before gingerly offering a paw. \"May I...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy nodded as she stepped onto the open paw and allowed Clawhauser to lift her off the ground like she was riding an elevator. He brought her even closer to his face to get a good look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is really real then?\" he asked. \"I heard from a few of the guys that you were taking an undercover operation in Little Rodentia. But I didn't think they'd actually shrink you for it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all high tech and classified stuff,\" Judy explained before she was interrupted by a buzzing that rocked her entire body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer cellphone was now too large for her to carry on her person, so she had to bring a small backpack along to hold it. It was more like a tablet now as she dug it out and saw that someone was calling her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was...</span></div></div>",

See you there soon then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Judy hung up, she was greeted by a buzz which rattled her whole body while holding the phone. With a few presses from her paw, she was able to determine that the address Gazelle was talking about was actually on the other side of town. While she might not normally mind that, when you were 2/3's your size any distance felt that much greater. But that's when she looked down at Clawhauser's paw as he was still holding her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say,\" Judy said, tapping her lip. \"If you promise not to freak out, Clawhauser, do you want to meet someone special with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I?\" the giant cheetah chimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one paid the tiny rabbit riding the giant cheetah's shoulder much mind as the two of them took the subway all the way to the listed destination. Judy figured it might be safer to bring someone with her as she got smaller and smaller. In fact, she was allowed to measure herself while they had a moment on the train. She had shrunk down to 38.2 centimeters, small enough that the once tight shorts she was wearing were now a comfortable fit and the T-shirt was starting to envelope her once again. Pretty soon, she'd have to start wearing doll clothes, a thought that made her toes curl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the train stopped, Judy guided Clawhauser from his neck, acting as his GPS as they navigated the streets. This was certainly a lot easier than trying to walk the streets herself with the worry of being crushed. This must have been what it felt like to be Finnick everyday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Finnick, when they arrived at a deserted alleyway, Judy leapt down Clawhauser's arm straight up to the fennec fox as he stood scowling while playing lookout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Finn,\" Judy greeted as she looked down at him as he came up to her chin now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rabbit,\" he grunted. \"You're even smaller than yesterday. Are you going to be my size tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the plan, at least!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph. Well, at least you're not alone there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gestured to one dark corner of the alleyway where a shadow stirred. Gazelle was wearing a dark hoodie and sunglasses, both of which looked comically large on her. That was because she seemed to be almost a full head shorter than yesterday. The serum had cause her to drop over twenty centimeters in height, or the total amount Judy had lost herself already. It had to work quicker for a mammal so large like Gazelle, though she still looked pretty giant from Judy's perspective. Compared to Clawhauser, she was significantly smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh em goodness,\" the cheetah squealed. \"Gazelle! Wow! You are...Shorter than I expected you to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get that a lot,\" Gazelle replied with a smirk as she turned to Judy. \"Well, Officer Hopps. Mind coming with me so I can show you what this is all about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly!\" Judy said as she hopped along side the pop star. \"What <i>is </i>this all about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I have a way to get you into the actual party itself, you see,\" Gazelle spoke in a hushed whisper. \"I can get you in for a role as...\"</span></div></div>",

You're just going to not have to get close to people else they might see through the disguise. Think more like the little elephant suit I had to wear than an actual mouse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean the 'toot toot?'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinnick barked a grunt while Gazelle just laughed and patted him on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regardless,\" Gazelle finished. \"I can get you in with no problems, I'll just say I know a mouse girl who would be interested and they'll hire you no questions ask. Finnick will put together the entire persona.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just have to play the part of a mouse girl,\" Judy thought aloud before an idea hit her. \"Wait a minute, Doctor Hightower mentioned that she had been working with hormones to create this serum in the first place. Maybe she has something that will allow me to be more mousy for this operation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to actually <i>become </i>a mouse?\" Finnick asked before shrugging. \"Eh, it's your body, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, guys! I need to run and ask the Doctor right away. Thanks for your help, Gazelle and Finn! Keep an eye on Clawhauser for me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Judy sprinted as fast as her little legs could past Clawhauser and into the street, making a beeline straight for Hightower's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she ran, the sudden exercise and excitement had sent her tiny heart pounding away and triggered the shrinking hormones coursing through her veins. She could feel her shirt begin to slide further to her shoulders as the pants were starting to now feel a bit loose. She was getting even shorter than a first grader, as people looked at her running by wondering why the little rabbit girl was in such a rush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she arrived at the Doctor's office, having lost a considerable amount of height from her activities. Though she didn't have a tool to measure herself, she was now 36.8 centimeters tall, nearing Finnick's height and now much shorter than the pintsized giraffe who had been surprised by the bunny's sudden arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Officer Hopps!\" said Hightower. \"My word, you're considerably shorter than yesterday!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's been a lot of excitement lately,\" Judy said while catching her breath. \"Doctor, you said that the shrink serum is distilled from a special hormone that tricks the body into constricting its cells, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, yes. It's a very new field of science that--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a way to trick the body into altering the cells into another animals? Like a mouse, for example?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHightower paused for a moment as she considered the question. She eventually determined that...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Interesting,\" said Hightower as she reviewed her computer. \"You're in luck. Lagomorpha and Rodentia share a small thread in their respective family trees. In fact, until about a century ago, most scientists considered rabbits to be a part of the rodent family. So, there is a link that we can exploit, though it's small.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean then?\" Judy asked trying to sound hopeful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we could induce the hormone with strands of that common thread into both families, we might be able to induce some traits fitting someone in the Rodentia family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean entirely?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that would be impossible given the laws of nature. What we can do is give you aspects of a rodent. Wider ears, longer tail, a snout. Just enough of an influence to grant a passable appearance, more so than what makeup and prosthetics could offer. The catch is...Well...This could all work in theory. I haven't actually tested anything like this yet and would feel much more comfortable doing a few trial runs over the next months--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we don't have a few months,\" Judy whined. \"I'm willing to suffer the consequences and sign any form for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you insist, I suppose I could use a test subject...I hope you don't mind sitting tight while I prepare the hormones and the release form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy sat eagerly holding a pen that would once fit comfortably in her paws but was now giant to the point where it almost felt like it belonged to a wolf or a tiger, though in reality it was her shorter stature which caused the confusion. And as she sat still, she could almost feel herself getting smaller by the minute. The clothes which was wearing were noticeably looser on her as the hours went by waiting for Hightower to finish the new mouse serum. Her shirt was now completely hanging on her shoulder and she had to keep a paw around her pants just to keep them from falling off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go,\" Hightower announced at last. \"But let's get an exact measurement so we know what dose to give you. Let's see here...36.2 centimeters, you're nearing half your height already and it's only been your second day. This should continue ahead of schedule before you know it. Still estimating you at around 5 centimeters, but we'll have to see. I've never seen it progress at this rate before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should see Gazelle,\" Judy commented as she rolled up her loose sleeves. \"Ready for the injection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the needle was far bigger than last time, Judy was giddy enough that she didn't even feel it as the cool blue mixture entered her veins. It chilled her whole body as goosebumps formed all up and down her arms and legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we'll just have to see how your body reacts,\" said Hightower. \"I will ask that you remain here for the rest of the day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should probably tell Nick where I am then,\" Judy said as she pulled out her giant cellphone. \"He's probably worried about me like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she texted Nick to inform him she was at the doctor's, Judy could feel her insides churn and bubble. It was a different feeling than with the shrinking serum, which felt more like her whole body was constricting, though that was certainly still happening during all this. She couldn't explain it in any other way other than parts of her were starting to rearrange themselves making her feel less like a rabbit and more like something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Nick arrived at the office, there was a noticeable change about Judy.</span></div></div>",

They're basically tiny microscopic robots.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct! Though they can only do simple tasks, with enough of them you can program them to do things normal medicine simply isn't able to. Though the tech isn't there yet to understand and combat things like cancer, we <i>do </i>understand how cells grow and shrink through countless, careful hours of observation. With this successful trial run of my research in the field, we may be able to get the funding to expand this into breakthroughs to allow anyone to become any size, shape, or even species they want!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Judy replied. \"Considering I come from a farm that sounds almost like far fetched scifi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All I need to do is prove that this has practical use in the real world! So, trust me when I say I will do everything I can to keep you safe during this case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt reassured Judy to hear that. \"Well, how does this work exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to give the nanobots a few hours to run through your entire system and attach themselves to your cells. From there, I've constructed a tool to control how big or how small you want to be in the form of a wrist watch just like the one I'm wearing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giraffe held up the silver watch that hung limply on her wrist. It had a single black screen with a down arrow and an up arrow. The screen had on it a number which Judy guessed what the doctor's current height was. 87 centimeters. She watched as Hightower produced a similar looking watch from her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" she explained, handing the device over to Judy. \"Obviously the watch won't shrink with you, so you'll have to be careful. In the wrong paws, I imagine this could be quite dangerous. I would recommend giving it to someone you trust rather that hold onto it yourself. But the choice is yours and I won't tell you how to do your job, officer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy nodded and thought for a moment before deciding to give ownership of the watch to...</span></div></div>",
