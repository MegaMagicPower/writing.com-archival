But most importantly, it was a happy land. There was a large walk around the kingdom, and if one went through the gates they would see a long winding road that led up the hill to Argolin castle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong this road, carts and horses went back and forth. Many, smaller paths went away and led to rows and rows of huts, shops, and houses. There was a wide river that lazily ran along the eastern side of the city. Trees grew and animals flourished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the enormous castle, lived the leader of this village. His name was Marrin. Marrrin was a wizard, who was very old and was no longer able to cast the enchantments he once conjured. His old age had left him bed-ridden and grey. Also in the great castle, were the armies and weapons of Argol. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut outside this paradise, were great forces of darkness. Any Argolian caught outside the gates would never return. The evil queen Amber. She was usually busy hunting for her long lost crown of fate, and conjuring up new and vile beings. She was incredibly powerful. Legend had it that the crown she once dawned could make great balls of fire, and transform into the wearer into a dragon, or something far more powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Amber needed to reunite with her lost crown. It was the source of her destructive powers. If she did, even Marrin himself wouldn\u2019t be able to match half her strength. Without out it, she was still fierce, but easily kept at bay by the defenses of Argol. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber once had a great army that conquered all the land. Within it were goblins, trolls, dragons, and her three daughters (each have a nickname that the Argols call them), who did her bidding and rained down evil:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Cassius, (Sorceress) the eldest. Cassius was of equal size to Emmarus. She was the smartest, and most wise. She took after her mother, conjuring up spells from levitating, to shields, to magical swords.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Emmarus, (Enchantress) the middle child. She was incredibly gifted at illusions. She could make a person see whatever she wanted and could play with minds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- And finally, Princess Ava. (Gargantuess) Ava was the youngest, but she rose high above the others, at an awe-inspiring height. An army of a thousand elves would tremble before her. Using her formidable and incredible size, she could squash, wrestle, or use a sword to devastate anyone who faced her. The sister who was strongest, and by far the most muscular, who was capable of hurling boulders and crushing villages with her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich path will you take, using these characters?</span></div></div>",

It was a horrible place, full of monsters, demons, volcanoes, including a large and quite dangerous one called Mount Peril. Mount Peril, was where Queen Amber practiced her dark magic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeyond all of this, on a jagged, rocky hill, was the Castle of Queen Amber. On a particularly dark and dreary day, Amber summoned her daughters to the throne room. Her guards opened the doors. The three children entered the castle and made their way up the long winding corridors to the throne room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think it is this time? Has mother found another village for us?\u201d Said Emmarus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAva just laughed. Emmarus looked up at her sister. In fact, she had to look far up. Ava towered over her by many feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think then little sister?\u201d Asked Emmarus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh sister. You may be my elder, as you so subtly pointed out, but you still do not understand. Mother has summoned us because she has found The Crown.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Crown of Hades himself? I don\u2019t believe so Ava. Your size and lust for power cloud your judgement. The Crown cannot and will not be found. That is certain.\u201d Emmarus responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoth of you,\u201d said Cassius \u201cmay be correct. But indeed it is a matter of grave circumstances. I fear that The Crown itself must be found soon. Each day we dally Mother looses her strength. We must move fast if we are to regain our power.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two younger siblings were quiet. Their sister always had a way of speaking in a way that created an ensuing silence. They finally ascended to the throne room. The entered and saw their mother sitting in her lava throne. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy children. Come. I must speak to you.\u201d They approached with caution. Queen Amber looked frail and sickly. Her hair had begun to change from a long dirty blonde mane to wispy, silver strands. Her power had been drained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is your bidding Mother. We are prepared.\u201d Said Cassius. The three bowed and went to one knee. Amber rose from her throne and began to walk toward a window, which only let in dark, volcanic light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou disappoint me, my children.\u201d She said. \u201cYou have failed to retrieve the one prize that I requested. You must explain yourselves, and then you must find The Crown. Before it\u2019s too late.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmmarus looked up. \u201cBut mother, we have tried. Those blasted Argols always-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThose puny weaklings! You should have foreseen this! They are a minor annoyance. Do not forget that your power was given in the depths of Mt. Peril. It can be taken away. Now, you will find me the Crown by sundown tomorrow. If you fail, I will die, and your power will be gone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe daughters rose and bowed. They exited and began their quest. Where do they go first?</span></div></div>",

We have been unable to locate a map that will lead us to the Crown.\u201d Said Ava. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe evil Queen cackled. She walked over to the corner of her throne room. She then open a long narrow basket. Inside, were various pieces of magical literature, and maps. She decided on one and pulled out a dusty parchment. She handed it to Cassius. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is this my Queen?\u201d Asked Emmarus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is your guide. I suggest you follow it.\u201d Said Amber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut mother, this map is incomplete. It only details the paths through the Forrest of Despair! Are you telling us we must search the entire wood?\u201d Asked Cassius. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDaughter,\u201d Said Queen Amber \u201cyou must look beyond the lines. I assure you that once inside the Forest you will understand what the purpose of the map is. I could retrieve the Crown, but I am too weak, and without the Crown itself, I do not have the power to find it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three daughters vowed. Each made a promise that they would never let their Queen down. Amber reminded them of the consequences should they fail, before bidding them farewell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three sisters walked briskly out of the castle. All that was left was a journey. Their destination was about a days walk North. The first hour was silent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy dear sisters. I have had a most grave thought: When we retrieve this Crown, shall we use it ourselves?\u201d Asked Ava.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. We mustn\u2019t. It is for the head of the Queen. And the Queen only. Don\u2019t be foolish, and don\u2019t forget your place. You may be stronger, but I am 100 years your elder. You cannot let your lust cloud your judgement.\u201d Said Cassius. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAva remained silent until they reached the wood. It was almost nightfall, and the skies darkened. Nevertheless, they pressed on. They had to find the Crown this night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey began to creep through the woods. Each moment there was a distant creaking or howl. They walked onward for what seemed like an eternity. They almost gave up. Suddenly, the came to a clearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is not on the Map.\u201d Said Emmarus. She turned it upside down and sideways looking for the clearing. It was not to be found. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is it. It has to be. Our efforts shall be rewarded. I sense that the Crown is within our grasp!\u201d Said Ava. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook! Ahead. There is a point in the center of the clearing that is lit far brighter by the moon. I have read stories about the writing of tree elves. You must put the map under this light. It will reveal the location we seek.\u201d Said Cassius. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmmarus ran over to the center. Indeed the moon was shining incredibly bright in the spot. She raised the map. The three watched in awe as red lines began to draw themselves on the map. The all converged at a spot not 50 feet away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hurried, following the map to a thick tangled cluster of bushes. Inside the protective layer, was a hole that led underground. </span></div></div>",

He admired the quiet, peaceful water, and the lush green trees. He suddenly heard a branch snap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spun around. \u201cWho goes there?\u201d He called. He began to cautiously creep forward. It was probably just a rabbit. But in this world you always had to be careful. He went forward. Suddenly, two large hands grabbed his shoulders from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgghhgh! Help!\u201d He screamed. As he struggled against the powerful iron hands, he thought he heard laughing. He definitely did. And he knew that laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not funny Sophie! You scared me.\u201d He said. The hands released him and he turned to face his attacker.

Although, in all the years that they had known each other, Sophie always tried to show that she was above Peter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued to walk in silence. Suddenly, they came out of the trees. It was dark and rocky, and when the river met the jagged edges, it crashed, sending waves ten feet high. In front of them, was a dark cave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is this place? I\u2019ve been in these woods hundreds of times but I\u2019ve never seen this before.

He eventually came to an enormous cavern. The ceilings were so high they could almost not be seen. Lava and black rocks made up the floor wall. Gold items, from coins to plates to bars, lay in please around the room. The floor could not be seen because there were so many items. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie was standing across the hall. She had her back turned. Peter went to her. Suddenly, when he reached her, he saw what she did. It was a golden box, about the size of a briefcase, but taller. There were dark jewels around the edges. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Asked Peter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think it might be....The Crown.

We could send in our reserve troops. This will push the enemy back, but it will leave us vulnerable to attack here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. We could pull back and defend. This will give us time to prepare, and possibly find the Crown. We are nearing the location every passing second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. We unleash our greatest weapon. The Sword of Artemis.

We need to relieve them.\u201d Said General Doorin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, but we must consider our most important objective. The battlefields of the Forrest of Despair and the Western fields are our largest battles. 75 percent of our recourses are there. It is falling and if we were to lose that then the road our city would lay unguarded.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am the Queen. I shall decide this. Gentlemen, we are struggling in this campaign. But we must defeat the forces of evil, and keep Argol a free land. This is why I have decided to send our reserves to ____</span></div></div>",

The Dwarf quickly went to his best rider. \u201cRemnill, deliver this letter to Captain Anderson. In case you lose it, it reads: We are sending reserves to the front. Pull back to Dungeon Bay and dig in. We will arrive by morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man nodded, mounting his horse. He rode off, directly into the fire of battle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n..... The Next Day, on the Front ......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaptain, we have good news. The reinforcements have arrived as promised.\u201d Said an Elf. Before him stood the legendary Elf, First Commander Sprier. He had fought back against Queen Amber when she possessed the Crown. He now was a strategist, who had refused a promotion to commanding Elven General no less than three times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWell, Commander, how are things on the front?\u201d Sprier spun around and faced his General. He saluted. They both smiled and shook hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are you General?\u201d Asked Sprier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen, I have to be honest. This war is one we are losing. It is my opinion that we need to move forward, and quickly. We need to stop the Queen from producing any more troops.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI agree.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. Now what happened here? How did we lose our position outside the Forrest of Despair?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, a while ago they just stormed out of the woods. Our armies fought them over every inch, but it was just too much. Many of us fled here. The ones who didn't got massacred or enslaved. That was before we had beauties like those ones over there.\" He looked fondly at the nearby crossbows. \"And I'm going to go back there soon. We took a beating, but I know the Dark Queen. This stuff here is just a warmup.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe General nodded, and saluted. Commander Sprier looked outward to the horizon. He put his hand up to block the sun.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, there was a blurry shape on the distance. Then, it separated into three different forms, which rapidly grew larger as they approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My god, those are armored dragons I believe. ALL HANDS! Prepare for Battle! Boys, man the bows! Take those foul beasts out of the sky!\u201d Cried Sprier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flapping of leathery wings was growing louder, along with the screeches of the dragons. The sound of wizzing arrows filled the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe noise was now very loud, and getting even louder. It reached a terrifying shrieking noise for a moment, before a line of fire scorched the Elves. A louder explosion answered and the shrieking passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore explosions, and then the beat of wings. The dragons were leaving the elves in ruins. Then the sounds of battle grew louder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAGHHH?!?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHELP ME, GAHHHH!\u201d<br>\r\nBOOOOM!!!!!<br>\r\n\u201cSave yours- AGHHGH!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the dragons landed. The attack halted. Suddenly the Argolians saw figures approach their position. Who?</span></div></div>",

We can lure them in and then destroy them with almost no losses. We must defend our city until we can locate The Crown of Hades. With that, the Sword of Artemis, and a One stone, we can win easily. We must be patient.\u201d Said the Queen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarrin nodded, giving his approval. As did General Manor and The General of the Dwarves. The council decided, and adjourned. Each General immediately went to their armies head quarters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a field tent, a captain ran to the ringing phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes sir?\u201d He said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCommander, this is General Sherman. Bombard Retreat! I repeat fire the magic balls into their front lines and fall back to the gates.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir, we only have a few more magical blasts. Are you sure?\u201d The captain asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure. This order is from the very top. Use whatever you have to. Use your last potion bombs if necessary. Break their line and fall back. That\u2019s an order!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Sir! We won\u2019t let you down.\u201d He hung up the phone and ran to the nearby soldiers. He instructed them to blast the last of the fireballs and he told them to load their last rocks onto the catapults. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFire!!!\u201d He cried, swinging his arm downward. They cut the ropes and boulder crashed into the advancing enemy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFire 2!!!\u201d He cried. They used a large wooden contraption that looked like a pot boiling on a stove. It fired a blast if fire, causing the goblins to erupt into flames. Next, archers rained down claimed and poisonous arrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe enemy began to retreat. Attacks like this happened nearly every other day, but there were so many enemies, that these almost never led to a victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing this time, horses were quickly hooked up, and made ready. Carts and barrels of supplies were loaded all as soldiers began to run for the safety of Argol. The field was left covered in abandoned bows, crossbows, Wands, swords, and spears. The plan had begun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, a group of elite scouts, the ones who raided Mt. Peril, were sent into the Forest of despair to find the Crown of Hades. What happens to these soldiers, led by the Amazon Sophie?</span></div></div>",
