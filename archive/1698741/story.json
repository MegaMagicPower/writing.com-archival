It hasn't occurred to you that in this reality, you're not her son, but her husband. Your mother smirks, and makes an almost sexual soft moan in reply to you. Now, you've never been attracted to your mom, but at 38 years of age most men consider her a triple-A threat on the hotness meter. Her raven black hair is always soft and styled long, with flat-cut bangs. Right now she was wearing men's boxers and a stringy tank-top, which without a bra didn't do much to cover her considerable breasts. With hips that swing like prize fighters and a nice round ass, most men could do nothing but stare in one way or another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she smirks, and she coos, then your mother comes over to your bed and sits, placing her hand on the bed and giving you a very serious sort of look. Thinking you're now in some kind of trouble, you move away from the computer and towards her. Once sitting, she turns her head to you and smiles. Then, she swings her weight around your front side, moving into a straddle position on your lap. She pushes you backwards onto the bed, but not before pulling you in close to get a face-full of her ample bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother lets out a deep, sensual cooing sound and says, \"So we're going to play mommy and son fuck, hmm?\" Suddenly you're aware that your cock's become hard, and the sudden sensation causes you to let out an involuntary moan. Your mother smiles knowingly, \"Got you all hard, hmm son?\" she looks down to her boxers and back up to your eyes, crooks a half-smile and says, \"I've gotten wet, too. Sorry about that, I've gotten your boxers all dirty sweetie.\" Thinking it ridiculous, you look down only to realize your mother's wearing your Scott Pilgrim boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think, \"Oh, shit.\" as your cock hardens. Your mother decides then is a good time to slide down your body. She unzips your pants, pulls the elastic of your boxers and watches all seven inches of your rock hard dick flop out. You feel the soft thud as your aching cock slaps your mother in the face. You feel your mouth hanging wide open, but cannot recover as your own mother grins like a kid in a candy store, opens her mouth and slides her tongue up the base of your cock. It's wet, but mostly warm, although not as warm and wet as the next thing... her mouth is wrapped around your cock and sliding down like a pro. Your eyes widen, your cock throbs and then, your mom sucks down with her full lips and slides them, ever so gradually along the shaft of your cock. </span></div></div>",

What if your dad catches you two together like this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, stop!\" you yell out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head jerks upwards suddenly, surprised.  Then she smirks, thinking that you're still role-playing.  \"Come on, <i>son</i>.  You know you want this.  Let Mommy give it to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, cut it out.  What if Dad catches us?  This is wrong, okay?  We have to stop it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh,\" your mom utters, backing away.  \"You know, I was really in the mood there.  I don't know why you have to ruin it by not sticking to the role playing right.  You know we never talk about people catching us together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, I ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just stop.

You're not role-playing or whatever.  You're just trying to speak to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaves the room in a huff, leaving you alone.  On the computer, you see a screen stating LIFE CHANGE COMPLETE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you approach the computer, you realize what must have happened.  This computer program ... it really <i>could</i> change reality!  And without really thinking about it, you just switched lives with your dad.  So that means that ... oh god ... your mom thinks that she's married to <i>you</i>.  But ... if you have your dad's life, then what about your dad?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to reverse whatever you did, but the program tells you that you can't, that only one change per day is permitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to stay like this for an entire day?\" you mutter to yourself, your eyes wide.</span></div></div>",
