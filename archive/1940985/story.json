Dr. Cooper, math professor, was as horrible as ever and tried to make the life of his students even more miserable by giving them more tasks than any human could possibly finish! Then there was Richard's second job. He never was the fashion type, unlike his girlfriend, but to work in a clothing store for both sexes? Not really great. He can't remember how long all those women each needed to find something to wear but together it was aweful long!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just think about Rica and the future we will spend together...\", he mumbled as he walked slowly to his room, passing his mother and sister who looked kinda worried, and falling right into his bed. \"Sometimes I wish life would change little by little... And getting better of course!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling exhausted he then passed out. Everything was silent in his room but he was not alone. In one corner of his room there were glowing eyes looking at him. \"Oh, I can arrange that!\", said the figure who was sitting there to himself but no sound was emitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Richard found himself in a different bed. Whose is it?</span></div></div>",

His class were blunt and dull but he had to endure them in order to finish college. And don't begin with his job!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud sigh escaped his lips as he turned around. That was the moment when he noticed somethig strange. The bed sheets... The felt different. Not unfamiliar. No. Just different than how they should feel. But from where did he know this feeling? \"Rica...?\", he mumbled sleepily and slowly sat up in bed. He looked around but could not find andone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. I'm just imagining things\", he laughed quietly but soon stopped. The room he was in was not his own. It was Rica's! All the sleepiness vanished this instant and now wide awake, Richard jumped out of bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the-?!\", he thought agitated. \"This is Rica's room! What am I doing here? Where is Rica?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around but immediately noticed slight differences. Instead of the boy band posters Rica still had from her teenage years, there were none! Just like in his room. He looked around and saw his TV and Xbox standing where normally only stood Rica's TV. Her make-up table was not there either. And a quick look into the waderobe showed all of his clothes instead of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on?\", he mumbled. He slowly walked over to the door and opened it. Behind he found the hallway connecting Rica's room with the other rooms in her house. So he really was at her house but why was Rica's room so different?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA door cracked and Richard shuddered in fear. He wanted to get back into the room but was paralyzed in fear and curiousness. He looked into the direction of the sound. Rica's mother had left the bathroom and was only wearing a pink bathroom. She smiled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up so soon? What's wrong, son? Having trouble?\", she smiled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard was dazzled. Did she just call him son? What was going on here?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no! I just woke up early\", he quickly said. He was not sure if he should tell her what he was experiencing right now. Maybe she would think he was crazy. Maybe he was crazy! But he wanted to make sure that he is before he would let anyone come to any conclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright\", she continued to smile. \"If anythings wrong you can always talk to your mother. Breakfast will be ready in an hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard nodded and watched after her as she left the hallway by using the stairs. Now he was really confused. His girlfriend's mother treated him like he was her son!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got back into the room in which he awoke. There has to be something that tells him what was going on! There has to!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around and after five minutes of search he finally decided to look into the wallet that was lying on the desk. Inside he found his ID. Well not exactly his ID. There was his picture and everything but the address as well as his last name were wrong! These were his girlfriend's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow even more confused than before, he decided to go to the bathroom and shower. Maybe the water will help him understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the bathroom he did not find anything strange at first but soon noticed that his shampoo was there. Normally he took it with him when he slept over here. He tried not to think about it for too long and got into the shower. The cool water really was helping him to calm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he got out of the shower, a new swap occured. But what was it?</span></div></div>",

Drying off quickly, he exits the bathroom, back into his own chamber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Is this really my room? I guess it wouldn't hurt to start thinking that way, especially since everyone else does, presumably.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walks 'cross the soft carpeting to the wardrobe. It isn't super masculine, but it's not so feminine that he can't say he wouldn't use it. Opening it reveals again, the collection of threads he's collected over the years. He's never really thought about his clothes much, just never been fashioned minded. Grabbing the first pair of cargo pants, the first wrinkled tee, and the first pair of briefs he sees, he strips out of the pair of shorts he was sleeping in and begins to redress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cargo pants are only half way up the calves when a sudden tightness hits his nethers. A tightness not too overwhelming, but unexpected enough to set him tripping over his pants and falling face first to the soft carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the Hell?!\" His eyes go wide. In place of his grey comfortable briefs were a pair of pink laced panties. They fit as well as a pair of girl's panties could on a boy, and realization hits him. He's not out of the woods as far as sudden changes. \"Nope!\" He yanks the soft fabric down his thighs and off his feet before diving toward the wardrobe. \"No...\" Color drained from his face as he experienced full unadulterated disappointment. Not a single pair of men's underwear had been spared. Nothing remained but Rica's panties. And all Richard's other clothes, but most notably Rica's panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, is this one lingerie? How come she never wore that for me?!\"</span></div></div>",

Moments ago they were completely normal but now they were more slender. More feminine. And his nails were longer. And the. Were painted pink!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck is going on?! Am I going crazy?!\", he asked himself and inspected his hands further. If he had not known better he would have thought that these were Rica's hands. But that can't be, right? He can't have Rica's hands! He is probably just dreaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... That must be it. That's the only possible explanation! I'm dreaming. I just have to wake up!\", he thought and immediately pinched himself with his newly acquired long fingernails but besides the pain he felt in his cheek nothing had changed. He was still standing in his girlfriend's bathroom with her hands!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If this isn't a dream... Then I must be crazy! All of this can't be happening!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard left the bathroom and went back to the room in which he awoke. He noticed immediately a difference to before. He looked at the desk and saw multiple bottles of nail polish standing there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impossible! These were not standing there before! Someone must have placed them there... Then again... They appeared right after my hands changed... Too much of a coincidence... Then again... I'm getting crazy, right? But I feel to sane for being insane... So what is happening?\", he thought and sat down on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should I do? Why is this happening. Nothing makes sense anymore!\", he thought and tears began running down his cheeks. It did not matter that he was crying, nobody saw him anyway. \"Why is all of this happening to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat there crying for what felt like an eternity. He got up as his stomach began signaling that he had to eat. \"At least I could get something to eat. Crazy or not, I've gotta eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard got up and went down to the kitchen. Since Rica was an only-child and her dad died five years ago he did not expect anyone besides Rica's mother and what he expected was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you're hungry, honey\", she smiled at him. He replied by simply nodding and sat down on the table. He grabbed the pancakes with his foreign hands while \"his\" mother began talking about something. He did not listen. He was too concerned with his own situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe left the kitchen as soon as he finished breakfast. He then got upstairs where his cellphone was vibrating. He looked at it and saw a message that reminded him that his classes would start soon. \"So, this is still normal? Maybe I'm just hallucinating... I should go to college and maybe everything will be back to normal. Yeah. I'm probably just daydreaming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then gathered everything he needed and left the house. He was not really surprised that his car was standing in front of the house. He had found the keys on the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next hour was boring as hell. College was not very far away from his home but from his girlfriend's home it was way too far. Luckily he had his car or otherwise he would have been late for his first class. During the ride he thought about what was happening. All of it. Something simply was not right. Everything was too real. He can't be hallucinating. He was not insane either. Insane people normally don't know that they are insane. So what was happening?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom time to time he glanced at the pink fingernails and shuddered. How could this have happened? Again and again he repeated the question but no matter how many different angles he tried to use, he was not able to come to an answer. Maybe this was a problem that cannot be solved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout his whole class he was not paying attention and was continuously looking for an answer he possibly could not find. He began to wish that he was crazy because then the riddle would have been solved. Unfortunately, the answer was not this easy. No, there was more to it. He somehow knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now if I only somehow knew the answer...\", he sighed after hours of thinking. \"Well... I guess it's time for some lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when he entered the cafeteria, another swap occured...</span></div></div>",

Instead of his usual black pants, he was now wearing a red skirt that ended mid-thigh. He recognized it as Rita's favorite one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked he looked around and waited for people to laugh or look strange at him but neither happened. They looked at him sure, but it seemed that nobody had thought that anything strange had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck is going on here?\", he mumbled to himself and continued walking. It felt strange to walk around in a skirt and Richard was relieved that, just like the other strange occurenses, nobody gave him a second glance. He silently grabbed something to eat and sat down on a lonely table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was not really a guy who talked much with other people, so he had time to think about his situation. Not that it helped him in any way. He was thinking about this for almost six hours now and the goal could not be any further, if it actually exists. Maybe there is no explanation?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't be...\", he mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can't be?\", then asked a voice from behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard turned around and saw Mark. He knew him because of some classes they had together and usually it was Mark who began talking. Richard did not want to be rude so he usually joined the conversation. But now was not really a great time for Mark to show up. But was there ever?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing...\", said Richard and shrugged his shoulders. \"I'm just thinking out loud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay\", said Mark and sat down in front of Richard. \"I guess you wouldn't tell me what it is about. Anyway...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that a conversation between the two began and Richard was glad that Mark was here. His head was beginning to ache because of this unsolvable problem. It was just nice to not think about it, although he was reminded of his situation every time he looked at his hands with the pink coloured nails and the skirt that was fastened around his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, gotta go now. See you tomorrow\", said Mark and left Richard alone again. And left him again with this problem. But he suddenly got an idea where he might find an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The library!\", he thought. He quickly got up and left the cafeteria. He knew that he did not really have time for looking through the library because he had classes to attend but it was more important now to end what ever was happening this instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo his skirt-clad legs brought him to the library where he found after hours of searching...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hours and hours of searching went by but nothing. Not a single clue. All those hours that went by for nothing. The air conditioner in the library did not really help him. It was the end of summer semster and it was hot outside. Therefore the air condition was running at full power. Maybe it was cooling too well because Richard's legs which were clad in only the red skirt were now freezing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I give up...\", he mumbled and got up. He unconsciously straightened the skirt with his femine hands and left the library as fast as he could. Outside he was in a shock how hot it now was. Kinda glad that he now wore a skirt, because now it was way more comfortable. \"I kinda get the benefit of wearing one...\", he thought with a big sigh. \"Yeah, just try to look at this positiveley...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard looked at his clock. He had been in the library for hours but he still had one class left. \"Guess, I can attend that one as well. It's not gonna hurt me if I do... I hope...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Richard walked to his last class and hoping that all the changes that happened would just disappear. They would not and the only thing he found out during his library visit was that he somehow transformed into his girlfriend or why else would he be wearing her favorite skirt or be waking up in her home? He doubted that these changes were all just coincidences. No he was turning into his girlfriend!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe the time I spent in the library was not in vain. At least I now have a vague idea of what might happen to me. Unfortunately there are no books concerning his problem. Not even fictional stories with a vague situation. Maybe he should check it up on the internet later?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class was filled with all people he had seen numerous times before but never talked to. This time there was no difference. Richard sat down in the last row, crossing his legs so that nobody could see his boxers beneath his skirt and listened to the boring lecture. While he tried to avoid thinking of his situation, he still thought about it from time to time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClass was almost over when the next swap occured. What was it?</span></div></div>",

But again, what should I do? I'm not very eager to go home. Especially since everything indicates that home is my girlfriend's home. Oh well, I can't do anything about it now, right?\", he thought and went back to his car. He still had not noticed that his lips had been swapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car ride home was as uneventful as ever. No wonder, since the highway was almost only a straight line. Rather boring. Luckily he concentrated more on the music coming from the radio rather than all of the swaps that had occured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should talk with someone about it...\", he thought. \"But who would believe me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, in movies the people normally look for someone they can talk to if they're having a similar problem like being body swapped. Maybe I should look for such a person aswell. But who would it be? Maybe Rica? Since I'm apperently swapping with her... She might notice all of this, too! On the other hand...

It seemed that some things in the room stayed like they were when the room belonged to Rica, like the bed, but some other things, like his computer or his gaming consoles, have changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the computer finally was fully turned on, he looked at Skype and was glad that Rica was already on. \"How she got to work I wonder...\", he thought.

He currently still lives st his parents house but he saves the money he makes from his part time job as clerk in a clothing store in order to get a nice little appartment for himself and his girlfriend Rita. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe exams are nearing and Richard feels stressed out so one night he thought about how a different life may be. Unfortunately, a mischievous entity heard his thoughts and decided to make it true. So, the next day he awoke in a different room. He had swapped where he lives as well as family with a female and he will soon discover that he will swap even more with said person over the course of the next 20 days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow the swaps work:<br>\r\nBesides Richard nobody will find anything out of the ordinary.<br>\r\nThe first 3 days only body part and clothes swaps may occur.<br>\r\nBeginning with the third day swaps concerning personal information, such as jobs, names or relationships, may occur.<br>\r\nOn the seventh day personality swaps may occur.<br>\r\nBy the 15th day Richard so many personality swaps will have occured that he will find it hard to stay himself and will have to concentrate.<br>\r\nThe last swap which will occur on the end of the 20th day will be a personality swap and then he won't be able to remember his old life.<br>\r\nThe woman he swaps with will of course notice nothing and show all the swaps he has, e.g. if they both only have swapped breats so far, he will have his normal body with her breasts while she has her normal body with his chest.<br>\r\nThe swaps will occur gradually so not too many swaps at once!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharacters:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard, 21 years old.
