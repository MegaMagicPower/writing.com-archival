I mean its pretty common for a person to lose an inch or two every twenty years but this...\u201d said Cyndie Jones as she was going through her records.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d asked Neil Green as he looked at his doctor. Cyndie put the records down and answered, \u201cWhat I'm saying is you have caught a very rare illness. Its so rare that there's hardly any word of it in the medical books\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell what is it? What have I caught?\u201d asked Neil as he was getting scared. \u201cWell Mr Green, you've caught a very rare illness which according to the only few people to ever got it is known as Shrinkage Disease\u201d answered Cyndie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShrinkage Disease...what does that do?\u201d asked Neil. \u201cWell...its does what it sounds...the illness you got is causing your body to slowly shrink away\u201d answered Cyndie. \u201cTell me that you're joking\u201d said Neil. \u201cIf you don't believe me, wait in a couple of days, then we see\u201d said Cyndie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, fine...what are my options?\u201d asked Neil as he looked at the floor. \u201cWell, since not many people have ever caught Shrinkage Disease so it best that you should remain within this hospital. You will be housed within the special ward till we can get any results\u201d answered Cyndie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds as if I got to stay here, is there isn't any other options?\u201d asked Neil as he looked at her. \u201cWould you rather be at home doing your normal things, slowly shrinking? The people will notice a shrinking man and trust me when I say this. You don't want that kind of  limelight\u201d answered Cyndie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine...when I am going to this ward?\u201d asked Neil as he stood up. \u201cWe can send you to it right now if you wish, the sooner the better as we can find a cure faster that way\u201d answered Cyndie as she stood up and walked next to Neil. Cyndie was a inch taller than Neil as she's 5'7 where Neil was once 5'10. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyndie led Neil down the hallway to entrance to building. \u201cSo just where is this ward anyway?\u201d asked Neil as Cyndie walked up to his car. \u201cDon't worry about the address, I send someone to pick you up within a hour to drop you off at the hospital\u201d answered Cyndie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee you later then\u201d said Neil as he drove off home packing a few of his things together. As he was packing, there was a knock on the door. Neil walked to the front door and opened it, there standing by the entrance as a 5'9 woman with long blond hair and light blue eyes smiling at him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErm yes can I help you?\u201d asked Neil as he was taken back by the tall beauty standing before him. \u201cHi Neil Green, I'm Melanie Dickson. I'm here to take you in\u201d answered the woman. \u201cTake me in? Oh you mean the ward right?\u201d asked Neil. \u201cCorrect Mr Green. Please, if you're ready packed, shall we go\u201d answered Melanie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeil zipped up his trunk filled with things he want and carried it to Melanie's car. With that, Neil took one last look at his house as he knew that when he was to return, the house will look different. The drive took about an hour long, Melanie parked her car in the car park, got out and waited to Neil to get out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce out, he looked out at the building that he would be spending in for a long while. He looked at the sign building and saw that it read, St. Mercy Hospital. With that the two of them headed inside the hospital.   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Can I trust you with that task\u201d said Melanie as she stopped walking and put her hands on her hips in front of him. \u201cOf course\u201d said Neil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, now then, last thing, I will be your nurse for the time you are to be here so, if things are to become hard as I know it will in the near future I will be here to help you with anything you need\u201d said Melanie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're my nurse, okay then. So what is there for a shrinking guy like myself can do around here?\u201d asked Neil as he laid back on his bed. \u201cFor the time being, you are to watch television till Doctor Jones arrive\u201d answered Melanie as she left the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeil turned on the television that was in the room for half an hour as Cyndie enters the room. \u201cAh hello Mr Green, how are things today?\u201d asked Cyndie as she looked at him as Neil sat up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I'm a man that's getting smaller, how would I meant to feel about that?\u201d answered Neil as he looked at her. \u201cOkay, okay...silly question to ask really. Anyway, today we need to take some blood samples along with some tests to that we can understand what we are dealing with here\u201d said Cyndie as she smiled at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine then, when do we start?\u201d asked Neil as he stood up and looked at the even more taller doctor. \u201cWe start right away, now strip off your clothes and get into bed\u201d answered Cyndie as she exit the room. Neil followed what she told him and put on a hospital gown and climbed onto the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute later,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyndie came back with Melanie in uniform into the room. \u201cCome on then\u201d said Cyndie as Melanie took the locks off the bed wheels and pushed the bed into another room to perform tests. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few blood samples and tests, left Neil very tired as he pretty much fell asleep when he returned back to his room. As he was asleep, he slowly shrank down another inch.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In the first moments Neil was a bit stunned after all this was the first time he'd seen her since the shrinking started and even having only lost a few inches so far the difference was more then noticeable or it might of been that he was simply struggling to breath under her tight grip! When Nicole finally broke her grip letting herself fall back onto the flats of her feet Neil was about to get a good look at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole was in a tight fitting button up red top it would seem she was thinking about him having lovely left the top few buttons undone giving Neil a lovely view of his girlfriends warm smooth chest as it softly pushed against the fabric of both her top and her bra that only barely lay hidden under a thin layer of red fabric. Her hair was loose as usual small tight curls bouncing at the ends of her wavy brown hair lightly brushing against her skin. She had on a simple pair of jean shorts with a belt that was slightly over sized which she had most likely stolen from him to make her outfit look cute, it worked. He wasn't able to see her feet, but from the sound they had made from her coming in Neil could hazard a guess that she was wearing her favorite light red flip flops that she took nearly everywhere with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ok?\" She asked again bringing Neil back to reality, he grinned shaking his head. \"Yeah I'm fine hun, the doctors here seem to really be ontop of things. They are working night and day looking for a way of curing me of this.... condition I guess I'll call it.\" Nicole frowned a bit the worry evident on her face. \"How bad is it thought your.... condition. I mean I understand the basics I guess. How much has it done so far?\" Neil smiled looking over himself. \"Well last I checked I was down to 5'6 so I've lost about 6 inches. So nothing life ending, but I will need to buy some new cloths my old ones would hang a bit at this point.\" Nicole smiled a bit even though she has a tear in her eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop that, we shouldn't be laughing about this. I mean what if it doesn't stop? How much smaller can you get?\" Neil shrugged, \"Honestly I don't think anyone really knows. I mean I trust the doctors, but it seems they don't even know how often I'll shrink much less how much I will before I stop without a cure. At the moment I just want keep positive about this. So how about it? Will you be strong with me Nicole...\" He got silent for a moment. \"I'm not sure I can really take all this without you.\" Nicole bit her lower lip before taking a bit of a breath. She leaned over hugging him once more. \"Of course baby. I'll be here no matter what happens. I'd never give up on you or us.\" She said before kissing Neil. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you.\" She says softly. \"Love you to.\" Neil says back as they hold each other the soft sounds of medical equipment filling the silence of the room.    </span></div></div>",

This is when he got a first hand look that he was in fact still shrinking. While he was still taller then Nicole that was changing rather rapidly. He use to be able to look down on her from almost a foot up now they were almost eye to eye. Though he didn't rest on her eyes long seeing two other very appealing orbs asking for his attention just a bit lower. \"I'm surprised you wore something so risky out in public hun.\" He said placing a hand on her knee, Nicole blushed a bit smiling slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you were in the hospital and I figured you needed a bit of a pick me up. Don't expect this all the time mister this was a special occasion.\" Neil laughed, \"Well I do enjoy these special occasions. Maybe I should come down with strange rare illnesses more often.\" Nicole shoved him lightly, \"Hey now don't joke about that. I'm still worried enough as it is. Don't think I haven't noticed your change in height this is still serious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if it keeps up maybe I can just take a ride in your cleavage. Then you won't have to worry about anyone, but me seeing it.\" He teased slightly though the thought did excite him a bit. She rolled her eyes, but she smiled. \"Sweetie if you get that small you are going to be spending alot of time in my purse just so I can keep you out of trouble. You get into places you aren't suppose to now. So I can imagine you'd be even worse being able to slip in to every little nook and cranny.\" \"You know me to well hun, I'm happy to know I'd have you to look after me even if you are a bit of a kill joy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two talked for a few hours about their days, about tv, about nothing at all. They just spent as much time as possible with each other knowing that soon enough Nicole would have to go back home soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole looked up at the clock seeing visiting hours were just about up and grinned a bit looking back towards Neil. \"Well I only have a little time left so. How about I let you give the girls a little attention.\" She blushes undoing a few buttons on her top pulling it away relieving the black bra that was under the fabric. Her breasts held tightly in the grip of the cups. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeil didn't hesitate his hands sliding up her legs and the curves of her waist before up the soft mounds of her chest. He let his fingers sink into the soft flesh and bra as he groped her a bit. She smiled. \"Now be careful I wouldn't be to rough on them after all you might not always be bigger and they might look for a bit of payback.\" Neil smiled giving them a rough squeeze causing both of them to laugh before they softly kissed once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright babe I need to go.\" Nicole said kissing him again before getting out of bed and buttoning up her top all the way this time. \"I'll be back as soon as I can to check up on you.\" \"I know, don't worry to much, the doctors here are top notch and I'm sure they will figure this all out.\" Nicole bit her lip a bit still nervous about the whole situation. \"Alright, I'll try not to worry to much.\" She said before the two of them shared one last long kiss and she headed out.    </span></div></div>",

He didn't know how long he would be in this place so he figured he might as well see what was here. He might even make a friend or two during his stay, you never knew after all. He hopped down off the bed which was a strange feeling since he'd hadn't had to do something like that since he was a kid. It would seem his condition was still doing its work and all he could hope was that it would eventually start to slow down a bit other wise he would be using a match box to sleep in by the end of the week. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeil made his way through the halls which he found for the most part to be rather empty. It would seem this ward was only for special cases so he saw few patients or even medical staff. He was heading to the recreation room when he felt two powerful hands push him making him stumble and finally tumble down onto the ground. \"What the hell is the big deal!\" He yelled out annoyed as he started to hear the laughter of a young girl. As he filled himself around he found himself looking up at a teenager dressed in a pair of light blue cotton full body pajamas. Her long black hair came down to the middle of her shoulder blades a small pink hair click lay nestled in the top side of her head. Neil couldn't help, but let his eyes slowly make their way up her body, she was rather cute girl and she was even taller then he was even though she couldn't be taller then 5'6 which shocked him a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had her hands on her hips looking down at Neil frowning ever so slightly. \"What are you looking at kid?\" Neil's face went red from both anger and embarrassment. \"What about you, what are you staring at?\" She shrugged talking over to Neil before kneeling down over him a bit. \"Just the new kid in the ward. I wanted to see if he was hot. Though you are a bit young for me if you were a few years older you might of been good dating material.\" \"What!? Me to young? What about you? I'm twenty three years old what are you fourteen?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl stood back up flipping her hair. \"I'm fifteen thank you very much and aren't you a little short for your age kid?\" \"I have a illness I wasn't born this small.\" \"Illness?\" She looked confused for a second before offering a hand. \"What does it do?\" She seemed rather interested in the whole situation helping Neil back to his feet. He explained the whole situation he was in losing inches here and there through out the day, how he wasn't even sure how it happened, how no one know if it would even stop, and how they were looking for a cure. \"So it isn't contagious or anything is it?\" \"No I don't think so.\" The girl breathed a sigh of relief. \"Well thats good, I don't need anymore problems on my own plate.\" Neil hadn't even asked why she was in this ward, \"So wha...\" She cut him off shoving her hand in his face. \"I'm Scarlet its nice to meet you and welcome to Vector Ward. It can be a bit strange here at first, but I'll help you out kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeil took her hand shaking it. \"Thanks Scarlet, I'm Neil and can you not call me kid?\" She shook her head. \"No way its not often I see someone smaller then me in here. So I'm going to enjoy this, sorry kid the nickname stays.\" Neil shakes his head, but excepted it. At least he wouldn't be spending all his time alone in here though he wasn't sure if Scarlet was much better. </span></div></div>",

Though they don't have much intention on watching it at the moment. Instead Scarlet can't help herself, but grin a bit noticing a small difference in Neil from their walk in the hall. \"Wow you are a little shorter already!\" She said excited leaning into Neil a bit. \"Another inch gone I guess.\" He said sighing a bit. Though Scarlet was all smiles. \"Don't worry Neil I'll take care of you while you are here. I can be your big sis and look after you. That way that  girlfriend of yours doesn't have to worry so much. Scarlet can keep an eye out on the ever shrinking Neil. I might even be able to carry you around in my pocket one day.

I guess its better then none of the time right? \"Exactly, glade you are happy with the arrangement.\" \"As if I have much of a choice in the matter with you.\" \"Now you are catching on kid. Just better to accept it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Scarlet, mind if I ask you a question.\" She glances down to him. \"Depends on the question.\" \"Nothing personal just about Vector Ward.\" She smiled nodding her head. \"O sure after all I am the big sister here I can help you out with that.\" \"Yeah well, what is this place.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well as you might of noticed this place isn't exactly part of a normal hospital. This Ward is separate we can't even leave this place without being allowed to by one of the doctors. They say its for our own protection and for the safety of others. You see kid this Ward are for the oddities the one in a billion cases that no one has ever seen or heard of before. There are only a handful of us in Vector, but each one of us is lucky you see we each won the disease lottery. We all have something that no one can figure out and so they stuck us in here until they could.\" Scarlet got quiet for a moment. \"And from experience I wouldn't expect to get out anytime soon Neil. Trust big sis on this one, try and get nice and comfortable.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeil could see Scarlet's eyes growing distant for a moment. He quickly put a smile on his own face. \"Hey big sis, how about you show me around this place. Maybe I can meet some of your friends here. After all like you said I'm the new kid in V-Ward.\" Scarlet perked up in an instant that look in her eyes fading away and vanishing as soon looked as if it had never been there at all. \"Sure thing kid.

They would go through different rooms many still empty waiting for someone to occupy them, a lunch room, the rec room, restrooms for men and women, a true bathroom the had large baths and showers for them to use, a gym, a small library and computer room, and even a crafts room for things like pottery, art, and the like. Sooner or later they would run into a pair of large white doors that were locked shut and by looking at them you could tell where air tight. They were only one part of what was an airlock system that would let people in and out of V-Ward and back out into the rest of the hospital. Neil tried to ignore this troubling idea that they were locked away in here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day was dragging on and the sun was starting to dip below the horizon in the distance. Scarlet yawned as the two sat in the lunch room at their own table. Neil could spot different people sitting around the room. Some talked to each other, some did not, some came in just to take some food before leaving to eat else where. \"Don't worry Kid I'll start introducing you to everyone tomorrow. I just wanted to get you use to the Ward first and I guess I like our time together just the two of us. Its kinda fun being a big sister.\" She smiled as she at some of her dinner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks again Scarlet, I really do appreciate this I wasn't sure what to expect here, but you have certainly made this far easier.\" She grinned reaching over messing Neil's hair a bit. \"No problem kid its what big sisters do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeil just laughed a bit letting her have her fun, he was getting use to it to be honest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them finished up dinner and headed to their rooms.

However, seeing Nicole had certainly helped calm him and running into his new friend Scarlet had made this place far less intimidating. He had still felt exhausted just from the experience of his life getting filled turned upside down. It wasn't over either as he slept inches bled away from him slipping off into the night escaping him like water down a drain. When he finally woke up it was easy for him to notice as he found himself nearly swimming in the sleepwear they had given him. It would seem he would need yet another new set of cloths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeil was up early and he was happy to find no one else in the showers as he felt like a kid reaching for the large knobs to turn it on. His morning was rather quiet as he headed back to his room finding a new pair of pajama like clothing waiting for him which he found to be his size. Even though he hadn't seen anyone so far that morning it would seem they had seen him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he finished putting his cloths on he heard a knock at the door. \"Ummm come on in.\"  </span></div></div>",

Did Mom and Dad come?\" Tracy shook her head. \"No, they are still off in China doing that big deal or whatever. They won't be able to come back for another month or so. Shannon brought me.\" Neil's face went pale. \"O no...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeil always had a problem with Shannon treating him like a little baby before. Even though she was only 28 she treated him like a little kid and now that would be even worse and he was right as Shannon entered the room. \"O my god look at you, you poor thing!\" She said grabbing Neil hugging him against her. There was little Neil could really do she was 5'9 and at only 4'8 he was the size of a kid to her. He could only squirm a bit while Tracy giggled at the sight of him struggling in their older cousins embrace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Neil was finally released he took a deep breath nearly being smothered by his cousins motherly instincts. \"Sorry Neil I didn't mean to hold you so hard. I guess I have to get use to your new size.\" \"Well I wouldn't get to use to it Shannon remember what the Doctor said, this is going to keep up. I certainly wouldn't mind a brother that could live in one of my old doll houses my barbies could use the company.\" Tracy laughed. Shannon frowned at her before looking over to Neil. \"Just ignore her.\" \"I always do.\" Neil shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them took a seat with Neil's feet hanging a bit off the floor from his own chair. He talked about what was going on and his first day at the Ward. \"Well its good you are making friends in here Neil.\" \"Though you might need to find some smaller friends if you keep this up. No one likes short guys.\" Shannon quickly flicks Tracy in the ear. \"OUCH! Sorry, sorry, geez it was just a joke.\" \"It wasn't a very nice one.\" Shannon turned her attention to Neil. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are always here for you Neil remember that. I'm always a phone call away and so is your sister though I certainly would understand you not calling her up all the time.\" Tracy suck out her tongue to Shannon. \"Thanks really I'm happy to see both of you. Its nice seeing people I know it makes me feel, normal. Well at least a little bit anyway.\" \"Happy we could help Neil.\" \"Yeah happy to help little bro.\" Tracy smiled happy with this new title. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two left after an hour or so telling Neil they would visit again soon and to call if he needed anything he nodded happy to have seen them.  </span></div></div>",

She smiled seeing him sitting on the side of his bed laying a hand softly on his thigh. \"How is my little guy doing today? It would seem the cloths I left you are still fitting you well enough. If you have any problems with them I can of course always get you a new set.\" That answered Neil's question on who had left the things for him. He didn't have to ask he could guess they had cameras all over the place, but at least he knew for a fact now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They fit fine Melanie, thanks. Is there anything you need from me?\" \"Funny I was going to ask the same thing. I am your Nurse after all and you have been here for a few days now. I just wanted to make sure you were doing well. I mean I can certainly see how things could be stressful for you. I hope seeing family and friends has been helping you out and that you have been making yourself comfortable here.\" \"Yeah it has and I have or at least I've started to. I certainly hope I don't end up here for to long though. I mean I wouldn't what to live here or anything, but it is nice.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great to hear Neil. Now lets do a quick check up alright? We have to make sure other then being a bit smaller you are still healthy after all.\" She smiled brushing her hair from her face. \"So lets get those cloths off you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeil didn't get much of a choice in the matter as Melanie started to strip him. His cloths easily pulled off of him leaving him bare as the day he was born covering his privates as he stood in his Nurses' shadow. \"Alright up you go.\" She smiled picking Neil up from under his arms and placing him on his bed. She seemed to be enjoying herself a little to much for Neil. Melanie started going over his body checking his heart rate, blood pressure, breathing, measuring out length of his arms, legs, fingers, etc...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe examination was long and a bit uncomfortable as Neil found himself having to push Melanie away the best he could as her body brushed up heavily against him. Her chest would push up against his back or chest during the check up, a hand would slide up a leg or linger a bit to long on his bare chest, her lips would get a little to close to an ear. He was able to make her back off, but he was a bit nervous. If he got much smaller and wasn't able to fight back anymore would she do anything or was she just playing around a bit finding the situation amusing? Neil wasn't sure about the answer and he wasn't looking forward to finding out the answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can get dressed little guy.\" She said standing back up walking towards the door. Melanie turned back as she opened the door. \"Don't be a stranger. If you need anything and I do mean anything give me a call. Until then I'm looking forward to your next exam.\" She smiled leaving the room closing the door behind her. \"She is going to be trouble.\" Neil mumbles under his breath.</span></div></div>",

So he quickly headed out towards her room. He made his way down the hall rather quickly and in a moment of not watching where he was going he bumped into a looming figure. \"Hey watch it pipsqueak.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet turned to see it was Neil looking back at her and her face quickly turned from a frown to a smile. \"O its you kid, sorry you are just a bit smaller then last time and well I didn't realize it was you.\" Neil smiled to even though Scarlet dwarfed him he felt safe around her. She knew her way around here and had been mostly nice to him so she was his security in here his 'big sis' as she said. Which was funny to think about since it would usually be the other way round if it wasn't for his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well how about I introduce you to some of your fellow patients? They are the only ones you are still taller then in fact.\" Neil quickly followed behind scarlet having to admit he was happy to know he would be finally meeting some people that weren't taller then he was. Though he knew that this wouldn't last forever at the moment he took a bit of pleasure knowing he could look down at someone again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet lead Neil into the rec room where two young girl age 8 on the couch watching tv. \"These are the twins Kellie and Allison. They are related to Doctor Jones and I'm will the to bet the reason she is working in V-Ward in the first place. Since it seems most medical staff avoids this place like the plague. The two had long brown hair and in fact the only way to tell them apart where their eyes. Kellie had green eyes while Allison had brown eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey girls big sis is here.\" The two girls jumped up running over to Scarlet giving her a hug wrapping their arms around her waist. \"Big sis!\" They yelled out together. Neil was starting to gather that Scarlet liked being the big sister making friends with those smaller then herself. Neil was willing to guess that Scarlet didn't have many friends that were bigger then she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey girls have you been good?\" The two smiled big grins, \"Kinda.\" They said seemly at the same time. \"Good enough.\" Scarlet giggled a bit before looking back to me. \"I want to you meet my new friend Neil he is a little on the short side though.\" The two ran over to Neil smiling and giving him a hug. \"Nice to meet you Neil.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls soon started slamming him with questions with Scarlet over looking all three of them a smile on her face. They asked what his favorite color was, food, tv show, what he liked to do. Then eventually they asked why he was so short and he told them seeing no reason to hide it. The two girls looked on in amazement. They even looked over to Big sis Scarlet to make sure it was true, she gave a nod and they looked back. \"So eventually we are going to be your big sisters?\" Allison said wide eyed. \"I mean I guess thats one way of looking at it.\" \"I can't wait! We won't be the smallest anymore!\" Kellie laughed.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

She took a seat on the couch as Kellie and Allison played with Neil. \"Hey now girls calm down.\" He said feeling some of his height melting away. The two girls getting even more excited seeing it happen right in front of them. \"This is amazing.\" \"I know maybe he'll get small enough to put in my pocket.\" \"Or my shoe\" \"how about in your ear!\" \"Ewwww!\" The girls said together before laughing. The whole conversation made Neil a bit nervous to be honest. After all he wasn't sure how small this would really make him and in reality all those things could very much be a possibility. Allison was the first to notice the look of worry on Neil's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry soon to be little brother. We did mean to worry you or anything me and my sister are just joking. We take after Scarlet and we'll take care of you don't worry.\" \"Yeah if you get super tiny we can give you rides and stuff and we will only play with you after we ask promise.\" Neil sighed, \"Well ummm ok I guess that makes me feel a bit better.\" Though the idea of being 'played' with was something new to worry about. Since they were talking about it more like he was slowly turning into a toy or something that needed to be asked permission to be toyed with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls then heard the theme song of one of their favorite shows and quickly rushed off. Scarlet was sanding behind Neil having been the one to flip the show on in the first place. \"I figured you could use a rescue.\" \"Thanks Scarlet.\" \"No problem kid.\"  </span></div></div>",

The two were around 4 foot only a few inches shorter then himself. It was a strange thought that currently he wouldn't stand out all that much in your average elementary school class. In fact at the rate he was going he might be closer to the size of the student's class pet. He sighed deeply the thought getting to him a bit until he felt a heavy hand on his shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey kid what are you looking down for kid? I mean I thought you might have had enough of that with you getting shorter all the time.\" She smiled, the amazon sized teen was doing her best to cheer him up a bit and she did bring a bit of a smile to him even as he found himself shorter then her developing bust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet seemed to be thinking for a moment before crouching down as if talking to a child looking him in the eye. \"There we go, I figure you might like talking with me a bit more on your level. So whats wrong? The twins didn't get too you to much did they? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head, \"No, its well, I guess my shrinking is just starting to sink in a bit I guess. Thanks for caring Scarlet.\" She smiled large arms wrapped around him pulling him in hugging Neil. \"Of course kid, I'm your big sis after all, I'll make sure your taken care of.\"  You couldn't help, but chuckle a bit, she was treating you like a child softly coddling you and the worst part was that it was working. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Scarlet, how about we just relax a bit and you tell me a bit about you outside of this place?\" She pulls away from the hug, \"Sure, why not kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them sit by the windows and chat most of the morning away. Neil learns more about Scarlet, but she never lets on too much. She lets him know her favorite foods, tv shows, a few boys she likes, but not why she was in the ward or how long. However, he could tell from the way she spoke about the ward and the people here she'd been here sometime a few years at least. </span></div></div>",

He can't help, but blush a bit and thought about apologizing. However, Scarlet either didn't notice or didn't care seemly cemented his status as a little brother of sorts to his friend. The two then parted ways for now as Neil headed back to his room, he had a visit from Nicole coming by soon after all and he wouldn't want to miss that for the world. Though a part of him was a bit nervous, he had still been taller then her last time she saw him, but now he was close to a foot shorter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter making it back to his room and killing a bit of time there was a knock at the door, \"Are you descent in there? \" Nicole's voice run out. Neil rolled his eyes, \"Not at all.\" He joked back, Nicole coming in a moment later anyway a grin on her face. She was wearing one of his old sweaters, her body vanishing under the fabric with the large Spartan U logo stamped across the front. She had on plan jeans and a pair of sneakers. She looked far more like her usual self then she had during her last visit, guess she wasn't going to be that risky ever time she stopped by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see your still stealing my cloths.\" Nicole shrugged, \"Hey they always looked better on me anyway, besides they problem fit me better now too.\" She said making her way up to the bed looking down over Neil. Her cheery looks mellowing out a bit as she saw how accurate her little joke really was now. Her once big strong boyfriend was looking more like the kid to her. The cherry ontop of this was when Neil jumped down from his bed and stood in front of her. He hardly came up past her chest now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I'll be giving up my whole wardrobe to you then. At this point most of my stuff would make it hard to move if I tried to wear it.\" Neil said now looking up to Nicole. It was a strange feeling, she always been the one looking up to him. It had been easier to look up to people he hadn't known all that well, but when it came to family or doubly for Nicole it felt so off. \"I guess I might end up borrowing from your old Barbie dolls if things keep up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole cracked a bit of a smile, \"Maybe I'll even bring you one of my old playsets. You did say we'd live in a mansion one day right? I think I might have one tucked away in my closet some place.\" Neil smiled happy to see her smiling again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you doing baby?\" he sighed happy to see Nicole, seemly more each day that passed. \"Just happy to see you, I've been missing holding you Neil.\" He reached out, \"Just because I'm a bit short doesn't mean I don't want to hold you, come here babe.\" He reached out wrapping his arms around her hugging her tightly or at least he thought he was until Nicole's arms came down on top of him. His face was pressed into her chest his view dark as his head was buried into the sweater covered bust. He was a foot shorter, but that size made Nicole so much stronger then him her hug pinned him to her, she didn't know her own strength now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, I miss you so much Neil, I just wish you were with me every night. I know the hospital is what's best, but sometimes I just want to take you home... Neil?\" She looked down to see her boyfriend struggling in her grip a bit, she hadn't really even noticed! She quickly let him go, Neil stumbling back taking a few deep breaths. Her hands shot up to her mouth, \"O my god, I'm so sorry Neil are you ok?\" He took a moment or two nodding as he caught his breath. \"Don't worry Nicole I'm fine. Just got to get used to being the one getting the bear hugs instead of giving them.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment had scared Nicole a bit, Neil was only a foot shorter and she already had so much power over him. What was going to happen when he was half this size or less then that? She started to worry when she felt a small set of lips press into hers. Her vision coming back looking down to see Neil on his tippy toes to kiss her. Her worries melted away for the moment, they would work it out, they would find a way to make things work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two sat close to each other on the bed for hours holding each other, talking about their days, and after one last kiss Nicole headed out promising to be back as soon as possible. </span></div></div>",

Seems its time to do another exam since you've been shrinking so much since the last time I saw you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was right though he didn't want to admit it, he'd shrunk another 5 inches since the last look over. It didn't mean he liked it and didn't mean he really wanted another visit from Melanie, but what was he going to say? If the doctor ordered it and these were needed to get better, Neil just had to kinda deal with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah down another five inches, has the doctor said anything about a cure or maybe something to slow it down?\" Neil asked the nurse as she moved closer lighting grabbing his arm and easily pulling it up to take his pulse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry my little Neil, but no. It seems all we can do right now is keep running tests. As you shrink more we should get better results. As you get smaller the disease grows more and more concentrated. We just need to figure it out before my needles are big enough to suck you up!\" She joked before sticking him in the arm and taking some blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finished up a few more tests and finally stripped Neil down once more looking him over. In fact she seemed to linger for a moment or two. \"Umm Ms. Dickson? Are you going to take my measurements?\" She seemed to snap out of it, \"Well of course little man.\" She said sweetly and started at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was done she packed her things away and slowly moved up to the edge of the bed. Neil felt like a kid leaning back as she pressed her chest out towards him. \"You know Niel, we are all here to help you while you are here.\" She said seemly reaching out for him, his heart racing as her large hand passed him by grabbing his gown. \"So let me help you out and get you something that fits a bit better. We wouldn't want you running around in your birthday suit would we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave him a kiss on the cheek before walking out of the room.<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Neil makes his way down the hall, not ready to face the likes of the twins or one of the other random faces making their way about the ward. He heads for Scarlet's room, she might have only been a kid, but she was the only friend he really had here and she was 15 going on 16 in the next few months. It was better then trying to talk with the twins at least Scarlet understood a bit more of what it felt like being locked up in here and wanting to get back to a normal life. Even with her being a bit of a tease, she was nice and looked after him, something he felt like he needed more then ever now seeing as he was easily the shorter person in the ward unless they had a few babies tucked away some place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made his way over the Scarlet's room reaching just over his head to the door handle swinging it open. \"Hey Scarlet, hope I'm not waking you.\" He said walking in seeing Scarlet still in bed turned the other way seemly looking at something. \"Huh who!?\" She nearly jumped out of her skin seemly tucking something under her pillow and rolling over to face you. \"O, wow its just you Kid, you gave me a heart attack, you should really learn to knock.\" You were speechless for a moment seeing Scarlet a bit more 'exposed' then usual. Her button up pajamas had more then a few buttons undone down far enough to give him more then a generous view of the teenager's cleavage. She looked at Neil a bit confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter?\" She said as you pointed down to her chest, she glanced down blushing a bit and quickly doing up her pajamas covering her girls up once more. \"Oops, ummm sorry about that, I was just, well in the middle of something.\" Neil had to admit, he was more then a bit curious what she had been up to, he closed the door behind him walking over to her bed. \"And what would that be?\" He said a smug look on his face, a look she returned. \"I'm not sure such a little guy like you is big enough to talk about big girls things like that. Don't think I didn't notice that my big sister status has only grown since last time we spoke. I mean you aren't even as tall as the twins anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tease before waving you closer, \"Here, let me help you up onto my bed kid. I'll show you, but you have to promise you won't tell anyone. It was hard as hell for one of my friends to get this too me.\" He nodded as he took Scarlet's hand and found himself easily pulled up onto of the sheets. Your weight along with your height reduced down so much that even this 15 year old was able to move you about more then you'd like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a seat next to Scarlet feeling like her younger sibling sitting in her shadow as she places a smartphone in her lap. \"I was just taking a few pics for my instagram and a few other for a few guys I'm chatting with on snap chat. A little boobage really gets a girl attention online and a bunch of guys really like the poor sick girl look.\" She snickered obviously enjoying the attention from so many as she looked over the comments and shares from her pictures. \"Though we aren't suppose to have phones in here, a friend of mine was able to slip it past the staff. I usually only use it in the morning before first call and after lights out. They isn't much foot traffic in the halls and my nurse doesn't check on me in the morning only the afternoons. Well, she also tends to knock unlike a little someone.\" She shoves Neil nearly knocking him over which he response with shoving her playfully back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just excited to see you, your kind my only friend in here.\" Scarlet smiled seemly happy to hear that, but then that smile turned into a smirk. \"O really? I'm sure that was the only reason you went busting into a poor young girl's room. I could of been naked in here! You were probably just being a little perv hoping to catch a glimpse of me in my birthday suit.\" She giggled a bit. </span></div></div>",

Her large thighs landing on either side of Neil's lap as the amazon sized teen straddled him, her large chest nearly hitting him in the face, he falls down onto his back. Scarlet now holding herself over top of him. \"O you like big sis and her big sexy body huh?\" She giggled, \"Well I don't know if you can handle me now, but hey when you get small enough maybe I'll find a use for you kid.\" She winked  running a hand up her thigh between her legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeil stammered for a moment, she wasn't seriously talking about using him like that, was she!? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet burst out laughing falling over onto her side laying next to him. \"O my god, the look on your face! Don't worry I'm not going to go using you as a little sex toy kid. Honestly I don't even know how, I've only seen a few videos on my phone of a girl using a dildo and from what I've seen, a guy that size probably would end up breaking. So no being a big old perv and knock ok kid?\" She said with a smile on her face. \"Or I might let that girlfriend of yours know you are peeking in on girls during your free time around her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you wouldn't! I mean it was an accident. You can't tell Nicole that! She'd kill me!\" This only made Scarlet laugh more, \"Clam down, its fine, I'm going to tell her anything since there isn't anything to tell. I know your a perfect little gentlemen and honestly I like tall guys anyway.\" She had to toss in one last jab. \"Though I had to admit, it was kind of fun teasing you a bit, might need to make that a habit.\" She rested her head in her hand as she lay on her side calming down having had her fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So anyway, what's up? I mean I know you aren't, what you must be under 4 feet tall now right?\" She asked looking him over. \"Yeah, I checked my height in my room, I'm down to 3 feet 9 inches as of this morning.\" Scarlet looked a bit shocked at the number. \"O wow sorry to hear that kid. At this rate your going to be closing in on the twins Barbie dolls in size. I might need to keep a close eye on you once you drop under two feet tall. They are sweet girls, but you are going to start looking less like a person and more like a toy when you start measuring up to their dolls like that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them talk, its a bit scary to think about how he is shrinking size and while she can be a bit blunt at times, Scarlet really seems to care. She doesn't say it, but he could see the softness in her eyes and tell she was rather worried. He had to remember she was only 15 so she was doing her best to cope with a new friend slowly shrinking away into nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours you hear a chime go off meaning its...</span></div></div>",

Neil scoots to the edge of the bed, he tossed his feet over finding them no were close to the floor. He pushes off jumping down falling for a bit before hitting the floor. In reality it really wasn't wasn't all that far, but when you are still used to only having a few inches from bed to floor at most it was difficult to get used to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeil head down to the rec room with Sarah, the feeling of the ward a lot different now that he'd lost so much of his height. He'd been short last time, but now he looked like a little kid following behind Scarlet. The once six foot Neil now found he wasn't even as tall as a teenager's bust line falling able to stand just under it with an a good 2 inches or so clearances. A thought he'd had as they walked knowing that if he stood just right he could almost hide from Scarlet using her own boobs. He was a bit to big for that kind of stunt, but it wasn't to far off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two stuck close together sitting down on one of the couches and watching a movie that was on tv. That is when the twins found them. Kellie and Allison came up to the couch rather excited to see both Scarlet and Neil though for different reasons. \"Hey big sis!\" They called out together, Scarlet smiling waving to the two. \"Hey, you two staying out of trouble?\" They nodded before simply standing there looking as if they wanted to ask something, but holding back. Scarlet rolled her eyes. \"What do you guys want, come on spill it.\" Kellie came forward, \"We wanted to umm we wanted to know if Neil would play with us. It's fun having someone closer to our size to play with and there isn't anyone our age here.\" \"Plus he is fun.\" Allison chimed in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet looked over to Neil a little nervous, he was shorter then the girls now so she wasn't sure how play time with them would really go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well its up to Neil, whatever he says goes ok?\" The two girls nod looking over to him, \"Please!

Neil are... are you serious?\" She said stammering a bit. Neil got up on his knees lifting himself up a bit to be a bit more eye to eye with  her as she sat on the bed. \"Of course, you didn't think I noticed how you look? Trust me, its not just guys online that think your pretty. I just get the perk of also getting to talk to you everyday. In fact, one of the only positives of me shrinking has been there is a bit more of you to look at each time I see you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet smiles laughing a bit. \"O, into tall girls huh? I guess that is really your only option now though isn't it Kid.\" She said a bit more playful again. \"Though, I hadn't expected you to be interested, even if I do think your rather cute. I mean I joke about being your big sis, but would you really want to be around me? I mean if I wasn't in this ward, I'd just be some freshmen in high school.\" He moves in closer placing a hand on her thigh. \"Scarlet you aren't some little kid, your a beautiful woman and the only person I've talked to since this started that makes me feel, well, feel safe. I'll admit I'm rather scared about whats happening to me and what will happen to me, but when I'm around you, I know I'll be ok.\" He smiles, \"The fact that my protector is a sexy girl is just a bonus.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet chews on her lower lip turning to face you. \"You think.. I'm sexy?\" She leans into you chest first the outline of her bra bleeding through her cute pink pajamas. \"I mean these pjs aren't exactly the most flattering thing to wear and what they have in the hospital gift shop isn't much better.\" Neil couldn't be sure if she was doing this on purpose or not, but she had to notice your eyes drifting down to the young girl's large bust only bound to get bigger as she finished developing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Though, you seem to enjoy the view all the same huh? I guess these cloths can get a bit tight around the chest.\" She smirked, she was enjoying the attention now leaning closer lightly brushing her chest up against Neil. \"Maybe, you could use those little hands of yours to, make sure they still fit in these cloths.

His hand couldn't hold even half of it, as his finger's did their best to reach around the cups of her bra. He was used to the heft of larger breasts, but each one weight a good 7 pounds at least. He had to really work his hands into them to move the massive tits about. Scarlet let out a low soft moan, \"Yeah, you like your big sis and her big tits?\" She said now looking down at him once more. He could only nod looking up to what looked like an 8 an a half foot tall Amazonian teen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet smiled a large hand reaching down and easily pushing him onto his back. She moved forward on her knees planting powerful thighs on each side of him. She then slowly sat down putting down what fleet like several hundred pounds of weight onto of Neil's lower body his legs vanishing under her tight cheeks. He struggled a bit unable to budge, the weight hurting a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it kid? Am I a bit to big for you? Here, let big sis make it better.\" She said blushing as she leaned forward freeing his legs only to have her chest press him down into the bed, the heavy bust pressing down on his stomach. He wasn't complaining though, he couldn't as large powerful lips wrapped over his as she gave him a long slow kiss. He didn't know what to do, as he felt himself growing hard as he was both enjoying himself and was scared of the power this 15 year old had over him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet perked up, her face red, \"Is that... is that your little penis rubbing against my leg?\" She seemed a bit flustered by this, she was young and obviously only ever talked to boys and that had mostly been online. So having this what she saw positive attention not just from some kid, but a man even a small one was overwhelming for her. Neil wasn't sure what she had planned, but then the morning bell run. Scarlet looking up and then back down to Neil climbing off of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we will have to continue this another time, wouldn't want someone walking in on us, wondering were we went huh?\" Neil only nodded his head still trying to wrap his head around what he'd gotten himself into.

Your legs are longer.\" He didn't see it, but Scarlet enjoyed that little comment, \"Well it just gives you more to look at right? Besides, I'm guessing you like the view back there.\" She teased glancing over her shoulder to see that little Neil was looking down to see her tight rear softly shifting with each step. Her heart fluttered having his attention like this, \"And soon enough you'll have to look up to see that sight. Don't worry though, I'll make sure to slow my pace a bit so you can take it all in when that happens.\" She giggles a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet had really taken to her role as large and in charge over her shrinking friend. She'd always loved male attention ever since her 12 birthday, but she'd been in the ward for so long she'd gotten so little of it. The guys she met online were nice and all, but nothing beat the real deal and as he shrank  it let her keep him to herself. After all he couldn't leave as long as he was shrinking and she knew Neil saw her as his only life line in the ward.

You grabbed Scarlet's hand not wanting to be left behind, the action causing her to look down smiling at you gripping your small hand in hers. \"Lets go over here, its not so crowded.\" She said leading Neil over to the far corner of the rec room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was right, the people thinned out soon leaving only a handful other then yourself and Scarlet. \"Were you getting a bit nervous there kid?

Kellie and Allison ran up on the two at first just telling Scarlet about their day and what they'd been up to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeil hoped that somehow, someway he'd be lucky enough that they would just not notice him and leave.

His new eye line was just about with their lips so he had to turn his head up a bit to meet their playful gaze. He could tell by the look in their eyes they enjoyed it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet looked over all three from above, never saying anything just giggling a bit finding the situation rather cute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, big sis, can we play with Neil today?\" Allison asked, not Neil, but Scarlet if they could play.

Where are you!\" echoed Cyndie's voice. \"She's in here\" answered Neil as he saw the door was open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,sorry if she woke you Neil\" said Cyndie as she entered his room. Neil noticed that another girl the same age as Kellie was with her. \"Oh right, you three haven't met yet right?\" said Cyndie as she got the two girls to stand next to each other.  \"Hi, I'm Neil\" said Neil as sat up. \"I'm Kellie\" said the girl that Neil first saw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allison\" said the other girl. \"Sorry about this, I had to babysit my sisters today\" said Cyndie as she held onto her two sisters. \"Its alright, so what's to happen today then?\" asked Neil. \"Well, that's up to you really. I'm stuck looking after these girls while the others are looking at the cure. You want to hang out with us?\" answered Cyndie as she smiled down at Neil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeil took a moment to think and answered...  </span></div></div>",

To his delight, he was still taller than the two girls as he was a head taller. But deep down, he felt that one day he would have to look up at them. \"He's small isn't he\" whispered Kellie to Allison. \"Even Cyndie taller than him\" spoke Allison back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come one you two, please be nice\" said Cyndie as she looked at her two sisters. \"Its fine, I guess I have to get use to it as I'm going to the kick of all size jokes\" said Neil as he smiled at the three of them. \"Right then, put your nightgown on come with us to the canteen\" said Cyndie. Neil went and got his nightgown on and went with the three of them towards the canteen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were making there way there, a woman in a nurse uniform stopped them and said, \"Doctor Jones, you have a visitor\" \"Have I, okay, can you three make it to the canteen without?\" said Cyndie as she looked at the Neil and her two sisters. \"Okay, see you in a bit\" said Neil as he and the two girls made there way towards the the canteen. \"Where's the visitor?\" asked Cyndie as she looked at the nurse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's in your office\" said the nurse. \"Okay thank you\" said Cyndie as she headed towards her office. As she made it to her office, she saw a woman with long ginger hair sitting on a chair next to her office. \"Cyndie Jones long time no see\" said the woman as she stood up and made her towards her. \"Well, if it isn't Jessica Reeds\" said Cyndie as the two of them hugged each other.   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
