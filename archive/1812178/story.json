A bright flash close by brought your attention back and you looked at the blank T.V. Again. The power had been out for the past hour and no one else was home or would be for some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat on the couch flipping though a gaming magazine you have looked through from cover to cover 6 times. Hoping that one of the articles will magically change into something new and interesting. Done with this you throw the magazine on the couch as you get up to look for something to pass the time with. You go to your garage to see if there is something you might have forgotten about that can entertain you tell the power comes back on. All of it seems like the normal stuff that your parents have left here on the off chance you and your two sisters will ever want to play with the old toys or wear your old Halloween costumes. You see a bag you remember from your childhood. It was a old kids backpack with a picture of Simba from the lion king standing on pride rock, remembering that this used to be your game bag for trips where you had your gameboy and all your games. Rummaging through the bag you pull out your old game boy. Turing it over you see a blue game in it knowing there was only one game you had in your collection that was blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was your Pokemon blue version game. Looking in the battery case you see that it still had good batteries in it. Smiling you take the gameboy back in the house and lay on the couch turning it on you get to the title screen and see a flash of lightning quickly followed by a house shaking boom of thunder. You push the start button and decide to see how far you can get by the time the power comes back on. As you push the new game button a flash of light emits from the gameboy so bright that you had to close your eyes. Scared of what is happening and blinded from the light you throw your gameboy to the other end of the couch and cover your eyes to rub the dots out of them. A boom of thunder can be heard then just a fast as the sound was there it was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was to quite you knew something was different. You move your arms and see a man in a white lab coat and a red sweater under it and some tan pants. He had an aged face and gray hair. But something was odd about him he looked kind of bury. As you look around you are now in a pitch black room with two spot lights one on him and one over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScared you ask \u201cw-w-where am I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe old man looks at you and said \u201c welcome to the Wonderful world of Pokemon...I am professor Oak....can you tell me, are you a boy or a girl?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice sounds like a recording. Less scared now you get off the floor, a hologram appears before you and has two options with the instructions to pick a gender and then press the green button at the bottom of the hologram to continue.</span></div></div>",

Next your body starts to tingle and then you notice your clothes feel different. You look down and see your favorite (zippered) hoodie. And a pare of your tan baggy cargo pants with your tennis shoes. Then you feel a weight on your back and see a backpack appear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou examine yourself for a couple of minutes. Feeling fascinated by this you press the girl button. The tingling returns. after the tingling dies down you notice the hologram is now a little closer to your face making you think that you are a little shorter. You look down and see a black tank top and some decent sized boobs staring back at you with a white skirt beneath them. Your socks are now higher up your legs and you are wearing some pink girly tennis shoes. You feel something tickling your shoulders and quickly look up at them only to notice there is nothing there you reach to the top of your head and trace your hands down your silky smooth amber colored hair surprised to find you now had your mothers hair color, you find your hair now ends at about shoulder length. Again you feel the weight appear on one of your shoulders, looking at it you see a strap leading to a dark purple messenger style backpack full of stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking it would be weird to be a girl. You push the boy button again and wait for the changes to come back. Hesitating for a second you push the continue button. The hologram starts to collapse in on it's self and then altogether disappears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at the hologram waiting for it to ask about your name,and your rivals name. The hologram starts speaking again saying \u201c your adventure will unfold soon\u201d after finishing a bright light flashes blinding you and penetrating the blackness that surrounded you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as soon as it started it was complete you stood in a bed room of an unknown house in an unknown world. Suddenly a voice calls out to you telling you to hurry up and come down to show your family the clothes you are going to wear tomorrow....</span></div></div>",

You quickly glanced around the room to get a feel for it, the walls were white with one window on the opposite side of the door and a bed next to the window. A bookshelf sat next to your bed and was full of what looked like text books of all kinds. Then there was a closet with very little clothes out of place. And finally on opposite sides of the door there was a small end table with a little TV On it, and a desk on the other side. You looked down and saw the clothes you were wearing in the black room and felt the backpack on your back. You guessed this is what you were supposed to be modeling for your family so you went down stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking slow through the house so you could find your way around without looking like this is the first time you have ever seen this house. You find your way to the living room and see your mom and sisters chatting while waiting for you. You were stunned the people before you were your family from the real world. You were happy to know that the people you have grown up with would still be here for support. The only difference was that your sisters were a lot younger then they used to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk in the room you family looked at you and start complimenting you on the clothes you picked. Your sisters got up and ran around you talking about how cool you looked and how jealous they were that you were going to start your journey as a Pokemon trainer tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around and didn't see your dad in the room, you turned to your mom and asked \u201c hey mom where's dad?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked kind of surprised that you asked that and said \u201c he took a job a week ago protecting a wealthy family on their way back home. he said it would be a couple weeks tell he was back. I though I told you that already, that is why he won't be here to see you off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that you hung out with your family for the rest of the day, you played games and watched some TV Then had a big dinner, and special goodbye and good luck cake for dessert. After dinner your mom told you to go to bed you had a big day tomorrow and you had best not be tired for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went back up stairs with no arguments and got comfy in your bed watching a Pokemon battle on the TV In your room before drifting off to sleep...</span></div></div>",

Sitting in your bed trying to calm your nerves you hear something outside. It sounded like people were coming towards your house and whispering. You peaked out to make sure they couldn't see you. You saw two people one girl with bright orange hair tied into two pony tails on the back of her head. a low cut tank top with a capital \u201cR\u201d centered on the shirt. And a short skirt with knee length socks and tennis shoes. Next to her was a man with short dark hair it was to dark for you to see anything defining about his face or body but he looked like a walking tank towering over the girl with bulging muscles, he wore a dark trench coat opened that hung down to about mid calf with combat boots and a tee shirt under his trench coat with the same capital \u201cR\u201d as the girl had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching them the girl was the only one talking, the guy was either silently listening or completely ignoring the girl you couldn't tell from the look on his face. As they got closer to your house you freaked out and grabbed your clothes pulling them on as fast as you could then grabbing your backpack  you headed to your moms room, you open the door and she turns around as fast as she could holding a bat in one hand and three small balls which you recognized as poke balls in the other. She relaxed a little once she noticed it was you. She looked at you trying her best to hide her fear and whispered \u201c I-I need you to do me a favor honey. Please, as quietly as you can get your sisters and get them away from here as fast as you can.go to the next town over and get to this house\u201d she pulls out a piece of paper and hands it to you.\u201d Don't come back for me no matter what, once I am done here I will find you at that address.....now go please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou nod at her knowing how hard it was for her to let you go knowing that she may not see you again. You sneak to your sisters room go to there closet and grab two dresses for them. Then walk over to Becky. You put your hand over her mouth so she won't scream or yell when you wake her up and shake her tell her eyes are open then whisper \u201c shhhhh, don't talk right now and get ready to go we are going on a little walk right now.\u201d then you go over to Vanessa and do the same thing. Once they are ready you rush them down stairs. You hear foot steps on the porch getting closer to the front door. Just to make sure you look around the corner and see two shadows looming in the doorway.. this sent a shiver down your back as you hugged the walk next to your sisters. then the girl starts saying that she will have this door open in a jiffy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou silently push your sisters towards the back of your house and listen for the click of the door unlocking. You get to the back door and hear the inevitable click, you hear the door open and the two walk in to the house complementing on how well decorated it was. They were heading towards the kitchen which was the room right next to the one you and your sisters were in currently, when you hear a warping sound and see a bright fire being blown down the stairs, this startled the girl as she jumped and yelled.. they guy just looked at the source of the fire. This gave you the perfect opportunity to escape out the back. You open the door and rush your sisters out. Standing on the back porch you were about to leave when you.....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hear the sound of a compressed air release. A second later you hear Vanessa cry out then watch as she touches a small red dart in her arm then falls limp to the ground, you look down at her and start shaking her gently trying to wake her up, calling her name as you do so. Then another compressed air release and Becky cry's out then falls limp. Thinking you are no good to them if you get hit you get up and start running towards where you heard the gun. Trying to run in serpentine patterns so as to try and prevent a clear shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile running a sound behind you startles you enough to make you look back to see what happened, you see a hole in the back of the house with small flames on a couple of the ends. You then notice two henchmen running away with your sisters on their backs. You hear the air release once more and feel a sharp pinch in your back. Everything starts going black and the last thing you heard was your mom looking from the hole in the wall screaming \u201cNoooooooo\u201d as loud as she could before everything faded to darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly begin to toss and turn, your mind is foggy and you are having difficulty moving your arms and legs. You hear a voice around you saying \u201c oh I think this one is waking up, bring me my notes and work table in here now. The boss wants results now... and I plan on delivering\u201d. Slowly you came to, to the lighting of florescent light bulbs. The room was completely white there was a mirror on one side a door on the other side. Other then that it looked just like a doctors office. You start freaking out scared, yelling out for help and struggling to get free only to realize you are strapped to a bed. With an IV in your arm<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man in a lab coat sitting in a doctors chair looks at you and say's \u201c it is no use we have strapped you down tight, it would be hard for a master escape artist to get out of the position you are in. so how about we relax and talk for a few minutes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou stop struggling and glare at him and say \u201c where is my family?\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that is a valid question maybe this will answer that for you\u201d he pulls out a remote looks at it for a few seconds before pressing a sequence of buttons on it. A hole in the wall opens behind you and it lights up the blank wall in front of you. Once the picture sharpens you see the screen split in two ways one showing each of your sisters strapped to a bed just like you with a nurse to the right of each bed. The guy stood next to you and said \u201c has there ben any change in the subjects?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthey replied with \u201cno sir, subject 1 and 2 have yet to wake up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n he turns to you and says \u201cSee they are fine? Now let me tell you why you are here, I am sure you know who we are\u201d he opens his lab coat and shows a big red R on his shirt, you nod in acknowledgment and he continues \u201c well in secret we are in a ongoing war with the other....aggressive diplomatic organizations such as Team Magma and Aqua to name a couple. Well.....we are on the losing side currently, that doesn't sit to well with the boss so we have a plan to fix that..... one of the main problems with Pokemon is that they understand us alone, they can learn how we are as people; and help us fight for that single person because of a bond between them. But we have found that that is not enough motivation for them. They fight selfishly for just their owner. Our plan though can change that if all goes as planned. If Pokemon don't understand how to fight for a cause then we need to find a replacement. As scientists we have been working tirelessly for a few years to perfect a new technology it will be able to change the test subject into a Pokemon in body and power. The only limitation's that we have found is that all the legendary Pokemon we have attempted have failed miserable for one reason or another. And then there is also the fact that going from a human to Pokemon you don't know how to use their powers so that means we have to use first stage Pokemon that way we can give the person enough time to learn there attacks and experiment with their bodies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou look at him trying to comprehend what he told you. Then ask \u201c so what does that have to do with me and my sisters?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nhe smiles and say's \u201c bravo it took the last test subject an irksome amount of time to think of that question. Well my little friend it means that you and your sisters have won the first place prize of being our final test subjects......before we move on to our willing participants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opens and a nurse walks in wheeling a large cart. And the doctor grabs a clipboard off the cart and begins looking it over while saying \u201c because you are not an official member of Team Rocket we won't make you join our war. You would be like all the other Pokemon we have that don't have the heart to win this war. So before this begins I need to know do you want to join our war or be released into the wild once we are done here? And if you have any other questions before your vocabulary is extremely limited you better ask now.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The first person on the list was a girl looking for a water Pok\u00e9mon, her first option was a squirtle. And her name was Holly; you thought that would be a fun Pok\u00e9mon to be you would have lots of power and the shell would be an amazing defense. You then look at the girls stats; she was top of her class in the recruit training. She is planning on getting in the Pok\u00e9mon thief section. You almost made your mind up right then with her when her stats in battle caught your attention, it read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnable to command pokemon with authority, used pokemon to shield herself to reach the end first.\u201d<br>\r\nNext there was a guy named Jack looking for an onix. Thinking, that much power would be fun to wield you think about it but you can\u2019t imagine not having your arms and legs so that option was out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As you looked over the list you found some possible candidates but all the Pok\u00e9mon they wanted were not your type, like the guy that wanted a magmar. Although it was a powerful Pok\u00e9mon it was not your type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you see one that just catches your eye. The girl wanted a psychic Pok\u00e9mon. Her name was Anna. You didn\u2019t know why but it just called to you. The first Pok\u00e9mon on her list was an abra. Though you knew they slept for 16 hours a day you have always liked and wanted the ability to lift objects with your mind and the body seemed strong to you with the look like it was always wearing armor. You were awe stricken thinking about abra it was the best choice you could have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then read her stats and see that she was very shy and quiet. She wanted to join the thief section like holly but a side note said she wanted to keep some of the Pok\u00e9mon she stole so she could build a strong team. She passed all her classes just under Holly but the main difference was her stats for battles. It read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAstounding control of her Pok\u00e9mon, seemed to be able to predict the moves of her opponent. Though she had a slower run then her classmates she was undoubtedly more thorough in her runs and very protective of her Pok\u00e9mon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was it you knew your choice and didn\u2019t want to look at any of the others. You call the doctor over and tell him you want to be Anna\u2019s partner. He was a little surprised but went with it. He called over the nurse and told her to bring the trolley he got the clipboard from. Then looked at you and said \u201cwe will begin shortly once we are ready we will give you the shot. From what I could tell from previous tests it hurts\u2026. A lot but you need to do it without drugs or it could affect you later. Now just relax once we are ready you will know.\u201d He then went to work with his nurse finding the vial and prepping for your change<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You sit in the bed as the doctor and nurses quickly move around you, you don't know what they are doing but they are all working on something. One of the nurses grabs the gurney you are in and moves you to one side of the room. The doctor tells everyone he is opening the tank so watch your step. After he pushes a couple buttons on the computer a door on the floor opens to revile a cylindrical tank. One of the other nurses walks over tells you to open your mouth then puts a regulator so you could breath and wraps a strap around the back of your head so it wouldn't come out. She quickly unstraps your arms and legs then holds out her hand waiting for you to grab it then helps you off the gurney. She brings you to the edge of the tank and tells you to get in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe liquid in the tank looked like water but was thicker, like motor oil. You sit on the edge and dip your foot in. it was really cold. The nurse sighs and pushes you into the liquid, you begin to panic but find you can breath because of the regulator and the tank was rising out of the ground until it connected with the top seal inside the ceiling. After you calm down and your body adjusted to the cold liquid you were floating in, you open your eyes and see all the nurses staring at you through the tank. The doctor is looking at the mirror in the room and it looked like he was talking to it but you couldn't hear anything after a couple minutes he nods then walks over to the computer presses a button and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell we are all ready to begin, I know you can't speak right now because of that regulator in your mouth but I just wanted to explain a couple things to you. This process should be short only lasting a couple hours. Once we are done you will be transferred to our poke center. Once you wake up from there and they give us the go ahead you will begin our training to see if this program really is worth delving deeper into or if we should quit now. Oh and I really hope you keep your word after this and stick with team rocket. If not you will receive a fitting punishment and I don't want that to happen to my new test subject probably as much as you don't. We will now begin our procedure try and relax.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nhe pressed a couple more buttons and once more you were surrounded by silence only the noises of you breathing in the water to keep you company through this scary time. The doctor pressed a green button and you heard the tank come to life. Mechanical arms began lowering themselves until they surrounded you. Then they grabbed your body in different places and you felt many pricks all over your body and the arms quickly retracted back into the top of the tank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began feeling dizzy and a dull heat formed in your body. Slowly you began getting hotter and hotter, you look down and see your chest was hardening into a dark brown plate. The rest of your body began lightening to a gold yellow as new plates began forming. The heat spread to your feet, you looked down and saw your feet collapsing in on themselves, you could feel each bone break as the toes merged together until you had two large toes in the front you wiggled them to see if they were real. As you watched them wiggle you felt a sharp pain from the back of your feet you watched as your heel's pushed out tell you had one toe back there as well. The armor like shell encased your feet and rose up your body until you felt a tingling sensation in your tailbone. You reached back and felt a small stub slowly and painfully pushing out taking a deep breath you try pushing out like you are taking a dump and practically scream through the regulator as the tail pushes further and further out. Your shoulders begin aching badly while you focus on your tail. You look and see armor pads pushing out on each side. If you could you would probably be crying from this procedure from all the pain you are in. The tingling moved down your arms reforming them to skinny less muscle arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard your hands start cracking and see them reforming into stubby claws.your neck seemed to shrink into your body and your face slowly began reforming. Your hair fell completely out and your ears slid up your head and pointed out at the top looking almost like a hairless foxes ears. Your mind was screaming at what was going on it was so painful you close your eyes, when you try to open them you find it is getting harder to open them completely, you begin feeling really tired. And your mind just goes blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly come back to consciousness and find you are lying in a soft comfy bed tossing and turning. And suddenly bolt upright. You were panicking you tried to open your eyes only to find that they barely opened, it felt like there were weights attached to them and pulling them closed as you tried to open them.when you do get your eyes half way open you see a bright room with white walls bottles and cabinets all over it. There was a mirror on the other side of the room but your body felt weak so you know you couldn't get up and look at your self just yet. You looked down and saw the hard gold and brown shell of your new body. Finally it was becoming unbearable you could not keep your eyes open any longer it felt like you were trying to stay awake when you are completely exhausted and you quickly shut them. As you closed your eyes your ears perk up as you heard something coming, it was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>you could hear the pitter pater of feet... bare feet and heeled shoes walking on tile. They stopped right outside your door and then walked in, the first to enter was a girl that seemed to be covered in short pink fur with darker pink hair on her head she wore a red dress with a pocket up-front. In the pocket was a large egg. (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://browse.deviantart.com/?qh=&amp;section=&amp;q=chancy+girl#/dux1rj\" target=\"_blank\">http://browse.deviantart.com/?qh=&amp;sectio...</a>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nshe sped into the room bursting with energy and went straight over to you, she began checking your stats on a monitor beside you and then turned to you. As she worked she noticed that your head was turned so that you were facing her and said in a cheerfully soft voice \u201coh good morning, I wasn't expecting to see you awake... though it has been about three days of you being out cold but now you are awake and by the looks of it you are still not fully recovered that surprises me though because your kind normally sleep for 16 hours a day and are well rested and recovered after that. But you have slept for three days and are still recovering, I don't know that seems kind of weird to me. Oh sorry am I talking to much? I have a tendency to just ramble on and on and on.\u201d you were a little taken a-back by her she didn't stop talking from the moment she walked into the room and noticed you were awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only were you awestricken by the chancy and her talking but what really surprised you was that even though your eyes were closed you could still see, it wasn't like when your eyes were open and could see in color it was more like movement caused things to ripple and anything that the ripple touched you could see until the ripples stopped. you noticed as chancy picked up a clipboard from the counter all the ripples were white when moving over inanimate objects but apparently for living creatures they pulsed with there heartbeats in different colors, like the chancy was pulsing in a bright pink color that illuminated all her features for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was kind of disorienting, seeing like this for the first time. It wasn't something that you could just turn on or off it was constantly pulsing, but no matter how much pulsing you saw it was never to much it wasn't over exerting your mind or anything it was just there. Then you could see another pulse this one yellow and coming from the floor by the door, your ears perked up and you could hear footsteps outside the door again. Then suddenly in walked a familiar figure. Though you had only seen them in the show you knew it was a nurse joy, the yellow pulses made her radiate like a Divine angel ready to help heal you any way she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard her say \u201cSo chancy hows the patient today?\u201d chancy looked at the nurse and said \u201c he is doing good, and he finally woke up.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou assumed that what the nurse heard was just chancy saying her name a couple times with a smile on her face but it didn't really matter as the nurse noticed you moving around. And said \u201coh good he is awake, that means he is almost ready to get to work with his new trainer.\u201d smiling she walked up to you and said \u201cI know this is a big change for you, I know that you used to be human and this body will take some getting used to but I need to emphasis how important it is for you to not let other Pokemon know you were human we don't know how they will react. And it might be dangerous to ether you or your trainer. The only ones besides me chancy that know are very high ups and your trainer. So please keep hushed about this to any Pokemon you may meet\u201d she looks at you as if expecting a conformation that you understood. To which you noded at her. She smiled again and said \u201c Now that that is cleared up starting when you are fully recovered you will begin getting training for your Psychic powers, so rest up\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nafter they checked a few more things with your stats and gave you a bowl of food they said good bye for now and left you all alone in the room. A couple minutes after they left you got tired of seeing the constant ripples so you decided that you will still try to use your eyes as much as possible. You opened your eyes as far as you could just to feel the strain from before, you slowly closed your eyes until the strain was gone and luckly it was before they were completely closed. You happily looked around the room and then down at the food they left you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You looked down at the food only to find that the food looked like big kernels of dog food and the smell wasn't that great ether so you decided that you would eat later and closed your eyes to go to sleep.</span></div></div>",

Once there some unfortunate events lead to you being stuck as a Pokemon. Will you accept life as a Pokemon? Will you fight it and try to get back to at least being human if not back to your world you know and love? And what trials will you face on your journey?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can be any Pokemon in any form (regular Pokemon,anthros,Pokegirls or guys,or other morphs you can think of.)<br>\r\nthe only rule is you will always be seen as only a regular Pokemon and you can only communicate with people the same as if you were a full Pokemon ie: they won't understand your words. on the plus side you can talk regularly with any type of Pokemon. And you can see other anthro, pokegirls or morphs as they truly are and not just regular Pokemon (like humans see them)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nand no legendary/super powerful Pokemon morphs. i guess i will allow it if you are not all powerful. if you can 1 hit K.O. any Pokemon then no that is not allowed but if you still have to fight and struggle in the battle then i will accept it i guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\ni will encourage you to write a chapter (good ones will get GP's) i normally only write one chapter and wait for someone else to add to the story so everyone gets the chance to write a story if they want. so if you want me to write more add a chapter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nand please add detail to the chapter. the more the better<br>\r\n<br>\r\nhave fun with it, and hope you add to my story</td>",
