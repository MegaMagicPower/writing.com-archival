You had told yourself you were going to be productive today, but here it is mid-afternoon and your only accomplishment so far has been the purchase and consumption of an over-priced slice of pizza from the mall food court.  Still, the day isn't quite over\u2014if you hurry, you might yet manage to keep the weekend from being a complete waste.   You probably only have enough time to finish one of your planned tasks, but one is better than none, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most responsible course of action would be to finish up your job-hunting.  None of the places at the Mall had been accepting applications, but a bulletin board posting had mentioned that some place called \"King Applied Research Center\" might be willing to pay people to participate in their scientific studies.  Even as late as it is, you figure you still have enough time to get over there and apply if you leave right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat said, you're not quite sure you're ready to leave just yet\u2014there's a new store here at the mall that looks strangely interesting.  You've never really been a big fan of magic tricks, but there's something about this \"Spells R Us\" store that just seems to call to you.  You tell yourself you should just come back later when you're not so busy, but somehow you can't shake the feeling that you might not get another chance.  It couldn't hurt to check it out, could it?  At the very least you might find some cool posters or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, your best friends Kyle and Matthew were planning on exploring that old abandoned mansion at the edge of town today.  You'd told them you couldn't go because you'd be too busy job-hunting, but after today's unrelenting series of failures you could really use a break.  They should be leaving about this time\u2014if you call now, they could probably swing by and pick you up on their way over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing again at your watch, you realize it's now four-fifteen.  Whatever you decide to do, you'd better get going soon.</span></div></div>",

How can we help enrich your life today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh, heard you guys were looking for participants for some kind of study?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right!  Here at King Applied Research Center we're always working for the betterment of mankind, but this quarter has been exceptionally exciting!   As we speak, several of our most groundbreaking long-term projects are nearing completion and entering the testing phase.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if from nowhere Rosa produces a stack of papers, which she then hands to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By signing these papers you agree that any and all information, trade secrets and unreleased technology within this building are the sole property of King Applied Research Center, and that you will not reveal to anyone, in whole or in part, any details of our projects or your participation therein.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter flipping through the papers to confirm that they were, in fact, a standard nondisclosure agreement, you sign with the provided pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent!\" says Rosa with a smile.  \"Now, as I said, there are several ongoing studies in which your participation would be most valuable.  You will, of course, be well compensated for your time. My personal favorite is the IDTS.  That's short for Inter-Dimensional Temporal Shifting.  In addition to being one of the first to experience the wonders of paradox-free time travel, you'd be paid $2000 for your\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The wonder of what now?\" you exclaim.  \"You're pulling my leg, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa smiles warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a common reaction among those new to our research, but I assure you the technology is quite real.  However, your skepticism is understandable.  For that reason I would like to remind you that you will receive the full $2000 for your participation whether or not the trial proves successful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh\u2026right,\" you say.  \"Still, are there any trials being conducted in <i>this</i> dimension?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, most certainly!\" says Rosa. \"Over in Experimental Neurology they're currently testing an exciting new consciousness transference protocol.  While we're not offering quite as much for participation in that study, it's another personal favorite of mine.  Compensation in that study falls between $1000 and $1500, depending on the particulars of your trial.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds interesting,\" you say, \"what's a consciousness transference protocol?\"<br>\r\n\"To put it in layman's terms, CTP is what you might call 'mind switching' or 'body swapping.'  It's quite safe, and sure to be all the rage when it's released to the public in a few years.  Once again, you'll be paid whether or not anything actually happens, so please put aside your skepticism.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh\u2026 right then,\" you say.  \"Is there anything else?  Maybe something\u2026 less weird?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa looks disappointed, but only for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you really wanted, you could participate in one of our more mundane studies.  The Experimental Neurology department is also collecting data for one of their other projects, still in the design phase.  All you'd need to do is let us scan an image of your brain for later use in development.  It's an entirely passive process, and has no effect on the subject whatsoever.  You simply sit down, let us take an image of your brain, and walk out.  We can only offer $50 for your participation, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause to consider your options.  Rosa looks at you appraisingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know,\" she says.  \"There's one other program that might be perfect for you.  You look about seventeen or eighteen; you're probably looking to participate in these studies as a means to help pay for college, no?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be honest, you were more concerned with having a little pocket money for dates and videogames, but the college thing is important too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah,\" you say.  \"Always preparing for the future, that's me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good,\" she says, \"because here at King Industries, we're dedicated to the future too.  And the future isn't just about fancy gadgets and scientific discoveries; more than anything, it's about the people who are going to live there.  That's why, starting this year, we're opening a brand new university to educate the young men and women that will one day inherit our legacy.  Our vision is to create an institution that will combine all the personal attention of a small school with the tremendous knowledge and resources of King Applied Research Center.   All of which will be provided at no cost to you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\" you say.  \"Are you offering me a full-ride scholarship to your new college?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right; as one of our first students your tuition will be entirely waived, food and board will be provided at no cost and you will receive an additional stipend each semester to cover books, supplies, and entertainment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't I have to, you know, apply or something first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all.  One of the central innovations of the King Model for Higher Education is our comprehensive placement test.  No matter what your talents, we're confident we can find a place for you at King University.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n While you scramble for a response, the phone rings and Rosa smiles apologetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to get that\" she says.   \"Just come tell me when you've made a decision, and we can start the appropriate paperwork.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she leaves to answer the phone, leaving you momentarily unsupervised.</span></div></div>",

Follow this way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she leads you down countless corridors, up and down numerous elevators until you finally reach a pair of riveted stell doors. Rosa presses a button on the wall, and the doors slide open to reveal a room, seemingly full of machinery. Here a wire, there a weird tube, and finally in the middle, is a metallic chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Step inside and sit down on the chair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly step forward... Then when nothing springs out of the wall to get you, you relax. The chair feels cold, and on closer inspection has wires stuck all over. Then, you notice Rosa is still near the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rosa, what are you doing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry. I just have to operate the machine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncomfortably, you slump down in the chair. Then, Rosa presses a button labeled \"start\" and.... It starts.

The door opens, again with Rosa, but this time, Penelope steps in, though backwards. Penelope! Of course! She's the kind of girl who would do this. Maybe I could start up a chat with her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sits down right where you are, and you take the opportunity to look at her huge boobs up her sweater. But then, you realise something.

The room spins, and your fingers dig into the arms of the chair. You can't tell up from down, and are terrified about being thrown to the ceiling, to the walls, as the room continues to tumble around you. Pressing yourself deeper into the chair, you curl your legs beneath, and dig your nails in, until they hurt. You refuse to let this damned chair throw you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to call out, to beg Rosa to abort. This can't be normal, you tell yourself. The tumbling sensation continues, as the room looks like it's steady, but every other sense in your body tells you it's spinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa sees your distress, reading your face. Easily she navigates, the dizzying turmoil to reach you. You force a weak, \"Help me.\", but you can't even be sure you even whispered the words. Nausea rises in your throat, and fighting not to puke, you swallow reflexively.  You don't want to puke over Rosa, you don't want to piss off your rescuer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRidding yourself of the conflict, you close your eyes to the untrustworthy steady room. Focusing instead on controlling your stomach against the spinning sensation. Eyes screwed tight shut, you feel yourself sink into and through the chair. Rather as if you're being pulled from your body. Ripped out, you dig your nails in deeper, but it still feels as if you're slipping from your body instead of the seat. Thoughts become strained, and instinct rules you, as your concentration flees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne eye is pried back open, and Rosa looms in front of one eye. She's saying something, but you can't hear what. A deafening silence steals away her words. You try to read her lips, her expression to work out what she's saying.</span></div></div>",

Knowing the effect it'll have on men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorryingly, you discover a strong leather collar secured around your neck. Your fingers tremble when you discover the padlock holding it in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/49/4a/cf/494acf25dc7d380b7671942bcd9fda55.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/49/4a/cf/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turn around girl.\" A stern voice snaps the command out. The hand landing on your shoulder tells you, that he's talking to you. Also being on your knees, you half-expect a command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuffling around, you wonder if you've landed in some sexist nightmare, where women are possessions. Your bust sloshes as you unevenly hobble around. Already dreading how valuable you'd be, with your insanely busty body. You doubt you'd ever escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a relief, when you finish turning to find yourself facing a woman. At least her skirt, a sigh of relief spilling from your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat doesn't stop her attaching a leash to your collar. \"B... But... I'm a woman too.\" you fight not to wail the last words in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/74/df/8d/74df8d4916a70c3f6b21f98a4176c520.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/74/df/8d/...</a></span></div></div>",

Behind one of the lockers, of course, and away from Trish to provide you some privacy. It's uncomfortable enough having for yourself to look down and peel off the cheerleading blouse, forcing them past the obtruding rack and giving you a peek of the plain white sports bra. Then the skirt falls down and you only briefly touch your crotch, feeling the patch of hair beneath with a tiny crevice in place of your penis. You quickly slip on the shorts, figure out how to put on the crop top, and exchange Andrea's gym shoes for sandals. You throw the red bra behind your back as you step out and head towards Trish. There are some things you won't be putting on, if not never then at least not yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish leads you out of the locker room and down a dark, dimly lit hallway. \"This is underneath the fitness center, gymnastics room, wrestling room, swimming pool, basketball court, and inside football stadium,\" she says, occasionally peeking over her shoulder, eyes inevitably falling on your chest. As friendly as she tries to be, something about you having giant boobs bothers her to no end. Her jokes earlier gave you more than a subtle hint at that, and to be honest, you can't ignore them so easily either...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you try. \"That's a lot of areas in one building,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods. \"Yeah, but as you can imagine, this isn't any ordinary college. It's meant to be the best of the best, with a place inside it for everybody. The college board even intends to add an interior baseball field along with tennis courts, a bowling alley, mini-golf, the works.\" You have to admit, all of this sounds damn impressive, but the real clincher is: \"All in the next three months too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really!?\" your voice swoops really high in genuine surprise. \"The college can build all that in three months?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The people here,\" Trish says, \"have ways of doing everything.\" You catch the subtext, and hush up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leads you up a set of stairs and past the variety of impressive rooms, all of them filled with college boys and girls engaging in whatever activities the space is intended to provide. \"This is where we would have been working out,\" Trish says, gesturing to the glass doors to the fitness centers. Treadmills, weights, and exercise bikes abound, and near the back you see a dance studio. Yeah, you're definitely glad you skipped out on the immediate work out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, the lush, expansive campus takes your breath away. You can't tell what state you're in because the landscape seems to encompass the best of all worlds--literally! Evergreens and forested areas suggest the Midwest, Gothic architecture calls to mind New England, a nice, warm sun and extensive array of beaches bordering large, horizon-reaching lakes (or oceans) take cues from the lower West and East coasts, while some mountains in the distance are pure Colorado / Rocky Mountain affairs. In all your college searching, the small amount you've done, never have you seen anything quite like this. Barring the unpleasant identity shift, this would be the perfect college experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish shows you the various art and creative centers geared towards writing, painting, sculpting, drawing, acting, dancing, film-making, video game design, et cetera ad infinitum. The science, mathematics, and psychology center covers the width of at least five football fields, and--for that matter--there is an outside football field as well, along with tennis courts and a racetrack, separate from the football field. That's a first. The tour ends at the residential area, which might as well count as a single suburban town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I believe that's a good overview of King Applied Research University,\" Trish announces with a well-rehearsed smile. I grimace at the name. \"Yeah, I know, they're still working on an official name. That'll probably come in the next few weeks once some more students trickle in. Now then...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You and Trish arrived at the residential complex. \"Fortress, more like,\" you think, staring up at the twenty-story, U-shaped brick monstrosity. \"And all of the students reside in there?\" you say out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not including the underground dormitories,\" Trish says, \"which are spread all around campus. You can access those from this building though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can tell from the way Trish rattled that off, that she meant to catch you off guard and amaze you. When you shoot her a suspicious glance, she sticks her teeth out in a disarming, sugary smile. \"You're sweet,\" you think, \"but sometimes, I can't tell if you're against me or with me.\" You decide for now that Trish cares for you, at least while you're a new student and she can show you around; but you're not sure if the friendship will survive beyond that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway,\" she says, and the two of you approach the center of the \"U\" from inside its arms, \"the King-and-Queen's Living Quarters are split into two halves for each gender. Girls are on the left. Guys are on the right.\" She stops and takes you by the shoulder. \"And you know which one you live in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The left,\" you say. \"I wish you'd stop acting like I don't know who I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish flinches at your tone. \"I just wanted to make sure,\" she says. \"If you go to the right by mistake, especially the way you're dressed right now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou catch her drift. \"Right. Ugh!\" Goosebumps rattle along your skin, and you feel chilly all over. \"I really hope Andrea has some more modest outfits in her dorm room,\" you whimper. You tug at the halter top, trying to obscure your cleavage as much as is possible. Trish only smiles at the effort. You're relieved to see, at least, that she finds it endearing, rather than another sign of your bimbo nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are countless windows and sliding glass doors all around you, at least fifty per wall on each floor, and that's not including the sides of the building you can't see. Every dormitory on the second floor and above has a balcony; and you see a few students tending to extravagant gardens they've built along the railings. But despite the elegance, which reminds you more of luxury apartments than student housing, you notice that there are only two ways to enter the building. Right at the symmetrical center of the \"U\", you see two doors next to each other with the generic \"male\" and \"female\" figures that you always find on public restrooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the entrance?\" you scoff. \"What do you do if you're transgendered? Is there a place for non-gender students?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish ignores the question. She enters a combination into the keypad on the female door's handle. It cracks open and suddenly you're inside. Your eyes adjust to the mellow brown that colors the entrance lobby. It's modest in size, but still akin to what you'd expect at a decent hotel. Heat radiates from a steel-grated fireplace on the left wall. Chaise lounges and plush arm chairs form a semicircle around it, on top of dim green carpeting. You gawk at the melting-pot array of female students transiting back and forth across the lobby. They represent every ethnic, racial and social group you could possibly think of. How many students are at this university?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Amy!\" Trish waves at one of the students sitting in an armchair. You walk past before you get a good look at her, aside from a thin, pale arm shooting up to wave back. A voice calls out from the other side of the lobby, \"Who's the new girl?\" in a British accent that briefly excites you, as it might have when you were a guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The best damn cheerleader this school is going to have!\" Trish yells back. She looks at you and winks. You don't stop blushing until you're through the double doors on the other side of the lobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't kidding about the transgender question,\" you say. The spiraling staircase taking you up each floor (and extending below the ground at least four stories) rises steeply, and if you look up too long, you start to feel dizzy. You focus instead on the nape of Trish's neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know from experience,\" she says. \"You live in whatever residential area matches your physical sex. End of story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't there any non-gendered people?\" you try. \"Is anybody given a body that's mid-transition or, or an identity that doesn't ascribe to either gender? It's a diverse campus. There's got to be someone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish goes quiet. \"There's a lot,\" she eventually says, \"that King Applied Research is still working to implement at the university. You have to remember that this is an experimental institution. We're technically not even open yet for another year... If they like what they see, they'll be accepting applications from the public.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And will those students have to be different people?\" you ask, although you realize right away that it's the wrong question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish stops in her tracks, halfway up the stairs connecting the fourth with the fifth floor. She squeezes the baluster tightly. A tense sigh escapes her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember what I said,\" she says, cutting each word short. \"We don't talk about our old lives. Or who anyone is. Aside from who we are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold up your hands. \"All right! All right!\" you say. You flash her a guilty grin, but she's already continuing on her way. You shut your mouth for the rest of the climb. \"It looks like we won't even last 'til the end of the tour,\" you think glumly, watching Trish keep her back turned to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the eighth floor, you go through a door into a tall, spacious corridor with more doors than you can count on both sides. Thankfully, your door is the third on the right. Trish pulls out a key, hands it to you, and with another one unlocks your door. \"And here,\" she says, mustering up a little bit of her old showmanship, \"is your room...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opens. Your eyes widen...</span></div></div>",

If you make him happy, I guarantee you'll enjoy it anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head is spinning, on one hand, you could risk it by trying to get Mr. Richards to help you out.  On the other hand, you could spend some time with him and take the safe route.  What could he do after all?  Then you think about the things you'd want to do to you if you were a guy again.  A warmth moves into your belly as you think about a man as sexy as Mr. Richards doing those things to you.  Shaking your head as you walk back to the table, you make your decision.</span></div></div>",

You bounce up to him and smile.  \"I'm ready!\" You say in a sweet voice. He smiles and gets up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish says \"We'll be right there Mr. Richards. I'm going to give her some girl advice\" She winks at him and grabs hold of your arm.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing Trish.  I'll be in my limo, but don't make me wait.\" He gives her a sharp look and you can feel her shudder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he turns, she whispers in your ear, \"Listen, I'm going to do you a favor and you have to trust me on this.  I'm going to use the impression drug so that you enjoy this.  I'll change it later if you want but for now this will make it better for you.\"  She starts to lead you in the direction Mr. Richards went and whispers in your ear several different impressions.  Each one makes you more scared.  By the time you get to the limo, you know, from the impressions, that you will love the taste of his cock and cum, the feeling of him cumming on you and in you, that you will orgasm easily, and that you will enjoy him touching, rubbing, and kissing you.  \"Now have a good time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou expect Trish to have that smirk on her face but she looks nervous.  Your heart in pounding with nervousness and fear as the chauffeur opens the door.  You get in and sit down.  You've never been in a limo and never knew they were so big and luxurious.  Mr. Richards sees your amazement and hands you a glass of champagne.  \"As you can see, I have rewards for those who treat me well.\"  He smiles.  You smile back and remember how attractive he is.  The part of you that still remembers being a guy is almost sick, so you take a sip of the champagne to hide your nervousness.  When you set down the glass, you turn to ask Mr. Richards where you are going.  Before you can say a word, you feel his lips on yours.  His kiss is firm but gentle.  You've never kissed a man before but can't remember a kiss feeling this nice.  He stops and looks at you.  \"Sorry about that, usually I am a bit more of the seducer type but you are intoxicating.  I couldn't resist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's... OK. I didn't mind.\" You hear that sweet little giggle escape from your lips and blush as the male side of you realizes that you are batting your eyes at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, Mr. Richards kisses you again.  You're vaguely aware of the limo moving as he easily pulls you over and has you sit crosswise on his lap.  Wrapping your arms around his neck, you kiss back.  Tongues twirl and play.  The guy in you justifies this as just kissing but your body is responding as you wiggle on his lap.  His hand moves up under your cheer top.  You want to protest but can't stop kissing him.  His hand finds your huge left breast and begins to rub it through your bra.  The tingles that move through your body are amazing.  He lifts up the top and exposes your bra.  His fingers rub and pinch your very hard nipples.  \"Lets get you out of that top and bra.\" He says in a soft but firm manner.  You start to remove your top before you realize it.  As a small part of you wonders why you did that so willingly, he reaches back and unsnaps your bra.  His head moves down and sucks on one nipple then the other which causes you to shudder and squirm on his lap.  You feel his hand on your thigh, working it's way up toward your pussy.  As amazing as this feels, the guy side of you is completely weird-ed out.  Maybe it's time to stop it for now.  If you do stop it, you don't want to make him angry about it.  But then it does feel good.  Maybe just a little longer...</span></div></div>",

Your shorts stretched, as you pulled them on. Clinging like a second skin, and your top was just as tight, just as revealing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wore a sports bra, because you knew you'd need to... It felt like a defeat to slip into the damned thing... But, now, as you jogged about, you wished you'd worn two of the damned things. They were meant to flatten and control your bust. But your bust had other ideas. The movement was eye-catching. Especially in that red you'd chosen. You thought it was strong, but it was eye-catching. Especially with that jiggle and sway so clear beneath. You'd turned a few heads, the wolf-whistles weren't just from the guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was unsettling to be ogled and enjoyed by some of the sporty girls.

As your vision clears, the first thing you see is a collection of eager faces hovering over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe's awake!\u201d squeals one of the girls hovering over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShh!\u201d says another.  \u201cYou'll scare her.

In the process, you become aware of several things <i>very</i> wrong with your body.  The first to catch your attention is the shiny black hair that slides across your face, but it isn't long before your gaze moves downward and you're clutching at yourself in frantic horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoobs!\u201d you squeak, nearly hysterical. \u201cI have boobs!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls giggle.

As she closes the door behind you, you manage to catch a glimpse of yourself in the mirror mounted on the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring back at you is a petite Asian girl with straight black hair, dressed in a tastefully modest powder-blue blouse and skirt.  You wave, watching in fascination as the svelte young woman in the mirror waves back.  Fran indulges you for a moment, then gently grabs your shoulder and turns to face you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know\u201d she says, \u201cIt can be something of a shock a first, being placed.

You see, while there is nothing I can do to change the fact that you are presently Amy Wu, we can work together to potentially make Amy Wu more in line with your personality. The most wonderful aspect of this institution is the fact that every variable can be controlled for. You've been placed in a default personality profile, but as an assistant dean, I have the ability to make some modifications to that profile. So tell me, Amy, what about yourself are you most displeased with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think it over for a moment. This isn't how you had expected this meeting to go. It seems that you're stuck as Amy Wu, the Asian sorority sister. Despite your continued reticence, after a minute, you settle on some aspects of your personality that you think could use some adjusting. \"Well, first and foremost, I seem so boring. I looked around my room, and almost everything there was directly related to my school work. It doesn't seem like I have any hobbies, or even any interests for that matter. Second, it's bad enough that I'm a girl, I'd rather not have to make such a dramatic cultural adjustment as well. I don't know the first thing about being Asian. Finally, I feel absurdly small. I don't even weigh 100 pounds. Before all this I used to wrestle, and I wrestled at 185, and now I'm barely half that. It's just so hard moving around feeling like I might get blown away by the slightest breeze.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand completely,\" replied Ms. Souto. \"But let's unpack all of that. Generally speaking, we only like to make minor adjustments to peoples' personality profiles at any given time. It can often be counterproductive to change the profile so dramatically so soon. I would suggest selecting one of the three things you mentioned as a starting off point, and after experiencing that change, you could potentially come back for more adjustments.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, understanding. \"So where would you like to begin?\"</span></div></div>",

I wouldn't want to adjust your profile in a way you would enjoy. So when you say that this personality is overly studious, would you rather that your personality be less studious because it is less academically inclined or simply because it doesn't prioritize academics above everything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Additionally,\" Ms. Souto added, \"any changes to your personality will result in some adjustments to your history and surrounding to reflect any changes in your profile.

You were certainly cute, in an innocent way, with soft, simple features and makeup that was understated and demure. Your dress was long, flowing, and modest. In fact, your entire outfit was built for comfort, with simple white cotton underwear that did nothing to constrict or restrict you in any way. You wore no jewelry except a few clunky bracelets around your wrists. You checked your purse and found an ID, along with some post-it notes, a class planner, a calculator, many different colored pens and highlighters, a simple black phone, and some gum. Everything was very neat and organized, much in the same way as your room was. Overall, you seemed like a nice, albeit rather plain girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/q4rbgqm\" target=\"_blank\">http://tinyurl.com/q4rbgqm</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All done,\" said Ms. Souto. \"Let me just submit this and you can be on your way. I would encourage you, however, to hang out here in my office for five or ten minutes while the changes are processed.\" You again voice your understanding, and Ms. Souto enters the final few keystrokes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately upon hitting Enter, you begin to feel disoriented. Your stomach begins to get all topsy-turvy and you feel nauseous. You also begin to feel a bit fuzzy, as if you were a bit groggy, almost the same way you used to feel if you were woken suddenly and from a deep sleep. You feel a burning in your throat and actually begin to get a little dizzy. \"I feel awful,\" you say. \"Is this normal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the changes are just processing. It takes a while. Also, it's 9 AM on a Friday. You probably were out at the bar last night and didn't get much sleep.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would you know that?\" you ask. \"Well I changed your profile. The old Amy Wu never went out to parties, as she was usually at the house studying. The new Amy Wu is much more social, and goes out three to four nights per week, sometimes more. Here, let me print out your change summary and show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Souto then passes you a sheet of paper, which reads:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"><br>\r\nPREVIOUS INFO<br>\r\nAmy Wu<br>\r\nAge: 19<br>\r\nHair: Black<br>\r\nHeight: 5'5\u201d<br>\r\nWeight: 95 lbs<br>\r\nEthnicity: Asian (Chinese)<br>\r\nMeasurements: 32B-23-33<br>\r\nMajor: Chemistry<br>\r\nGPA: 3.98<br>\r\nAlcohol: N<br>\r\nSmokes: N<br>\r\nSexually Active: N<br>\r\nSex Drive: Low<br>\r\nIQ: 117<br>\r\n<br>\r\nADJUSTED INFO<br>\r\nAmy Wu<br>\r\nAge: 19<br>\r\nHair: <b>Black w/ highlights</b><br>\r\nHeight: 5'5\u201d<br>\r\nWeight: 95 lbs<br>\r\nEthnicity: Asian (Chinese)<br>\r\nMeasurements: 32B-23-33<br>\r\nMajor: <b>Fashion Design</b><br>\r\nGPA: <b>1.87</b><br>\r\nAlcohol: <b>Y</b><br>\r\nSmokes: <b>Y</b><br>\r\nSexually Active: <b>Y</b><br>\r\nSex Drive: <b>Med/High</b><br>\r\nIQ: <b>96</b><br>\r\n</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit, what did you do...\" Your response tails off as more changes begin to appear. First, your clothes begin to change. The hemline on your dress begins rising and rising until it only covers a few inches of your thighs. The dress also splits at the waist, with the lower portion tightening into a very short and revealing jean skirt. The top portion, on the other hand, changes from a flowing cotton material into a clingy, black, lacy fabric that tightens around your chest and stomach. You can also feel changes going on beneath your clothes. Your previously plain and comfortable cotton underwear also begins to change. Your bra changes to a satin material and turns black, and tightens dramatically as you feel a firm metal wire appears within the bra that presses your breasts up, creating more defined cleavage.  Your panties also change, transforming from simple white cotton into a much more daring black lace. They tighten around your hips and you feel the material shrinking, especially in the back, as the panties morph from loose, full cut, white briefs into a low-rise, sheer, black thong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow dressed, you notice that your skin is taking on a different hue. Instead of the pale white you were before, you now have a much darker glow, although it appears to be either the result of a spray tan or potentially many hours in a tanning booth. You feel a sharp prick in your navel and look to see a tawdry-looking, heart-shaped , diamond stud adorning your newly-pierced belly button. You also feel a stinging sensation on your arm as you look and see a tattoo of some Chinese symbols appear on your arm. You notice that your hair is now streaked with auburn-colored highlights, and you feel your facial features changing from a look that is pure and innocent into something much more primal and sexual. Your face is less round, adopting a more aggressive shape, and your eyes are wider and more doe-like. You feel your lips puff up as they are caked in layer upon layer of gloss. You also feel make up caking over your face, and with your smoky eyes and penciled-in eyebrows, you begin to look a bit cheap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing you do is look in your purse, which has changed from a functional satchel into a glossy, leather, designer purse. Gone are all the school supplies, planners, and pens. In their place you find numerous bar receipts, as well as condoms. Some of them are still in the wrapper, others are just empty wrappers. You find a package of small pills that you quickly recognize to be birth control. There's also some small vodka shooters, a half empty pack of cigarettes, as well as a pocket-sized pink vibrator. You notice a clean thong as well. Apparently, Amy Wu has a tendency to lose her panties. Even your phone couldn't escape, now adorned with cheap rhinestone accents, with a dangly Hello Kitty decoration, and a cracked screen. You check and notice that you had missed six texts and three calls, most of them asking where you were at three or four in the morning. You look at a small mirror hanging on the wall and get a glimpse of the new Amy Wu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/qfqtxhj\" target=\"_blank\">http://tinyurl.com/qfqtxhj</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH MY GOD!\" you exclaim. \"You turned me into a fucking slut.\" You notice it's difficult for you not to speak in such an exaggerated and vulgar manner, when just minutes before you had no problem expressing yourself cordially and politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did nothing of the sort. I simply made you less boring. You also told me you didn't need to be as academically inclined. That's not a problem anymore. Chemistry is a tough major, and I don't know if you'd be able to invest the time in it. Now your life is more balanced. You have a major more in line with your, ummm, skill set, and you lead a much more, ummm, fulfilling social life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what the shit? Am I fucking dumb now?\" you hear yourself ask in a high-pitched, stupid-sounding voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, like you said, you're not as academically inclined. Dumb is a word I try not to use as it carries so many negative connotations...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, because people don't like dumb fucking skanks.\" you retort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I wouldn't agree with you there. Plenty of people like you. Just check your phone or Facebook. You're quite the social butterfly now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, change me back... I can't acclim... ummm, fucking deal with this shit right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's simply not possible.\" Ms. Souto said. \"The system won't allow any additional changes for at least 72 hours. Looks like this is you, at least for the weekend. I would encourage you to just go back to the sorority house and get familiar with the new you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUtterly defeated, and unsure how to handle a situation with someone as authoritative and well-spoken as Ms. Souto, you decide to just retreat back to the house and try to figure things out. \"Shit...\" you mumble under your breath as you stand up. When you walk out, however, you feel a sharp pain in your groin. It feels like it's coming straight from your vagina. \"Owww, why does my pussy hurt so bad?\" You blush in embarrassment as you hear how lewd you sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Souto can't help but chuckle and grin as she replies, \"must have been a <i>really</i> long night, hot stuff. Tough life of a dedicated sorority sister, eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush even redder as you realize that you must've been fucked so hard last night that it hurts you to walk. Feel ashamed, dirty, and exposed, you escape Ms. Souto's office and head back to the house. When you get there, are your sisters surprised by the new you?</span></div></div>",

A few sisters great you, and a few others just sort of glare at you and shake their heads. You quickly dart upstairs to your room as you just want to be away from all the prying eyes downstairs. Unsurprisingly, your room is also different. Upon entering, you're nose is assaulted by the smell of cheap perfume and alcohol. You look around and see a huge mess. Whereas before, the room was meticulously organized and attention was paid to every detail, this room looked like it had been hit by a tornado... a rather trashy tornado. Instead of a simple beige, your walls were painted bright pink. Instead of the simple floral sheets you had before, your new sheets were satin, red, and topped with at least fifty stuffed animals of varying shapes and sizes. All over the floor you see a menagerie of underthings and club wear. Your bras varied from neon pinks and greens, to animal prints like cheetah and zebra. Your panties ran the gamut of colors and materials, but each and every one of them was a thong. There wasn't a respectable pair of underwear to be found. The dresses were balled up all over the room, but were clearly all of a tight and showy design.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour walls were also decorated with posters of shirtless men, hyper-sexualized Asian women, and the occasional Hello Kitty picture. Instead of a bookshelf, you had a huge dresser, brimming with more clothes, all equally as revealing as those strewn about the floor. Atop the dresser were a few half-finished handles of vodka, rum, and tequila. You shuffled your way to the bed and sat down, looking at your nightstand, which was topped with a bowl of condoms, an almost-empty tube of lube, a larger vibrator, and a big, rubber dildo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were clearly still drunk, or at least tipsy, and seeing all the sex paraphernalia remind you of your aching vagina, and how much of a pounding you probably took last night.

You say your most recent status update, from 12:14 AM that morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">\"Me and my bitchezz headed 2 Ultra 2nite!!! Any kewt guyz wanna buy me a drink???? I'll make it worth ur while... <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/wink.png\" alt=\"*Wink*\" title=\"Wink\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/wink.png\" alt=\"*Wink*\" title=\"Wink\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Facebook being a saddening sight to behold, you quickly flipped open your email. You had two new emails. One was from the assistant dean of the College of Arts &amp; Sciences, and the other was from the Jackson County Court Reporter. The first email read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"Ms. Wu,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**SECOND NOTICE OF ACADEMIC NONCOMPLIANCE**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis email is to inform you that your present GPA of 1.87 is below requisite academic standards. All students are required to maintain a GPA of at least 2.0 in order to remain enrolled at the university. Failing to bring your GPA into compliance with university standards by the end of this semester will result in your immediate dismissal.\"<br>\r\n</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't decide whether you were more disturbed by the fact that you were failing school or the fact that you had no clue what \"requisite\" meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second email wasn't any better. It was from the court and thanked you for your recent payment of a $250 fine stemming from your arrest for indecent exposure, public intoxication, and soliciting a bribe a few months before. You skimmed the attached police report and discovered, to your horror, that you had apparently walked out of a bar, tried to hit a man who was trying to help you into a taxi, broke a heel on your shoe and fell to the sidewalk. As if that wasn't bad enough, the report also noted that your dress rode up to your waist, and you weren't wearing any panties, so you flashed your vagina to a large crowd of bar patrons. Finally, to add insult to injury, you apparently offered to \"suck the officer's cock\" if he let you off with a warning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly shut the computer and put your head in your hands. There was no getting around it. You were a dumb, slutty, Asian sorority sexpot. Every thing you did was designed to communicate your availability to any and all men, and you were quite confident that it was a rare occasion that you ever went home alone. To you, sex was a commodity, and it was your primary currency. You were dumb enough that you were about to flunk out as a fashion design major, and you were slutty enough that you offered up blow jobs as a means of getting out of legal trouble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that moment that tears began forming in your eyes and you became extremely self-conscious. You vividly felt how much you were on display. You felt the tops of your breasts (or tits, as you knew them) popping out of your tiny, black bra. You tried to adjust yourself to contain them better, but it was no use. You were acutely aware of the lace thong that was presently riding up your butt. You tried to adjust the thong, but in so doing you brush the lace across your vagina, which elicits a slight tingling sensation. You unconsciously slide your hand down the front of your panties and realize that you are completely shaven. You also feel your wetness and your thoughts turn to the items you have on your nightstand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do you respond.</span></div></div>",

You let out a high-pitched \"EEP!\" as you sat up in your chair and tried to appear nonchalant, however, you just ended up blushing in embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good God, Aimee.\" she said. \"What happened, you didn't get enough cock crammed up in your nasty, little snatch last night? Had to come home and finish yourself off a few more times? You are such a disgusting skank, and I cannot believe you ever were initiated into this house. How much dick did you suck at the bar <i>last</i> night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou honestly didn't know, so you couldn't reply. You just looked down. This girl was so dominant and assertive. Your dimmer mind knew it couldn't keep up in an argument, so you just stayed silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, that's what I figured,\" she continued. \"Well, either way, all of that is about to change. And do you know why? Well, the university was kind enough to inform me as chapter president that a certain, little fashion design major was finding college to be too challenging. A 1.87 GPA? Are you serious? What, you couldn't just suck off a professor or two? It would be rather fitting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could feel the tears welling up in your eyes as she continued to dress you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well, who cares. I know it was your dumb ass that cost us standards points that would've allowed us to beat Zeta last semester. Who knew that an Asian would be such a ditzy, little airhead. Well all that's going to change after you finally flunk out this semester. With such low grades, I'll actually be able to get you tossed out of the sorority entirely. Better get working if you want to stick around. Or don't. Just keep guzzling cum and enjoy your last semester as the sorority slut.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Mary marched out of your room with a contented smirk on her face. Her air of superiority was palpable, and you couldn't help but feel like a worthless piece of trash. And quite honestly, you were. Again, with all the shame, you found yourself keenly aware of how much of a whore you were. The ache in your vagina served as a constant remind, and your now wet panties really drove it home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had a decision to make. You could either accept that, for better or worse, you would have to make the best out of your time as Aimee Wu. You had no idea how long you would be stuck as her, and in the back of your mind you couldn't shake the fear that this change might be permanent. If that was the case, you need to make sure you don't fail out of college. On the other hand, you could just say \"fuck it.\" You're not Aimee Wu. You'll eventually get yourself changed back and then all this would be that slut's problem.</span></div></div>",

There's a chance that you may be stuck as Aimee Wu for the foreseeable future, and possibly forever, and you don't want to end up being a college dropout. You sit back down at your computer, determined to get a handle on your academics. You log into the university's intranet and take a look at your classes, grades, and schedule. The first thing you notice is that you're only taking twelve credit hours, and all your courses seem to be a joke. For instance, you're enrolled in something called \"History of Fashion in Literature\" with Prof. Langwell. As you click into the course's homepage, you notice that your average in that class is currently a 64.5%. \"Wow, I really am fucking dumb,\" you thought to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile clicking through the webpage you notice that you have a test coming up that constitutes 35% of your grade. It's scheduled for next Monday at 8:30 AM. You have no clue what it's on, so you shuffle through the stacks of Victoria's Secret catalogs, fashion magazines, and textbooks on your desk until you find the notebook for that class. Hoping to find some notes, you flip it open only to find mostly doodles and your name written a thousand different ways, all in gaudy, hot pink ink. The only notes you can find that even slightly pertain to the course mainly demonstrate how little you grasp of the core concepts, and how confused you are by all of this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately you find your textbook for the course, and the syllabus for the class. Unfortunately, since this is a literature-based course, the reading load is pretty hefty. You'll probably need the vast majority of the weekend to read all your assignments and study for this test. You also notice that the Prof. Langwell is having office hours in half an hour. Maybe you can convince him that you need to take your test a couple days later, or maybe he can point you in a more specific direction regarding what to review.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

The notification on the alarm reads \"<span class=\"chotpink\">Take your pill slut!</span> <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/bigsmile.png\" alt=\"*BigSmile*\" title=\"BigSmile\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">\" \"Ughhh,\" you think to yourself. \"What a fucking skank. I guess with all the cum getting pumped into me, I should probably take one of these.\" You grab a pill out of your purse and swallow it as you walk out the door. Unfortunately, Mary Leonard happened to be passing you just as you took your pill. \"Leaving so soon?\" she teased. \"Got to go get plowed again? Good thing you took your pill. We wouldn't want you getting all knocked up now, would we?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were so ashamed. It was clear to anyone that you were nothing more than a dumb slut, and the fact that it was so obvious, what with you walking around popping birth control, with your tits pushed up and on display, and with your thong popping up over the waistband of your skirt whenever you bent over, made you blush redder than ever before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, you couldn't help any of that right now. You just needed to focus on getting yourself together and hopefully solving this problem. With enough hard work and gumption maybe you could get your old life back, and if not, you at least needed to make this life more respectable. As you strode off towards the main quad, you felt your phone buzz again. This time it was a text from a guy named Mike. The lock screen on your phone displayed the text, which read, \"Wut r u doin 2nite?\" Maybe this Mike guy would be able to help you figure out your situation a bit better. You unlock the phone and open your conversation with Mike. You look back over the past few days' texts and notice that, if anything, Mike was most interested in helping you get out of your clothes. You were shocked to see that just two nights ago, on a Wednesday no less, you sent him a picture, with a message that read \"<span class=\"chotpink\">This is waitin 4 u @ my place!!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/nkehlkh\" target=\"_blank\">http://tinyurl.com/nkehlkh</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe it. Your were sexting some dude and inviting him over to fuck you on a Wednesday night. As if that wasn't bad enough, Mike responded with \"I'm down. Feelin like anal tho.\" And like the slut you were, you just responded with \"<span class=\"chotpink\">TeeHee!! Deal.</span> <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/wink.png\" alt=\"*Wink*\" title=\"Wink\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">\" It almost didn't surprise you anymore. There seemed to be no limits to your depravity. No wonder it seemed like all of your brains were dripping out of your leaky cunt all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do? Do you try to get in touch with Mike to mine more information about your life as a harlot, or do you keep going to Prof. Langwell's office hours?</span></div></div>",

It would be a far smarter use of your time to go speak to Prof. Langwell. At least you could make one wise choice that day. You find his office without much additional trouble. You walk in and ask him if he has a minute. Upon seeing you, Prof. Langwell sighs and says, \"I figured I'd be seeing you sooner or later, what with the test coming up next Monday and all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were slightly taken aback by the professor's demeanor. You figured that Aimee hadn't exactly been beating down the doors of academia looking for homework help, etc. But before you could respond, Prof. Langwell added, \"I know we've always had out little arrangement in the past, but I don't know if that can keep up. I'm afraid the department chair is suspicious of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What arrangement are you talking about, professor?\" you reply, quizzically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't play coy with me, Aimee. Trust me, I was just as happy as you with our arrangement. Close the door, please.\" Now speaking in a hushed tone, Prof. Langwell whispers, \"But, as I said before, I think the department head is on to me. I don't know if you can just keep showing up and blowing me before every test.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were taken aback by the professor's bluntness, but to be honest, you had no reason to be surprised. So apparently, not only were you receiving a measly 1.87 GPA, but you also had to suck cock to even get that. You really were the worst stereotypical dumb, sorority bimbo.

After this, you'll have more than enough time to catch up on the work in Aimee's moronically simple classes, but this time, you still needed a helping hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But professor,\" you pleaded, adopting a very coquettish tone. \"I really don't know how I'll be ready for Monday's test. Can't we just keep our deal one more time. I promise I'll study extra hard for the next one and I won't ask you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProf. Langwell looked uncomfortable at first, but eventually he just rolled his eyes and sighed again, this time with a defeated tone. \"How can I say no to you, Aimee. You're such an eager little tart. Come on under the desk and we'll do it once more for old times' sake. But I'm serious when I say, this is IT. After this, you're on your own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks professor! I promise, this is the last time. For reals!\" You don't know why you are speaking like such a ditz, but as you walked over to the professor's desk you became filled with trepidation. You were a guy, you liked girls. You'd rather be sitting in the chair getting your dick sucked then bobbing up and down on your knees. But you knew that there was no going back, and as much as it disgusted you, it had to happen. As you came around the desk you saw that Prof. Langwell had already pulled out his dick. Almost instantly upon seeing it, your mouth watered and your vagina started getting wet. You couldn't believe that you were so wound up that you were literally salivating at the sight of this professor's below-average cock. Somewhere in the back of your mind, you thought it might have been because you hadn't cum yet today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you slipped down under the desk and to your knees, the full gravity of the situation hit you. You were a truly dumb, overly-sexed, trolloped-up Asian sexpot. You couldn't believe that you were sucking dick to pass classes you were too stupid to pass by yourself, and you couldn't believe how much your lot in life had changed in such a short period of time. As you were thinking all these terrible things you felt Prof. Langwell's hand slide through your hair and over the back of your head, gently coaxing your mouth down onto his dick. You opened wide, feeling you big, puffy lips slide down his shaft, leaving a trail of gloss as they went. You really didn't know what to do, but it seemed that Aimee did. And as you felt yourself essentially shifting into autopilot, Aimee took the reigns. You found yourself licking around the shaft, sucking on the tip, and then relaxing your throat as you took his entire length into your waiting mouth. You must have been doing a pretty great job because it wasn't long before Prof. Langwell tightened his grip on your head and without warning began erupting in your mouth. Without thinking you just began swallowing, and the thick, salty cum began trickling down your throat. It took a few seconds for him to finish and you struggled to swallow and breath at the same time. When he finally pulled out, it elicited a small burp from you, which may have been the single most embarrassing moment of your life thus far (although you feared it might not be too long before you topped that), <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you've still got it Aimee,\" said Prof. Langwell as you stood up and adjusted your hair. \"It looks like another C for you this coming Monday. Congratulations. Now you'll need to get out of my office. Next time maybe we'll go over the book for a change.\" You shuffle out of Langwell's office, ashamed of yourself for giving into being such a slut. To make matters worse, as you walked past, Prof. Langwell gave you a playful smack on your ass and said \"See you later, slut.\" You couldn't get out of there fast enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walked back to the house you were wrought with conflicting emotions. On one hand, you were relieved that you wouldn't have to worry about that test on Monday. On the other hand, you could not believe that you had degraded yourself in such a way. As you were walking, however, your vision blurred momentarily before everything came back into focus. \"Weird,\" you thought to yourself. As you kept walking, you felt like something was different, but you couldn't quite pin it down. Then it dawned on you. You couldn't feel your thong riding up on you anymore. You reached back to feel it, and realized that it wasn't there. You weren't wearing any panties. That made no sense. You had them on when you went to Langwell's office, but now they were gone. Besides, you just blew him. It's not like you took your clothes off. Frantically, you checked your purse to grab the clean thong you remember being in there. But it too was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck?!\" you thought to yourself. You were walking past the Administrative Building you had been in earlier and decided to confront Ms. Souto about what seemed to be continuing changes even now. When you walked in she smiled at you and said, \"Hey Aimee. How're you getting along with your new profile?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fucking shitty,\" you reply, again sounding like a vulgar dunce. \"Things are changing still.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that shouldn't be the case. Not unless you've been reinforcing your profile. What exactly is different?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just walking around, and now I'm not wearing panties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were you wearing them before?\" asked Ms. Souto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I had them on, and even had an extra thong in my purse. Now they're all gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm. Well, let me check your profile really quick and make sure everything is still the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squirmed around in your seat as Ms. Souto checked her computer. Maybe you really did need to cum to make yourself more focused and less fidgety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh, I see.\" Ms. Souto said. \"It appears that your sex drive has changed from a medium-high designation to just high. Have you been doing anything sexual in a way that would fit your profile and that is different than your sexual activities in your previous body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit,\" you thought to yourself. \"By acting like Aimee I am reinforcing and developing my profile. I really shouldn't have blown that professor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were too embarrassed to respond, and again just looked down demurely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that answers both of my questions,\" chuckled Ms. Souto. \"It appears that you're adjusting <i>quite</i> well to your new profile. And I should have mentioned this earlier, but if you act in a way that would have been out of character before but fits with your profile now, it may cause slight modifications to that profile. So whatever you did today pushed your sex drive up a tad, and I suppose that change resulted in Aimee Wu being the type of girl that doesn't wear panties. You really must be the sluttiest girl in Tau Gamma. I'm sure you're just <i>sooo</i> popular with all the frats.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't tell if Ms. Souto was teasing you or not, but that didn't matter. You were reaching your upper threshold for embarrassment, and being called a slut just didn't seem to register anymore. What did you do next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"OK, just give me a moment to execute the trade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait again, this time expecting the changes that are soon to begin. \"All done,\" chirped Ms. Souto. \"Just hang out here until the changes have been processed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time changes you asked for came first. You can feel the heat between your legs dissipate as the cloud of arousal begins to lift just a little. Your sex drive is still medium-high, so you're still a little horny, but it's more of a dull need than one that requires immediate attention. You also check your purse and see that your clean thong is back in there, and you feel the familiar tug of the thong you are again wearing. \"At least I wear panties again,\" you thought to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when the next round of changes begins. Just like before, your clothes changes first. You notice your blouse changing in both material and color. It turns from black to white, and from a lacy fabric into a stretchy cotton. This seemed odd to you, as you were not expecting your clothes to get any less sexual. But then your bra disappeared and you could feel your new stretchy tank form a bra within itself. Then your clothes started to change in size. The tank got slightly looser, less so in the stomach and more so over your boobs. The top actually looked like it had previously been uniform in size, but the part over the chest had been stretched more than the part over the stomach. Your skirt and even your thong also loosened, and you were actually quite pleased to be wearing some clothes that weren't so tight for a change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat relief, however, was short-lived. You felt a warming sensation in your chest and leaned back as your boobs thrust outward, filling up like water balloons. You could feel your tits getting fuller and heavier. You quickly put your hands up to hold you new endowments, but they quickly become more than a handful. Also, your boobs aren't the only things swelling. You feel your skirt tighten as your ass swells up into a large, round bubble butt. The size of your cheeks pushes your thong up above the waist of your skirt, so now it will be permanently visible along with the top of your plump ass. You feel a thin layer of fat envelop you everywhere else, softening your stomach and your face further. After all is said and done, you are now an equally cute and sexy-looking girl as you were before, but whereas you used to be tight and thin, now you were busty and voluptuous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked over to the same mirror in Ms. Souto's office and caught a glimpse of the new Amy Wu for the second time today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/6ophrhu\" target=\"_blank\">http://tinyurl.com/6ophrhu</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, well there are no available trades for you now. This is you until at least Monday, and there's no way around it. Let me give you your change summary and you can be on your way. It's 4:30 and I'm going home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Souto quickly printed the form off for you, and you skimmed it as you headed out of her office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">PREVIOUS INFO<br>\r\nAimee Wu<br>\r\nAge: 19<br>\r\nHair: Black w/ highlights<br>\r\nHeight: 5'5\u201d<br>\r\nWeight: 95 lbs<br>\r\nEthnicity: Asian (Chinese)<br>\r\nMeasurements: 32B-23-33<br>\r\nMajor: Fashion Design<br>\r\nGPA: 1.87<br>\r\nAlcohol: Y<br>\r\nSmokes: Y<br>\r\nSexually Active: Y<br>\r\nSex Drive: High<br>\r\nIQ: 96<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNEW INFO<br>\r\nAimee Wu<br>\r\nAge: 19<br>\r\nHair: Black w/ highlights<br>\r\n<b>Height: 5'3\u201d</b><br>\r\n<b>Weight: 124 lbs</b><br>\r\nEthnicity: Asian (Chinese)<br>\r\n<b>Measurements: 34DD-29-38</b><br>\r\nMajor: Fashion Design<br>\r\nGPA: 1.87<br>\r\nAlcohol: Y<br>\r\nSmokes: Y<br>\r\nSexually Active: Y<br>\r\n<b>Sex Drive: Med/High</b><br>\r\nIQ: 96</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe it. You lost two inches of height and gained almost thirty pounds, seemingly all in your tits and your ass. Speaking of which, you could feel your ass wobbling as you walked across campus. Also, no matter how hard you tried, you couldn't get your thong to stay hidden in your skirt. Your butt was just too big. Your boobs jiggled lewdly as you walked and you knew you were turning heads for all the wrong reasons. Back when you were a man you knew a couple girls who looked similar to you. They were the type of girl that you took home if you were drunk. As a result, these girls had to slut it up even harder and ended up being more desperate in an attempt to compete with the girls who were more thin and toned. You caught your reflection in some glass and you saw that you really were just a little pipsqueak. A chubby, over-endowed, slutty-looking little pipsqueak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere did you go next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your thong is also doing nothing to hide the pronounced wobble of your big, bubbly butt cheeks as they jiggle around in your skirt, which is clearly a size or two too small. In fact, your perpetually visible thong draws some unwanted attention as numerous guys whistle at you, the overly busty, short, Asian sorority slut that was parading around the quad. It still was unsettling for you to think that those words described you. And boy, did they describe you perfectly. What was more disturbing was the fact that feelings other than disgust and repulsion begin to creep into your consciousness as you think about your present condition. You're terrified of the fact that you can feel yourself getting wet just from thinking about how much of a tramp you look like. You begin to think to yourself that maybe you need to get yourself off to quell your arousal somewhat. As such, your thoughts turn back to the items you remember lying on your nightstand. Maybe when you get back to the house you'll take care of the problem so you can clear your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk through the front door at Tau Gamma, you are greeted by a handful of girls standing around a box in the kitchen. \"What's up Juggs?\" one of them calls out to you. \"The jerseys for Greek Olympics are here. Come get yours!\" You sashay, which is really the only way your overdeveloped body allows you to walk, over to the kitchen counter and you're handed your jersey. It has your sorority's letters on the front, and says \"Juggs\" and has the number 69 on the back. Apparently the new you went by Juggs and was willing to flaunt her sexuality even on something as simple as a sorority shirt. You didn't have much time to think about it when another girl walked in and said, \"What the fuck Juggs? We were supposed to start pregaming for DKE's party this afternoon? You fucking bailed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forgot,\" was all you could say in reply. \"Well catch the fuck up,\" the other sister said to you as she pushed a half-empty handle of Kamchatka vodka into your hand. Everyone looks at you expectantly, waiting for you to take a pull off the bottle. You even hear another girl say, \"well, here she goes.\" You can still feel the dull heat coming from between your legs. Do you take a drink or go upstairs to put out that smoldering fire?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You've had about the shittiest day you could possibly imagine. First, you were unwittingly transformed from a fairly well-built man into a tiny, petite Asian sorority girl. Then you were changed from a boring bookworm into a cum-guzzling sorority skank. And if that wasn't bad enough, you were finally changed from a sexy, thin sex goddess into a roly-poly, huge-titted dumpster slut. It went without saying that you could use a drink. Besides, these girls had no clue what they were in for. Back in the day, you drank all your bros on the wrestling team under the table. No one had ever out drank you head to head. So you ripped the bottle out of the other girl's hand and took a mighty swig straight from it. Afterwards, you licked your big, dick-sucking lips and laughed when someone offered you a chaser. Even if you were stuck as Aimee Wu, you were still going to show these bitches up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you continued drinking shot for shot with pretty much anyone who even touched the bottle, your phone buzzed. You looked down and saw that it was Mike, the same guy that had texted you earlier, when you were headed to Langwell's office hours. His text asked if you wanted to go pregame over at his house. You thought about it for a moment, and then decided that drinking with guys would be more fun than drinking with a bunch of lightweight sorority girls. So you text him back, telling him that you'll get dressed for the party then head over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rip one last shot then head up to your room. As you climb the stairs, you have to steady yourself for a minute. You don't think it's the alcohol because you've had at least three to four times the amount you just drank in the past and it hadn't really affected you. You assume it must be something to do with an altered center of gravity, because instead of being a well-muscled, tallish man, you were now a short, thick, huge-titted Asian chick. As you get upstairs you start searching through your closet to find something to wear. You find that to be a tall order, however, because all the clothes are designed for a sorority slut nicknamed Juggs. You weren't trying to get all dolled up, you just wanted to chill with some bros, like it was old times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as you sifted through the litany of slutwear, other feelings began welling up inside you. The arousal that you remembered being dull earlier was significantly more pronounce once you started drinking. Part of you was tempted to just play the part, to be Aimee \"Juggs\" Wu for the evening and just go all out. You obviously weren't gay, so you didn't want to fuck any guys, but you could certainly slut yourself up and dance around a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you choose to do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You decide to throw caution to the wind, and just live in the moment as Aimee Wu. You can't be sure what is driving your decision most, the alcohol, your arousal, or maybe just a general breaking down of your will to resist your new reality. At this point, it didn't matter, and the most difficult decision you had left was how best to proclaim your promiscuity to the world. The first thing you did was address your soft belly. After sifting through drawers full of big bras and tiny thongs, you found some shapewear, clearly designed for the slut with an appetite. There was a skin-tone, tube shaped garment that looked like pantyhose for your gut. You stretch it on and marvel at how much it compresses your bulge. The flip side to that is that now your shape looks even more exaggerated. Looking at yourself in the mirror, you can't help but think that you might get assaulted on the street for the raw sexuality that your new body exudes. You're not worried though. With your tolerance and street smarts, you're not expecting any trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keeping digging through your lingerie drawer and come across a matching bra and thong, both in lime green. They're perfect, because the bra is strapless, and the thong is tiny, just a thin triangle with strings in three directions and silver writing across the front that reads \"hot and ready.\" \"How appropriate for Aimee,\" you think to yourself as you slide it between your round ass cheeks. Your underwear perfectly matches a black dress you have with silver and green accents. You strap on the bra, and realize very quickly that it's of the push-up variety. With DD boobs to begin with the effect is nothing short of miraculous. Your tits are on full display, with almost half of their mass fully exposed. Again, this seems fitting considering that you were now nothing but a riotous whore. You tug on the tube dress, toss on a pair of black heels, and cake on some more layers of makeup. You're impressed with the final result, and decide that the old you would definitely fuck the new. And you chuckle to yourself as you realize that the new you is too dumb and turned on to say no to practically any advance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to toss a couple fresh condoms and a water bottle filled with rum into your purse and you jiggle off towards Mike's. But before you leave, you snap a quick selfie of yourself in the mirror. \"Maybe I'll keep this slut's Facebook updated,\" you think as you glance at your handiwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/klehmbr\" target=\"_blank\">http://tinyurl.com/klehmbr</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad,\" you think as you prance down the stairs and out the door. It was a good thing that Mike's place wasn't far from Tau Gamma as the alcohol you had consumed so quickly was beginning to take its toll on you. You stumbled once or twice, giggling vapidly to yourself each time. On one occasion, one of your boobs actually popped out of your bra and you had to really battle to squeeze it back in. Luckily, you were alone on the street. \"Fucking tiny ass DD bra,\" you think to yourself, as some of Aimee's thoughts and memories begin to seep into your mind. You remember how Aimee is really an 34F cup, but since Victoria's Secret only makes bras up to a DD, she squeezes herself into those. You giggle again as you remember your reasoning. \"Victoria's Secret is the only place I can get neon cheetah print.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you make it to Mike's house, fortunately with all your jiggly bits still intact and having not exposed yourself to anyone, at least not yet. When you walk in, all the guys turn and cheer. Either because you're drunk, or because you're dumber, or maybe both, you don't notice the fact that you're the only girl there. You also don't find it suspicious that someone immediately hands you a cup of jungle juice that had already been poured before you got there. \"We were thinking of having a chugging contest,\" Mike said. \"You down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck yeah, I'm down,\" you reply, as you grab the cup. Mike grabs another cup and someone counts you down. You immediately think back to when you were deep-throating the professor, and you relax your throat in just the same way, allowing all the juice to drain down into your stomach in record time. You won! But you vaguely felt like Mike didn't even really try, or drink that much. You were too dense to care though, and you yelled \"Get on my level, bitch!\" as you watched all the guys around you chuckle and leer at your prominently displayed assets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stepped into a game of beer pong next and paired up with Mike. As the two of you took turns shooting, you stood in front of Mike and could feel his growing hard on swelling up into your fat, round ass. Subconsciously, you pushed back against it, enjoying the feeling of it pressing against you as your thong shifted around from all the movement. The two of you weren't doing well at the game, as you were a hammered-drunk sorority bimbo, and Mike was understandably distracted by your plump ass and wobbling tits. When the other team was shooting at the last cup someone dared you to take your tits out to defend it. Always up for the challenge, especially as Aimee was taking more and more control of your actions, you whipped your bra down and hung your massive mammaries down over the cup. Being the dumb slut that you were, you actually held your tits right over the cup, and the other shooter casually bounced the ball of your jiggling juggs and right in to seal the win. You drunkenly yelled \"You cheated! You bounced it off my boob! I can't help how fucking stacked I am!!\" The guys just laughed at the topless slut complaining about her gigantic tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Mike took you out to the dancefloor and started grinding up on you. He was so much bigger and stronger than you and you couldn't help but be aware of your comparative weakness. Shortly thereafter, however, things began to get hazy and you blacked-out. You can remember hearing someone say \"that didn't take long...\" and another say \"perfect warm-up for the real party\" and a final one say \"you have to practice riding on a community bicycle... wouldn't want to scuff up a nice clean one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen and where do you come to?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Ughhhhhhhhhh,\" you moan to yourself as you come to. The first thing that registers with you is the pounding headache you're feeling and the smell of vomit coming from the toilet you're sprawled out next to. Other than that, the house is oddly quiet. The music is off and you cannot hear anyone talking. You check your phone and see that it's 3:15 AM. The last you remembered you were pregaming and it was only around 10 PM. The next thing you notice is that you're completely naked. You immediately sit up and feel dizzy as the headrush you experience reminds you that you're still drunk. You steady your swinging boobs and try to account for the situation. It's around that time that you begin to feel other soreness and pain. First and foremost, your vagina is aching. It's even worse than when you originally transformed from Amy into Aimee. Your lower jaw is also very sore and you have a sticky, salty taste in your mouth. Finally, your knees are scuffed and scraped up, although they don't hurt nearly as bad as everything else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly stand up, wobbling unsteadily. This causes your tits to heave from side to side, and being so busty on such a small frame, the weight causes you to slip and fall back down. Gingerly, you rise back to your feet and steady yourself on the counter. You look in the mirror and are shocked at what you see. Your makeup is smeared and streaked all over your face, and your lip gloss is almost completely rubbed off. You also notice what looks like dried cum around your mouth, and what might be some more in your hair. Simultaneously, you can feel something wet dripping down the inside of your thighs. You reach down and feel that it is more cum, obviously dripping out of your sore vagina from standing up. Overwhelmed by the situation, you sit down on the toilet and just cry. Your tears are interrupted by a sudden wave of nausea and you drop down onto your scraped knees to vomit violently into the toilet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't believe it. Someone must have roofied your drink. There were at least six or seven guys at the party, and from the looks of it all there dicks were inside you in some way or another. An onslaught of shame quickly overwhelmed your prior feeling of nausea and you cried again. You checked your phone to see if anyone was available to come get you, but it was cracked even worse and not responding. You couldn't tell if it was broken or just dead. You looked around the bathroom for your clothes, hoping to make a quick exit. You found your dress balled up in a corner, but you couldn't find your bra or your thong. You tugged the dress over you and slinked out of the bathroom. You cracked the door and called out, \"hello?\" but no one answered. \"They must still be out at that DKE party,\" you thought to yourself. As you enter the living room, you see your thong lying on the floor between the pong table and the bathroom door. You go to put it back on, only to realize that one of the strings had been torn, as if someone had ripped it off of you. You then look up to the ceiling and see your bra pinned to it, among probably ten or fifteen others. Yours was clearly the biggest, and also the brightest. What's worse is there was a Polaroid picture of you topless holding up your bra, and someone had written \"Aimee\" in permanent marker on one of the capacious cups. You tried standing on a chair, but at a paltry 5'3\" you didn't stand a chance at reaching your big, bright, bra. As you dumbly strained towards the ceiling, you lost your balance and toppled off the chair, landing on your cushy, padded ass. You vapidly giggled to yourself as you couldn't help but think that this was one of the primary benefits of having a bulging bubble butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou momentarily thought back to yesterday, when you burped after swallowing Prof. Langwell's load, and how you thought that was the most embarrassing moment of your life to date. Well, tonight you had clearly topped that. Now, anyone who ever came to this house would know full well what a busty, sleazy, little cum dumpster you really were. And who were you to disagree. Again looking at yourself in the mirror, you began to fully realize that this is who you are now. Part of you still resists this, but it is becoming harder and harder to deny. You are actually becoming more like Aimee as time goes on. Memories of hers are slowly cropping up in your head, and you're beginning to understand that nights like this are not necessarily unusual, and may actually be par for the course for your weekends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you have the chance to further ponder your continued descent into slutdom, your vision blurs quickly, just like it did yesterday afternoon when your panties disappeared. You knew something had changed, and you remembered what Ms Souto said about reinforcing your profile. You felt a sharp pain in your nipples and pulled down your top to reveal that they were now pierced with two metal bars going right through them. \"Holy fuck,\" you thought to yourself. \"People will be able to see these things even through my bra.\" You knew it was becoming more and more difficult for you to even hide your sluttiness and allow anyone to take you seriously. As you were thinking about this, some of the sharpness of your headache went away, but much of the fuzziness in your thought process increased. You just assumed it had something to do with the alcohol or roofies you had in your system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou figured it was best to just try and sneak back to Tau Gamma. Hopefully, no one would see you and you could just go to bed and deal with this tomorrow. You looked around for your shoes, and when you finally found them, you stepped into them, tottering on the 5\" heels before regaining your balance. You still couldn't find your purse, and after fifteen minutes of searching you decided that it was no use. You'd have to try and find it tomorrow. You wobbled out of the house and down the street back toward the sorority. With no bra to steady your heaving tits, you could do nothing but hold them close to you with one of your arms to prevent them from throwing you off balance and making you fall. As you were walking, however, you saw a rowdy group of drunk revelers approaching you. Their shouting momentarily distracted you and you stepped awkwardly, causing one of your heels to snap and sending you tumbling into a sloped, grassy lawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EEEP!\" you squealed as you fell. The noise caused the drunks across the street to take notice of you, and your fall caused your dress to ride up, exposing your lack of underwear and smoothly shaven vagina to anyone interested in looking. One of the guys across the street said loudly to another, \"That there's a fine beaver. Hairless, though, but still a great specimen.\" The other guys roared with laughter and one of the girls started chanting \"STUPID SLUT! STUPID SLUT!\" Tears began streaming down your face as you gathered yourself up, grabbing your broken shoe and taking the other one off as you ran off barefoot, tits and ass bouncing and wobbling unrestrained. You finally got away from them and arrived without further incident at Tau Gamma. You prayed silently that no one would be awake as you walked up the steps and through the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWere you right?</span></div></div>",

KIDDING ME!\" she stammered between eruptions of laughter. \"Holy shit Aimee, you are such a disgusting skank! Look at you! Where's your bra?

Don't you at least clean yourself up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did. I totally cleaned off my face...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOLY SHIT! He came on your face, too!! That's too rich. I hate it when people stereotype sorority girls as insatiable whores, but they nailed it with you. Who was this guy anyways, fucking Hercules? How did he cum that much?\" Mary asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven your dim-wittedness, you didn't think to just walk away. Instead you engaged Mary further, saying, \"Well it wasn't just one guy, duh...\" You immediately realized how much worse that answer was, and Mary almost keeled over laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, excuse me princess. I forgot that it takes many a man to slake the lust for sex embodied by the great Aimee Wu! Did they at least pay you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. They took my fucking bra, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know?\" asked Mary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They stapled it to the ceiling when I was passed out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, Mary did need to sit down. She was laughing so hard it seemed like she was having a stroke. \"Well, you're certainly living up to your reputation, aren't you Aimee? You probably have more cum pumped into your trashy holes in a weekend than most sister have in a year, or maybe more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just look meekly down at your feet, ashamed at how Mary was right. You were truly a disgusting slut. With that, Mary walked back towards the kitchen. \"Well unfortunately, some of us actually study books here and not just the inside of men's boxer shorts. Better rest up there little Aimee. There's many more dicks to suck tomorrow. Remember, the early slut gets the cock, or some shit like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary left, and you wobbled upstairs, peeling off your dress and passing out naked in your bed. You didn't wake up until 3 PM the next afternoon, and while you were no longer drunk, you were very hungover. The headache wasn't as bad as it was last night, but your vagina still ached, and the fuzziness in your head hadn't gone away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

You check Facebook to make sure there weren't any drunken pictures of you from last night. Amazingly, there was nothing new, just the same old slutty pictures you had always had. You then checked your email. There was nothing new there either, just a bunch of junk: ads from Victoria's Secret, an email from \"dickpicsdaily,\" and a shipment notification informing you that your new 10\" vibrating dildo had been shipped. Below that, you saw the same emails from yesterday, except something seemed different about one of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe email that had previously been entitled \"Second Notice of Academic Noncompliance\" was now entitled \"Final Emergency Notice of Academic Noncompliance.\" You opened it and re-read its contents, except this time they were different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"Ms. Wu,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**FINAL EMERGENCY NOTICE OF ACADEMIC NONCOMPLIANCE**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis email is to inform you that your present GPA of 1.72 is below requisite academic standards. All students are required to maintain a GPA of at least 2.0 in order to remain enrolled at the university. As you know, if a student's GPA ever goes below the threshold of 1.75, emergency academic probation is initiated. You have ten (10) days from the receipt of this email to demonstrate that you will make your grades compliant by the end of the semester or you will be immediately dismissed from the university, and you must wait at least a semester before reapplying.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice that the email is already eight days old. So you only have until Monday to convince the university that you would be able to raise your GPA back to compliance. Given your current intellectual capabilities, you didn't have much faith in that. You thought about trying to suck off a few more professors to maybe set this straight, but you quickly try to banish those thoughts. Acting like Aimee had gotten you into this mess, becoming more and more like her sure wouldn't help. Then you think of Ms. Souto, the assistant dean of students. As the university official responsible for helping students acclimate to campus, she had a 24/7 emergency contact number. You grab your cell phone to call her and ask what happened, but you realize it's still either broken or dead. Luckily, your chapter house has permanent phones installed on the wall in every room. You pick yours up and dial Ms. Souto's emergency number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few rings, a familiar voice picks up. \"Lisa Souto. To whom am I speaking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummmm, Aimee Wu,\" you reply meekly, not even thinking to use your male name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Aimee. What seems to be the problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, ummm, like, I think I sort of changed again, and stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. What's different about your profile now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh, you know, my nipples are, like, pierced now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Remember what we said about reinforcing your profile. That's what you must've done. What exactly happened last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummmm, I dunno. Just stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aimee, I cannot help you if you don't tell me exactly what happened. Let me quickly pull up your profile and see what's different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit silently, as Ms. Souto access the university's intranet remotely. Without thinking, you begin idly playing with your pussy and accidentally moan into the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that Aimee?\" Ms. Souto asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked back to reality, you quickly pull your hand out of your now moist thong and reply, \"Uhhh, nothing. Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK Aimee, I'm seeing that your profile has modified slightly. Let me send you an email with the updates and we'll discuss this further on Monday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly respond, \"But I can't wait until then! I'll be, like, kicked out and stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you searched for the words to describe your situation, you received Ms. Souto's email. You open the attachment and see your new profile read-out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">PREVIOUS INFO<br>\r\nAimee Wu<br>\r\nAge: 19<br>\r\nHair: Black w/ highlights<br>\r\nHeight: 5'3\u201d<br>\r\nWeight: 124 lbs<br>\r\nEthnicity: Asian (Chinese)<br>\r\nMeasurements: 34DD-29-38<br>\r\nMajor: Fashion Design<br>\r\nGPA: 1.87<br>\r\nAlcohol: Y<br>\r\nSmokes: Y<br>\r\nSexually Active: Y<br>\r\nSex Drive: Med/High<br>\r\nIQ: 96<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNEW INFO<br>\r\nAimee Wu<br>\r\nAge: 19<br>\r\nHair: Black w/ highlights<br>\r\nHeight: 5'3\u201d<br>\r\nWeight: 124 lbs<br>\r\nEthnicity: Asian (Chinese)<br>\r\nMeasurements: 34DD-29-38<br>\r\nMajor: Fashion Design<br>\r\n<b>GPA: 1.72</b><br>\r\nAlcohol: Y<br>\r\nSmokes: Y<br>\r\nSexually Active: Y<br>\r\nSex Drive: High<br>\r\n<b>IQ: 91</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice that you've actually gotten even dumber, with your IQ currently sitting at a measly 91. No wonder your head was so fuzzy all the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I think I see your problem.\" Ms. Souto says. \"You're on emergency academic probation now, ok yeah. Well that's not good Aimee. Let's see if we can piece together what caused your profile to change. You must have done something dumb in order to adjust the IQ in your profile. Can you think of anything from last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I hung out with some guys. I had sex.\" you say in a voice that is barely audible due to how ashamed you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Aimee. You understand that a girl like you has lots of sex. For university purposes, you're classified as a low-IQ bimbo with an elevated sexual appetite. Just having sex might affect another girl's profile, but not one as, ummm, experienced as yourself.\" You blush again as you realize that the university system even recognizes you as an airheaded bimbo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must have done something unusual in order to trigger such a change. Tell me specifically what you did and who you had sex with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't remember.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me what you do remember.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, ummm, I was, like, drinking at Tau Gamma. Then, you know, I went over to a guy's house off campus cuz him and his friends were pregaming the DKE party. I remember drinking, like, some jungle juice and playing beer pong, but after that, it's really hazy. I blacked out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK,\" Ms. Souto responded. \"Who did you have sex with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it was probably Mike, and, like, maybe some other guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Other guys? Aimee, how many men did you have sex with last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohmigawd, I dunno,\" you say exasperated. \"It was probably, like, six or seven. I woke up and my pussy was super sore, but, like, so was my mouth. I definitely swallowed some cum because I could still taste it. Does it count if I just sucked a guy's dick and he didn't put it, like, in my box?\" You no longer even noticed how vapid, vulgar, and lewd you sounded when talking. It was all becoming more and more normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Souto paused for longer than usual, and you swear you could hear her laughing in the background. \"That doesn't really matter, Aimee. What you described sounds dumb enough to me to reinforce your profile and cause it to alter in the way it did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, like, what do I do?\" you asked, sounding scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really only have two options. You can try and satisfy the university by Monday that you'll be able to raise your GPA into compliance, but honestly, Aimee, I don't see it happening. The other option is to enter our remediation program.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happens if I don't get my GPA, like, high enough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would be immediately dismissed from the university.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would I do then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. You could reapply after one semester, but you'd have to demonstrate a re-commitment to academics that would convince the admissions committee that you are again suitable for enrollment. Plus you would probably have to work on the side as you would have to move out of Tau Gamma. Do you really think you'd be able to make that commitment, given your current, ummm, intellectual capacities?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably not,\" you mumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, I would suggest our remediation program. In that program, students are transferred to other personality profiles. The people currently in these profiles have faced similar dilemmas to what you currently face and have elected to go through remediation instead of facing outright dismissal. Once someone in the remediation program successfully demonstrates an ability to dedicate themselves to their work and invest wholly in something, they become a candidate for readmission. In order to be readmitted, however, there must first be a currently enrolled student that needs to enter the remediation program. Once there is a match, the two people swap. So you would trade profiles with someone in remediation and once you pass the program you can switch with someone else who is just entering the program.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why would someone want to, like, be me? I'm like, kinda dumb, aren't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, first of all, these individuals aren't students. They work for the university in some capacity, but they don't take classes. Also, in almost all instances, their profiles are arguably more challenging than yours. Most of the individuals in remediation would jump at the chance to be a big-titted sorority bimbo because it at least gives them a chance to get their degree, and through remediation, they've demonstrated that they are likely to overcome the challenges of their new student profile and actually obtain that degree, You see, in this way, we can all but guarantee that even the most challenged profiles will ultimately matriculate. So, which option are you interested in?\"</span></div></div>",

You'll need to come in this afternoon so that we can perform the switch and give you two a day or so to get acclimated to your new surroundings.\" Ms. Souto instructed you. \"Please be at my office in an hour or so for a debrief and profile exchange.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you said goodbye and hung up. You quickly got dressed, squeezing your tits into another DD bra that you were practically bursting out of. You slipped a tube top over it and paired that with a pair of tiny jean shorts. Your ass cheeks were coming out of both the top and bottom, and like before, your bulging butt cheeks pushed your skimpy thong into permanent view. At this point you didn't care, as you would soon be rid of Aimee and beginning life anew as Francesca, for better or worse. You tossed on a pair of slutty 3\" heels (the shortest you owned) and tottered out of the house and towards Ms. Souto's office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Souto asked you to wait patiently as she went to let the other girl, who had apparently been waiting in another office, in. She walked in and quietly sat next to you. Before you could really size her up, Ms. Souto spoke to both of you. \"Now girls, in accordance with university policy, I am required to fully disclose and explain what you're agreeing to. Francesca, you have successfully completed the remediation program. Congratulations. You are ready to return to being a full-time student. Aimee, you are presently facing all but certain dismissal and are voluntarily entering the remediation program to give yourself time to demonstrate that you are worthy of being a full-time student again. You will become Francesca and will live her life until you either complete the program or voluntarily withdraw, at which point you will be dismissed from the university. Francesca, you will literally step into Aimee's shoes and will face the same academic predicament she presently faces. Your circumstances will adjust slightly to allow you for more time to rectify it, but the situation will not change. I have every faith that you will be able to handle this challenge and down the road you may qualify for profile alterations that will make your situation more manageable. Do you both understand what I have told you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach of you nod in understanding, and then Francesca asks in heavily accented English, \"So could you tell me more about this chica, por favor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Francesca, I'm not going to lie. This profile is not easy. Aimee here is a member of the Tau Gamma sorority. Without question, she is the dumbest and sluttiest girl in that chapter, bar none. Let's just say that there's more going on in her bra than between her ears. You'll have to adjust to being a decent bit dumber than you are presently. She is a fashion design major and currently holds a 1.72 GPA. You'll need to develop a plan to raise it to at least a 2.0 by semester's end, and that plan must be approved within ten days. Aimee's promiscuity is well-known around campus and among the professors. She has been exchanging sexual favors for a reprieve from tests for some time now, and just last night she had oral and vaginal sex with six or seven guys and her bra is currently stapled to the ceiling of their house with her name and photo attached. She is very showy in the way she dresses. Everything she does is in an attempt to lure potential partners. As you can see, she is bursting out of her bra, a DD I might add, and her thong is perpetually visible over her waistband. Ultimately, you'll be nothing more than a tawdry, out of shape, chubby, dumb, over-sexed, over-endowed, Asian sorority bimbo. It won't be easy, but are you up to the challenge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush even redder as Ms. Souto explains your escapades from the night before. How did she know all that, you wondered. Francesca, however, was unfazed. \"Es an opportunity muy bueno. Yo necesito be an estudiante again,\" she said slowly in a combination of English and Spanish. You were worried about what Francesca was like if she was so eager to trade with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about, like, her?\" you said, gesturing at Francesca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Aimee, Francesca here is a member of the maid staff with university housing. She immigrated from Colombia with her family a few years ago, and due to her language limitations, she hasn't been able to enroll in university. Despite these shortcomings in communications, she is actually smarter than you are presently, but she's certainly not smart. She's of a below average intelligence. Her challenge, however, stems from her social life. Her family made many sacrifices to move to America, and they expect Francesca to live a life better than their's. Francesca presently has a boyfriend named Pablo, who is working as a manager at an auto body shop. He hopes to one day open his own shop and marrying him would lead her to a life of modest comfort and respectability, in the eyes of her parents. She also, however, has an ex-boyfriend name Enrique who is a member of a local Latino gang and who frequently tries to win Francesca back. Francesca knows that being with Pablo is the better decision because he treats her well and supports her as best he can. Enrique, on the other hand, is more focused on having sex with Francesca, along with a number of other women. Francesca, however, has an extraordinarily high libido. She often can't control her sexual urges. She tries to dress demurely, but often can't help herself, and in reality, she is something of a closet slut. Pablo is suspicious, as are Francesca's parents. She has already cheated on him a few times, usually when she drinks, and she has also had anonymous sex a few times, but no one can prove anything. If they ever could, Pablo would likely leave Francesca and her parents would disown her, as they are avowed Catholics. Ultimately, you will complete your remediation when you settle down with a good man, be he Pablo or someone else, and earn respect in your parent's eyes. Are you up for the challenge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I have, like, no choice and stuff, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you could stay as Aimee, be dismissed, and live your life that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way,\" you reply quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it's settled. Let me just enter the final commands here....and there. You two are officially swapped. Francesca, you will change first, and then Aimee will follow. Please hang out in the office for a few minutes while all the changes process.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit silently as you watch Francesca begin to change before your eyes. It was almost surreal to watch someone else go through these changes. Francesca initially gained a few inches in height and her face morphed from a Hispanic to an Asian heritage. It also looked like she was having a migraine, which you assumed came from her getting dumber. Her clothes also began altering and growing until the exactly resembled your clothes. You could see the same tattoo you had appear and you watched her grimace as her nipples were pierced just like yours. Then the physical changes kicked in. Francesca leaned back as her boobs expanded. Whereas before they were full and perky, they now softened, got jigglier, and swelled to the outrageous proportion you presently sported. Her gut began to expand, as her stomach stretched her waistline to the limit and then spilled slightly over. Her face rounded and the rest of her received a soft layer of fat that made her soft, curvy, and voluptuous in every way. Her ass changed in multiple ways. On one hand, it lost much of its projection, but it gained mass in width, growing taller and wider as it pushed up and out of her skirt. Whereas before, she had a big, round, pert bubble butt, she now sport the same fat, wobbly ass that you had. You could see the familiar black thong push up over the waistband of her skirt. With her changes done, she could pass as your twin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that didn't last long, as you began to change almost immediately after she became Aimee. As your changes began you heard Francesca say, \"Wow, like, I can speak English again. But shit, I sound like a fucking dummy.\" And she was right. She now possessed the same high-pitched, vapid, and vulgar sound that you had lived with for the past few days. You looked down and noticed your skin getting darker and more mocha colored as you could feel your facial features realigning to reflect your new Colombian heritage. The haze in your head began to lift as you could feel your thought process speeding up slightly. It was nowhere near as good as when you were a man, but it was certainly better than what you were used to as Aimee. Your tattoo disappeared, as did the piercings in your nipples. In order to fit your new clothes, your body had to alter first. You felt your gut shrink back and tighten up until your stomach was flat and toned. Your belly button piercing changed from a stud to a dangly thing with a pink butterfly at the end. You could feel yourself getting shorter, and you could feel your boobs shrinking. But even though they lost some mass, they firmed up and sat high and proud on your chest. Your ass on the other hand shrank down, leaving your skirt much looser around your waist. But that shrinking only last a moment, as your butt ballooned back up, however, instead of being wide and fat, your ass was round and jutted out from your back. You had a very prominent bubble butt, one that was even big for a latina, especially one of your diminutive stature. Your clothes were last to change as your top shrunk and tightened around your perky tits. It turned a soft salmon color and rose up your stomach to leave your pierced navel and flat stomach permanently exposed. Your jean shorts shrunk down, turned white, and became a cotton material. Your bra also shrank, from a 34DD to a 32D and you could feel your thong disappear. You looked in the mirror and saw Francesca staring back at you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/jww994r\" target=\"_blank\">http://tinyurl.com/jww994r</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Donde esta mi tanga?\" you heard yourself ask in Spanish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, like, don't have enough money to buy, like, enough panties to wear everyday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

I would encourage you both to swap info: email, cell phone, address, etc. so you can stay in touch and potentially help each other out as you adjust to your new lives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hand over your broken cell phone, and let Aimee know how to get to Tau Gamma. You also tell her that you've lost your purse, and that she'll need to file a report with campus security. Aimee asks you to describe the purse and what was in it, so that she could identify it for security. You told her that it was a black leather purse, and you told her that inside there was nothing but a water bottle filled with rum, a small pocket vibrator, a spare thong, and some condoms. It was a relief for you to see someone else have to blush as she realized what a nasty little slut she had become. It was clear that Aimee was dreading having to tell campus security about her missing whore bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAimee then hands you your new cell phone, a simple flip phone. She then gives you a key and a piece of paper with your address on it. \"Donde esta su coche?\" you ask, again in Spanish. \"Oh, like, you don't have a car. It's like, waaay too expensive,\" Aimee babbled. She then handed you a bus pass and vapidly explained what route you took to get home and where you got off. The two of you agreed to keep in touch and potentially meet up soon after you had both acclimated to your new lives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of you leave Ms. Souto's office, Aimee walks off towards Tau Gamma, with her ass jiggling out of the top of her jeans, thong riding high and proud. You can't believe that just an hour or so ago that luscious little tart was you. You turned and headed the other way, off campus and towards the bus stop. As you waited you for your bus you began to take stock of your new situation. It was a relief not to be as stupid as Aimee. Being dumb just made everything so much harder. It was like your head was constantly in a fog. You were worried though, about your limited grasp of the English language. It was most annoying because in your head you could clearly and concisely think of what to say, but when you opened your mouth what came out was always garbled Spanglish, at best. You were also worried about how poor you were. You couldn't believe that Aimee had told you that you couldn't afford enough panties to have a pair to wear everyday. You figured no panties was better than having your thong hanging out all the time. It was a relief not being so prominently displayed, even though you knew that deep down you were actually probably still a slut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, you could feel that heat building up between your legs again. This time, however, the sensation was much more powerful and acute than it had ever been as Aimee. You tried to ignore it, and fortunately your bus showed up shortly thereafter. You climbed aboard, and on a Saturday afternoon, you were relieved to see that there was only one other passenger. He was also Hispanic, and probably in his mid twenties. He was thin, but still rather muscular, and he had a pronounced five'o'clock shadow. You sat down towards the back of the bus, and as it pulled away from the stop you could feel your pussy getting juicier and juicier. The heat in your snatch was rising to previously untold levels, and you were beginning to squirm around in your seat. Your thinking was slowing again, but this time, it wasn't a haze like when you were dumber as Aimee. Instead, it was a vivid series of images, all of you being fucked in innumerable different positions by a slew of different dangerous-looking Hispanic men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fellow passenger couldn't help but notice you squirming, and when he looked back, he saw that your eyes were locked on him. He turned around and walked back to sit near you and said, \"Que paso, mami?\" You knew you were speaking with him in Spanish, but in your head, it all translated nicely into English. \"Nothing. Just riding home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You live alone, girl? I wouldn't want a pretty thing like you stuck by herself. It's dangerous out here, chica.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm, no.\" you reply meekly. \"I live with my boyfriend, Pablo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see no man. It's just you now, chica.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Pablo works late. I'm just headed home now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then I guess you don't have a man right this minute now, do you?\" the man asked suggestively. He then leaned closer to you and whispered into your ear, \"I know what you want, girl. And I'm willing to give it to you. All you have to do is ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know that you should absolutely say no. You need to make sure you end up with Pablo, so you can finish your remediation and get back into school. You can get caught sleeping around like the little latina firecracker you had become. But the analysis wasn't that simple. Whereas before, when you were Aimee, you would fuck guys and suck cock because you were dumb and either needed to pass a test or you would get tricked by some other guys into putting yourself in a situation that resulted in sex. As Francesca, however, that haze of stupidity was lifted, but you were still trapped in a fog of arousal. Instead of being too dumb to say no, you were just too horny not to say yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

You see the bus driver look back at you in the rear view mirror and you blush with shame for the first time as Francesca, the Colombian sexpot who apparently couldn't keep her legs shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man chuckled to himself, grabbed you by the hand and led you off the bus at the next stop. He walked you across the street and into a run-down, old Burger King. \"But I'm not hungry...\" you state. \"I know,\" he says. \"We're not here to eat.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing careful to avoid the stares of any employees, the man leads you down the hall to the bathroom. Once inside, he unzips his pants and frees his already throbbing cock. You can feel the familiar salivating of your mouth as the heat in your pussy builds to a fever pitch. You drop to your knees and swallow him whole. As you frantically bob up and down, you cannot help but assess your situation. You're now a petite, fiery, little latina with an insatiable lust for dick. You apparently just can't help yourself. You're blowing some guy you just met on a bus in a Burger King bathroom. It's getting hard to decide whether it would be better to be the dumb, busty sorority bimbo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts are interrupted as the man lifts your head off of his cock and stands you up. He then bends you over the tank of the toilet and pulls down your skimpy, white shorts. He chuckles when he sees you aren't wearing panties. \"You really are a fucking little slut, eh chica?\" You are too horny to even respond and you simply spread your legs wider. The man takes your hint and quickly thrusts himself into your dripping snatch. He grabs your hair and pulls you back as he pounds you relentlessly. You are acutely aware of your full tits bouncing, and your round, soft ass jiggling with each wave. You hear yourself moaning in Spanish, \"Ayyy, dios mio!! Ayyy, papi!! Muy rapido, papi, muy rapido!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't take long for the man to finish inside a hot little minx such as yourself. As you feel his cock tense up and erupt inside of you, your pussy clinches around him and you are hit by an overwhelmingly powerful orgasm as you cum two or three times in quick succession. The man was inside of you for your first, and maybe second cum, but by the third one you were just quivering and leaking all over the floor, like an aftershock from an earthquake. As the fire subsides, you quickly return back to consciousness and focus on your situation. You ask the man if he had worn a condom, and you are shocked when he just laughs at you and walks out. Feeling both of your cum dribbling down your thighs you do your best to clean yourself up and you pull up your now damp, cotton shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you complete your trek home, you can't help but think of how tough this may prove to be. You really just lost control when you got so heated up back there on the bus. Your libido is through the roof and you'll have to find a way to manage it. You're also worried because the man you just fucked wasn't wearing a condom. Memories of Francesca begin welling up and you remember that in the heavily-Catholic Latino community you live in, condom usage isn't as widespread. You just better remember to take your birth control when you get home. Finally, you arrive at the address. It looks like at one time it was a cheap motel on the side of the highway, but it has since been converted into an apartment complex of sorts. You find your door, #3, and use the key to get in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs anybody home?</span></div></div>",

You notice the shabby furnishings: the wood paneling, the minuscule dining room table, the moth-eaten sheets and blankets on the bed. There are crucifixes and images of Christ adorning the walls and you notice numerous candles with saints on them throughout the apartment. Either you, or Pablo, obviously takes faith very seriously. You toss your bag down and plop onto the raggedy old couch in the corner. You flick on the TV and see what's on. Surprisingly, you are immediately enraptured in a telenovela on Univision. You notice that even though it's obviously in Spanish, you hear everything in your head translated perfectly into your native English. You may be a Spanish soap-watching latina on the outside, but you were still yourself under your tight body and luscious curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the show spins a particularly unbelievable and exaggerated plot (someone was trying to kill someone else because of an absurd love triangle), you can't help but think to yourself how ridiculous it is, and you decide to turn it off. But somehow, you can't. You just sit transfixed on the TV. And as Antonio slyly seduces Isabella, the lonely housewife, you start to feel yourself fall into his web of seduction. You feel that familiar warmth building up inside you as a hand slips down the front of your pants, and down over your shaved, panty-less pussy. Your arch your back and thrust out your tits as you play with yourself, thinking about Antonio pistoning between your sumptuous thighs. You immediately feel yourself slicken between your legs and you feel the warm juices sopping into your skimpy shorts. You pull your bra off and begin playing with your aroused and hard nipples. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lose track of time, and ultimately of how many orgasms you've had. You can tell that the whole apartment smells of your juices, and you've left a noticeable wet spot on the couch. You can't believe this new body of yours. It was literally on fire all the time. The heat between your legs was so much more powerful than it had been as Aimee. You can hardly pull yourself out of the periods of arousal to keep track of the time and your surroundings. It was in one of these moments of temporary clarity that you heard the lock on your door unlatch. It was Pablo, back from work. As soon as he walked in, he knew what you had been doing. He gave you a knowing look and asked, \"Been getting ready for me, it seems.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would have expected yourself to be a gushy mess at the sight of your man walking in the front door. However, unlike essentially the rest of the day, you're not overheated, or even heated at all for that matter. This must be part of your remediation struggle. You know that Pablo is a good man, and you feel warm and safe because he's home, but you aren't overwhelmed with arousal the same way you were on the bus, or when you were watching trashy telenovelas. Somehow, you must overcome these slutty desires for \"bad boys\" and accept your sweet and caring Pablo as your future husband. As you're piecing together you predicament in your mind, Pablo asks, \"Would you like to see what I've been planning to do to you all day?\" He said it with a gleam in his eyes that could only mean one thing.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You figured that it would be in your best interests to warm up to Pablo. Maybe with a little effort, you could get yourself worked up again. It hadn't been particularly difficult up until that point, so why should Pablo be any different. You pull yourself off the couch and sashay over to him. You could feel the pleasant bounce of your tits and jiggle of your rounded ass as you let Pablo lead you to the bed. You peeled off your skimpy, damp, white cotton shorts and tried to let your body take over. You began coquettishly playing with yourself as you let out a soft moan. It took Pablo almost no time at all to shed his dirty work uniform and jump on top of you. He quickly entered your glistening slit and began pounding away between your creamy caramel thighs. Pablo was not a particularly well-endowed man and you could hardly feel him as he kept thrusting in and out of you. It was nothing like earlier today at the Burger King, bent over the toilet, getting reamed out by that unknown, rough man. Pablo, on the other hand, was much smaller in every way, and was much more polished than the musky bus rider you had just spread your legs for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Pablo kept fucking you, your mind drifted away, and you found yourself thinking of all the other men you would rather have exploring your nether region. Pablo just did nothing to excite you. Nevertheless, after just a few minutes you could feel Pablo clenching up as he spasmed and shot multiple loads of warm cum up into your sufficiently lubed-up box. As Pablo filled you, you were thinking about being filled by the man in Burger King just hours before. Just the thought of that pounding brought you to another loud, screaming, Spanish orgasm. You clawed into Pablo's back and arched your back, thrusting your perky tits into his chest as you both climaxed together. Pablo must have been pretty proud of his effort, as he patted your plump ass as you sauntered off to the bathroom to clean yourself up. Little did he know that even though he was on top of you, he was anywhere but on the top of your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sat on the toilet cleaning the fresh cum out of your leaky box, you thought that it would probably be best to take your birth control pill. You had checked earlier in your purse and hadn't found it. You took a few minutes rummaging through your medicine cabinet, but there were no such pills to be found. \"Dammit,\" you thought to yourself. \"Where the hell is it?\" Ultimately, you were about to give up when a though dawned on you. \"Aimee! She'll know where it is.\" You pulled out your flip phone and shot your previous self a quick text asking where her pills were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAimee quickly responded, saying \"<span class=\"chotpink\">ur catholic... cant take the pill... cant afford it too...</span>\" You followed up by asking how you were supposed to avoid getting pregnant, to which Aimee said \"<span class=\"chotpink\">u got 2 make sure they dont cum in u...</span>\" You quickly realized that you were in some trouble. \"What if they do?\" you hesitantly replied. \"<span class=\"chotpink\">Uhoh! Don't get preggers gurl!</span> <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/wink.png\" alt=\"*Wink*\" title=\"Wink\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">\" Realizing that Aimee was a little too dense to be much help you decided to change the subject in an attempt to get your mind off the fact that there was cum from multiple guys currently swirling around in your vagina. You asked Aimee what she was doing and how well she was getting acclimated. She replied, telling you that it was a relief not to be as horny as she was as Francesca. She said it was a bit embarrassing to be such a dumb slut, and to have everyone know it, but that she had basically locked herself in her room and got off three or four times to clear her head before settling down to figure out a plan for getting her grades up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were finishing up with Aimee the two of you talk again in a couple days and make sure everything was good. As you were sitting back down to watch more Telemundo, the phone buzzed again, and it was Aimee, reminding you not to miss work tomorrow. Even on Sunday, you were apparently working. But were you working your primary job with university housing, or were you working a side gig?</span></div></div>",

You slipped into bed that night next to Pablo and got yourself off two or three times as you slipped off to sleep. You awoke the next morning with Pablo's hand groping one of your burgeoning boobs. You slipped out from under his arm, subliminally aware that this was his day off. You didn't want to wake him up, and quietly slipped off to the bathroom to get ready. Your body was in autopilot as you normally didn't wake up this early, especially not as Aimee, and further still, you had no idea how to get ready as Francesca. You deftly showered and shaved every hair off your body south of your neck. The shower however, heated up your fiery latina sex drive, and you sat on the toilet for a moment as you plunged a couple fingers into your needy snatch. After bringing yourself off a few more times (hadn't it been about a dozen times in just one day as Francesca?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at your phone and realized that you were running late. You straightened your hair, applied makeup, including a gaudy amount of lip gloss to your thick, soft, pillowy lips. You then went over to the dresser to get ready. You figured that you should probably wear panties to work, and upon opening the top drawer you were greeted by a rather limited selection of bras and thongs. Almost all of your thongs were nothing more than two pieces of string. Francesca apparently adopted a rather minimalist approach to underwear. You grabbed a solid black bra and thong and put them on. The bra was a bit of a struggle, as it was designed to push your boobs up even higher. You somehow knew that it would be important to appear even bustier than you naturally were for your job. You then slipped on your tiny, stretchy Hooters tank top, which did little to hide your boobs or cover the shiny, trashy butterfly you had dangling from your belly button. You wiggled into a skin-tight pair of jeans and popped on a thick white belt. You knew that you would have to change into the requisite orange booty shorts, but you knew not to ride the bus that way. As you walked back into the bathroom, boobs jiggling like crazy, you grabbed your phone and noticed a text from Aimee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Dont 4get work! Muah!</span> <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/bigsmile.png\" alt=\"*BigSmile*\" title=\"BigSmile\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven when she was just texting, it was so clear that Aimee was such a dumb slut. Unfortunately, you thought to yourself, you were as well, albeit a less obvious one. You didn't bother responding with a message, choosing instead to snap a quick pic and send it via Snapchat. As the picture got beamed to Aimee, you couldn't help but think about who was in the picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/kuckxfj\" target=\"_blank\">http://tinyurl.com/kuckxfj</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you saw was not a legitimate, intelligent, or respectable member of society. What you saw was a sexed-up, little latina tart who you knew all too well struggled to keep her thighs together. You were pleased that you weren't the overtly trashy dumpster-slut that you were as Aimee, but you were worried that it would be difficult to succeed in mediation with such an over-heated pussy. You could already sense yourself getting damp just at the thought of all the men who were soon to be leering at you. You also realized that it would be unlikely that you would get back home without having sex in some way with somebody. Nevertheless, you mentally tried to steel your resolve. You would keep your legs closed today. Just go to work, serve some wings, and come home. It's as simple as that. Maybe you could fuck Pablo a couple times to settle the fire that would surely be raging later this afternoon. That would kill two birds with one stone and hopefully set you on the path back to respectability. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grabbed your purse and hustled out of your apartment, heading down to the bus stop. Fortunately, the bus was on time and you were quickly on your way to the local mall which had a large Hooters out front near the highway. When you arrived, there were no customers yet, just other waitresses, each busying themselves preparing themselves for the football rush that would inevitably begin around noon. As you walked in, a man in a black Hooters polo called you over to his perch at the bar, saying \"Hey Francesca, get over here. I need you to do me a favor.\" You tottered over to the bar and asked him what it was that he needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a group of regulars coming in, and I want you to take good care of them. They asked me for my best girl, and I figured you would be up to the task.\" You weren't sure whether to be happy that you seemed to be an accomplished employee or worried because you were afraid you were being selected for your higher likelihood of putting out. You hoped it was the former, but your tiny thong got moist thinking that it might be the latter. Either way, you certainly couldn't say no, so you just accepted it and told your boss you would do your best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the rush began, your table of VIPs showed up. It was three men and one woman. The men were dressed in jeans and polos of their respective NFL clubs of choice. The woman was conservatively dressed in dark-colored jeans and a pink Jay Cutler #6 Bears jersey. Your boss came over and whispered to you, \"That's them. Don't fuck this up, girl.\" And with that he gave you a subtle, yet sharp, slap on the ass, causing you to involuntarily squeak as your plump cheek quivered and wobbled under your orange booty shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked over to their table and introduced yourself. The men all order large beers and the woman ordered a cockail. You headed off to fetch their drinks, but as you did, you overheard the woman talking to one of the men. \"Look at her,\" she said, chuckling. \"She's thin, but those tits cannot be real. And that ass is so big, it's jiggling out of the bottom of her shorts. What a little fucking tramp.\" The men all guffawed to themselves, with one replying, \"Now, now, Janice. Not every girl can be as successful and intelligent as you. Some of them just have to work what they've got.\" \"She certainly is,\" Janice replied under her breath. \"As tarted up as she is, what with the piercings and the dick-sucking lips, you have to figure there isn't much going on upstairs. Everyone chuckled heartily, enjoying another laugh at your expense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe that it was you they were talking about. You became painfully aware of the hyper-sexualized nature of your body. You could acutely feel your ass bouncing and jiggling with each step. You could feel your boobs bouncing in your push-up bra, threatening to pop out with a little more effort. You could feel your slick, soft lips, knowing full well that most anybody would immediately assume that you used them for one thing, and one thing one: cushioning cocks and they slid in and out of your mouth. You knew that you looked like a sultry little slut, and what amazed you was that you still felt less trashy than when you had been Aimee. It seemed your definition of normal had been altered slightly, causing you to forget that some women weren't pierced, didn't show off their tits with everything they wore, and sometimes had underwear that covered more than just their pussy lips. But at this moment, that wasn't the type of woman that you were. You were again coming to terms with the fact that objectively speaking, you were nothing more than a simple, stupid slut. You were ogled, not respected, and people saw you as little more than a disposable repository for their spare semen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTearing up a little, you composed yourself, wiped your eyes and grabbed their drinks. You sashayed back over to their table and served them. They then ordered some food and you tottered back to the kitchen. While you were back there your boss approached you again. \"Good job Francesca. They all seem pretty happy. Now, just make sure anything they need or want they get. No matter what. Do this and I assure you that you'll get a great tip. From them, and maybe even from me.\" With that, you got another swat to your rounded rear and your boss plodded off to his office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed and the group became focused on the game. All of them were getting pretty boozy as it entered the fourth quarter. You were serving another table when you heard the woman call out, \"Franny, come over here please!\" You headed over to find that she needed another cocktail. This was her third or fourth of the afternoon and she seemed much looser than when she originally came in. After taking her order, you turned away, but she grabbed your shoulder and said, \"I just had a quick question.\" You turned to face her. \"Your tits... Are they real? I mean, wow.\" she rambled, obviously feeling chipper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to just walk away, or better yet, slap that bitch. But you knew you couldn't. You knew that your job, and probably livelihood, and ultimately, your ability to complete remediation hinged on you keeping your cool. Resigned to your position, you could do nothing but look down and mumble, \"No ma'am. They're real.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well. You're quite the busty thing, aren't you. You must be really popular with the boys back in the barrio, eh chica,\" she ribbed. \"Me, I could never deal with jugs quite like that. It's just too much hassle for a professional like myself. But I suppose in your profession, it could be useful. What are you, a DD at least?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No ma'am,\" you reply. \"I'm just a D-cup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you could've fooled me, sweetheart. Now go freshen up my drink, will you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walked away the entire table snickered to themselves. Your cheeks went beet red. You were beyond embarrassed. No one took you seriously. To them, you were nothing more than a big-titted, empty-headed slut.

But you knew you were supposed to make a good impression with this group, and you didn't want to fuck it up so late in the process. You also looked over and saw your boss staring at you expectantly. You sigh, and muster an \"ummm, ok,\" as you follow them out the door. As you turn the corner around the building, the woman whispers in your ear, \"be a good girl, now,\" and squeezes your ripe behind. \"ooooo,\" she coos, \"so big and firm, yet still soft and jiggly. Perfect for a girl like you.\" You know in the back of your head that this is heading in a bad direction, yet you can feel yourself getting wet as you're getting objectified, especially by this otherwise conservative and professional-looking woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally reach their black Suburban, which is parked behind the building.

You need to stay focused on not give in. You need to make sure you don't fuck up your chance to finish your remediation.

The other two men get up in the front seat and prepare for the show they expect you'll inevitably put on. You sit in the seat waiting for direction, but no one is offering you any. After a minute, the man sitting next to you says, \"Well, any ideas?\" Confident that you know what they're expecting you chuckle to yourself and say, \"I've got a few.\" You cannot believe the feeling that's taking you over, but your pussy is literally gushing with arousal at this point. You slip down between the captain's chairs in the second row of the Suburban and feel the black carpet tickling your knees. This is a position you've found yourself in all too often recently, but you now knew exactly what to do. You deftly unzipped the man's pants and pulled out his johnson. It wasn't particularly long, but it was thick. You slid your thick, pillowy lips over his shaft as you lowered your head down onto his growing erection. You could feel his hands sliding through your lustrous black hair, before he eventually grabbed a tight grip on a lock of hair and forced his cock down into your throat. You were shocked, both by his action and how your body reacted. You could feel yourself relaxing all of your gag reflexes. Clearly, Francesca was an old pro at giving head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bobbed up and down on his dick for a bit, and you could hear the woman behind you egging you on. \"That's it slut, suck it long and suck it hard.\" She chuckled as she continued, \"we figured you were the dumbest, skankiest chick in there, and boy were we right. Look at you, what a professional cocksucker. Me personally, I can't stand the thought of a penis in my mouth, but looking at you, I can see it's almost like an art form.\" You try to zone her out as you work on your target, but she makes herself known when she says she wants to improve the view. She starts tugging on your orange booty shorts and peeling them off your plump ass. As your thong comes into view, the woman laughs again saying, \"Timmy, you were right. She does wear panties, if you can call those things underwear. I guess I owe you $10.\" She gives your ass a firm smack and continues, \"look at that thing jiggle. Those Mexican chicks sure have a lot of ass. I hate wearing thongs, but hey, I guess they're easier to get off in a pinch than real underwear, isn't that right Franny!\" The two guys up front laugh with the woman. The man whose cock is presently in your mouth isn't laughing though. He's a bit too engaged in the sexy little thing bobbing up and down between his legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman starts up again, saying \"take your top off Franny, let's see those jugs.\" You try ignoring her and focusing in on the dick at hand, but you quickly feel her drunkenly fumbling with your bra straps. She works it for a few seconds before finally releasing it and pulling your bra out from under your tank top. Your tits, now unrestrained, swing heavily under you as you work, and you can feel your fully erect nipples chafing on the scratchy material of the Hooters tank. Overwhelmed with heat and desire, and not wanting to hurt your engorged nipples, you momentarily pop off of the man's cock and peel off your tank, leaving you topless and jiggling all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at those melons,\" one of the men up front opines. \"You think I can get in on the action?\" You largely don't process what he means, and choose to just ignore it. The woman, on the other hand, cheers him on. \"Go ahead Timmy, spit-roast this whore.\" You can feel her hands pull your shorts all the way down, leaving you in just your thong, but not for long. Timmy climbs over the center console and into the seat previously occupied by you. You hear him unzipping his pants, but the sound doesn't register. You're in another haze of horniness, just like you were yesterday on the bus. Timmy slides your thong to the side, and when he presses his head up against your rear entrance, you quickly take notice. You open your mouth to protest, but full of cock you can only mutter something garbled and incomprehensible. That isn't enough to dissuade Timmy who plunges his dick into your ass, filling you with a sharp feeling of pain, but also another wave of arousal. The pain isn't as bad as you would've imagined, as it seems that this isn't the first time that Francesca has offered her ass up to someone. Without thinking you push back on his dick, increasing both your pain and pleasure. It's about that time that the first man comes to fruition and begins shooting his hot load down your throat as the man behind him keeps pumping into your soft, cushiony ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit,\" the woman in the back exclaimed. \"She swallowed it all. What a good little whore.\" You could do nothing but moan as you felt Timmy's throbbing erection pounding your ass. The woman reached up and pinched your fully erect nipples causing you to let out an unexpected and uber-feminine \"EEP!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, you like being used like this, don't you Franny?\" the woman said, egging you on. All you could muster was a sultry \"yeahh.\" You didn't know why you were agreeing with this bitch, but you had fully lost control. You didn't notice the man you had just sucked off switch seats with the man from the driver's seat. The next thing you knew, there was another hard cock being pushed into your mouth. On instinct, you relaxed your throat and started bobbing anew. Again being filled from both ends, you furious bounced your mouth and your ass up and down to create the maximum pleasure possible. You were obviously doing a good job as you could feel Timmy tense up for a moment before blasting hot jizz up your ass, which promptly triggered an orgasm of your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, the slut is cumming!\" shouted the woman in the third row. \"I can't fucking believe it. A dick in her mouth and ass was enough to get her off! Your such a nasty little whore, aren't you Franny?\" As she said it, she reached up and cupped one of your big, wobbling tits. With a mouth full of dick you couldn't respond. The woman, however, wasted no time in using her other hand to slide a few fingers inside your vagina. \"Holy shit, she's so fucking wet,\" the woman exclaimed. \"She's loving this! Hey Bobby, you might want to finish in her box, she's ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea,\" Bobby replied. At that point he pulled your hair up, lifting your head off his dick and said, \"climb aboard there babe, you're going to take a ride.\" You swung one leg over him in a fluid motion and impaled yourself upon his shaft, eliciting a long and guttural moan from you, which in turn brought about a fit of laughter from seemingly everyone in the car. You didn't care as you were focused on one thing, and one thing only. You bounced up and down on the mans lap like a mad woman, your tits wobbling and jiggling all over, beads of sweat forming on your forehead, and your hair becoming tousled and messy as you repeatedly arched your back and ran your hands through it. With all this effort it didn't take long for Bobby to climax, shooting the final load up into your steaming-hot little box. As he did, you could feel yourself cum over and over, before you finally lifted off of him and felt the warm jizz seeping down your thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's leaking everywhere. What a stupid little tramp,\" the woman said from the backseat. As your arousal subsided and you regained control you were overwhelmed with a feeling of shame. You had given in again, and this time it was three guys all at once. You also felt like in some sick way, you were getting off to the humiliation being heaped on you the whole time by the woman in the back. You quickly slipped your thong back on, and you felt it absorb a lot of the cum seeping out of your holes. You also realized that for the third time in just over a day, a different man had cum inside your pussy. The woman was cackling to herself in the backseat, wearing your black bra like a hat. She said, \"tip the little tart and let's get out of here. Hop out there Franny.\" You pulled your tank on, nipples threatening to cut through the fabric and slid on your moist, orange shorts. You jiggled out of the car and each man tossed you a hundred dollar bill, and the woman tossed you your bra saying, \"better put this on. You wouldn't want anyone thinking you were a slut now, would you?\" With that, she rolled up her window and cackled to herself. The man who you had first sucked off reached out and handed you a business card that read \"Buddy Larson, Talent Scout, Elite Exotic Entertainment.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me know if you ever need work,\" he said, as he rolled up his window and pulled out of the parking lot. Still in a bit of a haze, you wobbled back through the back entrance and quickly into the bathroom to compose yourself. You spent a moment cleaning up, but quickly realized that your thong was soaked through with semen. You decided that it would be best to toss it in your locker and go without for the rest of your shift. As you tenuously walked out of the locker room, you were met by your boss who chuckled and said, \"you can take off early, Francesca. You must need some rest.\" With a wink, he slipped another fifty dollar bill in between your bulging cleavage and retired to his office. You blushed redder than you ever had and quickly gathered your things and hustled out of there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you got home, Pablo was gone. You didn't know where, but you figured it would be best to call Aimee and check in, with a hope of maybe getting some tips on how to control your seemingly unchecked arousal. Aimee picks up and you try to play it cool, asking her how she was doing and what she did last night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Aimee respond?</span></div></div>",

She tried to say no, but they were insistent and she figured that they wouldn't leave unless she obliged them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't, like, realize how totally low my tolerance is. I took one, and then another, and pretty soon I was, like, getting all dressed up to go to some frat house for, like, a big party and stuff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unintelligent and bimboish prattle was all too familiar to you. You couldn't believe that just days ago you used to sound and, even worse, look just like Aimee. You ask her if anything interesting happened at the party. She told you that she had been roped into playing numerous drinking games with one of the frat brothers, and eventually she got dared to make out with another girl. She says that she stupidly did it, and while they were kissing the girl unlatched her bra and took it from her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She, like, was totally not drunk and stuff. The guys must have dared her to do it. They told me that, like, I couldn't have it back until I showed them my titties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, like, yeah. I needed my fucking bra back and stuff. Plus I was drunk and, like, super giggly. I was into that guy and wanted to fuck him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou proceeded to find out that Aimee had sucked him off in the bathroom before letting one of his friends fuck her pussy. You weren't surprised. You knew how difficult it was to be as dumb as Aimee and try to resist anything when you're drunk. You're just too gullible for your own good. Aimee went on to explain that it was difficult for her to deal with her diminished intelligence and that she knew she had to focus extra hard to make sure she could raise her GPA and potentially alter her profile for the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were relieved that Aimee seemed to be struggling as well, so you weren't the only one. The conversation then shifted to you with Aimee asking how your shift at Hooters went. You explained that your boss had put you on a special assignment with a table of VIPs, at which point Aimee stopped you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were there, like, three guys and a girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, they come in every once in a while and totally try to take me out back and stuff. You, like, said no, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were silent for a moment, causing Aimee to shout, \"LIKE O-M-G FRANCESCA, you totally shouldn't have, like, done that and stuff. Like, what did they want you to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou explained everything that had happened in all the sordid details, explaining that you had fucked three guys and taken a load in your pussy. You also told her that you were paid $350 in tips afterwards, with some even coming from your boss. You couldn't help but break down and cry a little as you finished by telling her that you knew it was bad, but that you were just so turned on and lost in the haze that you could never stop it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Francesca, you're, like, a super-hot, super-horny little latina lady. You are totally going to crave dick and stuff. But, like, you have to just keep yourself away from all that, k? Pablo could tots find out... He was already, like, suspi- worried about me and stuff. He, like, must've thought I was sleeping around... which I was. But, like, not all the time, k? Just a little bit with like, Enrique and stuff. I, like, always tried not to fuck randoms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou asked Aimee what, if anything, you could do to control your urges. \"You have to, like, make yourself cum all the time. It's the only thing that, like, calms you down and stuff. I even took breaks from work to, like, finger myself in the bathroom. If you don't, then you'll totally lose control. You gotta keep it under control, k? We're both total sluts, ya know. It's, like, more obvious with me because I'm such a totally dumb ditz and everything. But you're a slut too, Francesca. You just, like, do a better job hiding it sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew she was right. While Aimee was overtly just a sloppy, over-sexed, stacked Asian bimbo, you were equally as slutty. It was clear to anyone that you're hot and ready pretty much whenever. If you can't get this under control you could lose Pablo and miss out on the chance of ever getting your life back on track. You didn't want to be stuck as Francesca Colmenarez your entire life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Aimee both agreed to talk everyday to check in and try to make sure that the other is keeping up and staying on pace to get their respective shit together. Aimee explains that she is formulating a plan to force herself to study and she's emailing professors asking if she can retake some exams she missed when she was hungover and overslept. She tells you that you also need to form a plan so you can stick to it. You're unsure what exactly you're going to do, but you hang up both feeling a little more confident and secure, knowing that someone else understands your situation and has your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[<i>author's note: The girl who was originally Aimee Wu and became Francesca is clearly the protagonist of this story, but I'm going to allow a split in focus here.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Amazingly, in a herculean showing of willpower and dedication, Aimee has managed to raise her grades enough that the university has determined that by the end of the semester her GPA will reach 2.04, bringing her into compliance with the mandate issued to her. She received a few letters of support from some professors, including Professor Langwell. She made sure not to mention that getting the letter required another blow job. She didn't feel too bad about it because she still did all the required work, Prof. Langwell is just a bit of a perv and couldn't resist holding her rampant sexuality over her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis isn't to say that Aimee didn't have some hiccups along the way. There was the night when she blew five guys in a college bar bathroom, but she attributed that to all the tequila she drank while celebrating the B- she had just received on a fashion quiz. She also unwittingly returned to the house where her bra was stapled to the ceiling. She didn't notice it until someone asked her if that was her in the picture. She couldn't hide her embarrassment and took a couple pulls of rum to make her forget, which led to her waking up in some frat brother's bed with a salty taste in her mouth and a sore vagina. Aimee knew she was still a dumb slut, but she was proud that she was able to overcome that to some degree and not allow her slips into bimboism to last more than a few hours, or a night at worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was the day, though. She had a meeting with Ms. Souto to discuss her progress and potentially make alterations to her profile that would make it easier for her to focus on her studies and potentially receive the degree she had hoped to obtain. Hopefully for the last time, Aimee squeezed her massive tits into a neon cheetah print DD bra and hiked up a bright pink, glittering g-string. She paired that with an obscenely tight, low-cut halter top that did nothing to contain her mammoth mammaries. She tossed on a pair of skin-tight yoga pants that stretched obscenely over her ass, leaving nothing to the imagination. She could feel the familiar swell of her quivering butt cheeks as her thong rode high and proud over her waistline. She dolled her face up without even thinking about it, caking on lip gloss and makeup. She looked at the chubby, Asian sexpot in the mirror and prayed that this would be the last time she saw her. She grabbed her new purse (campus security couldn't find the one she lost, despite the embarrassing details she gave about all the condoms. booze, and panties she had in it), stepped into a pair of 4\" pink heels (to match her thong), and jiggled off towards Ms. Souto's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Souto was waiting for her when she arrived and said, \"Aimee, please take a seat. It looks like you've done quite well for yourself. I've just received notice from the disciplinary board that you've met the requirements of emergency academic non-compliance and are on track to bring your GPA up to standard. Let me be the first to say congratulations. This profile is certainly not easy, what with the diminished intellect and hyper-sexual body. We're all quite pleased to see that you've had the wherewithal to not only settle this compliance issue as Aimee Wu, but to complete remediation as Francesca Colmenarez. As you know, that was not a particularly easy profile either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could feel yourself beaming with pride as you said, \"like, thanks, Ms. Souto. It's been totally hard and stuff.\" You also thought internally about how dumb you sounded, and how that would soon cease to be an issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can imagine,\" Ms. Souto said. \"Now, Aimee, as a result of your demonstrated improvement you are now eligible to make an alteration to your profile. You must remain as Aimee Wu, and you must stay as a Tau Gamma, but you may be able to occupy a different position within the chapter. As you're aware, you're presently the chapter slut. Every chapter has a girl who is dumb, barely passing her classes, and basically a whore. It's pretty clear that you are presently the quintessential sorority slut. Looking at Tau Gamma, I see that there isn't presently a chapter bookworm or a chapter vice-president. Let me explain these profiles to you and then show you the printouts for each before you make a decision. The vice-president is usually quite pretty, but not at all slutty. She may or may not be sexually active, but she is smart enough to know that as an executive officer in the chapter, she must maintain an image of respectability. She's not dumb, but also not necessarily a genius either. She would most likely be a below-average student in a challenging major or an above-average student in an easier major. She is very socially adept, as she was elected to her position by the other sisters, but she is social in a professional way, as opposed to available in a sexual way, like you are now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quietly blush as Ms. Souto reminds you of what a skank you are. You're unfazed though, because you know that it will all soon be changing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The chapter bookworm, on the other hand,\" Ms. Souto continued, \"is not nearly as pretty or as social as the vice-president. She is not unpopular with the sisters, but she keeps to herself enough that she isn't well known. The bookworm is usually sexually inactive, and may actually be frustrated with her lack of attention from the opposite sex. This concern is usually assuaged by her high performance in academics and her methodical, conservative nature, which makes her less needing of external validation. The chapter bookworm will inevitably graduate near the top of her class, but may not feel entirely fulfilled by her college experience. Ultimately, Aimee, it's up to you. You are the one who decides how the rest of your collegiate career will shape up, and what path you will ultimately take. At this university, we pride ourselves in being able to find a place for all of our students, and it's important that you choose wisely. If you become unhappy and deviate too strongly from your profile, you may inadvertently change it, and if the balance of your chapter is thrown out of wack, profiles may need to be altered to restore balance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod understandingly, and Ms. Souto says, \"So what'll it be Aimee? VP or bookworm?\"  </span></div></div>",

I wanna be, like, really smart.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK Aimee, let me enter your selection here and finalize it. Now you'll just hang out here for the changes to process and then you can be on your way.\" Ms. Souto reached under her desk and grabbed the printout. \"Here you go. Your changes should process any second now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you wait patiently, you glance over the printout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPREVIOUS INFO<br>\r\nAimee Wu<br>\r\nAge: 19<br>\r\nHair: Black w/ highlights<br>\r\nHeight: 5'3\u201d<br>\r\nWeight: 124 lbs<br>\r\nEthnicity: Asian (Chinese)<br>\r\nMeasurements: 34DD-29-38<br>\r\nMajor: Fashion Design<br>\r\nGPA: 1.87<br>\r\nAlcohol: Y<br>\r\nSmokes: Y<br>\r\nSexually Active: Y<br>\r\nSex Drive: Med/High<br>\r\nIQ: 96<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNEW INFO<br>\r\n<b>Amy Wu</b><br>\r\nAge: 19<br>\r\n<b>Hair: Black</b><br>\r\n<b>Height: 5'1\u201d</b><br>\r\n<b>Weight: 93 lbs</b><br>\r\nEthnicity: Asian (Chinese)<br>\r\n<b>Measurements: 32AA-22-28</b><br>\r\n<b>Major: Biology</b><br>\r\n<b>GPA: 3.96</b><br>\r\n<b>Alcohol: N</b><br>\r\n<b>Smokes: N</b><br>\r\n<b>Sexually Active: N</b><br>\r\n<b>Sex Drive: Low</b><br>\r\n<b>IQ: 122</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you finished reading, the changes began. The first thing you noticed was a sense of clarity as you mind quickened and sharpened until you were quite the high-achiever. No one would be talking down to you or not taking you seriously anymore. They still might not understand what you're saying, but for entirely different reasons. Your biggest struggle would be making sure that you could explain things in terms simple enough for most people to understand. The next thing you noticed was a pronounced blurring in your vision. You were afraid that something bad was happening until a bulky pair of glasses appeared on your face, restoring the visual clarity you had previously. Next, you feel yourself begin to shrink. You were already short before, and you couldn't believe that you were getting even shorter. Now barely over five foot you were a real pipsqueak. Next you felt your boobs deflating like two balloons that had sprung leaks. You watched them disappear as your bra began to look rather ridiculous over your tiny nubs, which were little more than puffy nipples. You didn't stand a chance of ever filling a real bra again, and hardly needed one as it was, except maybe just for modesty. You could also feel your stomach contracting back in, but instead of a taut, tight stomach, your's still had a layer of baby fat, albeit thin. You were like a rail, but you had no definition and had clearly never seen the inside of a gym. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour plump, round ass, and luscious thighs also began to shrink, becoming flat and bony. The seat you were sitting in became decidedly more uncomfortable as you lost all the soft, jiggly padding you had enjoyed as both Aimee and Francesca. Your legs look spindly and awkward, and you knew that your gait would be far less sexual or alluring and much more clumsy. The dark, fake tan you had also began to lighten, leaving your skin pale and pallid, as if you had rarely, if ever, spent time out in the sun. You could feel your eyes becoming more slanted, and less round and doe-like. Your nose also grew flatter and wider, much less attractive than the cute button nose you had previously. Next, your lips shrank from puffy, dick-sucking pillows into thin strips that did little to delineate your mouth from the rest of your face. Speaking of which, your face began to shift around, becoming less sexual, less attractive, and more simple and plain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the physical changes had subsided, your clothes were next to alter. You felt your neon cheetah print bra shrink and change fabric, from a shimmering satin into a plain cotton. Also, where you previously had well-defined and capacious cups, your bra was now essentially shapeless, like a training bra, designed more to shield your chest from view than to provide any support. Honestly, you had nothing that needed support. You would fail even the basic pencil test that girls did in middle school to determine whether or not someone needed a bra. The pattern on the bra melted away, leaving simple, plain white behind. Next, you felt your glittery pink thong shrink to fit your flat, pancake butt, but then it quickly expanded, into loose, full-cut white cotton panties. Your underwear was now designed entirely for function with no thought towards fashion, and you couldn't feel a pinch or a tug anywhere as everything was loose and airy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour yoga pants became thicker and less stretchy, so that no one could see through them. This hardly mattered as you had no ass to speak of, so you wouldn't have been able to stretch out even the tightest pair of yoga pants. Your heels shrank down and became simple, black flats. Your halter top changed into a conservative and flowy dress, designed to hide everything and show nothing. As if you weren't already covered enough, you felt a boring red cardigan appear over your shoulders. Ultimately, you weren't ugly. You were just very plain, very boring, and very un-alluring. Somehow you knew that you had received almost no male attention in high school or college, and you could feel your knowledge of sex that was encyclopedic before slip away until it was nothing more than the basic sex-ed classes you had in fourth grade. You hardly knew what sex was, let alone how to do it well. The final change was your purse, which had changed from the patent leather number you had before into a bland, brown, burlap satchel. You looked inside and say a wallet with a driver's license for an \"Amy Wu.\" Wow, you had even dropped the sluttier spelling of your name. You also noticed that all the condoms, booze, panties, bar receipts and sex toys from your previous purse had all disappeared. In their place was post-its, a calculator, numerous text books, a day planner, and a nalgene water bottle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked in the mirror and saw the new, bookish and boring Amy Wu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/lpyn9jz\" target=\"_blank\">http://tinyurl.com/lpyn9jz</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least I'm not an incomprehensible ditz,\" you heard yourself saying, sounding nasally and nerdy. \"I feel like my mind is engulfed in flames, everything is so sharp and vivid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you are quite intelligent Amy,\" Ms. Souto replied. \"You better get going and start acclimating to the new you. I hope you enjoy your decision.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm most certain that I will, undoubtedly, enjoy this over the harlot that I once was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that you leave Ms. Souto's office and head where?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you walk into your room, you notice that it's totally different. It's much more like it was back when you initially became Amy Wu. Where there were previously bowls of condoms, slutty clothes strewn about, and large bottles of booze, there were now stacks and stacks of books, nary a stray sock on the floor, and nothing more than a few boxes of tea bags. You breathed a deep sigh of relief as you felt like your life was finally normalizing. Maybe with enough work and dedication you could get your old body back, or at least become a man again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it was, you sat down at your computer to take stock of your class schedule, workload, etc. You were, quite literally, taken aback. You were taking 18 credit hours, with the majority of them being very difficult sounding science courses like \"practical relativity\" or \"nuclear physics.\" You also noticed that you were interning with a senior research professor, and probably dedicated every spare moment of your free time to that, homework, and what few moments of sleep you could steal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed again, as you sat down to what seemed like it would be a long night of work. You took solace in the fact that you were no longer a slut, however. Far better to be a boring, reclusive, bookwork than a huge-titted, cock-sucking bimbo. As you looked at your work, it may as well have been Greek to you. But within just a few minutes, your expertise and familiarity began to wash over you. Everything started to make more sense, and while it was still challenging, you were making it through. You hadn't felt this powerful or in control in quite some time. It was refreshing to have your best asset between your ears than between your bra straps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout three hours into your work, your temples begin to throb and your thought process begins to fuzz up. Not because you were ditzy or stupid in anyway, but simply because your brain had been in overdrive for some time now, and it was beginning to take its toll. You stood up from your seat and strolled over to your closet, casually thumbing through your clothes. You noticed how bland, boring, and ill-fitting your clothes are. You start idly browsing through your drawers, only to find thick, cotton panties and socks in almost exclusively white. Your bras are purely functional, and have no feature designed to add any sort of femininity to your silhouette. You again sigh, resigned to this new lifestyle, which you are still convinced is for the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you're about to sit down to return to your work, there's a knock at your door. Again, it's Mary Leonard, but this time she seems much friendlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Amy, I know you're really busy, but we're having a swap with Phi Psi tonight, and it'll probably be pretty low key. I just was hoping to get most of the chapter to show up, and was wondering if you could come by for a couple hours.

Sadly for you, it was much more difficult to get ready than it used to be. Back when you were Aimee, it was easy. Just grab a thong, bra, and slutty club dress, squeeze yourself into all three, jump into a pair of heels and you were ready to go. Now, you realized that it would be a stretch to even look cute, let alone sexy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about it and decided that it was probably for the better. You were smart, driven, and on the path to success. Who cared if you looked a little frumpy and boring on the way. You quickly grabbed a pair of loose cotton panties and slipped them over your boyish hips. You followed that with a white bra, listed as a 32AA, but which honestly looked like a preteen's training bra. You wore a white button-down blouse tucked into big, faded blue mom jean shorts. Since you were so waspish and tiny, you tossed on a mustard yellow cardigan to make sure you stayed warm.

When you slid into the tiny thong, it fell down as you had neither the hips nor the ass to keep it up. You collapsed onto your bed, in tears. Even when you tried to be just the tiniest bit sexy you failed. You couldn't believe it. After spending so much time as Francesca, and then Aimee, you couldn't believe that you were missing it in a weird, fucked up way. You just wanted to be a little attractive, to be cute sometimes, but in this body that was all but impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, worried, and even a bit scared, you called Ms. Souto on her emergency line. She picked up on the second ring and said. \"Amy, what seems to be the problem?\" You responded, sobbing, \"I hate this personality, this body, and this life. It's like I'll never have fun again. I can't live like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Souto replies, \"Well Amy, you did mention that you didn't want any temptations. You wanted to not have to worry about being slutty in any way,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know. And I love being smart, but I'm afraid I took it too far. There has to be some happy medium.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we can certainly talk about this in my office tomorrow if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou agree to meet up the next day. You quickly return the thong, embarrassed, and change into pajamas and go to sleep. The next day, you toss on some more frumpy, boring clothes and head down to Ms. Souto's office. She's already there waiting for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy, it seems like you're torn between two worlds. I know that, on the one hand, you want to be respected and intelligent, and ultimately receive your degree. But I also know that you want to have fun and be social. It seems like you would've been perfect as the VP, but you chose to swing the pendulum all the way to the other side. Unfortunately, the position of VP has been filled, so I can't offer you that compromise. You have to make a decision. You either stay as the chapter bookworm, or go back to being the house slut. You have to make a decision, and you have to stick with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I can go back to being dumb like that again,\" you reply. \"It's just too much trouble. I just know I'll end up back where I started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know you don't have to be so dumb. Being the house slut is a holistic endeavor. Not every slut is cut from the same cloth. There are dumb bimbos, but then there are girls that are slutty for different reasons. Since you did so well in remediation, you can have more of a hand in crafting your new persona. It really is up to you, but you can't be swapping every day. You need to pick a side of the fence and stay there. So what'll it be Amy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit and think, worried and conflicted, but you know you must choose.

Big, or something more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think for a moment, unsure exactly how far you want to go down the rabbit hole. You thought back to all the nights of you, parading around half naked, with your tits on display. As the memories came back, you felt a chill run up your spine, and a wry smile spread across your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a low voice, you said \"I'm thinking of something more...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Souto raised her eyebrows, and asked \"How much more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just know how much power big boobs have over guys. I had that power once, and I want it back. If I'm going to be the house slut again, I want to be known as the girl with huge tits. Last time around, I had big ones, but I was chubby. I get turned on thinking of what it might be like if I were thin and busty, like tits on a stick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Souto laughed inwardly to herself at the mousy, nerdy Asian girl fantasizing about being a big-titted slut. But this was her job, and she was here to keep the university interesting, so she pressed on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfectly fine,\" said Ms. Souto. \"Now, let's walk through some of the other decisions you'll have to make. First, your height. I know it'll be tempting to return to a normal height, or even give yourself that leggy physique that every girl dreams of, but remember, that will require additional expenses that will likely require a toll be taken on your IQ. So bear that in mind when making your decision.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh to yourself. You really hated being such a pipsqueak, but you really didn't want to be a complete airhead again. Ultimately you tell Ms. Souto, \"I'll stay short. It's a small price to pay for not being a moron.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, we'll keep you at 5'1\". Now, there's three relatively small things that will help you balance out the expense and preserve much of your IQ. The first is your vocabulary. The general default setting is to a middle-of-the-road level of profanity. We could up that and make you much more vulgar, which would save you some intellectual expense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would that mean?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, first off, you wouldn't be able to refer to any of your body parts by their anatomical name. You wouldn't say words like 'breasts' or 'vagina,' instead you'd say 'tits' or 'jugs' and 'box' or 'cunt.' Additionally, you'd probably end up swearing like a sailor and just being generally profane. I know it's not a great trait, but if you want to avoid being a huge ditz, it will help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK,\" you say, choosing to not even fight it. There didn't seem to be any reason to try and avoid it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Second, there's really no way around this. Your sex drive needs to be high. If you kept it at low, or even medium, that would result in a huge payment to be made out of your brain. I assume this won't be a problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't like the idea of needing to have sex again, but it was better than being so stupid, plus needing to have sex would be better than never being touched. You just look down glumly and don't reply, prompting Ms. Souto to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, the third thing you can do is become much more vain. This will transform you into one of those girls who is obsessed with herself. You'll primp and preen at the mirror for an excessive amount of time, and take an obnoxious number of selfies, but again, this is a small price to pay for someone who wants to avoid being an idiot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, you cannot disagree, and remain silent even though you're disappointed about the fact that you're about to turn into a class A bitch. Nevertheless, you reason that it cannot be worse than being completely devoid of personality, so you don't fight it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, ok. It looks like we can maintain much of your intellect, but we'll need to make one more change. There seems to be no way around it: you need to develop a fetish. The simplest way to do that is to increase your submissiveness and give you a fixation, probably either oral or anal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would that affect me?\" you inquire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, with the increase in submissiveness you'll find that you enjoy being ordered around by men and that you enjoy some mild humiliation. You won't be able to hold your own in arguments and such, not because you're unable to from an intelligence perspective, but because you just default towards capitulating and giving in. You'll need to be careful because you could easily be manipulated by a strong-willed man, but since you won't be a moron, you should be able to avoid that, or at least recognize it. As far as the fixation goes, that's pretty much self-explanatory. With an oral fixation, you'll gravitate towards fellatio quite frequently, and will obtain sexual pleasure from swallowing semen. With an anal fixation, you will ask, and potentially beg, men to fuck you in the ass, and you may need to put things into your ass to quell any building sexual desire. Do you think you can handle all this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about it for a minute, and then reluctantly agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK then,\" replied Ms. Souto. \"Well, which fixation would you prefer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou answer that you'd rather have an:</span></div></div>",

Plus, guys would be staring right at your soon-to-be stunning tits when you used your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, alright,\" says Ms. Souto. \"Let me finalize those changes and you can be on your way Amy, or should I say Aimee, since that will likely be your preferred spelling again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Souto passes you the familiar printout, which you read as you prepare for your upcoming changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPREVIOUS INFO<br>\r\nAmy Wu<br>\r\nAge: 19<br>\r\nHair: Black<br>\r\nHeight: 5'1\u201d<br>\r\nWeight: 93 lbs<br>\r\nEthnicity: Asian (Chinese)<br>\r\nMeasurements: 32AA-22-28<br>\r\nMajor: Biology<br>\r\nGPA: 3.96<br>\r\nAlcohol: N<br>\r\nSmokes: N<br>\r\nSexually Active: N<br>\r\nSex Drive: Low<br>\r\nIQ: 122<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNEW INFO<br>\r\nAimee Wu<br>\r\nAge: 19<br>\r\nHair: Black<br>\r\nHeight: 5'1\u201d<br>\r\nWeight: 101 lbs<br>\r\nEthnicity: Asian (Chinese)<br>\r\nMeasurements: 34G-24-32<br>\r\nMajor: Communications<br>\r\nGPA: 2.85<br>\r\nAlcohol: Y<br>\r\nSmokes: N<br>\r\nSexually Active: Y<br>\r\nSex Drive: High<br>\r\nIQ: 104<br>\r\nAdditional: Vulgar, Submissive, Vain, Oral Fixation<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you read the printout, you cannot help but feel slightly disappointed in yourself. You could have been the valedictorian of your class, or at least close. But instead you gave all that up, and chose to be slutty. And not just a little slutty, you agreed to reacquire the reputation of \"house slut\" again, so you knew the embarrassment and shame would be returning quite soon. Nevertheless, you didn't care. You've learned that despite everything, this is who you are. You could not live happily as a brainiac. That just wasn't you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you rationalized your decision to yourself, your changes kicked in. The first thing you noticed was the loss of the extreme clarity you had previously enjoyed. Your thought process was slowing down, and you were again becoming dumber. Fortunately, this time it wasn't nearly as extreme as before. You knew you weren't a genius, but you weren't afraid of doing the work for your now much easier major. The return to simplicity was almost cathartic for you, as many of your higher-level anxieties just washed away. You slowly realized that you almost enjoyed being slightly dumber than everyone else. There was less pressure and expectation heaped upon you. You were free to just be yourself and live, which was really all you wanted. Besides, you didn't want to be smarter than the boys you knew you'd soon be interested in again, although maybe this was just an outgrowth of your developing submissiveness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, your glasses disappeared and you watched as the world came into much clearer view. You no longer had to stare through the bottom of coke bottles just to see. Your physical changes then began in earnest. You felt your hair, which was previously limp and lifeless, gain an immense amount of volume. It was clear that you spent a great deal of time and money giving yourself hair that was impossibly full and luscious. You could also feel that vain sense of pride swelling up inside you as you realized that none of your competition could hope to compare to your marvelous mane of hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, you felt your face realign and return to a more angular, and sensual form. You felt your cheekbones rise and become more prominent, as your eyes grew larger, and adopted a more appealing olive shape that demonstrated your Asian heritage without compromising the innocent, doe-like quality of your eyes. You could then feel your lips plump up and transform from thin, nearly non-existent lines around your mouth, into smooth, soft, and sensual pillows that clearly had only one purpose in life: to have a large throbbing cock thrust between them, and you knew that soon you would be drooling for some guy to fill that little mouth of yours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, you started to feel a tingling sensation in your chest. You knew that the real changes were coming, and your vanity made you want to watch first hand. You asked Ms. Souto if you could go to the bathroom, and she chuckled as she waved you to the bathroom attached to her office. You rushed in and peeled off the frumpy sweater and oxford you had been wearing, as well as the shapeless training bra underneath, and stared straight at the little nubs you currently had for tits. The tingling increased, and after a few moments, you began to see the changes. First, you watched as the areolas around your nipples changed from a darker, reddish-brown color, to a much lighter, pinkish hue. They then begin to expand and grow larger, from about the size of a nickel to somewhere around a silver dollar. You look silly in that moment, as your nipples are now larger than the tits they're situated on. Your nipples then thicken and elongate, going from being nearly nonexistent to being a bit larger than a pair of pencil erasers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn addition to the tingling, you begin to feel warmth flow over and through your chest. What had previously been just tiny bee stings began to become more substantial, as they began to form two small, twin torpedoes which pointed out from your chest. That torpedo shape, however, was short-lived, as your boobs (and they finally could be called that) began to fluff out in all directions, filling in on the sides, as they became rounder as they approached a nice handful in size. At that point, you figured you were around a B cup, maybe a small C, but you were far from finished. As your tits continued to swell, they maintained their high, somewhat pointed appearance, as they jutted out from your chest. Quickly though, as you were fast approaching a D cup, the weight became too much, and they shifted from pointing out to hanging heavily in a teardrop shape. There was no sag, and you knew your new knockers would make jaws drop when you peel off your top and let them bounce into view. You knew that you were probably bigger than most of the girls in your sorority, but you were just busty, not exactly memorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you crested the upper limits of a D cup and entered the DD range, you started to notice how your tits were beginning to dominate your appearance. You felt the muscles in your back adjust and strengthen, as they were now expected to carry a much heavier load. You could feel the soft flesh making contact with the sides of your arms, and you realized you wouldn't be able to hide these even if you wanted to. You tentatively reached up and touched your boobs and were shocked at how unbelievably soft they were. They maintained their shape perfectly, buy yielded immediately to the touch. You were noticing less and less space between your boobs and your belly button, as the space between your neck and navel was almost entirely tits at this point. By now, you were almost past an F cup. You briefly turned to the side, and smiled as you noticed that you had developed a truly breathtaking set of jugs. As you turned back, the tingling and warmth finally subsided as you settled at a full G cup. You knew without a doubt that you had the biggest tits of anyone in your sorority, and that you would likely never have a man speaking to your face again. This was just fine by you, as you reveled in your reacquired power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, you felt your hips broaden slightly to give you a slight hourglass physique, albeit a severely top-heavy one. Your butt fleshed out a bit, but it was little more than a round half-moon, not quite a bubble, and certainly not a \"phat\" ass. If you had anything to say about it, no one would ever spend more than a moment staring at your ass. You truly had become the \"tits on a stick\" that you envisioned, and it was more than you could have imagined. The final physical changes affected you more generally. You felt your skin become absurdly smooth and soft, as every hair below your eyebrows quickly disappeared. You knew that you now religiously shaved and moisturized to give yourself this baby soft feel. Next, your skin changed from the pasty alabaster it had been before into the sunkissed glow of a girl who spent a decent amount of time in the tanning bed or lying out. Heavy makeup spread across your face, and your nails lengthened from tightly trimmed and unstyled into inch long, pointed black talons. You kept your nails perfect because you knew how much you loved seeing those fingers wrapped around a thick dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour previously boring slacks began to loosen and change into a set of camouflage sweat pants. You inherently knew that your go to outfit for bumming around campus involved a pair of loose sweats, which only emphasized how tiny your waist was, which in turn, emphasized the immense size of your tits. You also felt your previously plain white cotton panties shrink and transform from fully covering you to nothing more than a couple pieces of string and some wispy lace in the front. Without looking, you knew that the new thong was a bright teal. You knew that your lingerie now tended towards the exotic, and you also reveled in the looks you got from men and women when your slutty underthings showed through your clothes or peeked over your waistline. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://bit.ly/2pCeBmG\" target=\"_blank\">http://bit.ly/2pCeBmG</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at your discarded training bra on the floor which quickly began to expand and grow from a thin strip of cotton into a feat of engineering with three rows of hooks, thick heavy-duty straps, and large capacious cups which were designed to contain your mammoth mammaries as best as they could. Your new bra changed to the same teal as your thong, and you couldn't help but giggle when you picked it up and read the 34G tag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://bit.ly/2oJITX6\" target=\"_blank\">http://bit.ly/2oJITX6</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour oxford shirt quickly morphed into a stretchy, gray tank top. You hoisted your boobs into your new bra, and pulled the tank top over your head, nearly stretching it to its limit. Even though it wasn't exactly low-cut, at least by you new standards, it still could not completely hide your new, deep cleavage. You looked into the mirror and grinned at what you say. You were certainly an eye-catcher, and you snapped your first selfie:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://bit.ly/2pCnAUz\" target=\"_blank\">http://bit.ly/2pCnAUz</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You strutted back out into Ms. Souto's office, with a big smile plastered on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what you see?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding? This is me. I'm home! I can't stop looking in the mirror!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's to be expected,\" Ms. Souto said, reminding you of your new entrenched vanity. \"Well, hopefully you've finally found a home in this new persona, and can begin fulfilling your role on campus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wink you replied, \"Trust me, I'm ready to be a team player.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Ms. Souto bid you farewell and you began the familiar trek back to Tau Gamma. As you sashayed across the quad you were struck by the heavy, pendulous swinging of your giant tits. While many girls would have complained about the hassle, you not so secretly loved it, and did everything to thrust your chest out to better show off your new prized possessions. While walking, you couldn't help but notice the stares you were receiving, men with eyes glued to your chest and women shooting daggers through you. You winked at the boys, smirked at the girls, and carried on your merry way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walked into the Tau Gamma house, you felt your phone buzzing in your purse. You read the name on the phone and saw that it was Amber, who you knew to be a good friend of yours and sister at Tau Gamma. Amber was from an old money family, so she was always very posh looking. She was very focused on becoming a doctor, her family pushed her very hard, but she still loved to cut loose, and you were her outlet. Amber was a serial monogamist, and she had extremely high standards for any prospective men in her life. This ultimately left her feeling rather alone, as she wasn't free to just cut loose with no inhibitions. That's where you come in. Amber was your worst enabler. While Amber was always dressed beautifully, but conservatively, she constantly pushed you to be more daring, more slutty, and more wild. You could sense that Amber lived vicariously through you, as she constantly wanted all the details of whatever you had done the night before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, as expected, she was texting you to see if you had any plans for that evening. You knew that whenever you clubbed with Amber she picked up the tab, so naturally, your first plans usually involved her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing specific,\" you texted. \"I just figure we might hit Main Street and have fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect!\" she shot back. \"Meet up at the house at 9?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you had plans, but seeing as it was nearly 6, you subliminally knew that it was time to start getting ready. If the old Amy needed to be ready to go at 9, she would get ready around 8:30 at the earliest, but the new Aimee knew she needed at least 2-3 hours to make herself perfect. You bounded up to your room eager for a fun evening in this new life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walked into your room, you noticed that everything seemed fairly normal, unlike your previous experiences. As Amy, the bookworm, your room looked like a library, with a very sterile and bland vibe. As the dumber, chubbier Aimee, your room was an unmitigated disaster, with condoms and thongs strewn everywhere. This new version of Aimee at least maintained a modicum of order in her room, however, each new drawer opened revealed more and more stringy, skimpy, gauzy slutwear. For you, this was the \"Goldilocks\" room, it was juuuust right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving into the bathroom, you quickly disrobed and turned on the shower, getting everything nice and steamy. As you stood naked before the mirror, you again noticed the lewd and outlandish proportions of your new body. Given that you were just over five feet tall, you couldn't help but notice that your tits dominated the entirety of your visage, hanging heavily from just below your armpits nearly to your navel. They didn't sag, but the sheer weight and size of them caused a very heavy teardrop to form. They also pushed outwards to both sides, and as you turned around, you could see the round, pinkish softness of your burgeoning boobs. As you looked at yourself over your shoulder, you noticed a rather unimpressive ass, however, again, this was a small price to pay for the mountainous mounds you were hoisting about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the shower was sufficiently steamy, you stepped in and began to wash. As your soapy, wet hands explored your warm, slick body, you found yourself becoming increasingly excited and moist between your thighs. You noticed the rubber nub which had been affixed to the wall of your shower and upon which you hung your loofah. To anyone else, this would have appeared a perfectly normal shower accessory, albeit placed a bit lower than expected, however, that wasn't surprising given your diminutive stature. You knew the truth though. This little nub was how you got frequent release whenever you got worked up in the shower, which was often. You strained up on your tip-toes to bring your pussy over the nub and slowly you lowered down on it, gasping as it entered you. Through the steam, you wiped the glass in the shower and looked at yourself in the fog-resistant mirror you had installed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you saw caused your thick, eraser sized nipples to stand at full attention. The petite, well-endowed Asian girl staring back slack-jawed as she impaled herself upon the wall mounted toy was enough to turn anyone on. The fact that you were staring at yourself made this reality all the more consuming. You couldn't believe that you were so vain as to masturbate to yourself, but here you were, mouth agape, moaning, and rubbing your soapy tits in your much too small hands. You came at least twice before you rinsed yourself off and stepped out of the shower, quickly wrapping yourself in a towel. It was already after 8. You had taken an hour to watch you fuck yourself silly in the shower, however, you knew this was common place for the new Aimee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you dried off, you noticed a text from Amber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So tonight, I was thinking of doing something a bit more \"high-brow.\" A friend of mine is in town visiting a mutual friend from high school. He wants to take me out for dinner, but he needs a second girl for his friend. You down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged, not caring, as you knew that a fancy dinner would just be the precursor to a night of even more fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm game,\" you replied. \"What should I wear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found this question slightly odd, but it rolled off so quickly that you had sent it before you even thought of it. As you pondered further, memories began flooding back. You knew that Amber got a kick out of \"helping\" you with your outfits, although you secretly knew she just loved getting you to wear things she wouldn't dare to. You weren't really attracted to Amber, per se, but there was definitely a tension between you, and it was in moments like this that it presented itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" she replied coyly. \"I'm sure you've got a little black dress or something. Why don't you do that, but make sure it's eye-catching. I want you to look the best for these guys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't really have a 'classy' black dress. They're all a bit 'risque,'\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\";) Don't worry, that will be perfect. I want to make sure there is a little allure, if you know what I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled to yourself, as the perfect dress came to mind. You went over to your dresser to grab something to wear as you got ready. Instinctively, you grabbed two sports bras, one with well-define cups to cradle your girls, and another that just stretched tightly to make sure everything didn't wobble around too much while you were applying your makeup. The effect was mesmerizing. The two bras only seemed to emphasize how massive your melons were. You smiled to yourself and sat down to begin with your makeup. As you were painting on your face, Amber buzzed you again, asking if you were going to use the same lip plumper that you used the week before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your lips were so kissable, I think it would be perfect,\" she prodded. You quickly relented and agreed. You loved the way it looks too. Once you had finished applying your makeup, you felt compelled to snap a quick selfie and send it to Amber. You knew it was not uncommon for you to share your process with her. You applied the lip plumper and waited until you felt the familiar burning sensation. You made a seductive pout, ensured you fit your jugs in the shot, and snapped a pic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://bit.ly/2pLvUSd\" target=\"_blank\">http://bit.ly/2pLvUSd</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does the makeup look?\" you asked beneath the picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" Amber replied, \"but HOLY FUCK I couldn't look at your makeup for more than ten seconds with those fucking tits!! How do you even walk with those things?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stawp,\" you replied, faux angrily. \"I was born this way! LOL\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't act like you don't love it\" Amber retorted, to which you only replied with an emoticon: ;)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned the tables on Amber, asking her what she would be wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing much,\" Amber replied. \"Just a new dress I picked up at Saks last weekend. It's boring. For some garden party in a couple weeks, but I need to try it out beforehand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see,\" you pushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber quickly shot you back a pic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://bit.ly/2onMh6j\" target=\"_blank\">http://bit.ly/2onMh6j</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed Amber's elegant beauty, and understated appearance, with her tall, slim, toned physique being properly sheathed in a figure-hugging, but very conservative dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do you react?</span></div></div>",

Her, the respectable, erudite, future doctor, and you, the big-titted floozy.

You inform Amber, who simply tells you to go without.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go without?!\" you reply. \"But I'm a fucking G cup! How?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll figure it out babes. At least try it on and let me see!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou figure that just trying the dress on can't hurt anything. You pull it on with neither a bra nor panties underneath.

Your tits are spilling out everywhere, even to the outside of the top of the dress. They hang lewdly in the cutout which is supposed to show your pressed together, firm cleavage. With each step, they bounce and jiggle obscenely, and you find yourself constantly having to adjust the dress to keep from exposing a nipple. You stand to the side, and see that your boobs are pushing up into your arm pits.

Don't come crying to me when we have a parade of guys following us around all night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not me, babes, following you, and those bean bags you call tits! LOL\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEYYY! Bean bags are lumpy! These tits are firm, perky, and amazing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cocky much?\" Amber asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realized that, yes, you were becoming more cocky about your tits. You felt your nipples stiffen as you thought of how sexy you had become. Before you lost focus and slipped into another horny haze, you went back to your room to finalize your outfit and makeup. You still needed a pair of panties and heels. You opened your panty drawer and smiled at the lace, neon, and rhinestones staring back at you. Without much thought, you grabbed a wispy sheer black lace thong, You pulled it up under your dress and felt the soft fabric nestle against your damp pussy. You so desperately wanted another O, but you knew you didn't have time, and likely wouldn't do anything else but jill yourself off all night if you gave in now. You couldn't believe how hot your motor ran these days, and how easily turned on you had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to avoid thinking further about your growing arousal, you turned quickly to your footwear. Given that Amber seemed intent on having you parade around like a slut, you might as well give her what she wants, so you select a pair of five inch glossy black pumps with shimmering rhinestones lining the entirety of the heel. You slide your dainty feet into the heels and stand yourself up, expecting the same awkward clumsiness which befell you as Amy the bookworm, however, you were anything if not graceful in your sky-high heels. Everything felt so natural, and you could not help but notice the way your hips naturally rolled as you walked back and forth across your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a couple minutes after 9, so you decided to head downstairs to wait for Amber. As you walked out of your room, you nearly bumped into Mary Leonard, the sorority president. You remembered how she tormented you as the dumber, chubbier Aimee, and you immediately recoiled out of habit. Mary looked you up and down and just shook her head before she walked off. You swore you could have heard her mumbling something about \"slut\" under her breath. Surprisingly, being analyzed and judged in this manner triggered an aroused response from you, and you could feel your panties moistening. You weren't exactly sure why you reacted that way, but that wasn't an issue to address right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou strolled down stairs, hips swaying, tits jiggling, and you loving every minute. You walked into the sorority kitchen and went to grab a bottle of water while you waited. However, when you opened the fridge, you couldn't help but notice the half full bottle of Grey Goose staring back at you. While you initially just wanted water, now you couldn't help but think about how you needed a shot. No better way to get the night going, am I right?? You looked around, saw no one, and grabbed the bottle to take a big pull right out of the top. After that first swig, you could feel the blood rush to your face, leaving you flush, rosy, and cuter than ever. As if on cue, Amber came in through the kitchen's back door, saw you putting away the bottle, and smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Couldn't wait, huh?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, no. Just ready to get going,\" you responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, let's do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you hopped in Amber's car and headed off to dinner. As you drove you asked Amber what these guys were like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Greg is my friend from back home. He's totally cute. To be honest, I've always had a little crush on him, but I could never do anything...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" you interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my dad doesn't approve of his family. He says they're 'nouveau riche' or something. He would never approve of us. We went to the same school, but Greg's family never really seemed to fit in. Besides, Greg is something of a brute. He's all brawn and no polish. I'd fantasize about a hot night with him, maybe, but I couldn't ever see myself being with someone like that long-term.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the other guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Sam? He's fine,\" Amber started with much less enthusiasm. \"He's also from my town. He went to a different school, but my dad knows his dad, so we've hung out some before. He's fine, and he and Greg have been friends going way back, but he is just rather boring. All he wants to do is talk about his internship in New York, and how successful he's going to be, blah, blah, blah. I know I'm supposed to end up with someone like Sam, I just can't bring myself to do it yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Amber talked, you felt the vodka begin to take its effect. You'd only had one shot, albeit a big one, but you could already feel a bit light headed. When you stepped out of Amber's car, you had to catch yourself on the hood as you lost your balance in your heels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you drunk?\" Amber asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who me? Fuck no,\" you retorted. \"Can't a girl struggle with these stilts without getting called out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, you're right babes. Let's go. Dinner is waiting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that the two of you headed across the street and into the restaurant. You could see the pair of guys sitting at a table, and given Amber's explanation, you knew it was Greg and Sam. There was one guy in a posh blazer, with accompanying pocket square, who seemed to be talking nonstop. Next to him was a much larger, bulkier man who had crammed himself into a crisp button-down. The larger man looked very uncomfortable in his shirt, and you wondered how he even fit into it. His shoulders were unbelievably broad, and he would have looked ridiculous, except that his arms and chest were equally bulging to match. Upon seeing Amber, the man you presumed to be Greg jumped out of his seat and gave her a hug like old friends. He then turned to you, eyed you up and down, with his gaze lingering on your buoyant, bouncing boobs, and asked, \"And who is your friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this is Aimee. She's a sister, and my bestie!\" Amber beamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour introduction to Sam was far less enthusiastic, and you quickly found yourself seated and listening to Sam discuss finance or something. Even as Amy the bookworm, this would have bored you to death, however, nothing was stopping Sam. Why Greg was so close to him you had no idea. Luckily, the waitress came by quickly to take your drink orders. Amber ordered a glass of wine, but suggested that you get a vodka soda. Instinctively, you knew that the vodka soda was your drink of choice, so you elected not to fight the suggestion, and ordered a double.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you placed your order, you noticed Greg's eyebrow raise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A double at dinner?\" he said chuckling. \"A girl your size should be careful, you might not make dessert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber chuckled quickly, and responded \"Don't worry, she drinks like a fish. She can hang.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were glad to hear Amber stick up for you, but part of you worried that she might be writing checks that your ass may prove unable to cash. Despite these concerns, you got through dinner with no problem, slurping down a couple doubles, but generally being no worse for wear. As the boys pondered dessert you and Amber excused yourselves to the powder room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't he great?\" Amber asked, obviously about Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's definitely something,\" you replied, still amazed at the bulk of the man. \"Why don't you just date him? It's not like you're getting married or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber chuckled, responding, \"It's not just that. Like I said, Greg is sweet, caring, and kind. Plus he's funny and obviously sexy, but he's a bit of a meathead. I just feel like I would get bored so quickly. What am I supposed to do? Come home from med school and talk to him about advanced biology? We're just not meant to be, as much as he may excite me. Buuuut,\" Amber continued, dragging it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what?\" you responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But he might be perfect for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you trying to say,\" you asked defensively. \"Are you saying I'm stupid?!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Of course not, babes! I would never! I'm not saying that at all. But let's be honest, you've never wanted to go to med school. You're no dummy, but it's not like you're obsessed with school by any stretch of the imagination. Plus, we both know your history. You've been around the block before, and it's not like Greg is all that different from some of your previous suitors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But do you even think he's interested in me?\" you asked, still uncertain. \"He's really into you, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, in a way, yes. He still follows me around like a love sick puppy. And it breaks my heart because I can't reciprocate as more than a friend. And puhhlease. Is he interested in you? Do you mean is he interested in the tiny Asian chick with tits as big as her head, and come fuck me eyes? Yeah, I'd say he's interested. His eyes have been on every bounce and jiggle you've made tonight, don't doubt it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look yourself over again, and start to feel the warmth spreading all over, as your arousal mixed with the vodka have yielded a dangerous cocktail of vanity and desire. You're the object of mens' desire. Back when you were Amy, all you ever wanted was to be wanted, and here you were. You began to revel in the feeling, the feeling of your giant tits wobbling around unrestrained in your dress, the feeling of your wet pussy leaking slowly down your thigh, the feeling of heat based on the knowledge that eyes were on you, and heat based upon what you presumed those eyes thought when they saw you: \"tits on a stick,\" \"little Asian slut,\" \"stupid sorostitute.\" You had chosen this life, and now you were ready to live it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber sensed your shifting desires, and she struck as the opportunity presented itself. She leaned in and whispered in your ear, \"put that body of yours to good use. I'm turned on for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you were convinced. You were ready to let go of any remaining inhibition and see where this night took you. As if she knew exactly what to do, Amber pulled a vodka shooter from her purse, pressed it into your palm, and said \"a little more liquid courage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou threw back the shot as if it was water, and this marked the beginning of the end. From there, the night picked up steam but also became more of a blur. You remember Amber suggesting that you all go to the Downstairs, a dive bar off of Main Street. You remember more shots, and pulsating dance beats. You remember Amber whispering something in Greg's ear and his eyebrow raising. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you remember him changing, and focusing heavily on you. He buys you more shots, and you can't find the ability or desire to say no. Greg and you dance, seemingly for hours (even if it's only a couple songs), and you remember him pressing up against you as you grind your ass back into his hips. You felt his bulge pushing against your soft ass, and gasped as you felt how massive he was. Almost on instinct, you began drooling, and you knew that you had to have that cock in your eager little mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you and Greg pressed your sweaty bodies together, you watched Amber and Sam sitting, chatting, and watching you. As you swayed and jiggled over towards them you could hear bits of their conversation....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...believe that those things are real. They have to be fake...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...some girls get brains, and some get tits. We know what she got...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...perfect for each other...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the words seared into your memory, at the time, you didn't think anything of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OhhhhssshhmiGAWD Amber, this is SOOOOO fucking FUN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know babes,\" Amber yelled back into your ear over the thundering techno. \"Another shot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still couldn't say no, and acquiesced to Amber's offer, even though she only bought one shot. You threw it back and headed back out to the dance floor, where things again began to get hazy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd everything hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were laying in a bed, and it wasn't yours. But it wasn't totally foreign. Your head felt like it had been hit by a bus, and your jaw and pussy ached sharply. You were completely naked, and you felt what you hoped was just sweat dried all over you. As you tried to get your bearings, Amber came ambling in with two mugs of coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're up,\" she started. \"I'm so excited to hear all the juicy details!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What details?\" you asked groggily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About Greg, duh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't remember much of anything after you bought me that last shot at Downstairs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're kidding?! Well, let me fill in some gaps for you and we'll see if that jogs your memory.\" Amber said excitedly. \"So, you danced for a while after that shot, and honestly, you were really feeling it. Every eye in that place was on you and Greg. It was amazing. I started to get the impression that you were running out of steam on the dancefloor, and Greg suggested we head back to his hotel for a nightcap. Sam was already gone by then, so the three of us grabbed an Uber and headed to the hotel. That's when the fun started,\" Amber stated with a devilish grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What fun?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your canoodling with Greg, obviously. I sat up front with the Uber driver, and you two took the back. It started with kissing, then making out, and then more...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you said, suddenly nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you kept kissing him, just further south. I thought the driver's eyes were going to pop out of his head when you pulled Greg's cock out, and mine almost did as well when I saw how HUUUUGE he was. And I couldn't believe that you fit that little mouth of yours over the whole damn thing. You bobbed up and down with such fervor that it was like he had found the cure for cancer in his balls. But before he could finish, we got to the hotel, and he had to zip up. That elevator ride was so tense. I could see his bulge, and it looked like it was about to split his jeans. You were squirming so hard and mashing your tits into him. We finally got to the suite, and I poured myself a glass of wine and sat in the living room while you two ran off to the bedroom. You two were in there for nearly an hour, and it wasn't quiet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did we have sex,\" you asked demurely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you have sex? Are you kidding me? You two fucked like rabbits. I could hear everything through the walls. It sounded amazing. I was actually hoping that you'd spill all the details.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't remember anything,\" you said honestly. \"I'm so embarrassed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Amber asked. \"You were so sexy. Everyone wanted you, and you got laid by probably one of the hottest guys I've ever seen. What's to be embarrassed about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, it's just kind of embarrassing to fuck a guy a couple hours after you met him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Puhhhlease,\" Amber replied. \"Don't suddenly go prudish on me. It's not like this was your first anonymous hookup. You're just worked up because you don't remember it. No need to worry babes, everyone expects that a girl like you is going to be a bit more adventurous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A girl like me? What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The house slut, duh!? You've earned that rep, babes, and you enjoyed every minute of it. What's got you feeling so off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure. Amber was right. This is what you chose to be. You wanted all of this: the tits, the rep, the freedom, why were you suddenly so uneasy? You got up, threw on some clean clothes and plopped back down in Amber's bed. You thought about everything, and you resolved to stop worrying. It was a great fucking night, and you had more fun in one night than you had in all your time as Amy the bookworm. You were done fretting over this. You had decided to become Aimee, and you were determined to enjoy your choice. As if to jolt you from your reverie, your phone buzzed. It was Greg!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How you holding up this morning? When can I see you again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile spread across your face as you realized that you had him wrapped around your finger. You quickly snapped a selfie and shot it back to him, saying \"How about right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://bit.ly/2oQW4Wy\" target=\"_blank\">http://bit.ly/2oQW4Wy</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuckkkkk.\" Greg responded. \"You are fucking unreal. But I was thinking more about seeing you in real life. I'm in town one more night if you're free for dinner again, just the two of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe it, Greg was asking you out on a date! The look on your face told the whole story, and Amber chimed in, \"Wait, is that fucking Greg?! He's texting you already?! He's SOOOO totally hooked. What does he want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He wants to take me to dinner tonight. You think I should go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should you go? Are you kidding? Of course you should, and I am going to make sure everything is perfect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Babes, you're living my fantasy. I want to make sure everything is as it should be. We're going to get you a whole new outfit, and I am going to make you an even more stunning version of your sexy self!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You serious?\" you asked, uncertainly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dead serious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smile returned to your face, and you started anticipating the night ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You flopped down in your bed after a long, whirlwind day with Amber at the mall. She had insisted on taking you to help you put together an outfit for that night, and she put the whole thing on her credit card. You were beginning to get the impression that last night with Greg was no coincidence, and that this night was seeming like more of the same. You found it odd that Amber cared so much about how you were dressed tonight, and that she had such a concrete plan of how the night was supposed to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day began at the mall, with Amber rushing you from store to store, trying on an endless stream of clothes. The only constant in all the outfits you tried on was that they were all slutty, and that they all were designed to draw all surrounding eyes directly to your pendulous tits. Speaking of your tits, it wasn't as if you didn't already have all nearby male eyes upon you as you strutted and paraded through the mall. You found, that it was difficult not to thrust your tits out as you walked all over the mall. Not that you were bothered by this, mind you. You felt a constant surge of pride every time you caught a guy sneaking a peek at you. You felt your boobs bounce, jiggle, and slosh around as you meandered from store to store. You noticed Amber staring as well, with a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck are you looking at?\" you asked playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just you. I'm wondering how such a tiny girl can stand with such outrageous hooters. I just keep waiting for you to tip over with a strong enough breeze.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou punch Amber's arm. \"Stawwp, you're just jealous! I can't help how huge my fucking jugs are,\" you whine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber chuckles in response, \"believe me, babes. I could never have tits like yours. I love the visual, but they're a bit too vulgar for me. But they're perfect for a girl like you,\" she quickly corrected herself. \"Trust me. When we walk around together, I know that all the eyes are on you, and I wouldn't have it any other way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a conflicted sense of embarrassment and pride at Amber's comments. You wonder what she means every time she keeps saying \"a girl like you,\" but you do swell with pride knowing that you are constantly the center of attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day, however, quickly begins to blur for you. Amber has you running roughshod through the stores lining the mall's many corridors. She says that she wants to build your outfit from the ground up, so first you start in a lingerie shop. Amber initially took you to Victoria's Secret, but the sales associate took your measurements and told you that their store didn't carry bras big enough for your G cup knockers. You felt that sense of embarrassment mixed with pride as you walked back out into the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently the secret is that Victoria doesn't make bras big enough for little Asian sluts with watermelons for tits, huh babes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush at her comments, but continue to thrust your tits out even further, causing them to ripple and jiggle even more violently with every step. You end up at a boutique lingerie shop which caters to DD and up customers exclusively. Amber strides over to a woman who was arranging a display and asks for some assistance. The woman looks Amber over and says politely, \"I'm not sure if we would have anything in your size dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber chuckles, saying \"it's not for me. It's for her,\" as she gestures towards you. The woman eyes you up, and with a knowing nod says, \"I see. Let's get you measured.\" She takes you to the dressing room, pulls out a measuring tape, and goes about figuring out just how stacked you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, I'd say you're between a 34G and 34H, but honestly, I think the 34G will fit better. Plus, I think the visual fullness will better suit you it seems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For certain,\" Amber chimes in. \"I don't think it would be a problem if she were spilling out just a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she should be properly contained,\" the woman responded. \"But yes, she certainly won't have any gaps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better not have another growth spurt babes,\" Amber mocked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt so objectified listening to the two women discuss your burgeoning endowments, which easily dwarfed both of theirs combined. Somehow, despite the shame, you also felt yourself becoming oddly aroused. Having Amber speak for you, and having something so private being discussed so clinically by others sent a jolt down your spine and between your thighs. You pressed them together as you felt a subtle slickness between your legs. The rest of the day proceeded in much the same way. Amber spoke for you, picked out what you tried on, and made your final selections for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber explained that Greg preferred girly girls who exuded femininity, which is why Amber decided that the theme of your outfit that night was going to be pink and rhinestones. Amber picked a pastel pink bra, and g-string to match. The g-string was comprised of numerous large and small rhinestones instead of fabric in some areas. The stones were bright, gaudy, and were certain to catch an eye as they would likely leave an outline in anything she wore over them. You raised this concern, to which Amber replied, \"well, we certainly aren't trying to hide the fact that you got yourself all dolled up now, are we? Is a little slut like you really too bashful to show her g-string?\" You shook your head demurely, which prompted yet another chuckle from Amber. \"That's what I thought,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://bit.ly/2pctNb4\" target=\"_blank\">http://bit.ly/2pctNb4</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dress was a similar color, and clung close to your body without being too stretchy. \"We still have to maintain some semblance of innocence, don't we?\" Amber inquired. \"It will make it all the more exciting when he realizes how much of a little slut you are.\" With each time Amber called you a slut, you felt your confidence in the term grow. As you obviously knew all too well, you were the house slut. Everyone else clearly thought of you that way, so why shouldn't you? As you made the slur your own, you became increasingly cocky, and your vanity began to show. Your antics in the dressing room began to morph from just trying clothes on to sexually modelling them. You looked over every angle painstakingly. You pressed your giant melons together. You pouted and puckered your lips at the mirror. In short, you acted like a little tart and Amber clearly loved it as much, if not more, than you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dress itself, while not exceedingly clingy, was still very risque. The front of the dress had a deep-v cut into it which extended nearly past your navel. This opening was loosely covered by some straps that ran back and forth across the dress like shoelaces. These laces were stretched nearly to their limit over your G cups, and anyone who cared to look could see the sides and bottoms of your bountiful bosom through the gaps in the laces. When you tried the dress on, goosebumps stood up on your skin, as a chill air rushed over your boobs. You also felt the hairs standing up on the back of your neck as you saw yourself. You were a true stunner. You were the woman that wives would slap their husbands for allowing their eyes to linger too long on. It thrilled you like nothing else, and you were so happy when Amber picked out that dress for you. Amber added a little white fur coat and a showy rhinestone choker to complete the look, and the two of you happily headed back to Tau Gamma. You quickly started the process of getting yourself ready, as Amber gave you advice about Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's a man's man. He wants a girl who is going to be a girl. Don't talk over him, and don't talk about yourself too much. Giggle at his jokes, and don't be shocked if he puts a hand on your thigh. He's a gentleman, but he's going to want you, truuuuust me. He's always had a thing for big-titted girls. He dated the biggest tits in high school, and she had nothing on you, so I promise, he's going to choke on his tongue when he sees you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou beam as Amber heaps praise on your exaggerated silhouette. She encourages you to go heavy on the makeup, and really create a doll-like appearance with your eyes. You happily oblige, caking on mascara until your eyes are smoky and doe-like. You spend most of the time getting ready with Amber on the other side of the door. She said she wanted you to have a big reveal, and didn't want to see you until you were done. After multiple hours you finally said you were ready, and Amber counted down for you to open the door. When she reached zero, you flung the door open and stood there coquettishly, twirling a strand of your raven hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://bit.ly/2q0fusY\" target=\"_blank\">http://bit.ly/2q0fusY</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WOWWWW. Just fucking wow.\" Amber exclaimed with a devilish grin. \"My God, you're a fucking walking wet dream. Those eyes, the tits, the lips that are screaming for a cock between them, you've fucking got it all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked in the mirror and realized that she was right. You had never felt so confident or so sexy in your entire life. You were so glad you made the switch from Amy the bookworm. As you basked in the sight of yourself, your phone buzzed letting you know that Greg was out front to collect you. You slowly tottered down the stairs on your sky-high heels and came around the corner just in time to see Greg's jaw literally hit the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" he said, much quieter than Amber. \"You look so hot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just batted your eyelashes and breathlessly whispered, \"Thanks, you're not too bad yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the two of you headed off on what was sure to be an interesting date. How did the evening go?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your evening with Greg went off without a hitch. At dinner, the two of you made small talk, and while Greg's conversation skills weren't exactly rapturous, you found yourself entranced by him, and his sculpted physique fitted tightly within his shirt, and his strong, square jaw which added to a powerful and foreboding visage. Despite doing his best to maintain eye contact, you frequently caught Greg lasciviously staring at your tits. You inwardly smiled as you playfully chided him, saying \"hey, I'm up here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Greg replied. \"I guess it's just harder to focus around you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDinner was followed by a decadent dessert and drinks. After your second or third drink, you began to feel the familiar head rush which you knew portended a future rush of arousal downstairs. Seeing that you were sufficiently flushed, Greg asked if you'd like to help him finish a bottle of vodka he had up in his room. You quickly agree, and find yourself being tugged along by Greg's powerful arm as you head quickly for the hotel elevator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpstairs, Greg pours a pair of particularly strong drinks, and you feel your nipples stiffen in anticipation of the frolic you knew was coming. You sit down on the couch next to him, and after some more chit chat and a couple sips, you feel his hand sliding up your thigh. You look at Greg's lap, and notice his growing bulge pushing out and tenting is pants. It's just as big as you imagined in, despite not remembering much of last night. You felt yourself start salivating inadvertently as you slid your manicured hand over his throbbing cock. Greg began aggressively kissing your neck as he firmly kneading your mountainous mounds. You could feel yourself melting into him as everything became hazy with arousal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slid off the couch and onto your knees as you began fumbling with Greg's zipper. After a few frantic moments, his impressive cock springs into view and you gasp at the immense size of Greg's manhood. You quickly pop the head into your eager, waiting mouth, and begin sucking and bobbing your head. Greg's hand slides through your hair as he guides you up and down on his ever stiffening rod. For a few minutes you bob eagerly, as you hear Greg's breathing grow rapid and shallow. As you begin to feel Greg pulse and tense up, you start preparing yourself for the eruption you're anticipating. However, just before you're sure Greg is going to burst, he pulls your head off of his dick and tells you to \"Stand up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven the authoritativeness of his voice, you instantly snap to attention and get to your feet. \"Strip,\" Greg commands, and you immediately begin reaching for the zipper of your dress. You toss aside the jacket and quickly step out of the dress, standing in just your bra and g-string.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop,\" Greg says and you freeze. \"I want to get a better look at you.\" You stand awkwardly still as you feel Greg's eyes drinking you in. You wobble drunkenly a little bit on your heels as Greg walks up to you. Greg reaches around you and takes a generous grab of your ass, as he leans in to whisper, \"I know what a fucking slut you are. You don't think I know your reputation? I know guys who have fucked you that you probably don't even remember. I've always known that I would make you my bitch one day.\" You felt chills run up and down your spine. Hearing Greg speak this way to you was equal parts sexy and terrifying. You had no clue what he would do to you. If he wanted to, he could do literally anything he wanted. You were shaking with arousal as Greg stepped back and looked directly into your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like being such a fucking slut?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could do nothing but look down, and to your surprise, you found yourself softly nodding your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I can't fucking hear you,\" Greg roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" you squeaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like what?\" Greg wasn't going to let you brush this off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like being a slut,\" you found yourself saying demurely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You certainly look like you do, what with those absurd tits, and those skanky little panties. I can only imagine how many different cocks you've had inside of you.\" You continue looking down as Greg keeps going, \"But that's all about to change. You're done being everyone else's slut. You're done filling your holes with guys all over this campus. That's because you're my slut now. Do you like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel yourself nodding your head even more vigorously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl,\" Greg said, and you nearly came right then and there. You couldn't believe how the night had turned, and you had no idea where it was going. You were still just standing, soaking through your g-string as you were practically gushing with arousal. You could feel small beads of sweat forming on your skin, and tricking down into your cleavage. Your body was literally aching with need. Greg seemingly understood this, and took you by the hand towards the bedroom. This time, however, the lights in the bedroom were on, and while you were drunk, you weren't blacked out. You saw a relatively simple hotel bedroom, with a king sized bed, a small desk, a dresser, and a closet with mirrored doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg looked at you like a lion looks at a zebra, with malicious intent. \"This first night is going to be a long one, even for a slut like you. I don't ever want you to forget who is in charge here, and who you belong to.\" With large, powerful hands, Greg directs you towards the desk, where he has positioned the chair so that its back faces the mirrored closet doors. Greg leans you over the chair and tells you to spread your legs. You tentatively comply, still fearful of what was to come. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to see yourself for what you are. I want you to see what all those other guys saw. I want you to see a young, dumb, college slut because that's what you have been, and that's what you will always be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Greg effortlessly unclasped the massive back strap of your bra, which allowed your bouyant boobs to bounce freely. Previously contained tightly within the bra, your tits now hung heavily over the back of the chair, as they fell and jiggled into the familiar heavy teardrop shape that you knew drove guys wild. You looked at your face, which was still perfectly made up from earlier, albeit with a bit more fear and trepidation in your expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg also took a moment to admire your oversized knockers, however, he quickly moved on to more pressing matters. You felt Greg's leg spreading yours wider as he positioned himself behind you. However, instead of feeling his hand on your pussy, you felt his hand again pressed against your ass, spreading your plump cheeks. You realize what Greg intended to do, and your fear welled up, causing you to plead softly, begging him not to. You were terrified at the prospect of Greg's massive rod splitting your tight ass in two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg quickly cut you off, telling you to \"stop talking. This is what you were made for, no? You're the biggest slut at Tau Gamma, an maybe on this campus. If you can look me square in the eye and tell me you don't want me to fuck that tight little ass of yours, then I won't. But i have every expectation that you won't be able to. So what'll it be Aimee? Do you want this dick or not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back at yourself in the mirror, a bead of sweat falling delicately to the ground from your fully erect nipple. You see the subtle quiver of your huge boobs as you continue to shake softly with fear and anticipation. After a moment, Greg reiterates, \"Hmmmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you say?</span></div></div>",

Where?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitate for a minute, unsure of whether you truly do want the words which are on the tip of your tongue. You look back at yourself in the mirror, and see that needy, busty slut staring back at you. Here you were, splayed out over a chair, tits heaving, and skin percolating at the thought of a well-hung stud plowing you from behind. This life was a far cry from that of Amy, the bookworm. But you knew how much happier you were as Aimee, how much you craved the attention, how much you loved the eyes on you, and how much you enjoyed using your body for pleasure. One way or another, this was what you had wanted, and this was all part of being the house slut. You decided that the sooner you stopped resisting in any capacity, the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In my ass,\" you said, with more confidence this time. \"I want you to fuck my ass... daddy.\" You didn't know why you just called Greg \"daddy,\" however it felt so right. The word sent a shiver down your spine, as you became even more aroused by your newfound submissiveness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't the only one affected by your shift in tone. You felt Greg's cock stiffen to the point that it seemed liable to explode at any moment. He grabbed your hips with one hand, and pressed a finger into your asshole with another. You gasped as Greg's finger entered you. You knew, however, that this was merely the prelude to future fun. Greg worked that finger around to loosen you up for something much larger. One finger became two, which ultimately became three. This didn't hurt you nearly as much as it made you feel exposed. What came next, however, was a different story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the head of Greg's cock pressing up against your rear entrance. Greg had used his fingers to rub a small amount of lubricant around your asshole, with the intention of easing his own entry. As you felt the warm, thick head of his cock pushing against you, Greg leaned forward and whispered into your ear, \"I want you to beg for it slut. Beg.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words flowed out of you without second thought or filter. \"Ohhh, please fuck me daddy. Fuck this tight asshole daddy. Fill this slut up and fill her fat ass full of your fucking cum. I want to feel your jizz up inside me. Go ahead, daddy, make me your dumb little cumslut!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you babbled desperately, Greg eventually obliged, and pushed his cock up inside you slowly. You watched the slut in the reflection and saw her jaw go completely slack, as her words were replaced with a low, continuous groan. Pleasure and pain mixed together to form a sound that simultaneously seemed strained, but also needy. You watched the slut's eyes go wide as Greg pushed even deeper, plunging at least half of his length inside your plump little ass. Greg began to move in rhythm, with each successive thrust forcing his dick a little further into you until he was ultimately balls-deep inside your ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Greg's thrusts became more forceful, you watched the slut's tits begin quivering. What started as a jiggle, became a ripple, which then became a lewd, heavy wobble. Soon, your tits were slapping against the chair and against each other as they bounced wildly about. The slut you saw in the mirror became more vocal, shouting \"Do it daddy! Fuck that ass daddy! Fuck your stupid slut's stupid little ass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Greg happily obliged. Eventually his pace was frantic as he pistoned in and out of your tightest hole. The pain was unspeakable, as you could see tears running down the slut in the mirror's face, mascara running down her flush cheeks. As Greg pounded, he also took frequent, heavy swats at your rounded ass cheeks, causing the slut in the mirror to yelp in pain and shock. Greg also pinched and twisted your engorged nipples, causing even more pain to mix with your pleasure. After what seemed like an eternity, you felt Greg tense up and explode into your ass. You felt his hot load filling you, but only for a moment, as Greg quickly pulled out of you and forced you onto the bed where he told you to \"press those ridiculous tits together.\" You did as you were told, only to be rewarded with Greg's cum-soaked cock being shoved into your cavernous cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not done with you yet,\" Greg said as he pumped in between your pillowy jugs. It didn't take long, however, for Greg to have his second spasm, this time bursting in thick ropes all over your face. You could taste the hot seed as it seeped into your waiting mouth. Instinctively, you swallowed what you could, and reeled at Greg's musky taste. Spent, Greg rolled off of you and onto the bed. You...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning, you woke up to the sun beaming through the curtains of Greg's hotel room. Your head was throbbing, and hurt almost as much as your ass and pussy from the night before. Your jaw was sore, and you could feel the dried cum in your hair and all over your body. \"Such is the life of the house slut,\" you thought to yourself. As you slowly returned to consciousness and regained your bearings, the memories of last night began cropping back up in your head. You couldn't believe the way Greg used you and abused you, and the way he talked to you was scary, even if you could feel yourself moistening at the thought of it. What was most surprising was the way you gave in. You might not want to admit it, but Greg's domineering nature really turned you on, and the thought of you \"belonging\" to him was frighteningly sexy. You rolled over to see what Greg was doing, however, you noticed that he was nowhere to be found. You propped yourself up and prepared to get out of bed to go find him, when you saw him sitting at the desk watching you. He was seated in the same chair he had bent you over the night before and he was smirking at you with a face that made you equal parts afraid and wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get up just yet, now. We have a couple things to talk about.\" His smirk became even wider as he continued, \"that was quite a night last night, huh? I knew all along that I would make you my bitch, and it took almost nothing to convince you. I must say, I'm quite pleased. However, because you're mine now, I want you to know that there are going to be some changes. I meant what I said about you not filling your holes all over campus anymore. From now on, you fuck, suck, and cum only when I tell you that it is OK. Understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" you felt yourself saying meekly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Second, I have a very particular type of woman that really gets me going. Submissive is a must, but I also have a thing for a woman who is a real cold bitch. See, I've always wanted Amber. She was so perfectly distant and restrained. She has that old money air about her, and she is so vain and dismissive, I really couldn't get enough. The problem is, however, that Amber is more or less already promised off to some other old money kid, and she obviously isn't interested in passing up the kind of lifestyle that will afford her. I have money, but nothing like this guy she is promised to. So, in exchange for telling me no, she promised to help me find someone equally suitable to my tastes. That's where you come in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a chill run through you as you realized that you were nothing more than a pawn in a larger scheme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that I've found you, the real fun begins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat exactly does Greg have in mind? </span></div></div>",

And don't get me wrong, I love fucking girls like that, but I never make girls like that my own. No, instead, I prefer the girls who are more stand-offish and self-absorbed. They could care less whether they seem fun, or whether they smile. They know they're superior to the other girls bouncing and flitting around the bar, and they aren't ashamed of it. They don't spread their legs for anyone who is able to pour a couple sugary drinks into them. In fact, they aren't overly motivated by sex generally. Their lust, however, is insatiable for the perfect man that meets their sky-high standards and demands. This is exactly the way that Amber is, and I would love nothing more than to make her mine, however, as I've said, that just isn't in the cards. So, it appears, you will have to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat still as Greg's words washed over you. You were nervous as you were entirely unsure of what \"plans\" he had in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see that you're uneasy. Why is that my dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just don't know what you're planning,\" you squeaked back timidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg chuckled lightly, \"well, for starters, you're going to become a first-class bitch. The days of you being fun-loving, carefree, and easy are over. You'll change the way you speak, the way you act, the way you dress, and essentially everything about what currently makes you, you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what do you mean? You just want me to act like a bitch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no, not at all. It wouldn't be any fun if you were just acting. That's why I had to solicit the help of my friend Ms. Souto. Oh, you didn't think I knew about her, or about your tinkering?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt fear welling up inside of you as Greg continued explaining precisely how much he knew about you, and how all of this was far from an accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that the Aimee I fucked the brains out of last night was not always the top-heavy bimbo that sits before me now. I know that Aimee used to be Amy, the flat-as-a-board bookworm, who willingly traded her keen intellect and sharp mind for an oversized set of tits. And don't get me wrong, they're a great set of tits, but my knowledge about your deep-seated desires gives me a certain amount of leverage over you, and my relationship with Ms. Souto allows me to exercise a certain amount of control which really adds to the carrot and stick I'm presenting you with. Follow the underlying traits that I have coaxed her into implanting, and everything will be fine. Resist, and you will be punished. Do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively you knew immediately what you had done wrong. \"Yes, daddy,\" you corrected yourself. \"But what is going to change? And what traits are you talking about?\" you asked, curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you asked. I suppose the best place to start is in the traits I've had implanted. Remember when Ms. Souto told you that you were going to be incredibly vain as part of the bargain where you swapped that brain for those boobs?\" You blushed as you nodded. \"Well, we're going to do quite a bit to draw that out of you even further. The first way in which that is going to manifest is in the way you satisfy yourself sexually. Up until now, as the house slut, you can satisfy yourself cheaply and easily, by just bending over for any guy who can get hard enough to stick himself into you. Well, the new Aimee isn't going to be as easy. To replace all the random fucks you're going to miss out on, you're going to focus more on fucking yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what, just masturbate more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sort of. From now on, you're going to get off at least once everyday doing nothing but looking at yourself. You'll sit in front of a mirror and bring yourself off just from the sight of yourself. So you'll be literally fucking you. See what I did there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cringed as Greg chortled to himself. \"Isn't that a little fucked up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's one hundred percent fucked. Like I said, you're going to be a certified bitch. You'll find, with your newly implemented vanity, that this little task will become easier and more enjoyable the more you try it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Greg described your future, you thought back to the time in the shower when you had orgasmed from watching yourself impale your pussy in the mirror. At the time, you didn't anticipate that it would become your primary method of sexual release, but here you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I have no doubt that it won't be long before you love it. You're also going to present yourself much differently. Instead of being so overtly flirtatious and speaking in that silly, high-pitched voice, with that absurd lisp, you're going to speak directly and briefly. Less will certainly become more. People will begin to take you more seriously, because you won't allow yourself to get fall-down drunk anymore. And this is going to carry over to how you dress yourself. You're going to start wearing nothing but couture and designer brands. That means no more slinky clubwear, or dresses that show off too much of those tits of yours. You'll still be able to show plenty of cleavage, but it will be much more understated. Also, we're going to more or less throw out your lingerie drawer. The glittery, neon thongs are fun for a stupid bimbo, but you're going to wear proper lingerie from now on. Full cut, lacy, and very expensive. The days of your g-string hanging out over your jeans is over. You're going to transform from a common bar slut, into an ice cold, vain, incredibly sexual, high-class bitch. It may not do wonders for the size of your friend group, especially male friends, but you're mine now and this is how I want you. Do you understand?\"</span></div></div>",

First, your height. I know it'll be tempting to return to a normal height, or even give yourself that leggy physique that every girl dreams of, but remember, that will require additional expenses that will likely require a toll be taken on your IQ. So bear that in mind when making your decision.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh to yourself. You really hated being such a pipsqueak, but you really didn't want to be a complete airhead again. Ultimately you tell Ms. Souto, \"I'll stay short. It's a small price to pay for not being a moron.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, we'll keep you at 5'1\". Now, there's three relatively small things that will help you balance out the expense and preserve much of your IQ. The first is your vocabulary. The general default setting is to a middle-of-the-road level of profanity. We could up that and make you much more vulgar, which would save you some intellectual expense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would that mean?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, first off, you wouldn't be able to refer to any of your body parts by their anatomical name. You wouldn't say words like 'breasts' or 'vagina,' instead you'd say 'tits' or 'jugs' and 'box' or 'cunt.' Additionally, you'd probably end up swearing like a sailor and just being generally profane. I know it's not a great trait, but if you want to avoid being a huge ditz, it will help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK,\" you say, choosing to not even fight it. There didn't seem to be any reason to try and avoid it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Second, there's really no way around this. Your sex drive needs to be high. If you kept it at low, or even medium, that would result in a huge payment to be made out of your brain. I assume this won't be a problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't like the idea of needing to have sex again, but it was better than being so stupid, plus needing to have sex would be better than never being touched. You just look down glumly and don't reply, prompting Ms. Souto to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, the third thing you can do is become much more vain. This will transform you into one of those girls who is obsessed with herself. You'll primp and preen at the mirror for an excessive amount of time, and take an obnoxious number of selfies, but again, this is a small price to pay for someone who wants to avoid being an idiot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, you cannot disagree, and remain silent even though you're disappointed about the fact that you're about to turn into a class A bitch. Nevertheless, you reason that it cannot be worse than being completely devoid of personality, so you don't fight it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, ok. It looks like we can maintain much of your intellect, but we'll need to make one more change. There seems to be no way around it: you need to develop a fetish. The simplest way to do that is to increase your submissiveness and give you a fixation, probably either oral or anal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would that affect me?\" you inquire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, with the increase in submissiveness you'll find that you enjoy being ordered around by men and that you enjoy some mild humiliation. You won't be able to hold your own in arguments and such, not because you're unable to from an intelligence perspective, but because you just default towards capitulating and giving in. You'll need to be careful because you could easily be manipulated by a strong-willed man, but since you won't be a moron, you should be able to avoid that, or at least recognize it. As far as the fixation goes, that's pretty much self-explanatory. With an oral fixation, you'll gravitate towards fellatio quite frequently, and will obtain sexual pleasure from swallowing semen. With an anal fixation, you will ask, and potentially beg, men to fuck you in the ass, and you may need to put things into your ass to quell any building sexual desire. Do you think you can handle all this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about it for a minute, and then reluctantly agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK then,\" replied Ms. Souto. \"Well, which fixation would you prefer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou answer that you'd rather have an:</span></div></div>",

You could have been the valedictorian of your class, or at least close. But instead you gave all that up, and chose to be slutty. And not just a little slutty, you agreed to reacquire the reputation of \"house slut\" again, so you knew the embarrassment and shame would be returning quite soon. Nevertheless, you didn't care. You've learned that despite everything, this is who you are. You could not live happily as a brainiac. That just wasn't you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you rationalized your decision to yourself, your changes kicked in. The first thing you noticed was the loss of the extreme clarity you had previously enjoyed. Your thought process was slowing down, and you were again becoming dumber. Fortunately, this time it wasn't nearly as extreme as before. You knew you weren't a genius, but you weren't afraid of doing the work for your now much easier major. The return to simplicity was almost cathartic for you, as many of your higher-level anxieties just washed away. You slowly realized that you almost enjoyed being slightly dumber than everyone else. There was less pressure and expectation heaped upon you. You were free to just be yourself and live, which was really all you wanted. Besides, you didn't want to be smarter than the boys you knew you'd soon be interested in again, although maybe this was just an outgrowth of your developing submissiveness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, your glasses disappeared and you watched as the world came into much clearer view. You no longer had to stare through the bottom of coke bottles just to see. Your physical changes then began in earnest. You felt your hair, which was previously limp and lifeless, gain an immense amount of volume. It was clear that you spent a great deal of time and money giving yourself hair that was impossibly full and luscious. You could also feel that vain sense of pride swelling up inside you as you realized that none of your competition could hope to compare to your marvelous mane of hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, you felt your face realign and return to a more angular, and sensual form. You felt your cheekbones rise and become more prominent, as your eyes grew larger, and adopted a more appealing olive shape that demonstrated your Asian heritage without compromising the innocent, doe-like quality of your eyes. You could then feel your lips plump up and transform from thin, nearly non-existent lines around your mouth, into smooth, soft, and sensual pillows that clearly had only one purpose in life: to have a large throbbing cock thrust between them. You could feel how, due to the size of your lips, your mouth remained permanently agape, but only just so. You could close it all the way, but you had to think about it, and to be honest, you didn't seem to mind the imagery you knew you'd be creating in the men you met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, you felt your boobs swell forth. Whereas before, you could hardly fill a training bra, you could feel yourself grow from mere nubs to almost a handfull, which wasn't exactly ideal, but at least you looked like a woman again. Next, you could feel your spine and posture realign in a way that made you more athletic and agile. You certainly weren't an athlete in the sense that you wouldn't be playing any sports (you knew your hand-eye coordination was cutely pitiful), but you had now become toned enough that you knew you would be able to engage in whatever bedroom aerobics you may see fit. You also knew that your walk would no longer be clumsy and cumbersome, but would instead be smooth and sensual. You knew you would swish and sashay about in a way that would drive the boys wild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat brings us to your hips. The changes you had experienced before had been relatively minimal and had not caused more than a tingling sensation. Once your changes went below your waist, however, you felt a searing pain. This was likely due to the sheer magnitude of the changes you were experiencing. You felt your hips broaden dramatically, going from boyish to nearly unproportional, and you knew that your gait would be even more pronounced and sexual given your new dimensions. \"All the better for a girl like me, you couldn't help but think.\" Next, you felt yourself rise up in the chair you were seated in. This had nothing to do with any newfound height, however. Instead, it was as a direct result of all the supple and luscious fat that was pouring into your ass. You knew that you were gaining a significant amount of padding in your ass, and you knew it wasn't muscle. This didn't concern you though, as you imagined your ass pleasantly jiggling as you walk, and wobbling violently if ever it were to be smacked or spanked, which you knew it would be. As the changes moved further south, you felt your thighs thicken up, and you knew that you would struggle to walk without them rubbing softly together. Again, however, this didn't bother you at all, in fact, if anything it excited you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final physical changes affected you more generally. You felt your skin become absurdly smooth and soft, as every hair below your eyebrows quickly disappeared. You knew that you now religiously shaved and moisturized to give yourself this baby soft feel. Next, your skin changed from the pasty alabaster it had been before into the sunkissed glow of a girl who spent a decent amount of time in the tanning bed or lying out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, your clothes changed. First, your utilitarian cotton bra morphed into a lovely, lacy black push-up, designed to gently cradle and lift your boobs, giving you the appearance that you were bustier than you actually were. Next, you felt your plain white panties, which were previously loose but now strained to the max, change material into a satiny silk. You also felt them tighten and shrink, growing smaller and smaller until the became the wispiest and tiniest black g-string. In the back of your head, you knew that you only wore thongs now. You told other girls that it was because your ass was so big, and regular panties were too restrictive, but you knew it was really because it made you feel so much sexier and sluttier. Your lightweight red cardigan disappeared, and you could feel your loose breezy dress split into two pieces. The top tightened and formed a tank top, with a neckline much lower than Amy would've allowed, that did its best to emphasize your pushed-up, but still small, tits. The skirt portion tightened dramatically and changed into a bold black and white pattern. The hemline rose and rose until it just barely covered the bottom of your overstuffed, round ass cheeks. You'd have to be careful about how you bent over, lest you give everyone a show. Finally, your sensible ballet flats morphed into five-inch strappy leather heels. You were pleased to be back in heels, as it helped to offset just how short you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you absorbed the changes you felt a growing pain coming from your rear. You asked Ms. Souto if changes were still ongoing and she said no. She just winked at you and said, \"you probably just got stretched out a bit last night. You're not spending all your time studying anymore, remember?\" You blush as you realize that you're a slut again and you probably should stop asking those questions, lest the shaming continue. You checked your purse, which had shrunk from a practical black tote bag into a smaller, Coach clutch. You found much more makeup than you ever carried as Amy, along with a new ID reading \"Aimee Wu\" with a picture of you puckering your plump lips for the camera. You also found a large dildo and what appeared to be a buttplug, along with some condoms and lube. You were back to carrying around the slut pack, but it was strangely comforting to you. You were back to the old you, and as much as that may have terrified you yesterday, it was a relief today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood up and strolled over to the mirror, feeling your heavy ass cheeks jiggling and your hips swinging in exaggerated sensuality. You were stunned at what you saw, and immediately in love with the new, or at least re-imagined, you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ldqfn9yy4A1qdwh13o1_500.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ldqfn9...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt tears form in your eyes as you turned to catch a glimpse of your overstuffed skirt straining over your burgeoning rear. You could see the outline of your wispy little thong pressed firmly against the stretchy fabric. You attempted to adjust your tits to make them look bigger, but alas, they were your one major flaw. Maybe you could fix them later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK Aimee, I'm sure a slut like you has more than enough mirrors in her room. I have some work to do. Let me know if you need anything else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recoil at being called a slut, but quickly you get over it. The more often people say it the more you are accepting it, and honestly, the more excited it makes you. Aimee Wu is a fucking slut again, and you couldn't be happier. You strut out of Ms. Souto's office and head back to the sorority. When you get there, who do you bump into first?</span></div></div>",

Considering the mess that stemmed from your original \u201cmedium-high,\u201d you quickly realize that her profile is out of the question.  You look to the other profile\u2014Tracii.  Her IQ is a few points lower even than your current one\u2014a mere 88\u2014but then you won\u2019t be enrolled in classes, anyway.  More importantly, her sex drive is rated at an infinitely more manageable \u201cmedium\u201d level.  There\u2019s really no contest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Tracii Montgomery,\u201d you say with resignation. \u201cI\u2019ll take Tracii.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well, you'll need to come in this afternoon so that we can perform the switch and give you two a day or so to get acclimated to your new surroundings.\" Ms. Souto instructed you. \"Please be at my office in an hour or so for a debriefing and profile exchange.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you said goodbye and hung up. You quickly got dressed, squeezing your heavy tits into another DD-cup bra that you were practically bursting out of. You slipped a tube top over it and paired that with a pair of tiny jean shorts. Your ass cheeks were coming out of both the top and bottom, and like before, your bulging butt cheeks pushed your skimpy thong into permanent view. At this point, however, you didn't care, as you would soon be rid of Aimee and beginning life anew as Tracii for better or worse. You tossed on a pair of slutty 3\" heels (the shortest you owned) and tottered out of the house and towards Ms. Souto's office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Souto asked you to wait patiently as she went to let the other girl, who had apparently been waiting in another office, in. She walked in and quietly sat next to you. Before you could really size her up, Ms. Souto spoke to both of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Now girls, in accordance with university policy, I am required to fully disclose and explain what you're agreeing to. Tracii, you have successfully completed the remediation program. Congratulations. You are ready to return to being a full-time student. Aimee, you are presently facing all but certain dismissal and are voluntarily entering the remediation program to give yourself time to demonstrate that you are worthy of being a full-time student again. You will become Tracii and will live her life until you either complete the program or voluntarily withdraw, at which point you will be dismissed from the university. Tracii, you will literally step into Aimee's shoes and will face the same academic predicament she presently faces. Your circumstances will adjust slightly to allow you for more time to rectify it, but the situation will not change. I have every faith that you will be able to handle this challenge and down the road you may qualify for profile alterations that will make your situation more manageable. Do you both understand what I have told you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach of you nod in understanding, and then Tracii asks in a sickeningly sweet, bubble-gum voice: \"So, like, what\u2019s her deal and stuff??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Tracii, I'm not going to lie. This profile is not easy, and it\u2019s not as big a step up as you may have been hoping for in terms of capability and appearance. Aimee here is a member of the Tau Gamma sorority and, without question, she is the dumbest and sluttiest girl in that chapter, bar none. Let's just say that there's more going on in her bra than between her ears\u2026 though you\u2019ll note she is less extreme in both regards than your current profile.  You\u2019ll gain only a few IQ points in the exchange, but at the level you two girls are at, those may be significant. She is a fashion design major and currently holds a 1.72 GPA. You'll need to develop a plan to raise it to at least a 2.0 by semester's end, and that plan must be approved within ten days. Aimee's promiscuity is well-known around campus and among the professors. She has been exchanging sexual favors for a reprieve from tests for some time now, and just last night she had oral and vaginal sex with six or seven guys and her bra is currently stapled to the ceiling of their house with her name and photo attached. She is, as you can see, very showy in the way she dresses. Everything she does is in an attempt to lure potential sexual partners. As you can see, she is bursting out of her bra, a DD-cup, and her thong is perpetually visible over her waistband. Ultimately, you'll be nothing more than a tawdry, out of shape, chubby, dumb, over-sexed, over-endowed, Asian sorority bimbo.  However, you [i]will[/i] be a student. It won't be easy; are you up to the challenge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush even redder as Ms. Souto explains your escapades from the night before. How did she know all that, you wondered. Tracii, however, was unfazed. \"Like, totally,\" she said eagerly, her high voice practically squeaking. This gave you pause.  How bad must things be for Tracii if she was so eager to switch even after hearing everything about Aimee?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about her?\" you say, gesturing at Tracii.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Aimee, Tracii works here in the administrative offices, assisting students and doing filing and record retrieval. She came here with her boyfriend at the time, who was a student, though with her decidedly lacking academic record, she was unable to qualify for enough financial aid to attend university herself.  They originally lived together, he attend class and she saving money, but during his first semester her boyfriend left Tracii, citing his inability \u201cto be tied down to some hometown skank with so much hot coed pussy around.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow needing to support herself as well as save for college, Tracii has been forced to work a second job, spending her evenings as a waitress at \u201cAnatomy Class\u201d a strip bar just off campus.  As I\u2019ve mentioned, Tracii isn\u2019t very bright, and she was talked into the considerable enhancements you can see here by the owner of that establishment, who described them as a \u201csound career investment.\u201d  Though her tips actually did increase considerably after the surgery, the gains aren\u2019t enough to offset the cost of the procedure payment plan, and Tracii is floundering financially. That, then, is your objective:  you will earn remediation when you have rectified Tracii\u2019s financial woes, and accumulated enough savings to enroll in university.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI won\u2019t sugarcoat it: this won\u2019t be an easy task. Tracii is a dim bulb, and thanks to her recent boob job, her body looks even trashier than your current one.  Most people will consider you little more than empty-headed eye candy, and in large part they\u2019ll be right.  She drinks frequently and heavily, as her financial means are\u2014as mentioned\u2014almost nonexistent, so since someone\u2019s always willing to buy her a drink, bars are about the only regular entertainment she can afford.  You will be, in every sense of the phrase, a vapid blonde bimbo, and it won\u2019t be difficult to slide into a pattern of failure that leaves you stuck in that body for a very long time.  Are you up to the challenge?<br>\r\n\"I guess I have no choice?\" you mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you could stay as Aimee, be dismissed in a few days, and spend the rest of your life as a dumb, chubby, slutty college drop-out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way,\" you reply quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it's settled. Let me just enter the final commands here....and there. You two are officially swapped. Tracii, you will change first, and then Aimee will follow. Please hang out in the office for a few minutes while all the changes process.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch with a mixture of anticipation and as Tracii starts to morph in front of your eyes.  She lost several inches of height, bringing her eyes level with your own, even as she gained weight, her toned, flat belly bouncing outward into a perfect copy of your own. Her breasts shrank and fell, deflating and losing their sculpted perkiness as they took on a more natural curve. Her clothes also began altering and growing until the exactly resembled your clothes. You could see the same tattoo you had appear and you watched her grimace as her nipples were pierced just like yours. Her hair and skin darkened, taking on a slightly tanned Asian coloring to match yours, even as her facial features pulled themselves up into a mirror image of yourself.  She grimaced as the changes progressed, though whether that was from discomfort, or simply disgust with your body, you couldn\u2019t tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, her changes stopped, and no sooner were you staring at a duplicate of yourself than a twisting sensation indicated it was your turn.  You gasped as the changes took you.  Your legs lengthened, turning long and slender while giving you an extra three inches of height at the same time. Indeed, all your limbs became slender\u2014the excess fat of Aimee\u2019s chubby form melted away, leaving you with the willowy, thin build of model.  You large, heavy breasts melt away, too, leaving you practically flat chested.  This lasts only a moment, however, before Tracii\u2019s breast implants suddenly balloon outward, taking you from A-Cup to F-Cup in the space of a single breath.  Despite the evocative simile, these are clearly no balloons; these massive, surgically enhanced funbags are seriously heavy on your twig-like frame, and you nearly topple over with their sudden weight.  Your hair exploded outward, cascading around your head in a massive platinum blonde wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the changes finally stop, you stumble over to the mirror, to take in your new self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i.imgur.com/GzVrocB.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://i.imgur.com/GzVrocB.png</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, given the circumstances,\u201d said Ms. Souto, \u201cI\u2019m going to let Tracii take the rest of the day off to get acclimated.  Unless you\u2019d like to get started right away?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You work downstairs, room 203-D  Your tasks should be fairly straightforward, but if you get lost at all, feel free to ask for help.  No one will be too surprised; Tracii already has something of a reputation as an airhead, as you can imagine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she gestures for you to leave, though she holds the new Aimee back, presumably to go over her classes and probation stuff in more detail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n203-D turns out not to be an office at all, but a large, open room with several desks, and an open counter window at one end, where a receptionist can deal with students directly.  Fortunately for you, it doesn't take long to recognize which desk is yours, as all the others are occupied.  It's also the smallest, covered in a hoard of multi-colored sticky notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitantly, you slide into the chair.  As you do so, your massive, fake breasts plow across the desk, knocking papers and office supplies everywhere.  Surprisingly, no one even looks up at the disturbance. <i>Tracii must do that all the time,</i> you realize, <i>so much that they've all learned to tune it out.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, you settle in to your desk and look about you.  Fortunately, Tracii seems to be as scatterbrained as you feel, and most of her job-pertinent info is written haphazardly on the sticky notes all around her desk.  Other notes list phone numbers she might forget\u2014including, apparently, even her own\u2014answers to common questions, and occasionally the intense working out of a simple addition problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This won't be so bad,</i> you muse.  <i>I can handle this, no problem.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, indeed, the workday goes quite smoothly.  You don't know any of your duties, of course, but people tend to just give you orders, and you follow them, and that works out fine.  Make ten copies of this.  Call so-and-so and confirm that.  As far as you can tell, you don't really have any responsibilities of your own; you're just a resource for the others in the office to offload menial tasks onto.  Still, you handle everything that's thrown at you, more or less, and by the time the end of the day rolls around, you're feeling pretty confident in your ability to master this remediation and earn re-admittance.  It's boring, but totally doable.  Best of all, your libido has been completely under control all day.  For the first time since the Aimee fiasco, it looks like you're not a total slut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, using the numbers from the sticky notes scattered around Tracii's desk (and a calculator as you don't entirely trust your current intellect with basic math), you run a quick tab to calculate how long you'll do this for before you earn the $13,000 you'll need for your first semester's tuition as a non-resident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Let's see, add the income from this job, plus the waitressing gig, minus gas, food, rent, boob job payments, car insurance, utilities\u2026. So that means each month, working both jobs, I'll be able to save up\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Negative six hundred dollars!?</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was obviously going to be harder than you initially thought.  But if Tracii is in this much trouble, how did she qualify for the swap with you in the first place?  As you crinkle your cotton-candy brain for solutions, a ping from your computer indicates a text message.  It's from Mike, one of the other workers in room 203-D<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That's odd</i> you think. <i>We're all right here.  Usually people just call out for me when they need something.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou check the message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\"><b><span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Mike: hey, u want another 200? File room, 10 minutes.</span></b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh.  So, you're not a slut.  Just a whore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over at Mike.  Overweight, with greasy black hair, at least ten years your senior.  He flashes you a lascivious wink.  You shudder.  Unlike your experience as Aimee, you're certain you have the ability\u2014even the preference\u2014to turn him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're just not sure you can afford to.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's a good thing since you weren't sure of where it was.  Seeing a folder that has a sticky note that says \"To Be Filed\" on it, you pick it up and head toward the room.  A pleasant, older lady gives you a sad sympathetic smile as you walk by her.  You wonder if she knows what you are really going to do but you figure you're being pretty smart taking the folder so you hold it up and say, \"Um... I'm going to, like, file this y'know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just shakes her head and sighs, \"Oh Tracii...\"  You figure that she just feels bad because you're so obviously dim witted.  So you flash a smile and go to the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get in, Mike growls, \"Lock the door and drop to your knees.\"  His leering smile makes you shiver, but you figure this will get over faster if you listen.  As you move to your knees you look up at him, well mostly his belly, and remember the money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about, y'know, the money?\" He glares and mumbles something about not being trusted just because he forgot to pay a couple of times but he pulls out two $100 bills and hands them to you.  Smiling as you see the money, you reach out and undo his belt and open his pants.  Pulling down his pants and shorts, you see a small hard cock.  Even though you are in a different body, you still remember how to suck cock like the pro that Aimee was and wrap your lips around his small cock.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few long minutes, Mike grunts, \"Oh fuck, have you been practicing? You've never sucked me off this well.\" He stiffens up, grabs the sides of your head and empties his balls into your mouth.  It's a bit icky but you swallow and then clean off his cock as he pulls it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulls his pants back up and says, \"My wife is out of town this weekend, I'd be willing to pay for some pleasant company.\"  His lustful glare makes you shiver.</span></div></div>",

You were rather cute, though rather plain and ordinary, with soft, simple features and no makeup (you didn't really need any, from what you could tell). Your dress was long (ankle-length), flowing, and modest. In fact, your entire outfit was built for comfort, modesty, and simplicity, with simple white cotton underwear that did nothing to constrict or restrict you in any way. You wore no jewelry but a simple silver watch on your left wrist. You checked your purse (plain and simply designed and the same light blue as your dress) and found a wallet with ID, some cash and a single credit/debit card, also a class planner, a calculator, several pens and highlighters, and a simple black phone (everything organized and in separate pockets). Overall, you seemed a decent, plain girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All done,\" says Ms. Souto. \"Let me just submit this and you can be on your way. I would encourage you, however, to wait in my office while the changes are processed.\" You again agree, and Ms. Souto enters the final few keystrokes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately upon hitting Enter, you begin to feel disoriented, but it passes quickly. \"What was that?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said, the changes are being processed. There won't be a lot, and we don't like changing profiles too heavily anyway, but it still tends to be disorienting until it's complete. Here, let me show you what we did.\" She then hands you a sheet of paper:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPREVIOUS INFO<br>\r\nName: Amy Wu<br>\r\nGender: Female<br>\r\nAge: 19<br>\r\nHair: Black<br>\r\nHeight: 5'5\u201d<br>\r\nWeight: 95 lbs<br>\r\nEthnicity: Asian (Chinese)<br>\r\nMeasurements: 32B-23-33<br>\r\nMajor: Chemistry<br>\r\nGPA: 3.98<br>\r\nAlcohol: N<br>\r\nSmokes: N<br>\r\nSexually Active: N<br>\r\nSex Drive: Low<br>\r\nIQ: 117<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNEW INFO<br>\r\nName: Amy Wu<br>\r\nGender: Female<br>\r\nAge: 19<br>\r\nHair: Black<br>\r\nHeight: 5'5\u201d<br>\r\nWeight: 95 lbs<br>\r\nEthnicity: Asian (Chinese)<br>\r\nMeasurements: 32B-23-33<br>\r\nMajor: Chemistry<br>\r\n<b>GPA: 3.90</b><br>\r\nAlcohol: N<br>\r\nSmokes: N<br>\r\nSexually Active: N<br>\r\nSex Drive: Low<br>\r\n<b>IQ: 125</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said,\" Ms. Souto says, \"The changes aren't very drastic. Since you're not focusing exclusively on academics, your GPA dropped, but not by too much since you're still academically inclined. To compensate for having other interests, your IQ was raised a little to keep your GPA high. Now, the changes should finish up shortly...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only change you notice right then is that your purse gets slightly but noticeably heavier. You look inside and find that several new items have been added: in addition to what it contained before, your purse now also holds a handheld video game system and a couple of thick science-fiction and fantasy novels. It remains as neatly organized as before, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, that wasn't very much,\" you say quietly. You pull out one of the novels, an unfamiliar title with a cover picture of a knight facing a dragon. \"And at least this is less...girly,\" you say before putting the book back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're an intelligent, modest girl with an interest in science, as you can tell by your major,\" Ms. Souto explains, \"I gave you extra-academic interests that both make sense for that and would be best for your acclimation. As for being 'girly', before you ask, right now we just made you about as unfeminine as the Amy Wu profile will allow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are disappointed by that, but can do nothing about it, so you let it go. \"So now what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the system won't allow any additional changes for at least 72 hours,\" Ms. Souto says. \"For now, I'd suggest that you go back to the sorority house and try to acclimate to your new self. Most of the changes will be in your room there anyway, so that would be best to get used to the adjustment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith nothing else to do, you return to the sorority house as suggested. A few of the girls are there, and greet you as you enter. You only absent-mindedly return their greetings and instead head straight for your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you enter, you are surprised: it has indeed changed (though not much) and somehow feels more comfortable. Before, it was neat and meticulously organized, with feminine (mostly floral) decorations in light pastel colors. Now it remains neat and meticulously organized, the desk, binders, storage, bookshelf, and so on remain unchanged; but the colors are more gender-neutral, the floral theme is gone, and the feminine decorations are removed, replaced with a second bookshelf of science-fiction and fantasy novels, and a television and a game console on a TV desk next to it. Checking your closet reveals little changes to your clothing: they are almost entirely modest and plain shirts, skirts, and dresses in various shades of blue, green, and gray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh. It's better than before, but you're still a little annoyed at being stuck as Amy Wu. There's nothing you can do about it though, so you have no choice but to try to get used to it.</span></div></div>",

Over the course of studying, you notice your handwriting shift from big and messy to small and precise. Your studying tactics have also changed, as you read over the chapter multiple times and quiz yourself, whereas Elliot would've read half the chapter and given up. Not to mention you knew hardly anything about chemistry, and now you were an expert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Looking around Amy's, well, your boring room, you realized you liked it plain and boring.

The first to catch your attention is the shiny red hair that bounces across your face, but it isn't long before your gaze moves downward and you're clutching at yourself in frantic horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoobs!\u201d you squeak, nearly hysterical. \u201cI have boobs!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls giggle uproariously.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe's even bustier than you, Vera,\u201d says one of the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd skinnier, too,\u201d says another.  The buxom blonde girl you assume must be Vera looks a little annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFran hides a smile as she tries to quiet them down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, now, girls;\u201d she says, \u201cYou know how hard it can be adjust to your first placement.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls nod reluctantly, but continue to hover about until Fran shoes them away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don't I show you to your room?\u201d she says, glancing meaningfully at the others.  \u201cYou can come meet the rest of the house after you've had a few minutes to get situated, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill more concerned with feeling yourself up than anything going on around you, you nod absently and let Fran lead you down the hall to a small, tastefully decorated bedroom.  As she closes the door behind you, you manage to catch a glimpse of yourself in the mirror mounted on the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring back at you is a busty redheaded girl with a ravishing figure, dressed in a provocatively low-cut sundress.   You wave, watching in fascination as the buxom redhead in the mirror waves back.  Fran indulges you for a moment, then gently grabs your shoulder and turns to face you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know\u201d she says, \u201cIt can be something of a shock a first, being placed.  It's Denise, isn't it?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Her books are on a shelf above\u2014judging from the accumulation of trinkets piled on top of them, they probably don't see much use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening up the dresser reveals pretty much what you expected\u2014drawers stuffed to bursting with low-cut tops and flouncy skirts.  You pause for a moment on the lingerie drawer. You shudder slightly at the size of the bra cups\u2014some are labeled \"DD\", some \"E,\" but they all look big enough for your head.  And now you're wearing one.  You slide the drawer closed with a grimace, suddenly acutely aware of the straps digging into your shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe closet's much the same\u2014tight little dresses and flirty little tops\u2014plus three full bins packed with more shoes than you'd thought imaginable, none of which seem to have less than a one-inch heel.  Also stuffed in the closet for some reason is the trash can\u2014the contents of which include a tall bottle of vodka and two empty boxes of condoms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find several more boxes\u2014full ones\u2014in the nightstand, plus another in her purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, slightly sick to your stomach, you decide you've seen enough.  Denise is obviously just as she seems; a buxom, libidinous sorority girl.  Pawing through more of her lacy thongs and seemingly endless condom stashes won't tell you anything you don't already know about 'your' new life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question, then, is what to do now?  Should you play along as 'Denise' and just go out and 'meet the girls' as Fran suggested? Or should you quietly slip out of the house and see what you can uncover about this twisted campus?  Maybe there's still a way out of this!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Thus decided, you slip out of your room and make your way down the hall back to the living room, voices growing louder as you approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...I'm just saying I'm glad <i>I'm</i> not the one stuck as Mc<i>Slut</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnnie, don't call her that!

And have you <i>seen</i> her wardrobe?  Frankly, as a house I say we were better off without her.

Right?  <i>Right?</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's an awkward pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, fine, whatever,\u201d sighs Vera.  \u201cNo talk about before.

Vera doesn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome!\u201d says Fran, glaring at the others. \u201cEveryone, Let's give a warm welcome to our newest sister, Denise McLain.  She's a freshman, and majoring in communications; isn't that right Denise?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFigures that's what you'd 'study,'\u201d scoffs Vera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, yeah,\u201d you mutter, uncomfortable.

Not to mention it looks like it will barely covers your butt.  \"No way!\" you protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFran brings it over to you and gives you a serious look.  \"Listen Denise, I'm trying to help you.  If you don't wear something like this, you will start to be noticed and then... well, sometimes bad things happen.  Just wear this, you don't have to have a good time or do anything, but please wear it.\"  Reluctantly you take it and wiggle out of your clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll need to take off the bra, this outfit will provide enough support even with your impressive size.\"  She smiles pleasantly.

Fran helps you and then hands you some high wedge black heels that must be at least 5\" high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take them but protest, \"How do I even walk in these things?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFran giggles, \"Don't worry, there's a lot of muscle memory thing built into the transformation process.  I'm willing to bet that you will quickly adapt to them.\"  With a little help, you put them on and stand up.  You look in a mirror and are taken aback by how sexy you look.  Instinctively, you straighten the dress.  Noticing that it does feel nice in spite of how tight it is on your body.  \"There, now we're ready to go party!\"  Fran laughs as she grabs your arm to pull your to the door.  You stumble a little at first but then you quickly get used to the high heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These heels feel pretty good.\" You comment as you look down at them.  \"I would have never guessed something like this would actually be comfortable.\"  Fran just gives you a knowing smile and ushers you to meet the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girls filter into the common area and all look great.  You think about how you'd definitely notice as a guy.  The only one who is dressed as scatily as you is Vera and you have to admit she's pretty sexy as well.  Then you realize that none of this is turning you on.  Before the interview with the scientist at KARC the sight of all these sexy sorority girls would have almost driven you mad with lust.  But there's something different in how they look now.  Thinking it's probably just a lack of testosterone or something, you shake your head and go out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk to Pi Iota Gamma isn't long.  You don't join into the chatting and laughter of the other girls but you can feel that there's a certain excitement in the air.  You can hear the music from the Gamma house as you get close and see some other groups gathering.  One group of guys catches your attention.  They must be an athletic group, maybe football or something, because they are all large and muscular.  Suddenly, you feel a rush between your legs.  You realize that you are extremely turned on.  \"No...\" you mumble, \"This isn't right, I... I don't like guys that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFran leans close and asks, \"Did you say something?  Are you OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize that you need to beat this somehow.  You can't run away every time one of the mad scientist induced emotions or feelings come over you.  But are you really ready to face this many people?  Especially when they look like the frat guys you just saw.</span></div></div>",

The bartender smiles at the two of you as he hands you the drinks and winks.  \"Of course, you're both 21 right.\"<br>\r\nFran winks back, \"Of course we are!\" Then she raises the glass and says, \"Cheers!\" You join her and take a sip.  It tastes really strong but you don't want to sound whiny so you figure you'll just nurse it.<br>\r\nWalking through the room, you can tell many guys are checking you out.

You may be in a girl's body but the beer tastes much better and reminds you of your previous life.  After you take another drink, you notice a couple of guys come over and start talking with Fran.  She introduces you to the guys as Rick and Tony.  You politely say hello and take another drink.  But you're eyes roam all over them.  They obviously are football players.  Rick is at least 6'6\" and Tony is taller by a couple of inches.  Rick is a lighter skinned, brown haired guy with blue eyes.  Tony is darker with dark hair and brown eyes.  Both have massive shoulders and huge arms.  You think about how nice it must feel to be held by those arms.<br>\r\nThen you shake your head, followed by a big drink.

Our placement test determined that this is the role for which you would be best suited.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut she\u2019s a girl!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you can see,\u201d she indicates your body, \u201cThat\u2019s not an obstacle for us. Anyone can be assigned any role for which they are best qualified, without prejudice to concerns like sex, age, disability, or other physical status.  This is your role.  The entire campus, even the staff and professors, are organized this way,.  Every role is essential to the proper functioning of this institution, and in your case, the tests were quite clear.  You are Denise McLain, newest member of Tau Gamma Sorority\u2014not to mention something of a legend of the locker room variety, if reports are accurate. Now, if you\u2019re certain you\u2019re unhappy with your profile, I may be able to help you make some modifications, but make no mistake: your basic role as Denise McLain is not up for debate.  Now, would you like me to help you adjust your profile today?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The most amazing part of this is that everything can be controlled. You are currently in the default Denise McLain profile, but I have the authority to modify that profile. We don't like to make adjustments too severe - that's what the placement exam is for - but we can certainly make some modifications. So, Denise, what is it about yourself that you wish to change?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I looked through my room,\" you say. \"And...Denise is really, really girly and, to be honest...a slut. And these boobs are kinda heavy and annoying and I'm having trouble walking in these damn heels.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" says Ms. Souto, \"but that's a bit much for one modification. What would you say displeases you the most? We can adjust that, and if you are still dissatisfied in a few days, you can come back for possible further adjustment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, make it so I'm not a damn slut. That's the worst of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well,\" says Ms. Souto. \"Give me a moment to make the adjustment.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit and watch as Ms. Souto types on the computer. You shift your purse but do not look through it, and focus your attention on Ms. Souto. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All done,\" says Ms. Souto after a minute. \"I just need to submit this and you can be on your way. I would encourage you, however, to wait in my office while the changes are processed.\" You again agree, and Ms. Souto enters the final keystrokes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately upon hitting Enter, you suddenly feel very dizzy, but it quickly passes. \"What was that?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The changes are being processed. It tends to be disorienting as it works. Here, let me show you what we did.\" She then passes you a sheet of paper, and you look at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPREVIOUS INFO<br>\r\nDenise McLain<br>\r\nAge: 18<br>\r\nHair: Red<br>\r\nHeight: 5'6\u201d<br>\r\nWeight: 122 lbs<br>\r\nEthnicity: White Non-Hispanic<br>\r\nMeasurements: 38DD-25-36<br>\r\nMajor: Communications<br>\r\nGPA: 2.2<br>\r\nAlcohol: Y<br>\r\nSmokes: N<br>\r\nSexually Active: Y<br>\r\nSex Drive: Very High<br>\r\nIQ: 90<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNEW INFO<br>\r\nDenise McLain<br>\r\nAge: 18<br>\r\nHair: Red<br>\r\nHeight: 5'6\u201d<br>\r\nWeight: 122 lbs<br>\r\nEthnicity: White Non-Hispanic<br>\r\nMeasurements: 38DD-25-36<br>\r\n<b>Major: Writing/literature</b><br>\r\n<b>GPA: 3.8</b><br>\r\n<b>Alcohol: N</b><br>\r\nSmokes: N<br>\r\n<b>Sexually Active: N</b><br>\r\n<b>Sex Drive: Very Low</b><br>\r\n<b>IQ: 110</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you can see, there have been a number of changes, focusing on making Denise less libidinous and more academic. The old Denise would go to parties at any opportunity and thought nothing of...being intimate. The new Denise is more studious and academically inclined, rarely parties and never drinks or gets intimate.  The changes should be finishing now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing you notice is your purse changes, shifting from a fancy-looking designer purse to a simple, functional handbag. But then your clothing begins to change. Your dress becomes less low-cut and more modest, covering your bust and better covering your cleavage. The dress's hemline drops from high above the knee to a bit below it. Your underwear changes as well. Your lacy black bra changes into a simple cotton bra, becoming noticeably more comfortable. A tightness disappears from it, and it no longer squeezes and pushes up your breasts. Your panties, too, change from thin black lace to simple white cotton. Unfortunately, the high heels remain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour skin lightens slightly, and you can feel previously-unnoticed piercings vanishing. Your face tickles a bit as makeup disappears from it, leaving you with a natural look. Your hair seems to get a little longer, but you're not quite sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go,\" says Ms. Souto. \"Now the system won't allow any more changes for at least 72 hours, so I encourage you to go back to the sorority house and learn about the new you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up and head for the door. Though you're still having trouble balancing with the heels, walking seems easier, as if an unnoticed ache in your legs is gone. You leave the building and start to head back to the sorority house.</span></div></div>",

Reflexively, you swallow the first few mouthfuls, it tastes of chemicals, but it's hopefully not toxic. It continues to rise, forcing you to take a desperate gulp. It floods into your lungs, and you feel like you're drowning. Beating against the tube with your fists, it's your panic that stops you realising you're not drowning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing is an effort, the liquid heavy and sluggish in your lungs, but you can breath it.... you are breathing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe liquid continues to pour in, you feel it splashing through your hair as the tube fills to the brim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa smiles reassuringly through the glass, a faint pink tint to your vision.

It's not painful, just distracting. As you see your clothes turn to dust, and then nothing, it spikes up to degrading. Your hands shift from keeping you in position, to covering your crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorse, Rosa doesn't seem interested by your nudity. But things take a turn for the worse, as your skin starts to disintegrate. Your bare organs float in the solution, held in place you assume by the same nanites gorging on your flesh. Another glance from Rosa, just as apathetic is another wave of humiliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout eyelids, you can't close your eyes, or even blink. Glancing down, the sight is disturbing. You snatch your gaze back up, focusing on Rosa through the glass. You try not to see the half-reflection of your bare facial muscles. But they move catching your eye, demanding your attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sense of shrinking is hard to define, as you float there. But, your face looks smaller, your body reduced, towards the petite. You don't fancy being small, dismissed as cute. But at least Rin wasn't as busty as the alternative. The idea of adjusting to being Kelsey, to being clearly a girl was terrifying. At least, at a simple A-cup, you could still dress the same, just in smaller sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tube feels roomier, giving you more space to swim. An instinct to scull your hands, as you float keeping yourself in place. Forcing yourself, you glance downwards once more. You see a reduced chest, narrower shoulders, skinnier arms, ending in slender hands. It's still bare of any pink flesh, those bare muscles red and raw-looking. But thankfully free from pain. The sight is oddly calming. Things are going smoothly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa looks you over once more. Her gaze dropping quickly back to the console. The expression on her face is easy to read. She's starting to panic. Her hands fly over the controls, as she tries various things. Sparing you a glance, she's only looking to see if her actions are having any impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's making some progress, as you see skin form. Thickening your muscles and veins are hidden beneath a soft olive layer. Not the familiar pink you knew, but inoffensive. It feels oddly tight, but you assume you'll get used to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look to Rosa ready to beam a reassuring smile to her. But that flickers, falters and fails, as you see she's still looking just as agitated, just as distressed. She gives you a curt nod, and stabs a button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel those new eyelids get heavy, and you fall unconscious in the tube.</span></div></div>",

You see a sign on the warehouse that says \"Geraldson Furs\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"We got the perfect day- government inspectors are coming by,\" says Sara, \"They'll be here in an hour and get the message of our protest. FUR IS MURDER!!!\" She yells, garnering a deafening rebuttal from the crowd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Birch, get up on that rock! You can lead us!\" Exclaims Sara.

It can be tough for some, but I came from and English-speaking country,\" she says in an Irish accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"What ees zees?\" you ask, trying to say 'What is this?', but it comes out in a thick French accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I know it can be tough when you're acclimating,\" says Morgan, \"But soon enough the French accent will seem natural.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Quit suis-je?\" you ask, meaning to say 'Who am I?', but for some reason speaking French just seems more natural and flows better for you. You also notice you're thinking in French.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Your name is Emilie LeBlanc,\" says Morgan, \"I'm basically, I guess I'm here to help you out with your new life? Something like that. Don't worry, a lot of us are from other countries.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I am from zee Etats-Unis,\" you say in your annoying accent, \"I am not coming from France.\" You notice that when you CAN speak English, it comes out broken as well as accented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Well, you're Emilie LeBlanc now, and Emilie LeBlanc is from France,\" says Morgan, \"We don't really get to talk about our old lives. This is you now, might as well forget about whoever you used to be. Besides, it's not too bad once you get used to it. Oh, I'm stupid, I'm supposed to show you what you look like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Morgan gives you a mirror and you can finally see yourself. You have large eyes and a long face, a small mole under your thick lips. You have a long, elegant neck, and you're wearing a beautiful green dress over the curves of your new female body.

You take a deep breath and steel yourself. \"Yes, I understand,\" you say, barely keeping calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" says Elena cheerfully, and helps you stand, since you're still a little disoriented. You look around and see that the room is large, in soft colors and minimalist decoration. The bed you were laying on is actually a pull-out couch-bed. \"This is the entry and common room for the girls' wing of the international dorm,\" Elena explains. \"Here- you should see yourself,\" she says, and directs you to a mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough you know you should expect to see a girl in the reflection, you're still unprepared for actually seeing it (even after looking down at yourself earlier). In the mirror is a decently-pretty Asian girl, petite yet buxom, with a shy-looking cute face and straight black hair that reaches halfway down her -your- back. Though your clothing is very modest (the shirt is long-sleeved and shows no cleavage; the skirt is loose and reaches past your knees; you wear sneakers and regular socks instead of heels/stockings; you're not wearing any makeup, jewelry, or cosmetics of any kind), it fails to completely hide your feminine figure or your large and prominent breasts; and you shift uncomfortably, aware of their weight on your chest and the pressure of what must be Aya's bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All your stuff is in your room - except this,\" Elena adds, handing you a plain white handbag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Elena's pointed tone and the deliberate way she gives you the handbag, you get the feeling she wants you to check it, so you do. It contains only a wallet with some cash and ID (you wince seeing the name \"Aya Nakano\" and the same girl's face on your ID, but suppress it), a plain black smartphone, some basic school supplies (including several pens and pencils and an advanced calculator), and what appears to be a small notebook - labeled on the cover in Japanese kanji (identifying it as your schedule/planner, and labeled with your new name in both English and kanji). And...you can read it and understand the kanji just fine. You're not even translating it in your head, you understand it just as clearly as if it were written in English. You mention this to Elena, and she nods. \"Mm-hm, that's the adaptation,\" she says. \"You're from Japan, <i>of course</i> you understand the language.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh. This is all overwhelming, and a lot to take in. You agreed because you didn't see much of a choice, but that doesn\u2019t mean you're happy about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aya?\" says Elena, catching your attention. \"I know it can be difficult at first, but it does get better. I can show you to your dorm room if you want. Or if you like, you can explore the campus.\"</span></div></div>",

Who are you?\" you groan, only to let out an \"eep\" at the unfamiliar -female- sound of your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you know, Miss Jensen?\" he responds. \"I'm Mr. Stanton, your professor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill a little disoriented, you say \"I'm sorry sir, but I think you have me confused for someone else. I'm Elliot Barnes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so?\" he asks calmly. He pulls you to your feet and directs you to look at a mirror on the back of the office door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look in the mirror and are shocked by what you see. The reflection staring back at you is of a decently pretty girl in her late teens, with waist-length straight black hair, wearing a modest blue-gray shirt and jeans, and a small pair of thin, simple glasses. You raise your arm, and the reflection mirrors your movement. Looking down at yourself only confirms that the girl in the reflection is you. You realize...Janet Jensen. They actually turned you into Janet Jensen.</span></div></div>",

You take off your glasses to rub the exasperation and exhaustion from your eyes, then put them back on since your vision is rather poor without them.  You pull out the wallet and ID (still not comfortable with the ID saying 'Janet Jensen' but able to suppress it) and find your dorm location on the map, deciding to head there first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go outside and see a sign identifying this building as 'Professors' Offices'. You find it on the map and mentally trace a path to your dorm, about halfway across campus. Only then do you look out at the actual campus, and are surprised by what you see. It's large, and very modern-looking but still keeping lush greenery for a good aesthetic look. You don't like what they've done to you but you have to admit it is impressive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you make your way to your dorm you think about the change in your identity. It could definitely be worse, but that doesn't mean you like it. You catch a glimpse of your reflection in a mirrored surface serving as part of a modern art sculpture, and stop briefly to take it in again. Though there's no mistaking that you're a girl, your appearance isn't too feminine: you're wearing pants instead of a skirt and sneakers instead of heels, you don't have a purse or handbag, you're not wearing jewelry, makeup, or cosmetics of any kind (and you still look decent), and although your hair is long it just falls where it will and has no fancy treatments. Before you were too focused on having been turned into a girl to notice all this, but now... You take a deep breath to steady yourself and continue toward the dorm. You're still uncomfortable with the change, and you still don't like it, but if Janet isn't too feminine... Yes, it could be a lot worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach your dorm, which has an electronic lock. Just as Mr. Stanton said, scanning your ID gets you access. You then find your room and scan your ID to get in. And...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room is neat and meticulously organized.  On the far wall there is a desk with an advanced-looking computer on one side and open work space on the other. On the right wall is the bed, neatly made with gray sheets. On the left wall is the closet door and a bookshelf of science-fiction novels. On the near wall (with the door you entered through) is another bookshelf containing textbooks, folders and binders, and various non-fiction books (including manuals and documentations) about robotics engineering and computer sciences. Checking the closet reveals that Janet's outfits are mostly similar to what you're wearing now: modest shirts and pants in gender-neutral colors. The clothing/underwear dresser is in the closet as well, being small enough to fit, and containing only simple white bras, panties, and socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh. It seems Janet is a modest, intelligent, tomboyish engineering student. You're still not enthusiastic about being her, but you repeat to yourself again that it could be a lot worse. The question arises, though, what do you do now?</span></div></div>",

Through the windows, sunshine illuminates the trees and buildings beyond, and you walk outside stopping at the top of the steps and survey the campus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk ahead leads to a large statue with arms spread as if welcoming you. Walkways lead from it to other buildings left, right and beyond. There's a few people wandering along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the left is a modernistic, mostly glass structure that looks like something out of the future. The sun glints off parts of it while other parts seem to absorb all light leaving deep black holes that reveal nothing no matter how hard you stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind the statue is a wooden building of three floors, the top being dormers in the roof. It's painted in an off-white with deep blue shutters on one side and dark red shutters framing the windows on the other. A small covered porch holds several chairs and benches with various colored cushions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn your right looms a large red brick building with the sun behind it. In the shadows, ivy surrounds the windows like eyelids of a multi-eyed monster with the high archway in the center like an open mouth swallowing students then spitting out others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at the map, you see the glass building is the science building. Ahead is the co-ed dorm with obvious male and female wings. On the right are classrooms and library. Behind you - the building you just met Mr. Stanton - is the administration and teacher offices along with some meeting rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe statue before you is listed as the \"Alfred King Statue.\" As you raise your eyes, the statue seems now to beckon you forward. You blink slowly thinking it must be an illusion of the sun; and when you open your eyes this time, it's arms are now spread again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's all quite weird, although also somewhat familiar. As you move down the steps, the wind catches your hair and blows strands across your face which you casually brush back behind an ear as natural as can be. It isn't until you're just about to the statue that you realize that you're wearing high heeled shoes but have not faltered one bit, even down the steps, and they feel natural as does the slight bouncing of your chest. Well, at least if you're now a girl, you're not fumbling about acting like a guy trying to act like a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a stocky girl with strawberry hair looking up at the statue on one side, but your attention is drawn to a tall, well built, and handsome young man looking at you from behind the statue. A feeling of being alone not knowing anyone wafts over you, and you think this experience would definitely go better if you made some friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've always been uncomfortable meeting girls and aren't sure how to approach her. She seems more interested in the statue than any of the people around, but maybe she's just as lonely as you are. You see the guy is also checking her out possibly trying to decide which of the two of you to approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you feel like you've got a little competition going here. Perhaps you should approach the girl before he does just to tease him and cut him off. Or maybe you should just put yourself before him before he goes for her making a decision for him. Excitement washes over you as you move towards ...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But I suppose it doesn't matter. If they could do this,\" she gestures at herself and you understand she's referring to your new bodies, \"they could easily set up an illusion here.\" She shrugs, then turns away, gesturing for you to follow, which you do. \"I should get going. I want to look around,\" she lowers her voice, \"and get away from that guy,\" she briefly indicates the boy, who's still there. \"He's just been staring at us. It's annoying.\" You agree with this completely, so you go along with Kelly. She smiles, seemingly pleased to have you with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you leave the statue behind, Kelly looks at you. \"Have you seen your dorm room yet, Janet?\" she asks. \"I woke up in mine. They're pretty nice, actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I haven't,\" you confess. \"I only woke up a few minutes ago, in that building there,\" you say, indicating the professor's offices. You idly think that it's easier talking to girls since you've become one yourself - you don't think your normal self would be as relaxed around Kelly as you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In there?\" Kelly asks, \"What's your position?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm an...engineering major teacher's assistant,\" you say, adjusting your glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool,\" says Kelly, \"I'm a major in biology, nothing too special about me. Anyway, do you want to check out your room first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I considered that,\" you say, \"but I wanted to look around the campus first.

Your body feels strange, and there's an unfamiliar weight on your chest. As your vision clears, you see you're lying on your back on a bed in an unfamiliar room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you awake?\" asks a female voice. You turn to see a girl with short dirty-blonde hair sitting in a chair by a desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Who are you?\" you ask, your voice sounding soft and high-pitched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl looks at you. \"I'm Jennifer Blaine. A fellow R.A. And you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" you ask. \"I'm... Elliot Barnes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure about that?\" Jennifer asks, taking your hand and pulling you to your feet. As she does, you get a look at the room. It looks like a college dorm room - a single. You were lying on the bed, which has light green sheets. There's a desk with a computer, where Jennifer was sitting, and a bookshelf filled with books. There's posters on the walls from several science fiction series. Jennifer turns you to a door that has a full-length mirror on it, and you stare in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at you from the mirror is an attractive-looking brunette girl. She's slim but also curvy, with large breasts. She's wearing sneakers, an ankle-length light green flowing skirt, and a modest black shirt that manages to cover her large chest but cannot hide it. Her face is soft and cute, with blue eyes. Her hair is soft brown and reaches her waist. You lift your hand, and the reflection mirrors the movement. You gently tug on your hair, and you can feel it. You gently poke your large bust, but drop your hand as you feel that too. The girl in the mirror is you. You realize... Rebecca Reeve. They actually turned you into Rebecca Reeve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now let's try this again. Who are you?\" says Jennifer pointedly. Something about her tone hints that she's not genuinely asking.</span></div></div>",

I'll be helping you with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, thanks...\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer smiles. \"Okay, you probably want to look around your room. I'll wait outside. When you're ready, come on out and I can show you around the campus.\" And with that, she steps outside, leaving you alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs suggested, you look around. The room is neat and organized, the decor in shades of green, blue, and white. The computer on the desk looks advanced and fancy, and the desk is large enough to also have a space for handwritten work. Under the desk is a printer with a built-in scanner. The bookshelf contains your textbooks - various books on writing and literature. There are also several classic novels. The bottom shelf contains some science-fiction books, probably for personal entertainment.  There's a small dresser, which is filled with undergarments - standard socks, panties, and bras - as well as pajamas (nightgowns, mostly, but also shirts and pants). You check the closet - the door with the mirror - and find a large number of modest shirts, and skirts varying from knee-length to ankle-length, and only a couple pairs of pants. There's one spare pair of shoes in there - a pair of formal flats. You shut the closet door, shaking your head in resignation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou exit the dorm room to find Jennifer waiting in the hall. \"Ready to see the campus?\" she asks.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A moment after you nod at the profile of Alexis Lee, you black out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you awake, you're lying face down on an unfamiliar bed.  Breathing becomes more labored than what you are used to when you lay on your stomach.  There is an unfamiliar pressure against your chest that somehow feels oversized and incredibly sensitive.  Your eyes shoot open as you jerk your head up from the pillow it was resting on.  Your vision is blurred but you can tell you are in a room you've never been in before.  The other thing you notice is how several long strands of fine, black hair fell over your opened eye to obscure your vision further.  Memories of the conversation with Rosa slowly come back.  She was talking about some profile that you were supposed to choose between.  One was Alexis Lee and the other was Amanda Rodriguez.  You chose Alexis because you loved history but also because she sounded hot.  Who doesn't love volleyball chicks after all?  But never in your wildest dreams did you actually believe it would become reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Okay, stay calm,'</i>  You think to yourself as you lay as still as possible.  <i>'There is no way this could possibly be happening.  I'm probably just laying on a large pillow or two.'</i>  Slowly, you slide your left hand to your chest to inspect the object under your chest.  You lament as your fingers caress soft flesh covered by a cloth connected to your shirt.  <i>'This has got to be a dream...'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you awake?\"  Came an unfamiliar female voice from behind you.  Your eyes shoot open once more as you naturally turn your head to the source of the disturbance.  It was a tall blonde who was sitting on her bed reading a rather large book, at least, she looked like she had been.  By this point the book was lowered and she turned her head to face you.  \"About time you woke up.\"  She said with a smile as she completely set her book aside.  \"Where am I?\"  You ask and are so shocked at the voice coming out of your mouth that you let out an \"eep\".  The voice was sultry and sweet, the voice of a true siren with just the slightest hint of an accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Smith Annex,\" The blonde girl says as she stands up. \"My name is Maria. I know, being placed is a shock, isn't it?\"  She takes your silent shock as a yes.  \"Have a look for yourself.\"  Maria leads your gaze over to a full length mirror.  You hesitate in your bed for a moment, horrified at what might await you inside that mirror.  Against your better judgement, you muster up the courage to face your fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLong, toned legs reach out to the floor easily.  You don't pay much attention to this fact until you stand up fully extended.  The ceiling and surrounding furniture was smaller than what you remember it.  Even Maria, your Hispanic roommate appears to be on the small side when moments ago you thought she was rather tall for a girl. The fact that your center of gravity has shifted tremendously is also very evident to you as you walk towards the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing that catches your attention is your eyes.  They are a brilliant jade and so captivating that you were mesmerized by your own gaze.  Next came your face with its flawless, porcelain skin and luscious lips.  Your facial features were sleek with your distinctly Asian heritage but softened by your Western lineage for breathtaking beauty.  Gradually you survey the rest of 'your body'.  Silk-like black hair fell just below your waist, you could tell by turning around to see.  That was when you noticed your shapely rear even in the grey sweatpants you were wearing.  The waist itself was pulled up and folded over in that way girls do when wearing incredibly comfortable boys clothing.  Jade eyes followed the skinny waistline of the sweatpants back to the front when your vision was obscured by two large, firm breasts.  You could feel your cheeks starting to get hot from embarrassment as you realized that there were two very stiff protrusions peaking out from underneath the white tank top doing its beast to keep you modest.  You avert your eyes to keep you from getting more embarrassed by looking at yourself in the mirror again.  Exposed navel greeted your eyes this time.  Firm, six pack abs that were softened by a thin layer of body fat to keep it feminine looking. <i>'God, everything about this girl <b>is</b> hot!'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crazy, isn't it?\"  Maria said, tearing your eyes away from the mirror that you became infatuated with.  You glance over at Maria to find her leaning against the wall with her arms crossed.  \"Waking up in some other girl's body.\"  You stare at her blankly for a moment.  \"Other girl's..?\"  Maria nodded at your statement.  \"One minute you are enjoying a girl's chat with Rosa and the next minute you wake up in some other girl's body.\"  That was when you realized that Maria must have been a girl put in another girl's body.  Would she find it weird that you swapped from one to another?  Maybe she'd think you were a pervert.  You decided it would be best not to tell her.  \"Yeah, really weird...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria gave you a gentle smile before walking next to you.  \"Well don't worry about it too much.  You've got me to help acclimate you.\"  She placed a hand on your shoulder, looking up to you.  \"I'm an honors student like you and on your volleyball team.  Though it looks like you'll be our star player!\"  You respond with a weak smile because you don't quite have this whole situation figured out.  Maria removes her hand and places both of her hands on her hips in a sassy manner.  \"So does our star player have a name?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I'm Alexis, Alexis Lee.\"  You say to Maria.  That was the name you were given by Rosa at least.  You couldn't help but feel a little unsettled using this name for the first time.  A whole new name to fit a whole new body for a whole new identity.  The thought rattled you to the core.  Was this process reversible or were you stuck as Alexis forever?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alexis?\"  Maria replied to your name with a hint of jealousy.  \"Aw, that means you get the cute nickname Lexi!\"  She was visibly pouting at this point.  You had never thought of that.  Lexi was a great nickname now that you thought about it.  Sophisticated yet sassy.  A smile you couldn't suppress comes across you face.  \"Well you should have chosen better, shouldn't you?\"  You say as instinctively move to cross your arms across your chest but quickly realize adjust your arms to be crossed underneath your large chest, lest you try and crush them to keep them folded.  That was going to be a strange habit to get into.  Fortunately Maria didn't notice your awkwardness because her mouth was open in shock at what you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bitch!\"  Maria said to you playfully as she smacked your butt that caused you to let out a yelp before moving past you.  \"Now get dressed so I can show you a tour of campus.\"  Maria walked over to a closet next to her bed, taking her shirt off while she walked.  Your eyes follow her as she walks into her closet to get changed herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Wait, get dressed?!'</i>  You think to yourself.  What did you know about female fashion?  All you really knew is what you liked seeing them in; revealing clothing.  Unless slutastic was fashionable here, which you weren't even sure you could pull off, you had no idea what you were going to do.  <i>'Its okay, maybe it'll come to me when I open the closet.'</i>  You open the closet and the first thing you see in front of you was a rack of all white blouses.  Just below the blouses were a number of plaid skirts whose primary color was emerald green with the off color appearing to be a really dark color of blue, really dark.  Perhaps they were navy blue?  On either side of this rack was an assortment of matching apparel that.  To the left were navy blue blazers with an emblem on the chest that must be the school coat of arms.  To the right were several long sleeve sweaters, a few sweater vests, and ties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that makes things easy...\"  You mutter to yourself when you hear Maria say.  \"I know, right?\"  She walks up behind you wearing her white blouse and was halfway done working on her tie.  \"These uniforms are dreadful, but at least we get weekends to wear whatever we want.\"  That was when Maria pointed to the left and right sides of the closet where your 'casual clothes' were located.  \"Though switching to a new body makes picking your attire a challenge at first.  I mean, going from knowing whether or not you've got a big ass make a world of difference in the entire ensemble!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"No kidding...\"  You say as you survey your body once more.  \"You know what?  Now might be the perfect time to find out!\"  You say as you look over to Maria with a smile as she finished tying her tie.  \"Care to play a little dress up?\"  You raise a questioning eyebrow as you give your roommate a playful smile.  She glances down at her watch before gazing back up at you.  \"Oh you are such a bad influence on me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria looked your body up and down before turning her gaze towards the closet.  Next thing you knew, she darted inside your closet and pulled out three different tops.  \"Which one of these do you like?\"  She asks as she holds up a red, low cut v-neck, one of those frilly tops that girls wear over tops that makes them look pregnant, and a teal tube top.  You imagine yourself in these clothes and how sexy you'd look wearing them.  That was when a dreadful thought crept into your mind.  How many other guys would be staring at you creepily while you wore them?  That was something you did <b>not</b> want to even be aware of, let alone deal with.  Maybe the pregnant top wasn't such a bad idea after all.  \"Or you could always go with the one piece black dress.\"  Maria said, sensing your uneasiness at the choices before you.  You look over to the one piece dress and your eyes immediately lighten up.  The black dress was sleek, stylish, and conservative.  Maria could see the look of approval on your face.  \"I bet you're a tease, aren't you?\"  She joked as she threw down the tops she picked out.  \"Well don't just stand there, try it on!\"  She exclaimed as she dove into the closet to find clothing of similar tastes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug and pull your tank top over your head and throw it to the ground with the rest of the tops.  The sweatpants quickly follow.  Maria glanced over and saw you standing next to her in nothing but lacy boy shorts and did a double take.  \"Wow,\"  She said as she stood up and placed on hand on her hip.  \"I must admit, I'm jealous.  And its good to know my teammate has no problem exposing herself.\"  You stick your tongue out at her as you throw the dress on over your head.  The dress naturally became stuck on your chest and you hand to assist sliding it down the rest of your body.  The dress was so tight that it was form fitting and you had a feeling it was mean to be this way.  \"Double wow!\"  Maria said as she looked you over.  \"Now go put on some nylons while I pick out your shoes!\"  She seemed to be having far more fun with this than you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of searching you find a pair of black nylons and put your left foot through the nylon stocking.  Slowly you draw the stocking up your leg.  This is the first time you've examined your legs closely and it was thrilling.  You had very long legs that were toned from years of playing sports (you assumed).  The feel of your soft, smooth skin was tantalizing and even more exciting the second time through with your right leg.  You can't help but believe you've got the most perfect set of legs you have ever seen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready?\"  Maria asked as she held up a pair of 3 inch heels.  The shoes were primarily made of black straps that you wrapped around your feet once you put them on.  You shake your head with a smile as you done your new footwear.  If you thought you were tall at 6'2, you hardly imagined what life at 6'5 was going to be like.  Though it was difficult to wear the shoes at first.  You had to get used to walking in heels.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Now that is H-O-T-T, hot!\"  Your roommate Maria said as she licked her index finger to touch her ass that she stuck out for your viewing pleasure.  She made a sizzling sound like water boiling on a hot frying pan.  You can't help but grin at her remark.  \"Come on, I want to see the full package!\"  She said while twirling her finger around.  You respond by doing a twirl for her.  \"Honey, you have nothing to worry about when it comes to fashion.  If you can wear it, you can pull it off.  Heck, you'd be able to pull off things you can't wear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when a high pitched beeping came from Maria's silver wristwatch.  \"Oh crap!\"  She exclaimed as she looked at her watch in disbelief.  \"Look at the time, we've gotta go!\"  The tiny, by your standards, Puerto Rican girl grabbed your wrist and pulled you with surprising strength.  \"Go, go where?!\"  You protest as you are pulled out of the room.  \"What about my uniform?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing dragged out into the hallway, you catch a glimpse of a room door to your immediate left.  On the door was what looked like computer paper inside of a plastic sheet protector with two names on it.  You don't have time to read it because you are being pulled along by your roommate but you are fairly certain they were female names due to the pink ink and stars for dots you see on the paper.  Directly in front of you was what looked like an open bathroom.  There was a massive mirror on the one side with four sinks, tile floor, and shower stalls on the right hand side.  Across from you was a similar door that was open as well.  The door opened up to another door that also had a pair of names on it.  You realize you are probably living in a quad, four rooms and a bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was little time to dwell on that thought.  Maria quickly pulled you to the right with ease and then to the left in an open hallway.  She was directing you with ease because you were unbalanced by the heels you were unaccustomed to wearing.  You decided it was best to follow instead of risking a catastrophic collision that would be mainly embarrassing.  \"Where are we going?\"  You pressed Maria again as she dragged you past several quads on either side of the hallway.  \"I've got to take you to see the academic councilor, its part of the acclimation process!\"  She responded as the hallway opened up into a lounge.  There were numerous tables and comfy looking pieces of furniture laying around in no particular order.  That lounge turned into a main lobby with a desk that was being staffed by two women who appeared to be in their early also girls wearing uniforms.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Resident Advisers, students who live with us, settle disputes, and enforce the regs.\"  Maria said as she walked up to a pair of glass doors with metal frames.  The glass looked thick enough to be bulletproof and the doors had a large bolt lock that automatically unlocked when motion sensors detected Maria and you passing under them.  Fortunately for Maria, unfortunately for people like you trying to keep up with her, the door could be pushed open from the inside (Though the weight of the door did seem to slow her down momentarily).  \"Real pain in the rear.\"  Maria said cheekishly as soon as the door closed behind her with a wicked grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing back you see the residential hall you are coming out of was about four stories high.  It was built out of brick with a concrete foundation.  The top of the building had a wooden roof that came to a point similar to architectural designs of colonial south.  It even looked like it had a bell tower at the top.  Meanwhile a wrought iron fence guided people down the steps from the main lobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Steps?!'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was by the grace of God and you leaning on your roommate that you didn't trip down the five concrete stairs and crack open your skull or killing your roommate.  You had little time to recover as Maria shows her gratitude by guiding you to the far less imposing one story building.  Inside the building was a computer bank, another common area for study or waiting, what looked like a receptionist window, and several offices.  \"Great, we made it!\"  Maria said as she finally lets go of your hand.  \"I've got to check in at the counter, your counselor's office is right there.\"  She said as she pointed to a door before heading over to the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you have time to yourself to think you begin to worry as you approach the door.  Who was your counselor and what were they going to tell you?  Would the know who you are or what you are?  What about you not being in uniform, will they be as bad or worse than what Maria said about the Residential Advisers?</span></div></div>",

You place your hand on the silver doorknob to open it up.  <i>'Here goes nothing...'</i>  You think to yourself as you twist the knob and pull the door open.  You are shocked at what you see in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting behind a rather large, wrap around desk made of oak was none other than Rosa typing on a computer.  Your mouth drops open as you raise a accusation finger at the woman.  \"Y-You!\"  You exclaim in a higher pitched voice than you anticipated.  The woman stops typing and looks up at you with a pleasant smile.  \"Ah, Alexis,\"  She began to say as she stands up and gestures to a chair in front of her desk while heading towards a filing cabinet.  \"Please, have a seat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk inside the office and close the door behind you.  This was a conversation best left private you think as you walk to the chair that Rosa gestured to.  \"So how are things going so far?\"  The woman asks you excitedly as she pulls out a file from the cabinet and walked over to her desk.  \"Well its definitely been an experience, that is for sure.\"  You say to Rosa in an uncertain voice while she takes a seat in her chair and begins looking over her file.  \"I bet it is, you are our first successful TG!\"  She replied gleefully, causing you to raise an eyebrow at her.  \"Successful, TG?  Are you seriously telling me you've never done this before!\"  You practically shout at the woman who seems to be unphased by your reaction.  \"Oh heavens no, that would be irresponsible of us.\"  Rosa laughed while putting your file down on the desk.  \"We've done it plenty of times.  Yours is the first to be successful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a minute all you can do is sit back in shock at what Rosa is telling you.  \"We were able to make it work by adding hints of your DNA into the mix.  That of course means there are some things that aren't exactly like we had planned with your body but that should be nothing to worry about.\"  You knew this was going to be an experimental procedure but you never realized to what liberty they were going to take with your body up until this point.  What if things had gone wrong, what if you died during the whole thing?  \"Among other things your body is producing a large amount of testosterone as well as estrogen.  This normally causes problems but we've used our technology to block majority of the ill effects.  Though I do suspect you'll have far better understand of geo-spatial relations than women due to this and more than likely will be far stronger than a woman of your size.\"  You automatically give Rosa  threatening look when she referenced your size, as if implying she shouldn't insult your figure.  \"And here I can see the estrogen taking its affect on your thought process.  Your vocabulary should unexpectedly expand, as will your communication skills, concerns for others, and near sighted perception.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Estrogen affecting my vocabulary and behavior.  That explains the words slutastic and ensemble.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, so what does this all mean for me?  Am I going to be stuck like this forever or am I going to have to try and go public with this information?\"  You threaten as you cross both of your arms and give Rosa a stern look.  She shakes her head at you.  \"It means that if you don't acclimate to the University that you will soon find yourself a guinea pig for far more sinister experiments as per our agreement.\"  If your eyes could throw knives at someone, they would have been throwing daggers at Rosa by this point.  \"You wouldn't.\"  You reply to Rosa's remark.  You are hoping to on high that she is bluffing.  \"I will if you don't cooperate missy.\"  That title definitely did not sit well with you.  \"Besides, why would you want to?  This body is clearly an upgrade from the one you previously had and we've got a bright future laid out for you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise an eyebrow at Rosa.  \"What do you mean, bright future?\"  The idea of bright future could mean several things at this point and very few of them were probably in your favor.  \"You did see the curriculum you signed up for, didn't you?\"  Rosa asks as she turns the folder towards you to show you.  It says history and engineering physics.  \"Yeah, what about it?\"  You say to her.  \"Those are nothing special.\"  A condescending smile now appears on Rosa's face.  \"Child, those are two of the most advanced studies we have here at King University.  The subject of history is not just the study of history, but using space-time devices to correct or alter history.  It is a very delicate and paradoxical burden that requires incredible amount of care and thought.\"  She slides designs for what appears to be two wrist devices.  \"And engineering physics is applying scientific theory into practical use, all scientific theory.  Like these devices that will be accompanying you on your journey through space and time.\"</span></div></div>",

You'd deal with the issues of that entire scenario later.  \"You're absolutely right,\"  Rosa said with a bemused look on her face.  While she says that she folds her hands together and props her elbows up on her desk to rest her chin upon.  \"There is no possible way that you are sitting here in front of me in a young, athletic woman's body.\"  Rosa looks at you victoriously as she awaits your response.  You open your mouth and raise a finger to make a point but you are rendered speechless by her argument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa's lip twitched into a victorious smile as she sat back to look down at your file.  \"Your psychological profile says that you have an alpha personality and all the faculties necessary to excel in everything you do.  Or at least you think you do in any case.  This explains your defiant and belligerent behavior.  You clearly abhor the idea of not being in control of your own fate and most certainly will at some point try to create a way to out maneuver, out think, or overcome the University.\"  She looks up at to gauge your response but you simply sit there in silence with a scowl upon your face.  She was right in every regard but you weren't about to tip your hand.  \"But the fact of the matter remains that you have yet to do so and I suggest you play along.  You'll soon discover that working with the University will be far more beneficial than it is to work against us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look away and sigh.  \"So what is it you expect me to do?\"  \"Simple,\"  Rosa began to say as she pulled out a schedule from your file.  \"I expect you to play your part as Alexis Lee without telling anyone you are special.  Go to your assigned classes, participate in sports, and do what you do best; excel.  Who knows, maybe if you act like you want to be here you will actually find yourself making friends and having fun.\"  You take the schedule from Rosa's hand but have a burning question in your mind.  \"What is the point of me participating in sports or even this University even having a sports program?\"  The whole idea of sports in King's University seemed to be ridiculous and somewhat immoral.  What would be the point of a sports program in a place where they give you a new body that the corporation creates for you?  \"You mean besides it being a way of maintaining a level of normalcy for students to participate in for stress relief, entertainment, and physical fitness?\"  She asks you, which you respond unpoetically with.  \"Uh, yeah.\"  She chuckled at your naivety.  \"Because it is a great way to generate revenue to fund this place.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 'Counselor' grabbed your file and headed towards the cabinet in her office.  \"Now unless you have any more questions I suggest you be on your way.  Don't want the RAs to catch you out of uniform now do you?\"  Rosa says while she files your folder into its proper place.  \"The RAs?\"  You ask Rosa, confused by her remark.  \"Yes, they have the authority of the University.\"  She says while walking over to desk with a smile on her face.  \"That means that if you are caught breaking the rules they have the authority of the University to exact punishment on you.  That usually comes in the form of being volunteered for one of their experiments.\"  The statement hung in the air as Rosa dropped that bomb on you.  \"Ta-ta!\"</span></div></div>",

I mean, being a history major alone is huge.  I know girls who would kill for that major.  Its so selective that only one class exists in the University!\"  You raise an eyebrow at your roommate, suspicious of her enthusiasm.  \"Is that supposed to make me feel better?\"  You say bitterly as you make your way towards Smith's Annex.  You were too focused on the fact that you were being blackmailed into this 'selective' major.  Though it might not be considered blackmail due to the fact that you did sign your life away.  Your mistake, but it didn't mean you had to like it.    \"Ch'ya!\"  The Puerto Rican girl responded as she caught up to walk next to you.  \"Do you not realize what you get to do with this major?  You basically can explore the universe unhindered.  You can literally meet Prince Charming.\"  You roll your eyes at that remark with a smirk on your face.  If nothing, your roommate was good at making you feel better.  Even if you didn't want to admit it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking up the concrete steps, you come to the front door and reach out for the door handle.  You hear the very audible bolt switching from the locked position to the unlocked position.  \"How the heck does it know anyways?\"  You turn to Maria and ask while you place your hand on the door handle.  \"Facial recognition program.\"  She says as she points up to a camera at the top of the door.  \"That is just creepy...Jeeze, what is this door made out of?\"  You complain as you struggle with opening the heavy door.  The inanimate object was unexpectedly heavy even after you saw it kick Maria's butt earlier.  \"I know, right?  Its a workout just to open it up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the door finally opens up, you and your roommate cross the threshold into Smith's Annex.  Behind the counter are two different Residential Advisers or RAs.  One of them, an attractive looking black girl who has her hair pulled into a ponytail looks up at you.  \"Excuse me,\"  She says loudly as she stands up and moves to head you and Maria off.  \"Just who are you and where do you think your going wearing that?\"  The girl says accusingly while placing her hands on her hips.  You can't help but find it humorous that a girl who doesn't even come up to your chest is attempting to threaten you.  \"I'm Maria and this is my roommate Alexis.\"  The Puerto Rican girl says before you have the chance to say anything.  \"I know she is out of uniform but she just arrived today and is getting settled in.  In fact, she just saw her counselor.\"  The RA looked up at you scrupulously before looking back at Maria.  \"Please let it go just this one time!\"  Maria pleaded with the girl.</span></div></div>",

Immediately you feel yourself falling to the ground.  Your instincts are to reach out and brace yourself before you impact but your arms and legs don't respond.  They are locked out, paralyzed, by whatever that blue light was behind you.  Unfortunately your senses were paralyzed too, otherwise you might have been spared the pain of smacking your face against the tile floor.  You'd wince in pain but even your throat is prevented from moving.  The only control you really had was the ability to move your eyes, and with your face against the ground, about the best you could do was see the second RA you didn't pay any attention to earlier.  She was lowering a device that looked like one of the price guns used in retailing stores.  She must have used that to paralyze you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do that for?!\"  You could hear Maria exclaim in fright as a shadow looms over you.  You look up to see the black RA kneeling down next to you.  Well, really all you could see was her shoes, white socks, smooth legs, and up her skirt because of the way she was kneeling next to you.  Navy blue panties.  <i>'Probably to go with the school colors'</i>  You thought smugly to yourself.  \"You said it yourself,\"  The black RA said over you.  \"We've got ourselves a first timer here.  Don't want her trying anything stupid now do we?\"  There was a hint of sadistic pleasure in her voice.  A moment later you feel her cold hand across your neck as she pulls your hair back.  A moment later a syringe is stuck in your neck and you feel a cold sensation running throughout your body as the serum was being injected into your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That should do it.\"  The RA said as she removed the needle from your neck.  You see her stand up and start walking behind you to where the second RA is.  You hear the girl flip a switch, point the gun at you, and fire a bright pink beam at you this time.  You can feel the control you are regaining over your limbs and slowly start moving to a sitting up position.  Maria kneels down next to you to help you up.  \"W-What did you do to me?\"  You say meekly as you are still trying to shake off the paralysis.</span></div></div>",

Meanwhile you can't help but become infuriated with how nonchalant she was being about the whole situation.  \"What the hell is that supposed to mean?\"  You demand from the girl.  She was now busy ignoring you by zipping up the case and securing it behind the front desk.  \"Exactly as it sounds, it is supposed to reduce your size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou manage to rise to your feet using your growing anger as a source of new found strength.  \"What do you mean reduce my size?  Like all of me, permanently?!\"  You couldn't help your raising voice.  It was enough to warrant a threatening look from the black RA while the other RA flicked a switch on her device before raising it against you.  A slight sense of dread came over you as you saw that device aimed at you but it paled in comparison to your fury.  This girl was getting the brunt of all the pent up rage you had for Rosa but were too afraid to express because of the ramifications.  \"You really expect me to sit here and take this?!\"  Your questioned lingered in the air, waiting to be answered, and it was the black RA who would give you that answer.  She placed her hand over the device and forced her associate to lower the gun before taking several steps towards you.  \"I expect you to accept your punishment for breaking the rules like an adult.  It is the only way you will ever learn from your mistakes and respect the rules.\"  She was now standing a foot away from you.  \"Especially for someone in <i>your</i> position.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but give the RA a shocked but bewildered look.  \"What do you mean, <i>my</i> position?\"  Your words seeped with venom, challenging the RA to expose who you really are in front of Maria.  You've only known her for about half an hour but you were sure that she was going to be your bedrock in this institution.  She was the only kind person you met thus far and you really didn't want to explain to her that you used to be a guy right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone set to be the next generation of RAs.\"  The RA responded, granting you at least a sigh of relief.  \"You should know better.\"  She pointed at you to emphasize her remark.  You couldn't help but give the RA a look of defeat.  Looking at things from her point of view, she was completely right.  <i>'Wait, since when did I ever give a damn about what other people think?  Oh yeah...'</i>  That thought only compounded the amount of self loathing you had for yourself right now and it must have been apparent on your face because of what the RA said next.  \"Come back in an hour,\"  You looked up, or actually down, at her with a confused expression.  \"I'll examine the effect it has had on you and give you the counter-serum.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilently you nod at the RA.  \"Right, experimental.\"  You said in a defeated voice before turning around and heading towards the room.  Maria looked like she wanted to say something but one look from you silenced her.  So she quietly followed behind you, giving you the space you needed to let everything sink in at once.  You used to be the average Joe but now you've somehow been transformed into a girl.  Grant, you are a ridiculously hot girl, but that doesn't ease your mind at how permanent the situation is.  Then you were blackmailed by the corporate thug Rosa into compliance while being forced to take some bizzaro classes.  She has enforcers dressed up in Catholic school girl outfits hellbent on ensuring you are too among other school rules, lest they turn you into their personal pin cushions.  And to top it all off, they know exactly how to give you a guilt trip while doing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing you do when you walk into the room is kick off your heels and dive straight onto your bed.  Maria closes the door behind her while you wrap your arms around your pillow.  \"I hate my life...\"  You say before bury your head in a pillow.</span></div></div>",

She walks over to 'your' bed to sit down next to you.  \"You are just having a rough start.  We all go through it.\"  You can fell her lay her hand upon your back to comfort you.  Unfortuanately the last thing you wanted to be was comforted.  \"You don't understand,\"  You snap back at her before pressing the pillow against your body even tighter.  \"I didn't ask for any of this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a frustrated sigh as you throw your head into the pillow wishing for everything to just go away.  You are particularly upset with the way you were behaving.  Ever since you became a girl you began to act like one.  Irrational thoughts dictated by emotion, not logic, filled your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate this body!\"  You say, popping your head up momentarily to look at Maria was gesturing to all of your body before burying your face once more into the pillow.  \"Come on now, you don't mean that.\"  Maria says as she starts lightly caressing your back.  \"Girls would kill to have your body.  You've just gotta get used to it.\"  You scoff at the idea.  \"Get used to a freakishly tall body that has hit the gym one too many times, no thank you.  Go ahead and let them have this body!\"  You knew you were being mellodramatic at this point and you hated yourself all the more for it.  But Maria seemed to be right on cue and well experienced with this kind of emotional trauma.  She immediately responded by teasing you to downplay your problems.  \"Well you won't be freakishly tall for long from what I'm told.\"  You can't help but laugh at Maria's remark despite the horrid truth of the matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, you begin to feel a chilling sensation start coursing through your body.  It was almost as if you could feel the venemous serum start working on every fiber in your body while it spread.  You weren't sure how long you had but you knew it was starting to take effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not funny,\"  You say to Maria as you prop yourself up with your elbow to look at her.  She still had her hand on your shoulder and was looking at you with a warm smile and compassionate eyes.  \"Then why are you laughing?\"  You shake your head at Maria as you try to force back a smile, several loose strands of your hair falling in front of your face.  \"I must look like I mess.\"  You say as you put both of your hands on your face to brush away all the hair and what threatened to be tears.  \"I think you look beatufiul.\"  Maria says, shocking you so much that all you can do is stare at her while blinking away your watery eyes.  You weren't sure what to think of what she was saying while she was caressing you so affectionately and tenderly.  \"R-really?\"  You ask in a chocked voice.  Maria leans in close to you where your face barely inches away.  \"Really.\"  She says with a sultry voice as she looks at you with her soft, brown eyes.  You hesitate as your green eyes searches hers, uncertain of what Maria intends.  She moves slowly to lean in and kiss you, affording you the opportunity to remove yourself from the situation if you want.  In this moment you realize that she was the closest thing to a friend out here in this strange new world and you wanted to be with her.  No, you <i>needed</i> to be with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrembling, you lean in to kiss Maria back.  Your kiss was unsure at first but soon becomes empassioned as Maria affectionately kisses you back.  She starts to press against you to force you onto your back while she straddles your hips.  Meanwhile she interlocks both of her hands with yours and pin them above your head while she passionately kisses you.  You feel yourself getting lost in the moment as Maria starts gyrating her hips against hers and you even let a slight gasp escape from your lips as she does so skillfully.  It is hard to describe how excited you were getting.  Suddenly your entire body felt like it was on fire.  Your cheeks were flushed, your nipples hard and sensitive, and even thought Maria wasn't grinding up against it, yet, you could feel yourself getting stimulated and wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately the terrible serum sensation remained.  You felt a sinking feeling in your gutt and you couldn't help but notice the tight clothes loosen while Maria seemed to be getting heavier...</span></div></div>",

I don't know if it's too painful to speak, or their humanity is absorbed by their animal nature... But that could be you, if you protest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gesture that you want to leave, \"I hope she's lost her humanity.\" Maria adds. \"I've heard the stable hands talking.

You thank her and open it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis -you- have a variety of clothing. There are several dresses and skirts, but also a slightly lower number of pants and shorts, in addition to various types of shirts. \u201cUh, a little help?\u201d you ask weakly. Maria walks over to you, smiling gently. You open the underwear drawer, and are relieved to find that the vast majority of your underwear is simple and plain, and select a plain white bra and matching panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou strip naked and put your clothes in the hamper that Maria points out. You catch another glimpse of yourself in the mirror, but turn away, deliberately not thinking about how very attractive your new body is, and ignoring Maria\u2019s grin. You get dressed, starting with the panties. The bra is a bit weird at first but you manage once Maria tells you what to do, likely the muscle memory she mentioned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria starts looking through your closet, occasionally pausing to look at something. After a couple minutes Maria brings out two dresses, one shin-length and brick-red with no sleeves, and one thigh-length and sea-blue with short sleeves. Both, fortunately, are fairly modest, and you select the blue one. You put the dress on relatively simply, treating it as an extra-long shirt. Maria then advises you to add shorts under the dress, which you are happy to do with black jean shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, you look great!\u201d Maria says once you\u2019re done, grinning widely. \u201cSuper hot. I bet you\u2019d look great in anything. You won\u2019t have any problem getting a girlfriend.\u201d You smile sheepishly, and she chuckles and calms down. She gestures at a makeup kit on a table near her bed. \u201cYou want some?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d you say firmly, then think of something and switch to a more \u2018in-character\u2019 response. \u201cI mean, er, I don\u2019t ever use makeup.\u201d Indeed, there is no such kit on your side of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria nods. \u201cHeels?\u201d You shake your head, taking a pair of sneakers from your wardrobe, and she shrugs, looking at your wardrobe and seeing only flat shoes (just the sneakers and a pair of formal flats). \u201cWell, it\u2019s not like <i>you</i> need to be taller.\u201d You smirk at that. You\u2019re a lot taller now than you were before, and you like that much, at least. You put the sneakers on while Maria puts her own shoes on. She is wearing low heels, but even with them she is still shorter than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria takes your hand and leads you back into the hallway and towards the stairwell. The two of you head down the stairwell to the ground floor (your room is located on the third floor) and exit into a wide-open lobby. Several girls are here, relaxing, reading, or talking with each other. Maria waves to them as you pass by but does not stop, instead leading you out the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Alexis, shall I start the tour?\u201d</span></div></div>",

You walk down the corridor, and arrive in a stainless steel room, in the middle of which lies some machine with two seats on it.

Maybe they need to have consistancy. But now's not the time to ask why. Now, Rosa and her clone leave and two old, bald professors step in. Something like out of those horror movies with mad scientists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of them rapidly keys commands to the computer-thingy and the other one is busy messing about with the machine-thingy. Now's the time. Now they carry out their evil plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly seem to lose all feeling, a kind of nothingness. You can't move, you can't feel. Not just darkness. At least darkness it something. Nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, you feel something rush by. The wire! You're in the wire!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, nothing again. Suddenly, feeling rushes back into you. Only... Different. You regain vision, and see yourself sitting next to you. You sense something on your chest, something missing on your crotch. Now, the mad scientists have left the room and Rosa's familiar face stands in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou evidently have been released from your paralysis. You reach down and feel... Boobs? Now you reach inside your... Panties! And you feel an emptiness. Nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for participating! Here's your reward...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're in no conndition to accept the money Rosa gives you. You just grab it, and ask, \"Can I be swapped back now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! It says so here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, you seem to be able to understand. \"Process is valid only for one use, subsequently...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasp in shock.

The gender-switching experiment is tempting, but you trip over the word \"experiment\". An <i>experiment</i> that could <i>try</i> to change you back? It sounds risky, and you really don't want to make things any worse. So the mind-altering \"treatment\", as unnerving an idea as it is, seems like the most practical choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull the body-switching helmet off your head and stand up, wobbling a bit before getting your more top-heavy frame to stay upright. \"Tell me about this treatment,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The mental treatment?\" Rosa says. \"Yes, I believe that would be the best solution. You see, our focused biotic magnetiser can rearrange neural activity patterns to the optimal configuration for...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis isn't making any sense to you, so you tune out the incoming cascade of technobabble and focus instead on your new body, awkwardly shifting your weight in a vain effort to feel more comfortable. You slowly run your hands up your mildly hourglass-shaped figure. When you reach the lumps on your chest you can't help jiggling them a little and shuddering at the unfamiliar sensation they produce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start paying attention again just as Rosa finishes, \"...with the net effect of correcting the subconscious self-image to perfectly match the body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, okay,\" you say. \"But I'll still be, you know... myself, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Your memory and identity will be entirely intact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over at the girl in your old body (and the other Rosa - wait, are you still talking to the same one?). Her expression says it all; she's scared and has no idea what to do. Although it feels like you're looking in a mirror, you know that the face making that expression is no longer yours, and never will be again. Perhaps that hasn't really sunk in yet, but you'll have to accept it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's do it,\" you manage to make yourself say, turning back to Rosa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent!\" she says. \"Come this way, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find a pocket in the jeans you're now wearing and stuff your reward money inside, becoming very aware of the strange shape of your hips, before following Rosa. You walk the same way you always do, but it feels totally wrong with your new shape, and you have no idea how to fix that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa leads you to a room containing a reclining chair of the sort you'd see in a dentist's office, above which hangs a sinister bullet-shaped device you try not to identify as a death ray. On one side of the room is another futuristic computer. On the other side, embedded in the otherwise featureless wall, is a large mirror, which you use to familiarise yourself with your new face. You're pretty cute, so... that's something, you suppose?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only have a few seconds to admire yourself before an elderly scientist walks into the room. You're not sure if it's one of the same old men from before - you didn't get a good look at them, being paralysed and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One for mental adjustments, then?\" he asks, looking you up and down. \"Yes, you look like you need it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder what you were doing to elicit that comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what level of body comfort optimisation are you looking for?\" the scientist asks you. Your only response is to stare blankly at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's being asked here,\" Rosa says, \"Is how far you're willing to go with this. Running the machine at maximum efficiency will make you happier with your new body, but we understand you may dislike the idea of inducing total contentment this way, so you may opt for a less thorough setting if you wish.\"</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, a pair of plastic blocks emerge from under the chair on either side of you. They press themselves against the sides of your head until it's clamped firmly in place. You tremble, beginning to regret putting yourself at these people's mercy a second time, as you watch the overhead raygun-thingy position itself above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe device begins to emit a humming sound, and you feel a tingling sensation that starts in your head and spreads throughout your body. This is followed by a feeling of calm that prompts you to close your eyes and relax. For a minute, you cease to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the humming stops, the plastic clamps release you, and you snap back to reality. You hurriedly leap out of the chair in a motion far more swift and fluid than you were previously capable of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's it!\" Rosa cheerfully states. \"How do you feel now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, okay, I guess...\" you unthinkingly reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!\" Rosa says, turning to leave the room. You begin to follow her, but stop to consider the meaning of what you just said. You no longer feel at all uncomfortable or out of place in this body. Being a woman suddenly seems entirely natural and intuitive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over at the scientist and see that he's still busy doing something with the computer. Since nobody is looking, you poke at your breasts again just to marvel at how strange it doesn't feel. You know you didn't have these things until less than fifteen minutes ago, yet now you can barely imagine them not being there. You scratch your head, somehow unsurprised by the feeling of thin, smooth hair, trying unsuccessfully to resolve the dissonance between how you feel and what you know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou exit the room, barely realising that you're now walking with a feminine sway, to find your old body standing in the corridor alongside Rosa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You went through with it?\" your body asks. \"Are... are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I feel fine now,\" you say, your voice conveying amazement at what you're saying. \"It's almost like I've been this way my whole life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour former self stares at you skeptically. \"But you're still the same person?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" you breathe. \"Elliot Barnes, that's me... except that's not much of a girl's name. Am I supposed to use yours now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's suggested that you exchange forenames, yes,\" Rosa chimes in. \"Which would make you Jennifer Barnes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" you say, a little unnerved by how good that sounds to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new Elliot sighs uneasily. \"So you think I should go in there and...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's for the best,\" you tell him (it was hard enough to think of him as female before assigning him your old name).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hangs his head, looking ready to cry. \"I don't know what I'm going to do, but... here.\" He takes your cell phone and wallet out of his pockets and hands them to you. \"I put my number in your phone. Give me mine and I'll call you later... I guess we'll need each other's clothes and things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fumble around to find his possessions in your pockets and give them to him. The two of you fall silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if there's nothing else,\" Rosa says to you, \"Please allow me to show you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter one more concerned glance at Elliot, you follow her. As you walk, you stare at the list of names on your phone and sigh. Being a woman may not seem so bad now - in fact, you can't muster any real desire to be male again - but this is still going to have a hell of an impact on your life. How in the world are going to confront your friends an family and explain to them that yes, you're a girl now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach the front door of the building. \"Have a nice day!\" Rosa unhelpfully offers as you step out onto the street. Now what are you going to do?</span></div></div>",

You figure that the only half-way normal study they're conducting is the brain imaging one.  Even if the pay is a lot lower, at least nothing freaky is supposed to happen to you in that one.  Thus, you walk back up to Rosa's desk and state your intent.  She smiles her corporate smile and hands you the appropriate paperwork, which you promptly sign and return.  Once you've finished, Rosa leads you down gleaming white corridors to a small examination room.  There, a boxy-looking machine hangs from the ceiling.  You assume that to be the imaging device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, just so we're clear,\" you say, \"this machine doesn't do anything but take a picture, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa smiles.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a traditional photograph or X-ray, but the imaging process is entirely passive, yes.  You won't feel a thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're sure it's safe?  Totally safe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa then reaches over and strikes a few keys on the console keyboard, bringing up a multi-colored display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This one is mine,\" she says, pointing to the colored blobs.  \"See that red bit there?  That's the amygdale\u2014the coloring indicates that I was a little nervous at the time this was taken; just like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brings up several more images.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This one belongs to the company president\u2014Mr. King himself.  Those two belong to a pair of identical twins, college students just a couple of years older than you.  See how different their images are, despite the physical similarity in brain structure?   Truly fascinating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa continues to stare at the images for a moment, clearly quite interested in what look to you like unintelligible blobs of color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh,\" you say, \"What do you need all these for, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, the applications are endless!  These reference images have proven extraordinarily useful in expanding our understanding of human neurology.  Practical applications are still several years off at this point, but the potential this technology has demonstrated is already very exciting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reaches into one of the many unlabeled drawers that line the walls and produces a clipboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In fact,\" she says, \"I think I can get you a little extra compensation if you'll sign an extended use waiver.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An extended use waiver.  That will allow us to keep a copy of the image on file indefinitely.  Otherwise, medical privacy laws dictate that, as we are a research lab and not a medical care facility, we'll have to dispose of the stored images after three years. Since many of our projects are rather long term, it helps to have a consistent set of reference images that we can use for the entire project rather than having to recompile all our data every three years.  In either case, we are required to notify you in advance of any use of your image, and you will be invited to be present when it occurs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa hands you the clipboard, smiling expectantly.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The specialist instead turned to his commander.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like the newer models we commandeered from the casino and the brothel are already coming online.

About a third of the pile of bodies is getting up, pulling heavy wires from their necks in confusion.  They look like people, but did that guy say they were actually robots or something?

What's even odder is that the action reveals that the stark examination room has somehow disappeared, only to be replaced with some kind of laboratory.  Odder still, instead of just Rosa, there are nearly forty suddenly people crowded around you, all of them staring at you with eager anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's oddest of all, though, is that you're among them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the middle of the group, standing next to Rosa and several other people you've never met, is, well, you.

Tall, heavy bookshelves lined the walls while tables of every height from ankle to shoulder displayed various and exotic wares.

You'e not sure how to respond; he <i>sounds</i> like the proprietor, but he <i>looks</i> like a crazy homeless man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um\u2026 Do you work here?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do, Elliot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man waves his hand dismissively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel free to browse,\" he says.  \"I'm right in the middle of a little project in the back, but I'll be right with you when I've finished.  It shouldn't take me more than a couple of minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the unusual old man turned away and strode off between the shelves, eventually exiting through a narrow doorway marked 'Staff Only'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that was\u2026 weird,\" you mutter.  Shaking your head, you sigh and turn your attention back to the merchandise.  It really is an eclectic collection, and doesn't seem to be organized in any particular pattern.  A hand-carved wooden figurine sits atop a pile of musty books, which in turn rest against a wire-frame bin full of flashy videogames.  Elsewhere, other items are displayed just as haphazardly.  A fine silver pen, a delicate vial of black powder and a gothic-looking choker all sit proudly on a single table, as if it was only natural that they be displayed together.  On still another table, expensive-looking jewelry sits side-by side with an off-brand pack of gum; the effect is bewildering and overwhelming.  As you ponder where to start, a devilish thought strikes you\u2014with the doddering owner occupied in back\u2014and no apparent security\u2014it wouldn't be difficult to abscond with some of the merchandise\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The parting smile of the owner, the only thing niggling at the back of your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if it's gibberish, it'll look impressive on your shelves. An ornate book binding. But you still suspect it's more interesting than that. It's too expensive to be simply a joke. The pages themselves are gilt-edged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding a comfy chair, you settle down for a long read. Holding it to your nose, you riffle through the pages, inhaling the aroma of old books fill your nostrils. A stray glance, as you flick through it seems to show writing you can't recognise, let alone read. But the pages skim past, you can't be sure that it's not some blurring effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when you do open it properly, you're surprised to find you can read it. It's even written in modern english. From the title page, you see a selection of tales are listed inside. Picking one, you read it with great relish. It's the tale of a Princess, in a lofty tower, awaiting a political marriage to secure peace. It's surprisingly good, giving you the promised new perspective on her life. It feels incredibly authentic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe joy you got from the story encourages you to try another. This time, it's the story of a harem girl, who has to trade on her beauty to please her man... her owner, you realise with a shudder. Having to compete for his attention, and favours, she flaunts her body, taunting and teasing that as her only asset. It's incredibly sad, and again has that same insight that same ring of truth from it's narrator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlicking through you hunt for a different voice. For a male perspective on their history. You find the story of a sultan, who rules his court, city and country with wisdom. Constantly worried about courtly intrigues, and envious neighbours, it's a story of great uncertainty and intrigue. Always balancing on a knife edge, even his relief of the biddable and beddable Harem girls, have their own struggles and hierarchy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother tells the story of a simple peasant. Making her way through the world, she dresses and disguises herself to pass as a man. It's a cruel, heartless world with no real justice, and only the fear of violence the deterrent for actual violence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wave of tiredness washes over you, and you glance to the clock on the wall. You're surprised to find that several hours have passed, and you feel quite cosy and snug. The book is heavy and warm in your lap, almost pinning you in place. A yawn suprises you, and you settle back for a nap in your comfy chair. Eager to wake and read the next story, and the next, you allow your eyelids to fall, and your breathing to deepen and slow, in moments you're asleep.</span></div></div>",

You hear another glass glugging as it's poured from a jug into a different glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey tug it back into place, as you wonder about being too warm, as the women waiting on you worry about you dehydrating. You give them a tip of your head, deferring to their experience. Surely that knowledge will come with time. Listening carefully, you realise you understand their chattering conversation. At the same time, you know it's not English. You snort in amusement, you hadn't even realised it, but you instinctively understood Arabic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at your hands, you admire the rings there, another sign of your wealth. But other sensations intrude, first tickling the back of your mind like an itch you can't reach, before crashing over you like a tsunami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not a Sultan, this isn't your harem. You're a harem girl, safe and secure and free from any resposibility. Hell, of course you are, you aren't considered a person. You're property to be cared for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recall the pink painted nails that went with those rings. You catch your reflection in a metal mirror hanging from a tent pole. You're as gorgeous as the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/40/c8/8b/40c88be3713fea855c3f07ceb5b9b288.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/40/c8/8b/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the cascade of wrongness threatens to overwhelm you, a wave of calm washes through you. You are Ayesha, you are safe, you are protected, you are valuable, you are valued. The nightmare visions of living in the West, of a tortutous chimera of delusion. You relax into your sisters' caring hands, as you sink back to the cushions that make up your bed.</span></div></div>",

While the books and trinkets are interesting in a peculiar sort of way, ultimately you're here because you're bored.  What better balm for a group of bored teenagers than a brand new videogame?  And, you realize, since Kyle and Matthew aren't here, you're free to choose whichever you like without arguing about it!  Thus decided, you focus your attention on the display.  It's a small bin\u2014it contains only three games, none of which seem to have been produced well-known development studios.  Actually, upon closer examination you see that the games are all produced by the same obscure company, called 'Fantastic Realms Studios.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Unparalleled realism!\"</i> boasts the display.  <i>\"Immerse yourself in expansive, detailed  virtual worlds!  Interact with intelligent, lifelike characters!  Enjoy multi-player support for up to four players!

On the cover, a heavily armored knight faces off against a fearsome dragon beneath the game's title: \"Legends of the Shattered Empire.\"  \"<i>Play as one of over six hundred character classes!

While off-label generic games like this were typically cheaper than the big blockbusters, you only have\u2014 \u2026sixteen dollars and seventy three cents.  Ouch, even less than you'd feared.  Stepping carefully to avoid bumping into the closely stacked merchandise you make your way back up to the front where the elderly proprietor is hanging a freshly-painted sign over the counter.  After he hammers the last nail into place, he turns to you and smiles, gesturing elaborately at the elegant lettering which reads: 'Because I am a wizard.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" he beams, \"what do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou search frantically for a tactful reply.  What to say to a grown man who apparently thinks he's possessed of magical powers?  Honestly, you've suspected since you first saw his bathrobe that this guy may be more than a little senile\u2014or worse\u2014but you hardly want to say that, especially if it's true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's\u2026  nice,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I most certainly am not!\" huffs the old man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not nice?\" you ask nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  No, I'm not senile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a step back.  \"How did you know\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a flourish, the old man points to the still-wet sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um\u2026 right,\" you say.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I know you don't yet believe\u2014that doesn't matter.  I only mentioned it because you asked.  Well, that and perhaps a little excitement with the new sign\u2014but mostly because you asked.  I used to have a rather nice one, you know, with embossed gold lettering and all that.  I was really quite fond of it.  Quite an unfortunate affair what happened.   There were these luchadores, and\u2014ah, well, never mind.  It's a rather long story and I'm sure you have places to go.  Now, what can I help you with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuchadores?  As in masked Mexican wrestlers?  Whatever\u2014you decide to let it go.  The man's probably crazy anyway. Better to make your purchase and get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh, how much are those games?\" you ask, pointing to the bin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\" he says.  \"The Fantastic Realms pieces!  I just got those in today, from a brand new supplier.  They're absolutely state-of-the art\u2014perfectly realistic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, you mean like next-gen? These games?<i>Strike Team Six: Star Patrol Commandos</i> and the others?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's called <i>Strike Force IV: Space Marine Commandos,</i> and I assure you,\" says the old man,  \"these games are unlike anything you've seen before.  They're more like\u2014oh, what's the term\u2014they're like what you would call 'virtual reality.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Virtual reality?\" you ask, incredulous.  \"Are you serious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always,\" says the old man.  \"I'll tell you what\u2014buy the game, and if you're not completely satisfied that I've represented it honestly, you can come right back here for a full refund.  How does that sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be honest, that sounds pretty good.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the catch?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No catch.  If, after trying the game, you are in any way unsure as to whether it did indeed allow you to 'live the adventure,'  I'll give you back every penny\u2014why, I'll even let you keep the game!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that's certainly good enough for you.  You can take the game home, spend a few hours playing it with Kyle and Matthew, and then if\u2014when\u2014it doesn't live up to the hype, you can come get your money back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right,\" you say.  \"How much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sixteen seventy-three\" says the old man with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's weird; that's exactly how much I have.  How did you\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, the old man points again to the hand-lettered sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh\u2026 right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking your head, you hand over the money.  The old man smiles warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, then,\" he asks, \"Which one was it you wanted?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"This one,\" you say without hesitation, reaching out to grab <i>Legends of the Shattered Empire</i> from the shelf.  The other games had their own appeal, but RPGs had always been more your forte.  Plus, the promise of over six hundred character classes and such a vast world to explore is too good to pass up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe self-proclaimed wizard smiles in a knowing way, and nods kindly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That should be perfect for you, Elliot,\" he says, slipping the money into one pocket of his frayed bathrobe, \"Just make sure you read the instruction booklet before you start playing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thank him and exit the strange shop, prize in hand.  Although you still haven't made any significant progress on your goal of job-hunting, you decide to return home early.  The mental strain of speaking to a mind-reading old man has left you feeling fatigued, and you're eager to install and play the new game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExiting the shopping center, you curse under your breath as you realize that spending all of your money in 'Spells R Us' has left you with no cash for the bus ride home.  Fortunately, it's only a few miles from the mall to your house, so you decide to walk the rest of the distance.  Quickly growing bored of the repetitive scenery, you fish around for the game and unwrap it, casually tossing the plastic into a waste bin as you pass.  Popping the case open, you pull out the thin instruction booklet and begin to leaf through it as you walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first few pages are an overview of the world the RPG is set in, Telluris.  True to the game's name, the continent of Telluris was once a mighty empire that ruled justly over the known world.  With the death of the Emperor, however, the various noble families ruling the Empire's fiefdom broke off and began vying among themselves for power and, ultimately, the throne, paying no heed to the late Emperor's young son, legitimate heir to the Empire.  These wars have become more and more brutal, with some lords even enlisting the aid of the foul monsters that dwell outside the Empire's borders, and much of the once-bountiful land of Telluris has been reduced to a battle-scarred wasteland.  You, as the hero, take on the role of the leader of a group of knights and mercenaries loyal to the former Emperor, and now to his son.  It is your quest to unite the land of Telluris and restore it to its former glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing the overview is a listing of the classes available at the beginning of the game.  To start out, there are only eight basic choices, but as the player progresses, they will unlock more options, up to a maximum of the six hundred advertised on the game's case.  The first classes are standard fantasy fare.  Barbarian, Knight, Rogue, and Archer make up the weapon-based jobs, while Mage, Priest, Warlock, and Bard are available for the magically-inclined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe back of the instruction booklet is a page thick with small text warning the user to play only a certain amount, take breaks as necessary, and other standard fare for video games.  One item catches your eye as you scan the page.  A line notes that the game must be completed in a single playthrough, and if the hero dies, the player has the option to start over as a different class, but with some of the items or skills they obtained in their last try.  A game without a save option is unheard of in the modern day, but the system used seems interesting, so you're willing to accept it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you finish reading, skipping over the rest of the small print, you consider that the instruction booklet is very small for such a large amount of proclaimed content.  Also odd is the complete lack of any images, art, or explanations of the game's menus or HUD in the booklet.  Presumably, there will be some sort of tutorial when you start, but you have to wonder why the old man from the shop was so insistent you read the thin pamphlet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping the booklet back into its case and pocketing, you realize that you've reached your destination.  The sun is just setting as you enter through the back door and slip upstairs to your room.  You don't want to encounter your dad on the way there, and explain to him why you bought a computer game rather than making any progress on finding a job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door to your bedroom locks behind you with a reassuring click, and you slide off your jacket, throwing it on the bed before making your way to your desktop computer on the other side of the room.  Smiling in pleasant anticipation of playing a new RPG, you pop the disc out of the game's case and place it carefully into the disc tray before allowing it to slide back in.  Oddly, the game doesn't appear to need any installation, simply coming up with an autorun menu, then launching the program directly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome, Hero, to the shattered Empire!\" the bold golden text on the screen reads, then fades into a small menu.  Only one option, 'New Game', is available over a view of a rolling plain with a castle in the background, above which hovers the title of the game in the same bold, golden letters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, you are shocked by the quality of the graphics.  The plain before you looks completely realistic, down to the individual waving blades of grass and the reflection of sunlight off a nearby stream.  Your computer is an earlier model, and shouldn't even be capable of rendering such a beautiful environment.  The gorgeous landscape, with its towering mountains in the distance and roiling clouds, is a stark contrast to the rather blocky polygons featured on the front of the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost in a trance, you click on the 'New Game' button, and the screen fades to black, before bringing up another menu.  This screen features a long, dungeon-like hallway with a pair of blazing torches on either side.  Just as with the sunlight, the fire looks incredibly realistic.  In the center is a box featuring the legend 'Choose your class!' with two options.  Just as the instruction booklet said, the starting jobs are separated into Physical and Magical options.  Which do you choose?</span></div></div>",

You click on the option and feel briefly dizzy as the image on the screen leaps down the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the movement stops, the image is no longer a hallway, but a cave tunnel, lit with much cruder torches. This image somehow seems even more realistic than the ones before it. You hear a slight breathing sound from your speakers, and briefly hear a faint growling. There is no sign of your character on the screen, but you can control the viewpoint by moving the mouse, and you figure this must be a first-person game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you return your viewpoint to its starting point, you are startled by a humanoid figure charging at you from the darkness. You flinch in surprise, and not knowing the controls, swipe and click the mouse on instinct. You feel something thud against your left arm, and in surprise, you swipe your arm to throw it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink. Then shake your head and look again. You\u2019re no longer sitting in a chair in front of a computer, but standing in the tunnel. The humanoid figure - a zombie - charges again, and this time you respond by throwing your right arm out. The axe held in your hand slams into the zombie\u2019s neck, and it collapses to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around, still seeing the same cave you\u2019d seen on the screen, except now you\u2019re physically there. You\u2019re holding an axe in your right hand and a round wooden shield in your left hand. What\u2019s more, something feels odd somehow, your body feels weird. You look down, and jump in surprise. Two large breasts are prominent on your chest, and you realize you feel their weight. It\u2019s not just that; your entire body is slender and feminine, although with a strong, athletic build. You\u2019re wearing leather armor that leaves your shoulders and upper breasts bare (save for shoulder straps), and has a knee-length skirt. You have reddish-blonde hair in a waist-length braid. Between your legs there is only emptiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear more footsteps behind you, and you turn to see another humanoid figure walking towards you. But this one is not a zombie. It\u2019s a woman in full plate armor (that is still form-fitting but covering), with short brown hair, carrying a sword and shield. She\u2019s fairly tall for a woman, but you\u2019re quite a bit taller than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve gotten all the zombies,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we should check the rest of the cave to be safe. What do you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill overwhelmed and off-balance from your change in location and in body, you can only stammer out a \u201cUh, okay?\u201d You wince slightly at the high, feminine sound of your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman looks concerned. \u201cAre you alright, Erika?\u201d she asks.</span></div></div>",

Clicking the option on the menu, you are met with a brief sense of vertigo as your perspective on the screen dives into the dank hallway behind the menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the movement stops, the image reforms into a view of a large and dimly lit cave, every bit as realistic as the scenes before it.  Strange symbols painted in black and red cover the walls, and the eerie effect is compounded by a rhythmic scratching and chittering coming from your speakers.  There's no sign of your character on the screen, but you find that you are able to move your perspective with the mouse, and swing around to get a better view of the cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chittering sound reaches a climax, and without warning, an ugly, green-skinned humanoid bounds out of the shadows and throws itself at you, fanged mouth flinging spittle.  Reacting on instinct, you take the brunt of the thing's force on your shield, following the motion with a quick upward stab that sends your sword piercing deep into its bony chest.  The thing wheezes and goes limp, thick green ichor oozing out of it to cover the blade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sudden rush of adrenaline wears off, you realize two things.  First is that you physically felt the impact of the creature hitting you, and the solid weight of the sword as you countered.  This leads to the revelation that you are no longer staring at a computer screen.  Gone is the mouse and keyboard, and in your hands are a hefty metal longsword and a shield made of the same material.  A clammy wind blows around you from some unseen depths of the cave, and, once again acting on instinct, you turn and cut down another goblin sneaking up behind you in the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe motion results in some momentum you aren't used to, and indeed your entire body feels strange and unwieldy.  Dreading what you'll see, you slowly look down.  A carefully crafted plate of steel armor covers your chest, and you immediately gain a new appreciation for the term <i>breastplate</i>.  The silhouettes of two respectably large breasts are clearly visible under the metal and, as you stare at them, you are keenly aware of their unfamiliar weight on your chest.  Though it is somewhat difficult to see over your new bosoms, you can also make out a slender waist, similarly armored, flaring into a crimson cloth skirt covering a set of curved, womanly hips.  Your arms, covered by gleaming gauntlets, are thin and feminine, and, despite your disoriented state, you idly wonder how such a frame can support the weight of a full set of plate armor, not to mention the steel sword and shield your hands are grasping with practiced ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour examination is cut short by a sudden renewal of the scratching and feverish muttering in the darkness around you, and you automatically drop into a defensive stance without realizing it.  The clamor is terminated by a meaty-sounding thump somewhere in the darkness, and a hulking human form looms out of the gloom.  Still cautious, you glare at the figure until it departs enough from the gloom that you can make out its features.  A bronze-skinned musclebound man wearing leather and furs approaches you, a crushed goblin clutched in one meaty fist and a broad smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was the last of them, boss,\" he says, letting the corpse slip from his hands and land with a wet thud on the floor behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boss?\" you manage, still overwhelmed and now shocked at the sound of your own feminine, almost lyrical voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other looks at you strangely, his sizable brow furrowing slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You feeling alright, boss?\" he asks with obvious concern, \"Little green bastards didn't cast some sort of spell on you, did they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this he cracks his knuckles menacingly, the popping sound echoing through the caverns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find yourself unable to produce any sort of reply.

Use with caution.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to the pen, the small vial of black powder bears the label 'Lust powder.'  \"Having trouble romantically?\" asks the card. \"Simply sprinkle this powder on yourself, and the next person you touch will suddenly find you absolutely irresistible! Use with caution.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, there sits the gothic-looking choker, labeled 'Collar of Mind Control.'  \"Tired of disobedient underlings?\" asks the card.  \"Just place this collar around someone's neck, and make them slave to your every whim! Use with caution.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn addition to a reiteration of the warning to \"use with caution,\" a small sign promises that all products will work as advertized or you will receive a full refund.  You're still skeptical, but the outlandish promises are just too enticing to ignore.  If they don't work, well, you'll just come get your money back.  If, on the other hand, they really are magical\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus decided, you turn your attention back to the display, faced with a difficult decision:   which item should you try?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If\u2014when\u2014this all turns out to be a hoax, it's the only one of the three that will actually be marginally useful, if only as an ordinary pen.  Thus decided, you grab the pen and walk up to the front of the store, where the elderly proprietor is hanging a freshly-painted sign over the counter.  After he hammers the last nail into place, he turns to you and smiles, gesturing elaborately at the elegant lettering which reads: 'Because I am a wizard.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" he beams, \"what do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou search frantically for a tactful reply.  What to say to a grown man in a bathrobe claiming to be a wizard?  You've suspected since you first saw his robe that this guy might be more than a little senile\u2014if not actively insane\u2014but you hardly want to say that, especially if it's true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's\u2026  nice,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I most certainly am not!\" huffs the old man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not nice?\" you ask nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  No, I'm not senile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a step back.  \"How did you know\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a flourish, the old man points to the still-wet sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um\u2026 right,\" you say.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I know you don't yet believe\u2014that doesn't matter.  I only mentioned it because you asked.  Well, that and perhaps a little excitement with the new sign\u2014but mostly because you asked.  I used to have a rather nice one, you know, with embossed gold lettering and all that.  I was really quite fond of it.  Quite an unfortunate affair what happened.   There were these luchadores, and\u2014ah, well, never mind.  It's a rather long story and I'm sure you have places to go.  Now, what can I help you with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuchadores?  As in masked Mexican wrestlers?  Whatever\u2014the man's probably crazy anyway. Better to make your purchase and get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh, how much for this pen?\" you ask, brandishing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\" he says.  \"The Historian's Pen! That's a very powerful artifact indeed.  I trust you read the label?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you realize that with this pen cannot write falsehoods?  That every sentence it produces is complete, irrefutable fact?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess,\" you say, blushing.  It sounds even sillier out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man looks at you appraisingly.  Finally, he nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well,\" he says.  \"You may have the pen for sixteen dollars and seventy-three cents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmptying your pocket, you are surprised to find that you have exactly that amount.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's weird, how did you know\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, the old man simply sighs wearily and points to the sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.  Right.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanding him the money, you pocket the pen and walk hurriedly out of the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce back out in the food court, you idly flip the pen over in your hand.  Where should you try to use the supposedly magical pen?  It is called the 'Historian's Pen,' so maybe you should use it in History class.  You've got an important test tomorrow, and a pen that won't let you make any mistakes would certainly be helpful. You also have a creative writing assignment due next week\u2014you weren't planning on starting it yet, but it would be a good chance to see if anything special happens when you try to write 'falsehoods.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, the label did say \"use caution.\"  Maybe you should test it a little before committing to anything large-scale, especially a work of fiction.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There's centaurs, vampires, fairies, and a woman made entirely of a translucent, blue, slime-like material.  You don't even look up from the paper as these new people start quietly going about their shopping.  You're even too focused on letting the creative juices flow remember the pen's magical effect that prevents it from writing falsehoods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause a moment after the introduction.  A magical setting is nice, but you can't have a story without any specific characters.  You tab the pen to your chin for a moment in thought.  Two options for a main character enter your mind:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllie - A thinly-veiled self-insert.  No one will notice if the main character is just a self-insert for a power fantasy if you just make it a busty swordmaiden version of yourself, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sexy, potion-brewing witch.  You're not sure on a name, yet.  That's always the trickiest part.  But hey, it's a solid idea for a magical and mysterious main character.</span></div></div>",

Ellie is one such adventurer, with flowing blonde hair and a sword as wide and heavy as one of her legs.  Though her frame doesn't show excessive muscle - at least not by adventurer standards - she wields the magic sword with ease, for it seems to weigh nothing in her grip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround now, you notice your view obscured by locks of blonde hair springing down in front of your eyes.  You pull at the strange hair, wincing when you find out that it seems to be connected to you.  Glancing down, you notice a pair of pert breasts pressing out against your leather armor.  Wait, armor?  You quickly take inventory of your new armor and sword.  You act in a natural shock and confusion prompting glances from the other passerbys in the food court.  What can only be described as a woman make entirely out of gelatin taps you on the shoulder, asking if you're okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what?\"  Your face freezes when you see her - such an inhuman visage leaves you stunned.  She taps you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey, miss.  Are you okay?  You seem to be freaking out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could I not be freaking out?  I'm a girl!  And you're... you're some kinda talking Jello!\"  The woman pouts, grumpy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, miss adventurer, of course you're a girl.  What's the problem?  Did you put on a girdle of femininity?  And I don't be appreciate being called Jello, by the way.  Is it that hard just to call me a slime?  Even a goo-girl?\"  You're humbled.  This alien woman seems to be acting as if everything is perfectly fine.  Then you look down to your paper - everything seems to be exactly as described there...  Not wanting to delay your response too long, you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um.  S-sorry.  I didn't mean anything by it...\"  All this can't be real, can it?  Curiously, you try to write something else with the enchanted, silver pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you write?</span></div></div>",

Ellie is not an exception. Her friend and companion is a female slime\u2013person named Jeli. While Ellie fights with her sword, Jeli is an archer wielding an enchanted longbow. Firearms remained primitive in this world despite the existence of 20th\u2013century technology, as enchanted weapons are preferred over firearms, which cannot be enchanted.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up in time to see a dazed look pass the goo\u2013girl's face for just a moment. If you had blinked, you would have missed it. At the same time, she is suddenly wearing an ornate longbow and a quiver of arrows on her back. She still wears the sleeveless knee\u2013length lavender dress she was wearing initially.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ellie, are you alright?\" the slime girl \u2013 Jeli \u2013 asks, now in a gentler tone like a concerned friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah,\" you say, the soft high voice speaking your words sounding strange to you. \"I just, uh, have to use the bathroom.\" Jeli nods and steps back. You stand, making sure to take the pad of paper and magic pen and put them in your bag before heading towards where you know the bathroom is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you reach the bathrooms, you notice that the doors are taller and wider than they were before. The question of why is answered quickly as a 12\u2013foot\u2013tall man \u2013 a giant \u2013 exits the men's room. Out of instinct, you start to head towards the men's room before you remember and enter the women's room instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women's bathroom just has stalls \u2013 no urinals \u2013 as expected. Though some are different, to accommodate the fantasy races that had been added to the world \u2013 large ones for giants and centaurs, much smaller ones for the 1\u2013foot\u2013tall fairies. You go to one of the human\u2013sized ones, enter, and lock it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a moment to cup your breasts and crotch. You can't feel your touch through the leather armor, but you can feel that your breasts are real and your crotch is empty. You hesitantly lower your pants \u2013 thick leather like the rest of your armor \u2013 and see your flat crotch encased in black panties. Yeah, you're definitely a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to feel like you really do need to use the bathroom, so you remove your sword (and its sheath) from your back, lower your panties, and sit on the toilet. Peeing as a girl is strange and familiar at the same time, and you need to wipe when you're done. You pull your pants back up and replace your sword on your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou exit the stall and wash your hands in a sink. You look into the mirror at your youthful and pretty face, framed by your long blonde hair. Your breasts look to be about a C\u2013cup, encased in the brown leather armor. You sigh and force yourself to look away from the mirror.</span></div></div>",

You feel different, somehow. Your chest feels heavy, and something feels off between your legs. You shift in place, trying to get more comfortable, but the feeling remains. Then you look down - and yelp in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pair of firm D-cup breasts stick out of your chest, your waist is thinner, and your hips are wider. Copper-red hair hangs from your head, reaching just past your waist level and touching your seat. You jump up and turn around, examining yourself. But you see only that you are a girl. Still wearing the same clothes as before, but perfectly fitted to your female body. You poke at your crotch, but find only emptiness. Yes, you're a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour jump in shock as you remember what the old man had said - that the pen only writes truth. But you were writing fiction... You look at your paper and reread what you wrote. Your eyes widen as you realize - you have become the girl you were describing...the witch. Finally, you look up and glance around at the surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA very pale man dressed in black with a very wide-brimmed hat shrugs and moves away. A centaur woman wearing a dress on her human half glances at you as she passes by. And so on. Many of the people you see are not human, but some sort of fantasy race. In shock, you realize that the pen didn't stop you from writing falsehoods - it made your writing come true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust to confirm, you take out your wallet and look at your ID, which still says \"Elliot Barnes\", though the picture is of the red-haired girl. You pick up then pen and write:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>That witch's name is\u2026</i>\" you pause for a moment before a name comes to you. \"<i>That witch's name is\u2026 Alia Skywind.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment you finish writing, the name \"Elliot Barnes\" on your ID changes to \"Alia Skywind\".

I never should have strung you along like this.  I\u2026 I don't know what I was thinking.  I know it sounds clich\u00e9, but I hope we can still be friends.  You really are a good guy, Elliot\u2026 I just don't think I can date you.  Keep dating you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica looks puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird.  I keep doing that.  But that's just what I mean, you know?  I barely even remember how we started dating in the first place.  It just doesn't feel\u2026 right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shakes her head sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Elliot.  I\u2026 I think you should go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's all she says.

Mostly you just feel cheated.  The pen made her date you, but it didn't bother to make her <i>like</i>you? What a ripoff.  Well, it's nothing another sentence won't fix.  All you have to do is write that she won't break up with you, and she won't!  Problem solved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, that may be an overly simplistic solution.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>She suddenly reaches out and gently cups your chin, turning you to face her.  The move surprises you.  You're still attracted to her, and the touch of her hand makes your heart race a little.  Then you notice the look on her face, a look of genuine concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah.\"  You stammer in reply.  \"Totally.\"  She smiles and your heart jumps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!  No, I-I'm fine.  Just...totally fine.  Why?  Is...is something...\"  You say and and find your thoughts trailing off.  Words are getting a bit harder for you to find as you see the warmth in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.  Well, I guess?  I mean, you just looked like something was bothering you, and I was just remembering trying to break up with you earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wait, what?</i>  You think.  <i>She's supposed to be free!  What happened?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, I mean...\" You say hopelessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  God.  Like I said, I'm <i>really</i> sorry.  That was just boneheaded.  I mean, seriously, sorry.  I don't even know what I was thinking.  It was just like, for a moment, I wondered what I saw in you, you know?  And I guess I just panicked, but sitting here, looking at you.\"  She looks to the side a little and shakes her head while laughing softly, then turns back to look into your eyes.  Once she does, you know you're stuck. You know that no earthy force could make you look away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, it's pretty fuckin' clear.  I mean, I thought something was bothering you, and I got concerned.  And I'm looking here at you and you just...just sitting here with you makes me so <i>happy</i>.  I mean, there I was last year, dating the quarterback because that's what I'm supposed to do because I'm the head cheerleader, right?  And I'm just miserable.  Totally fucking miserable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns to look out over the landscape again, and you feel your mind reeling.  She was miserable?  You didn't...nothing you wrote would have done that, so she was really miserable?  You stop and think, and as you do, you find memories of your life as a girl start to fill in the details.  Yes, you remember suddenly.  She was miserable, and you were only one of two people who noticed, you and Shauna, her best friend.  The details start coming to you as she tells them, your mind filling with memories of a timeline that somehow made sense, that felt<i> right</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like him, but I can't put my finger on why not, so I keep feeling like I'm supposed to, and I just keep <i>doing it</i> like a dumbass.  I mean, I have have sex with him because, hey, we've been dating for six months, and I mean that's what you do when you've been dating someone the requisite amount of time.  You bang, right?  Maybe that'll get me feeling something.  Tch.  God, such a dumbass.  And never once did I stop to think, 'Hey Jessica, maybe there's a reason you don't feel anything for him.  And hey, maybe there's a reason none of your female friends talk about wanting to touch and kiss each other like you always want to do with them.  Maybe there's a reason they talk about guys that all do nothing for you instead.  And maybe, <i>just maybe</i> it's <i>not</i> because there's some mysterious social code you don't know about but everyone else seems to follow.  Maybe you're just gay, and they're not.  Seriously, how long would I have kept being <i>that</i> dumbass for if it hadn't been for you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you find you know the answer to that hypothetical.  She would have kept being that dumbass until today.  It strikes you that <i>that's</i> why she was breaking up with you as a guy.  She was probably about to break up with her original boyfriend for the same reason!  What you wrote with your pen just made you take his place!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then came you, you know?  You with you stupid, mousy hair, your 'I don't give a shit' fashion and your stupid, sexy ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My-my ass?\"  That one surprises you.  Even more surprising, you have no memory of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your ass!  Hell of a way to tell your girlfriend perving over her ass before you started dating is kind of what helped you realize, 'Yup, I'm gay.'  I know, but surprise, to answer the question you never asked, your ass made me realize I was gay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait.\"  You say, suddenly remembering something.  \"Is <i>that</i> why Shauna told to wear a miniskirt if I had one when we drove out to Lala?\"  You ask.  You remember a touch of mischief in her voice when she told you to wear it, and it was during that road trip that you and Jessica had become a couple.  You'd kind of taken to wearing miniskirts for \"good luck\" since.  You'd generally been a baggy jeans for every occasion girl before then, you remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica answers by bursting with laughter.  \"Oh, god, she did?\"  She asks, her face turning bright red.  \"That bitch.  Oh my god, fucking bury me now.  That's it.  I'm done.  Had a good life, and I'm done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooo...\"  You say, curious.  \"You're dying is sad and all, but can we get back to the subject of my ass for a minute?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughs some more and looks away, unable to meet your eyes.  \"So, ummm...yeah, your ass.  You've got a pretty slim frame, right?  But once you get down low it's just like, BAM.\" She said, gesturing with her hands moving down side by side before one curves outward suddenly and dramatically then back in.  You feel oddly self-conscious about the fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you calling my ass fat?\"  You say, then paused, embarrassed you just asked that. <i> Really?</i>  You think.  <i>A girl for fifteen minutes and worrying how big your butt looks already?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm calling it curvy, sweetie.  There's a difference.\"  She said.  \"Anyway, yeah.  Shauna, that bitch, knew I'd been staring at your literal ass.  God, when I saw it in a mini skirt for the first time, I kinda just wanted to <i>bite</i> it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was your turn to blush from ear to ear, and you oblige.  When you can bring yourself to look up again, you see her looking at you, smiling.  The shine in her eyes is brighter than you've ever seen it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So yeah, I was being a dumbass.  I'm crazy about you, Elly.  I don't ever want to break up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heart is pounding now, and the crush you had as a boy and the history you remember as a girl seem to be combining to make you realize you're pretty sure you've fallen in love with her, which makes you remember your concern over what you wrote even more.  Does she only love you as a girl because you wrote she was your girlfriend before you changed genders?  You used to watch her pretty closely.  You think you would have noticed if she was secretly miserable, or gay.  But then, how much of that is just what's left of your male ego?  Remembering back now, you remember things so differently.  As a guy you thought you were pretty close with her because she would occasionally talk to you about her personal life and frustrations.  As a girl, though, you actually <i>were</i> close.  You look back at all the memories that have been filling in about your life as a girl and find that not only do you have more memories of time spent with her, but the time spent is different, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have memories of staying up late on the phone, sharing dreams and insecurities.  You remember dropping hanging out with the guys (apparently you still hung out with guys more than girls in this life) to celebrate her teams' win at the regionals with her, even though you were bored and spent most of your time on your phone.  You remember her suggesting you two stay in and she watch as you played Skyrim instead of going out on your date when you suddenly got it as a gift from your dad and started freaking out because you'd wanted to play it for years but your parents hadn't let you.  Most damningly, you remember her standing in tears after you randomly bumped into her in the hallway after she'd just had a fight with her boyfriend, finding out what was wrong and getting her to skip practice and on the fly put together a night out on the pier that was both terrifying and one of the fondest memories you now have.  You remember being lightly buzzed from a combination of the beer you'd managed to convince the bartender you were old enough for (despite the picture on the ID not looking much like you), and the adrenaline from the extreme speed boat ride you got off of just before hopping on the ferris wheel.  You sat there, looking at her, thinking about just how damned beautiful she looked when she turned from the view of the city glowing with lights stretching out below you to look at you in quiet for a moment before thanking you for taking her out.  She told you it was just what she needed and looked like she wanted to lean in and kiss you, but you were both tipsy, and she was emotionally vulnerable so you pointed something out in the view that caught her attention and made the moment pass.  She broke up with her boyfriend that weekend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a guy you remember not knowing how to handle her emotions and shuffling your feet awkwardly.  \"Oh my god, she's crying,\" you remember thinking.  \"What am I supposed to do?\"  When she finished telling you what happened, you blandly told her that it sucked and she deserved better.  Then you walked her to practice.  You remember being happy that night as a guy for having been there for her, for having scored an \"in.\"  The memory of those feelings was now embarrassing beyond belief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to her and much to your own surprise say, \"Jessica?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears began streaming down her eyes, then.  Tears of a completely different sort from those you remember months ago, and these make your stomach flop and your heart fill with a wonderful ache.  She reaches forward and kisses you gently, smiles and says, \"I love you too, Elly.  Oh god.\"  She pauses and wipes the tears from her eyes.  \"God, Elly.  I really fucking love you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile back and as something occurs to you, you ask,  \"So...um...do you still want to...uh...<i>bite</i> my ass?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Elly,\"  She says, and reaches over and begins to lean you back, then adjusts herself and your seat and lays you down.  \"I never stopped wanting to.\"</span></div></div>",

You're no longer in Jessica White's living room, that much is obvious.  No, instead, you seem to be\u2026 on a football practice field. Surrounded by football players.  Wearing football pads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" demands the gruff voice, which you now realize originates from Coach Wheeler, your gym instructor and the school football coach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I said, what's your deal, Zimmerman?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes you a moment to realize everyone is looking at <i>you.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.

There, reflected back at you, is the captain of the West Lowery High football team: Chad Zimmerman.  Tall, blond, muscular, and strikingly handsome.  That when it all falls into place.  Instead of redirecting Jessica's affections to you, it redirected <i>you</i> into the current target her affections.  Hesitantly, you flex your new biceps.  This\u2026 this could work. The only issue now is getting back to Jessica.  Well, that's no problem, not with the historian's pen. Reflexively you reach into your pocket\u2026 only to realize you don't have any.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorror dawning, you fumble about yourself, searching for the pen and notebook.  But of course it's nowhere to be found.  Chad wasn't carrying it, so now you, as Chad, aren't carrying it.  But if you aren't carrying it, then who\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, your answer literally pops into being several feet away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Their breasts and pussy will double in size in all directions when they are horny. Since I am feeling nice, and would like to see some proper sex, their expanded parts will not inhibit their movement when this happens. The rest of their body should also change so that their sex organs don't make them look bad, so long as their height does not increase. In order to facilitate this, every part of their body will be overwired with nerves that make them horny. They will never get old, and will never get tired, hungry, thirsty or otherwise unable to function when they are horny as well. They will never become pregnant unless I want them to. I think they should do ordinary stuff 50% of the time so that sex doesn't look too neat or orderly. Their vagina will also increase its output of juices and menses in proportion to its size. It will even output a small amount of juice even when not horny. PMSing should also be at an extreme too. The police or other people will never interfere, in fact when I press a button that will appear on my desk, anybody within a 100 foot radius will become a student here. Lastly, none of this should ever give me a problem.</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou read this, and strangely you like it. Since you are always horny, your butt and breasts double in size instantly. Now they make up about half your body weight. Your waist is now only 7\" wide, and your hips are 1.5' wide, making your body curvy beyond measure. You arouse yourself everytime you move a muscle, and so you leave a trail of vagina juice whereever you go. It doesn't come to your mind that you look like you have incontinence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you finish observing your new sexy body, you see Chad's hand moving as if he has just pressed the button. You see several people enter the school gate, all rapidly changing. You recognise them as some parents and a few policemen. Soon, they too will be turned into girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nearby buildings are also affected. Some of them have turned into hostels, others intoblocks of classrooms. All of them have a bright pink 'SLUT' and a picture of you fucking Elloit/Chad/Master on them. More of Chad's handiwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the inside of the school next. He was rught, it looks more chaotic now. A number of students, like you, are also leaving vagina juice everywhere theu go. You feel extremely turned on by them. In fact, you feel like jumping out the window and fucking them. But \"Master\" ( i am tired of typing out all three names) stops you. He has his own plan.</span></div></div>",

After a while, just fucking girl after girl is boring for him. So, when you turn around to look, he has just completed another order:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div class=\"bquote\"><i>I will undergo the same physical transformation as Christine over the next one minute. In the meantime, no one but the ORIGINAL Chad (me) will be able to get within 1 foot of this pen. If they come within even 2 feet, their brain will immediately be filled with thoughts of sex. During the time I am transormed, my name will be Brittany. Everyone is to call me that.</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is quite a surprise to see your normally draconian principal undergo the 30 minutes of change in 30 seconds. (I, the author, am a bit of a geek/math whiz/genius. That is 3600 times faster.) He is naked, so you can see his 15cm long (you suspect he used the pen for this) erect penis shrink into a plain, smooth, white crotch. As it happens, he jumps up in surprise to feel a vagina form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, his clothes which were on the floor turn into a bikini. He will need one to cover those rapidly expanding boobs. His hair doesn't change from black, so it only gets longer. His hips expand, and his waist slims. Now when he tries to walk he also swings his hips, like you. Well, not really his. Those boobs are bigger than oranges, and his sexual organs have fully formed. As soon as that happens, vagina juices gush out to replace that erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, change two. Over 15 seconds, his butt and breasts expand to half the size of yours. He also gets attracted to other girls and somewhat bisexual. He struggles to keep balance while rapidly changing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChange 3, and final. In the remaining 15 seconds, the bit described in the last chapter comes to bear. Luckily, he now has no problems walking. When he's done, you gasp in surprise. Apart from the face and hair, this rapidly leaking woman is a perfect clone of yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany annd you have sex just 1 minute after that. Five hours later, it finally ends. She gets off you, and the two of you put your clothes on. The principal's office now has a bedroom with a King-size bed, which the two of you sleep together in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, the bed is soaking in juices, and so are your skirt and Brittany's thong. Both of you had wet dreams last night. He uses the pen to clear up the mess. Then, he goes to the PA and says:</span></div></div>",

Chad had written down a note secretly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor 24 hours, Christine cannot orgasm unless I let her and that she was constantly aroused because she is now even more bisexual than before, and all these 2k+ people are sure to turn her on'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christine, wake up\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe yawned and stretched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Master?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take a look at this\" he said, pointing out the office window into a whole cafeteria full of extremely sexy young women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly she buckled her legs and started quivering in her high-heels. She moaned a bit when Chad had surprised her with pulling her over to him and sticking his huge foot long dick into her. She was extremely horny and needed release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I need to orgasm Master, why can't I orgasm it feels like I'm going to burst!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you can orgasm\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a scream and ended with a heavy pant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you survive the day, you aren't allowed back in here until I call you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he shoves her out the door, completely naked.

You could deal with him and his punishment yourself, or you could simply write in your notebook that the Wizard at Spells 'R Us would know about everything Chad had done or tried to do (somehow you got the feeling that the old man wouldn't like any of it, and he'd probably do far worse to Chad than you could ever think to do to him) or just leave him for whatever sort of <i>magical</i> authorities existed, something as powerful as magic couldn't be left without its own laws and law enforcement officers after all.</span></div></div>",

So, you sneak into your regular locker room and get out your pen. Hastily you write:<br>\r\n<i>I am the correct gender, and reality alters for it.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel your head spin. You find yourself in the cheerleaders' locker room again, halfway changing from the cheerleading uniform to an equally exposing outfit. You freeze in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christine, what's wrong? You were just halfway changing and then you just stood there and totally freaked me out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Uhhh...I just paused to...Uhhh...scratch an itch. you start scratching at your legs in a rather exaggerated manner. Amy looks at you suspiciously and then smiles and says,\"Wow christine. You really are a klutz sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou avoid a few suspicious stares and finish changing. To get to the bottom of this, you excuse yourself to the toilet and lock yourself in a cubicle. (You nearly go to the wrong toilet. Again, you shake this off as being absent-minded.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't need to take off your tight, revealing tank top to see that your breasts are now real, and they are about J cups. You don't know for sure, because your body likes it's cleavage exposed to the world, and therefore has no bra. You feel that you also have no panties or thong as air rushes up your incredibly tiny shorts to touch your inflated butt. You are incredibly sexy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo get a better look, you take a small mirror out of your newly-materialised handbag and peer at yourself. Your hair is now blonde, and you lips are puffed up too. Your face is very smooth, and you cry out for a split second at your own beauty before realising that your voice has changed correspondingly, it is now smoother, higher pitched and somewhat sedective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon find out the implications of your new sexual organ. Since your brain has not been changed, you find that your shorts are slightly damp as your brain responds to seeing someone like one of the better-looking bimbos stare at them in the mirror. You sit up again and open the door as if you just peed,and again avoid stares. Tomorrow will be a l-o-n-g day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\nTomorrow comes!<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, you wake up as usual. Your attention is diverted immediately to the change, as you struggle to get up with the weight of your breasts. You are still very drowsy because you missed a lot of sleep last night. You found that your usual way of sleeping on your front had uxexpected results arising from your breasts getting squashed under your own weight, and your neck couldn't touch the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour shower also turns out differently because your breasts present a whole new area to clean, and you have no idea how to use makeup. You have to dress up again, but your wardrobe is filled with clothes similar to what you wore yesterday. Other than that you can only find a few tight, exposing bikinis that show off a huge area of midriff. You decide against the possibility of using them as underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreakfast is uneventful, apart from occasionally bumping your boobs and being called Christine. You soon need to go to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour new body has a harder time getting to the bus stop than usual. Your high heels are killing you, and your feet hurt so much that you simply drop yourself on the first seat you see. Bad move. You end up next to Chad. He keeps trying to \"accidentally\" look or reach up your clothes, and you do your best to stop him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seems like hours of trying not to be molested, he mutters something about you \"being less sexy\" today and it's time to get off. Where you are supposed to go to now is a mystery, so you browse through your bag to find out. Your new body is apparently something of a bimbo and its worksheets are covered with F's, D's and little drawings of hearts apparently made by you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou arrive at your locker room sooner than you thought and so you go to your new locker. This locker has very little actual school-related stuff, mainly drawings of attractve men. You're not interested. You want your pen.</span></div></div>",

Instead, you essentially had girl Vance. And while it was fun to have a girl to play videogames with, your \"other\" joystick was feeling neglected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on, Vanessa. Gotta take a leak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, dude.\" she nonchalantly says to you, never taking her focus off the screen as she keeps wasting scrubs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go into the bathroom and pull out the notebook and pen. \"Let's start small for now. A few minor physical changes and quirks...\" You already have three ideas in mind, but before you start, you have an idea. You kinda want to see these happen in the flesh, so you first write down, \"Do not enact the following changes on this page until Vanessa is in my sight.\" then you write down your three edicts:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"1. Lengthen Vanessa's hair down to her waist.\"<br>\r\n\"2. Despite being a tomboy, Vanessa only likes to wear miniskirts.\"<br>\r\n\"3. Increase Vanessa's breasts by one cup size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the book, you flush the toilet to complete the illusion of having used the john, and return to your room, where angry 12-year olds were bitching at Vanessa over their mics because she was mopping the floor with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa notices your return. \"Oh, you're back. Can you believe these scrublords?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, just an you set up in the notebook with the Historian's Pen, the changes began once you saw her. Her hair inched downed from the nape of her neck, past her shoulders, and as it slowed, you could see her chest plumping from B's to C's. Finally, your eyes deviate down to her legs as you watch her baggy cargo pants ride up, Vanessa wholly ignoring this, as she did with her other changes, as they slid up past her knees, the pants legs going up as far as mid-thigh before fusing together to form a miniskirt, and said skirt shifting further, losing another half a centimeter as it pleated up and acquired a red and black plaid design.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa notices your staring, and wonders what you're doing. \"Yes, girl play videogames gud. Now get back over here and let's get back to it!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head to snap your head out of it. That was... amazing!! Watching Vanessa transform before your eyes!! It was so... sexy. You pick up the controller and resume playing, but your mind is still on what you had seen - the growing hair, the swelling bosom, the pants turning into a miniskirt. Maybe you should try more out on her... but now that you think about it, you sorta like Vanessa like she is now. However, there's still other people in school, in town, and even your own family, and with the pen, they're all your playthings...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more hours of gaming goodness, Vanessa decides to head on home, planting a kiss on you for the good time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" you ask yourself, \"who should I try this out on next?\"</span></div></div>",

As soon as you heard that they were playing in your hometown, you bought tickets for yourself and Vince, who was hooked on them after hearing their biggest song, <a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmkHqUwa4zg\">\"Love Bites (And So Do I)\"</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmkHqUwa4zg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't much trouble in picking your outfit for the night, since it was a rock show...outside of the underwear, which you were mostly unfamiliar with. You ended up going with a lace-fringed Victoria's Secret set, having just as much trouble with the bra as you expected. Funny, your boobs didn't look <i>that</i> big when you looked in the mirror, but they were a bitch to work with when trying to get the hooks in place (why'd they'd have to make them so small...). Your longer fingernails didn't help much with that either (oh yeah, guess those have to be done too...wait, what? Why would <i>that</i> thought enter your mind?). Black tights, a denim skirt (a bit shorter than you were comfortable with, but the tights helped with <i>that</i> problem), a <a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://cdn.wmgecom.com/production/media/catalog/product/cache/46/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/h/a/halestorm_mr._hyde_juniors_racerback_tank-1.jpg\">\"Mz.

You did your nails with a black polish, and checked Facebook while you waited for them to dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found your friends list, and saw that you now knew over a thousand people, several times the number that you had cared to keep in touch with as a guy. \"Yeesh, how many friends can one person have?\" Your own timeline included pictures of you at the beach, on the volleyball court, scoring goals in soccer...the magic had apparently added activities to your life, and made you more important in the ones that you had before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little bit of makeup later (slightly disturbing you with your competence with that), you pulled your hair back into a ponytail, and went to your car (now nicer than before...guess you hadn't tried racing that guy once, so your parents got you a better ride).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVince was waiting for you in line, as you had originally planned. Of course, as this was now a date, he had bought the tickets instead of you. 30 minutes later, the doors still hadn't opened...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, it's getting cold out here,\" you say under your breath. Hearing this, he took off his coat and put it on you, which made you warmer than the jacket alone could account for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe opening act finally showed up, and you went in (he paid for the coat check, of course). They played a forgettable opening, and In This Moment played a much better set to prepare the crowd for the main event (and to sell their newly released album). After a few minutes of intermission, Josh Smith came out and started the opening bass riff for \"Hello, It's Mz. Hyde\". The band came out one by one to start playing after that, and you found yourself hugging Vince in anticipation. (Pull yourself together, you're a GUY)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course you started screaming when Lzzy Hale came out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey played a few songs, and most of the band went backstage for a break. Lzzy went to the piano to play \"Break In\"...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or-lMf9f7gY\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or-lMf9f7gY</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the crowd's celebration, Vince grabbed you and kissed you. Hard. On the lips. Deeply.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Regardless this experience would be very helpful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it is a great idea, let's do this!\" you said to April.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" said April happy you agree to this, \"Thanks for the support\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your welcome\" you said smiling to her excited to try this out as you touch the notepad waiting for April to right down the new reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen April lifted up the magical history pen and started writing down for the new reality for you and her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce April finished writing, she started to change. She grew taller, even though it is very hard to tell since she is sitting down. She gain some muscle mass, not alot, but enough for a normal average guy. Her face starts to harden and becomes more boyish/guyish. The hair on her head becomes shorter and possible grews some more hair on her body. Her breast shrink down on her chest and it becomes flat like a normal guy's. You can't tell, but most likely she is gaining manhood down her crouch area where there use to be her womanhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the transformation is complete, what once was a girl named April sat a guy who you don't know will be his new name yet for his/her body. He has a pretty average build and still looked fairly geeky/nerdy, but did not bother you, he is still a guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what about you?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You realized that with this pen, you had the power of a god in your hands. You could change reality as you saw fit. You could change HER as you saw fit. You could give her physical traits that totally clashed with her tomboy personality, but rewrite reality so that it synchronized perfectly with her mindset, or just say screw it and change her mentality... no, you wanted to keep her tomboy nature, but you wanted to re-roll that body. You hated to admit it, but a tinge of misogyny was filtering judgment about her looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing you did was a clever idea on your part. \"I want a full-length mirror that allows me to see any individual that I am currently transforming with the pen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn ornate mirror rises from the floor, trimmed in gold. \"Now, for the good stuff... I just got to phrase it just right just in case this pen tries to monkey paw me somehow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin writing a long in-depth treatise of transformations to Hannah's body and wardrobe, watching as you began to write that Hannah appeared in your new mirror in her car, driving, currently wearing the same clothes from the photo on your dresser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...permanently remove all body hair from Hannah below her neck...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis one you can't tell if it worked, but you're still focused on writing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Hannah's has hair to her hips and is now a platinum blonde...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched her hair rapidly grow down and shifts color, watching her unconsciously brushing some of her growing locks out her field of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Without increasing muscle size or mass, all of Hannah's muscles are now 5x stronger...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch her grip her steering wheel so tight it leaves indents in the wheel. \"I gotta be more careful there...\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Hannah's breasts are now natural JJ-cups. While Hannah is a tomboy at heart, she in fact only wears only the smallest and sexiest tube tops, tank tops, halters, and bikini tops over her breasts, in stark contrast to her personality. Despite how tiny and revealing her tops are, she can continue to pursue her usual activities, such as sports, without fear of nip-slips or her boobs popping out of her tiny clothes, and no one will ever question how and why this works. Hannah can still move move around easily in spite of her breasts' large size. Her back muscles, without changing size or mass, shall increase in strength twenty-fold, allowing her to carry her increased chest proportions with ease...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw in the mirror with excitement as her chest ballooned out, gaining a cup size a second, as her shirt shriveled away to nothing. Soon, she was sitting there with breasts that almost sat on the steering wheel only covered in a white strip that barely passed for a tube top, pressing the mountainous tits together into a sea of cleavage. Your boner was straining your pants, but work was still to be done, and she was still only halfway to your house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Hanna has a 20\" waist, firm abs, and extremely wide, motherly hips. Her butt shall be large and voluminous, yet muscular and firm. She can eat and drink anything she desires to any degree she desires and never become overweight nor underweight, maintaining im perpetuum the figure I have just given her...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as her roughly size 8 waist constricts as though under a vice to size 0 proportions as her hips go the other way, flaring out about as wide as her shoulders. As by magic, her pants seem to keep up with the changes as rises up in her seat, gaining a toned bubble butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Hannah, despite being a tomboy, wears only short miniskirts and thongs all the time, even when exercising or playing sports. The school even allows her to play on the soccer and softball teams in a miniskirt, and no one questions it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou studied the mirror excitedly as you saw her baggy cargo pants shrivel up her legs like a strange goo, changing color as it went to shades of red and black with strips of yellow. The fabric fused together and began folding on itself, forming pleats as it rose over her knees, now most definitely a skirt. A studded leather belt materialized through the belt loops, which were also turning red. Black thong straps were rising out the top of her skirt, resting on the top of her hips, as the top of her skirt began to rest itself lower and lower. Finally, the hem of the miniskirt finished shrinking about a third of the way up her thighs. However because of her boyish tomboy personality, you can see her sitting in the car with her legs spread out, giving you a free upskirt. Your boner could cut diamonds now, but no, you're not done!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Hannah's thighs and pussy are very toned and muscular, and highly sensitive...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch Hannah shuffle in her seat and moan a little, panties dampening slightly, but then she says, \"It's unusually cool today. Sure, I hate wearing anything but a miniskirt, but they don't do a good job of keeping you warm. I might actually HAVE to invest in some pants...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then realize that her scantily-clad wardrobe had a fatal flaw - that it exposed her to the elements; freezing her in the winter, which potentially meant frostbite and hypothermia, and then there's sunburn and skin cancer in the summer. \"Good point, Hannah. Well, we'll just fix that!!\" You pause your regularly scheduled changes to your girlfriend to add an addendum, you know, for her health...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Hannah can wear her clothes all year and never get cold or hot. She can never get frostbite from exposure to the elements or contact to cold surfaces, nor can she get skin cancer, sunburn, or any other type of skin damage from exposure from sunlight and ultraviolet radiation...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, I guess it must of just been goosepimples. I must be a little excited to get there.\" Hannah says, shrugging off her previous experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess while I'm mutating my girlfriend to make her resistant to disease and fortifying her constitution, I should also add a few metabolic changes while I'm thinking about it, let ol' willy calm down a bit, before I do my last couple of physical changes I have in store. I mean I still got 15 minutes...\" you remind yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin writing stuff down to ensure her health, mostly using stuff you heard in health class, on TV and random facts you pull up quickly on Web MD. \"...Hannah is immune to all STD's, including HIV and AIDS. Her immune system is highly resistant to all other diseases, and is immune to cancer. She cannot contract diabetes, and her heart pressure always remains normal. Her blood vessels cannot become clogged with fat or cholesterol. She cannot get varicose veins. Hannah no longer has a gallbladder nor an appendix. She cannot go bald for any reason. Hannah never has acne...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did you know, but you had just cured Hannah of a recently formed and undiagnosed ovarian cancer tumor that was about to metastasize by writing that line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause, out of ideas. \"Hmmm, can't think of anything else medical, so let's get back to the physical.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Hannah now has brilliant blue eyes with 20/10 vision...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah's eyes shift from a muddy brown to such a striking blue they almost seemed neon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Hannah's lower legs are just as toned as her upper legs, and are baby smooth...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see her legs gain a small amount of meat to them, all of it muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Hannah's shoes are always the newest sneakers, sandals, or high-heeled boots, and also owns platform heels for special occasions. Hannah can walk flat-footed or in the highest of heels without any discomfort...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah's old dirty sneakers begin to repair themselves, becoming a pair of the newest kicks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...No one objects to Hannah's taste in clothing; not her parents, not her friends, not the school, not even strangers...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked over into the mirror, and you saw that she was pulling onto your road, but damn... that hair, those tits, that skirt... Hannah had become something you thought could never exist - the appearance of a smoking hot mega bimbo on the outside, but in reality an intelligent geeky tomboy on the inside. \"You dun good.\" you thought. However, you thought it would be safe to put in one more line, just in case she found the book:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...All changes I have written about Hannah up to this point shall only be visible to my eyes only...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see the text shimmer, but it's still there. \"I believe it worked. Alright, I should go meet her at the doo...\" Well, there was still a minute or two...</span></div></div>",

Thus decided, you grab the vial and walk up to the front of the store, where the elderly proprietor is hanging a freshly-painted sign over the counter.  After he hammers the last nail into place, he turns to you and smiles, gesturing elaborately at the elegant lettering which reads: 'Because I am a wizard.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" he beams, \"what do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou search frantically for a tactful reply.  What to say to a grown man in a bathrobe claiming to be a wizard?  You've suspected since you first saw his robe that this guy might be more than a little senile\u2014if not actively insane\u2014but you hardly want to say that, especially if it's true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's\u2026  nice,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I most certainly am not!\" huffs the old man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not nice?\" you ask nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  No, I'm not senile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a step back.  \"How did you know\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a flourish, the old man points to the still-wet sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um\u2026 right,\" you say.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I know you don't yet believe\u2014that doesn't matter.  I only mentioned it because you asked.  Well, that and perhaps a little excitement with the new sign\u2014but mostly because you asked.  I used to have a rather nice one, you know, with embossed gold lettering and all that.  I was really quite fond of it.  Quite an unfortunate affair what happened.   There were these luchadores, and\u2014ah, well, never mind.  It's a rather long story and I'm sure you have places to go.  Now, what can I help you with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuchadores?  As in masked Mexican wrestlers?  Whatever\u2014the man's probably crazy anyway. Better to make your purchase and get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh, how much for this powder?\" you ask, nervously producing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\" he says.  \"Lust Powder! That's a very powerful substance, young man.  I trust you read the label?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you realize that this powder will make you irresistible to your target?  And that it doesn't wear off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess,\" you say, blushing.  It sounds even sillier out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man looks at you appraisingly.  Finally, he nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well,\" he says.  \"You may have the powder for sixteen dollars and seventy-three cents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmptying your pocket, you are surprised to find that you have exactly that amount.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's weird, how did you know\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, the old man simply sighs wearily and points to the sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.  Right.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanding him the money, you pocket the vial and walk hurriedly out of the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce back out in the food court, you idly flip the vial over in your hand.  Who to use it on?  The vial only seemed to contain enough powder for once dose, so you'd have to choose carefully.  You could use it here at the mall\u2014there were plenty of girls here you wouldn't mind throwing themselves at you.  You didn't really know any of them personally, though\u2014maybe you should take the powder to school and use it on someone there.  On the other hand, this wasn't a decision to be taken lightly\u2014whoever you touched with it would apparently be attracted to you for life.  Maybe you should wait until a particularly special opportunity comes along.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But you're still mostly you, and while reality seems to have shifted so that you have always been a girl, you still pause long enough that you seem like you're hesitating. Jordan's brow furrow for a second before she quickly adds \"And what's more, my pleb parents will be away visiting my aunt and uncle this weekend and I'll be alone. We could totally swipe some beer from my dad's fishing shed and get high after!\" She bites her lip and gives you a sultry look \"And anything we else we might think of doing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fucking A!\" You say excitedly as the thought of not only seeing your favorite punk band at the concert but spending some time with Jordan. Previously you hadn't been into the idea of more than a casual beer and had no interest in weed, but now the entire combination of literal sex, drugs and rock and roll was turning you on. Already you could feel your new female organs churning beneath your skirt. But you were still at school and ignored your new urges before crawling into the seat beside Jordan, who gives you a wide smile and pulls out a package of cigarettes, offering you one, which you naturally take and place in your lips, the deep crimson lipstick holding the cancer stick more than your own mucles. You let it hang there as you lean in towards Jordan as she pulls out her lighter and produces the flame with an audible snap, the small spark leaping onto the cigarette's paper. You pull back, taking a slow drag of the cigarette and blowing it out slowly as if you've done it before while Jordan lights her own. You feel her slender hand slide across yours as you both lean back and stare up at the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the powder having backfired, you strangely felt okay with the strange twist of fate that had befallen you. But at the same time, even with the shifting of reality, you still remembered your old self alongside all the new memories of your female self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pulled the cigarette from your mouth and blow a cloud a smoke off to the side as you move a strand of vibrant blue hair out of your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Life is strange\" You mutter to no one but the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it.\" Your new girlfriend replies.</span></div></div>",

Walking through the crowded hallways, you ponder the girl on which to use the powder.  The obvious choice would be Jessica White\u2014universally considered the hottest girl in school, the blonde head cheerleader would not only make a fantastic lover but would, in becoming your girlfriend, significantly advance your own social standing.  She isn't stuck-up, either;  despite her stunning appearance, she is actually very friendly, even to those\u2014like you\u2014outside her own social circle.  Her only flaw is that she doesn't exactly sparkle with brilliance.  Jessica could provide a lot of things as your girlfriend, but stimulating conversation is definitely not among them.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nFor that, there's Annie Breen.  Annie is something of a geek, and proud of it, but she's also very pretty.  Not in the same league as Jessica, but then, who is?

When in range, you poke her gently on the forearm and then when nothing happens immediately, you give her a harder jab causing her to face you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think you a...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn't finish as the world slows to a standstill with you seemingly trapped in a bubble. Dumb struck you look around at your classmates all frozen in place. You see one of you friends, Matt with his fingers up his nose which causes you to laugh. The laugh that comes out though is more like a girl's  high giggle. \"What's happening?\" You say alarmed in your new girly voice. And then there is a bright flash which forces your eyes closed. Your body is tingling all over, almost feeling like it is moving within itself. The feeling isn't painful but when the tingling moves to your crotch and lower stomach, you feel an inner warmth come over you. Still with your eyes closed, you begin to be able to better distinguish the colours of the flashes but perhaps the most concerning thing you feel is as if you are getting weaker. You attempt to tense your arm but feel minimal response. Suddenly the tingling stops and you start to feel material move across your body. Something constricts your chest but in a supportive way and then you feel flowing softness across your torso and upper thigh. Something clingy works its way up your legs all the way up to your crotch. And then just as fast as it started, the light disappears and all sensations stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts at this you notice that the sound has come back into the world so you quickly open your eyes. The view straight ahead of yourself is obstructed with what appears to be the chest region of a cheerleader. You look up and see Jessica's face looking down at you with curiosity. It's at this you realise your changed perspective. You've shrunk and dramatically too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" Jessica says, her voice full of concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot sure how to answer, you stammer. \"Um yeah, uh I don't know.\" With this, you notice the change in your voice again, it is a cutesy singsong voice that you would expect to belong to a girl. You cover your mouth with your hands and your eyes grow wide. \"What has happened?\" You think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remove your hands from your mouth and hold the. front of your face. Gone are the grubby and broad spades of a teenage boy, instead you see tiny and delicate mits with the nails painted a light shade of pink. <br>\r\nYou follow the hands up and see hairless and dainty arms with no sign of musculature. You look down to find your view slightly obstructed by two perky mounds emerging from your chest under what looks like a white blouse. Leaning forward slightly, you make contact with your lower body which is partially covered by a short floral skirt with a belt and your slim legs being covered by black tights/pantyhose ending at a pair of small ballet flats on a pair of small feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head in disbelief only to see hair flicking past your periphery. Your hands shoot to your head and are greeted by what feels to be very thick yet smooth hair going all the way down to your mid back. You bring a strand in front of your face to discover it is a glossier shade of your existing brunette hair colour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's at this point your eyes grow wide again and you start to reach for your crotch but Jessica, who up to this point has been watching you examine yourself with some curiosity now lightly takes your hand and leads you into the girls bathroom. Too dazed to resist you go along with the now much taller girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily the bathroom is empty so more people won't witness your melt down. You both stop in front of the mirrors and you are struck dumb by your reflection. In front of you stands a extremely petite girl 18 year old girl who must be little over 4ft 10. Her face and hair is adorable with, light makeup having been expertly applied and her baby blue eyes wide with confusion. She is wearing a white blouse under a black cardigan, with floral skirt, tights and flats. She is clasping a bag in her left hand which is decorated with flowers and hearts and a sundry of other girly things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is you. Your mind races trying to figure how this happened. \"The powder will make you irresistible to the one you touch\", the old man's voice floats through your head and it hits you. You touched Jessica White so that must mean she likes girls.  You don't know what you are shocked at more, your transformation or the fact that head cheerleader and hottest girl in school is a lesbian and prefers cute and petite girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey are you alright?\" Comes Jessica's soothing voice and a hand touches your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look to her again and realise that the height and size difference between you two is substantial, being 5ft 9, she almost has an entire foot on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah thanks, I just got a little dizzy I guess.\" You say trying to act natural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn't look convinced \"Are you sure, you seemed pretty out of it? It's like you walked right into me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm sorry, I was just lost in thought. I'm really sorry for bothering you.\" You say again trying to end the awkward questions. It seems that your transformation wasn't witnessed by anyone else but you and even then you had your eyes closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica's expression softens. \"It's okay. No harm done, just as long as you are alright. I'm Jessica by the way. I don't think I've seen you around before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Ellio... Ellie\" you say almost blowing your cover. \"I'm kinda new to the school. This is my first week.\" Not technically a lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow that's great where did you come from?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I'm in trouble\" you think so you say the first thing that comes into your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm from ......</span></div></div>",

It seems the unicorn as promised got you home as promisepd with warping it seems. Then she walks you up to the door and leavitates a set of keys out if her personal saddle and unlocks the door and walks you in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unicorn rides you to your room and opens it with a strange force and walk you in.

Instead of seeing yourself with your best friend, you see yourself with that Pony that just took you home, could it be in this reality she replaced your best friend somehow or your friend became her, you are kind of unsure, yet it tiggers some strange images in your head that you somehow known her for a long time, maybe as long as your original best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also noticed some of those My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic stuff you got is nowhere in sight. Either they are stolen or never existed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour clothes are the same mostly, except the MLP:FIM stuff is gone. But strangely there is some dresses and Make-UP hidden away.

It seem there are still other humans in the world, but now they seem to co-exist with the different types of Ponys which look like ones from the cartoon series. There is even hints the Humans and Ponys as couples are common and maybe more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is quite a bit more to take in then you imagine from using the strange Lust Powder.

Thus decided, you carefully pocket the Lust Powder until the final bell dismisses you and your fellow students to their homes and after school activities.  Once the halls have emptied, you make your way down to the math lab, hands shaking with excitement.  You wonder idly whether Annie will simply throw herself at you right then and there or if she'll just start fawning over you until you ask her out.  Whatever the case, her affections will be more than welcome.  As you approach the door to the math lab, you pause briefly, taking a deep breath and carefully sliding the vial from your pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here goes noting,\" you whisper, popping the cork and sprinkling the fine black dust over your skin.  It disappears as it makes contact, melting into your arms with a gentle shimmer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking another deep breath, you gently crack open the door to the math lab, only to be met with a terrible realization\u2014Annie isn't here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you?\" asks one of the math club members, noticing you in the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly snap your exposed arm behind your back to avoid accidental contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, is Annie Breen here?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" says the math clubber.  \"I think she stayed home sick today, but she should be back tomorrow.  Is this about the yearbook? Would you like me to give her a message?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, no thanks,\" you mutter, mind racing.  Hastily you back away from the door, letting it slip closed behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is not good.  You've already applied the powder, and as such whoever you touch next is supposedly going to become irresistibly attracted to you. That leaves you with a difficult choice.  Of course, you could simply try not to accidentally brush against anyone for the next twenty four hours, until you get another chance at Annie.  That could prove quite challenging, though; you might be better off finding a suitable substitute as soon as possible.  Most of your peers have already gone home for the day, but you should still be able to find some pretty girl staying late for an after-school activity.  It's hardly ideal, but at least that way you wouldn't run quite so much risk of accidentally infatuating the wrong person.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The library usually has a few people in it after school. Once you get to ground level where the library is, you quickly walk to the entrance and slip inside while carefully keeping your arms as close to your body as possible. While you probably look a little odd, it will help prevent accidental touching, and may creep people out enough to stay away from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe library was divided into two identical halves with a bunch of tables in the center. Most are empty, but as luck would have it, a girl is sitting in the back by the windows. She is cute with shortish black hair tied with two pigtails, a pair of thin framed glasses on her face, and a somewhat small but attractive figure. Her attention is focused on a book that she is reading, so she probably wouldn't see you if you were quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'll work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quietly walk over to her, anxious to free yourself from the powder's effect. As the girl keeps reading, oblivious to you, you go around her table and sneak behind her. You hesitate for a moment wondering how to make contact with her. If the powder doesn't work, it could end up rather embarrassing. It doesn't take long for you to get impatient though, so you decide to just fake walking buy and brush up against her with your arm.</span></div></div>",

It fills you within seconds, and you feel like you need to sit down. With shaky footing you stumble to another table and hold yourself up by pushing against the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's in that powder?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother stranger feeling overwhelms the first one. It's not painful or entirely unpleasant, but the strangeness of it is unwelcome. Suddenly, you feel as if your body is warping. You look at your arms and find out that it actually is. Your arms become thinner and your legs soon do the same. The hair on your head starts to feel heavy, so you reach up and grab it only to find that it has become much, much longer and better groomed. Your hips completely rearranged and you begin to feel something like a breeze between your legs. Looking down, you see that you're now wearing a skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you begin to speak, you feel a jolt go through your chest. Your transformed shirt had become fairly tight on you, but it was now beginning to lift up off your body. However, it wasn't becoming any looser. Something is pushing it up, or to be more precises, two things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those can't be!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour new breasts now steadily grew to full size, leaving you with a noticeable weight on your chest. Somehow, you had been turned into a girl. The only explanation is the powder, but it wasn't suppose to transform you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quick push, you back away from the table and look at you new your new petite hands. You happen to catch a pair of eyes watching you on the edge of your vision. It's the girl who you tried to use the powder on. She is staring at you from behind her book. When she notices that you're looking back, she immediately turns away, but still stares back every so often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuck had not been on your side. The powder had actually done what it was supposed to. You were now exactly what the cute library girl wanted, but it just so happened that she was interested in other girls. Everything had gone wrong and you needed some space to yourself to figure it all out. You turn and run out of the library. The girl's eyes stay fixed on you all the way to the exit.</span></div></div>",

Stopping on the other side of the door to the library your lean against the wall and take in a couple of deep breaths thinking all the while \u201cthis can't be happening... this is just a dream...a bad bad dream...when I open my eyes I will be my old self and this will all be one bad nightmare that in time I will forget about.\u201d you take one more deep breath and open your eyes and look down, only to see two big spheres staring back at you though a tight black tank top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to pinch yourself to see if you were still dreaming only to feel the prick of you pinching your arm. Wondering what you were going to do and what all has changed would you still have your old life but be a girl would it be completely different? you slowly start to make your way outside. Once outside you see a couple of people sitting on the stairs that glance up to see who else was leaving before there workaholic parents came to pick them up. Feeling very awkward about your new body and attire you make your way down the stairs feeling like everyone is staring right through you, it is almost unbearable and you can feel yourself getting faint at the thought of it. You see a tree out in the front lawn of the school and make your way to it and lean against it for the shade as your vision starts to blur you begin taking a couple of deep breaths again trying to calm yourself down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can feel your body start to calm down slightly to the point where you are not about to pass out at least, when you hear something behind you, at first you pass it off as someone talking to one of there friends but you hear it again just a little louder then a whisper saying \u201cumm...e-excuse me. A-Are y-you alright?\u201d you turn around and see the girl from the library at first she is looking at you but then gets to shy and looks away; you notice her pigtails swaying in a very cute way. You quickly stop leaning on the tree and look at her and say \u201c Can I help you with something?\u201d completely ignoring her first question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe starts to talk in her whisper like voice \u201cw-well I n-noticed you in the library, and well I am new to town and don't have any friends y-yet\u201d (she seemed to shudder a little at what she was saying like she felt like the stupidest person in the world) \u201ca-and I-I was wondering if you. Well if you weren't busy we could h-h-hang o-out or I c-could help you in c-classes that you might be having trouble in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking her over briefly even though she was looking down you could tell by her body language that she was about to cry because she was having such a hard time talking to you; you suspected that if you said no to her that she would ether make it to the closest bathroom stall or maybe her house before she did start to cry. noticing that she was getting closer to running away to hide and cry you knew you had to make up your mind soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew that the only way for you to even have a chance at becoming a guy again was to go to spells r us and talk to the wizard. But if he couldn't or wouldn't change you back you might need to learn to live with this new life or you might need her help get help so accepting her offer might not be that bad but it might begin clouding your judgement soon; but that powder must have affected you at least a little because the more you looked at this girl the more cute she becomes, you think that you can only resist the power for so much longer before she is all you can think about so getting a way from her might clear your head enough to find an escape from this spell so you decided too...</span></div></div>",

You pull it out and look at it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nit had a picture of you (the girl you) smiling for the camera like nothing was wrong and the name Ellie Barnes on it. This shocked you, you just said that your name was Ellie Barnes after the Lust powder was used and it was still able to change somethings. You slowly slide the I.D. Back in the wallet and put it away, then you grab the cell phone and see it is pink with some red hearts on it and a sloppily done unicorn in puffy paint like something a little girl would do. You think about it and it could have been your young cousin she is in third grade and it looks like some of her work and she comes over all the time so it would seem like she did it. You check to see what time it is and if you got any messages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that you better go home you look around for April only to find her at the front desk checking a book out. You walk over to her as the librarian finished checking the book out to her, she thanked him in her quiet voice and turned to you. She asked \u201c so are you ready to go?\u201d clutching the book to her chest. You smile and said \u201c ya I got my stuff I am ready, are you?\u201d she nods and you begin to walk home.

It was actually quite annoying - you'd like to have a conversation with someone as attractive as the pigtailed girl was, but she's far too shy to have a proper conversation. Is this how all attractive girls feel, you wonder to yourself?<br>\r\n\"Listen, I'm going to have to go,\" you say, noting the sense of rejection that's clear in the girl's face. \"But I'll talk to you tomorrow, or whenever I next see you.\" The look on her face - she clearly doesn't believe you. She thinks you're just making excuses to get away from her. It's a look of embarassment, of rejection - of someone who expects to be rejected, and feels stupid for even trying.<br>\r\nYou felt really guilty - you've felt like that once or twice, and it is an awful feeling. <i>At least she was brave enough to come and see you,</i> you think. <i>If your dream girl suddenly appeared to you, would you have the confidence to start talking to her? Could you make yourself push through that fear?</i><br>\r\nYou think, holding your manicured fingers gently in front of you (as there's nowhere else to put them) of what you can do to make her feel better.<br>\r\n\"I mean it.\" You speak more softly than last time, and instinctively rub her arm in reassurance. \"I appreciate you coming out to check on me, and I'd love to show you round town.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles as you say this, clearly fighting back the tears. She's a little shorter than you, maybe four or five inches. A bit of your hair has flopped down in front of your eye as you lean in to reassure her. With your other hand, you flick it behind your ear, noting the smell - strawberries, or peaches - something fruity and feminine. It reminds you of what has happened to you, and you feel even more embarassed, blushing even more, and renew your determination to get to Spells R Us.<br>\r\n\"I feel s-so embarassed, I'm b-b-being a t-t-total d-drama queen.\" She could hardly look at you as she spoke, she kept looking shamefully at the floor. \"I c-c-came out here to see i-if you're okay, just the w-way you ran out...\"<br>\r\n\"I'll be okay,\" you squeeze her arm, softly, and smile as you say it. <br>\r\nYou need to come up with some excuse for running out, \"I've just gone through some changes in the past few days, and...\" you clutch for something, \"Right before I ran out, I had some bad news I wasn't expecting.\"<br>\r\n\"A-anything serious?\"<br>\r\n\"I'll be okay.\" You smiled as you said it - you hoped it was true. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking your hand off the girl, you look yourself up and down - the arm you are pulling back to yourself is long, elegant, with transparent nail polish, you're wearing a medium length black skirt, ending just above the knee, with your legs bare below that. You can feel a slight breeze. Your tanktop is black as well, with quite large breasts (though you weren't used to looking at them from this angle), and your stomach felt tighter, more toned. You're wearing a white belt, though you can only see the sides, your breast obscure the front of your lower body, and you haven't the experience to know how to look round them.<br>\r\nSuddenly you realised you were checking yourself out, and remembered you had to get to the Mall quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to get going,\" you say, \"But I'll look out for you tomorrow, come over and see me if you see me first.\" She nodded in agreement. \"In fact, I'll tell my brother to keep a look out for you as well, his name's Elliot Barnes.\" <br>\r\nHopefully you'll be back to yourself by tomorrow, and while she may not be attracted to you in your male form, she was still cute enough for you to enjoy her company. Besides, being attracted to a girl who didn't feel the same way was hardly anything new, was it?<br>\r\n\"I'm A-april. April Sutton.\" You have to come up with a name of your own...<br>\r\n\"Sally. Sally Barnes.\" <br>\r\nYou smile at her, and she smiles back, nervously, shyly, like she can't believe her luck that such a beautiful woman wants to spend time with her. There's a tension between the two of you, you can feel her checking you out, and you're suddenly more aware of your new femininity. You can feel a stronger wind blow across your legs, your heart is beating quickly beneath your breast, your cheeks are blushing, and your lips seem almost to be itching to kiss April. You lick your lips - softer and larger than you are used to - and look at April's. You think how good it would make her feel if you placed your hand on her chin, gently drew her near and gave her a....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou break away, mid-thought.<br>\r\n\"I've got to get going.\" As she nods, you squeeze her, tightly, your breasts just above hers, and feeling bizarre between the two of you. <i>They might even be bigger than Penelope's,</i> you think to yourself, before tearing yourself away.<br>\r\nYou run off, to leave before you're tempted to turn back, looking over your shoulder only once, from a distance. <br>\r\nYour hair flops across the whole of your face as you turn.<br>\r\nHer cheeks are redder than a tomato, and she's grinning from ear to ear. <br>\r\nBizarre as this experience is, you enjoy having a prety girl fancy you - it isn't all bad.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You need to get back to the mall <i>now;</i> nothing in that backpack is as important as confronting the man who did this to you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus decided, you stomp off toward the mall\u2014and promptly stop stomping, as the violent motion nearly causes your ample breasts to bounce right out of your tank top.  After a moment spent collecting yourself, you start out again, this time carefully forcing yourself to adopt a more regulated pace.  Even the gentlest stride you can manage isn't enough to completely control the fleshy wobbling, but at least you're able to reach the mall without further compromising your modesty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt still isn't enough to deter unwanted attentions, however; as you make your way across the mall parking lot the driver of a passing pickup sounds his horn appreciatively.  You practically jump out of your shoes at that sudden blast, which obviously amuses the driver and his passenger to no end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, though, you do finally reach the mall.  There's no shortage of lecherous ogling in here, either, but you don't care anymore\u2014you're almost to the store!  Almost back to normal! Throwing modesty aside, you break into a jog, shamelessly using your hands to keep your oversized bosom from escaping your top as you take the escalator two steps at a time.  You're probably quite the sight, but it's worth the embarrassment because in just a few more seconds you're there.... in front of the closed store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSore, embarrassed and out of breath, you stand there, panting helplessly in front of the darkened storefront.  It's barely four o'clock, and every other store in the mall is still bustling with activity.  But not Spells 'R Us.  The shop is as silent as midnight, tightly locked behind slats of rolling steel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo...\u201d you mutter, \u201cThey can't be closed...  They can't be...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut closed they are, with no indication of when they might be open again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d you shout, shaking the bars with your hands.  \u201cNooo!  They <i>can't</i> be closed! I can't be stuck like this!  I CAN'T BE A GIRL!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slam your fists against the bars again, screeching incoherently until you hear a loud rumble from behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat seems to be the problem, miss?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around, coming face to face with a portly, balding man in a mall security uniform.  From the way his eyes snap upward when you turn around, you realize the man had been checking out your ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhhh...\u201d you stammer, manicured hands still clutching the security gate.</span></div></div>",

Your new breasts are getting really annoying - although you're not running at any real speed, they're bouncing up and down so much you feel like they'll hit you in the face. You suddenly notice that your shoes are pretty comfortable to run in, and looking down realize you're wearing a pair of smart black flat shoes. <br>\r\n<i>Thank god, </i> you think, not knowing how you'd adapt to heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost run into someone coming out of the library, a guy you don't recognize, but you stop yourself, your bodies maybe an inch or two apart.

In fact, he seems pretty pleased to get so close to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's hardly anyone in the library, so you go straight to the table where you sat when you changed. There's no backpack there, but there is a large, silver handbag. Reluctantly, you bend down, and open it up... <br>\r\nThere's a wallet inside, your wallet. It still has your student ID, unchanged by whatever changed you, your clothing... and  apparently your backpack as well. There's some school books in there, a folded-in-half Spiderman comic, a mobile phone and house keys. Come to think of it, that's the entire contents of your backpack and pockets.  Closing your bag again, you decide to get out and to the mall as quickly as possible, it must already be getting close to the end of the day.<br>\r\nYou carry your bag by the strap, as you head to the door, before you realize you'd look more believable as a woman if you slip it over your shoulder.<br>\r\nAs you walk out, Mrs Hawk, the elderly librarian, glared at you with what appeared to be disgust. <br>\r\nAwkwardly, you smile back. Had you done something wrong?<br>\r\nThen it hits you. You're a large-breasted, short-skirted young woman, carrying what appeared to be an expensive handbag. You're bound to get a few looks like that from women.<br>\r\nAs if this wasn't hard enough already...</span></div></div>",

Holding your large metallic handbag, over your shoulder and kept in place by your manicured and painted hand, while you felt the air rush against your lower legs, up your skirt at one point...it was all a strange and quite nice experience. <br>\r\nThere was at least twice you were sure a guy had been checking you out, and you found the idea quite exciting, your heart beating faster at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the mall now, you speed up the last part of the journey, to Spells R Us...only to find it closed. Crap.<br>\r\nIt's not even five o clock yet, but you suppose he didn't seem the type for conventional business practices. <br>\r\nYou can always call back first thing in the morning, but what would you do tonight?<br>\r\nThinking quickly, you consider your options. Your best bet would be to try and stay with either Kyle or Matthew, but how would you convince them of the truth? That you used a magical powder, intending to make a cute stranger fall for you, but instead turned into her ideal partner, a member of her own gender...<br>\r\nKyle's a smart guy, he might be able to be persuaded there's things beyond what he knows scientifically. He used to be a UFO nut a few years back, so maybe he could be persuaded? <br>\r\nMatthew would be useless for anything like that, but he pretty much thinks with his dick, maybe you could... I don't know, do something? Lead him on, then spend the night on the settee. You shudder a bit at the thought, but his parents are out of town at the moment, it is more or less achievable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly your thoughts are broken by a guy, a few years older than you and wearing a shirt and tie, checking you out as he walks past, barely five feet away. The breeze of his motion sends a soft gust up your skirt, causing it to ruffle a little. He smiles dirtily, then turns his back after a few seconds, walking on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around - the mall is more of an after-school hangout than a place of business at this time of day, with groups of kids at different ages all over. You notice a group of boys, about fourteen or fifteen years old, at the fast food joint. Their body positions look as if they are all faced toward you, but none of their faces were looking the same way. <br>\r\nOne of them looked in your direction, then, after about half a second looks away again. They're saying something to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not sure whether you like this or not. You can feel a nervous excitement every time you think someone's checking you out, and a sort of adrenalin rush, but you feel yourself blushing, embarrassed at...you're not quite sure exactly what you're embarrassed at.<br>\r\nIs it the fact you're being treated like a beautiful woman and have no experience dealing with the attention? Fear that they'll find out the truth about you? Is it shame and embarrassment about the fact you're quite enjoying it?<br>\r\n<i>How beautiful am I?</i> you think. You've seen your figure, your legs, hair smells nice, and people seem to be reacting to you well, but you realize you've not even seen your new face. Presumably you have a different face - it would be bizarre otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember thinking earlier that your stomach felt tighter, so you hit it, lightly, with your knuckles. <br>\r\nIt does feel really tight to the touch.<br>\r\nYou put your free hand, the one not holding your bag, under your top, and try and squeeze a bit of stomach fat. You would have found this easy this morning, but the feel of your stomach is tight and muscular, and totally hairless. <br>\r\nIn fact, thinking about it, your tight hairless stomach feels almost as strange as the large breasts you can't help but see when you look down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the gap on this higher level, you notice a middle-aged man, clearly submissive to his wife who was speaking to him without reply, looking over at you. <br>\r\nInstinctively, you wave, and smile a little. <br>\r\nHis face lights up.<br>\r\n<i>I've got to get out of here,</i> you think. At least to somewhere quiet, where I can think for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk off, and almost straight away, hear a half dozen wolf-whistles from the boys.<br>\r\n<i>Anywhere but here. </i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Kyle's the smarter of the pair, no doubt; probably the smartest of the whole trio, loathe as you are to admit it.  True, he can be a little eccentric, and his passion for his personal projects can be downright obsessive at times. But maybe, in this case, that kind of fervor is exactly what you need in an ally.

He may not be an intellectual match for Kyle where academia is concerned, but he's savvy, decisive, and\u2014when he wants to be\u2014absolutely relentless.  His preoccupation with seducing women (or, as he calls it, \u201cbagging bimbos,\u201d which may have something to do with why he hasn't succeeded yet) might be awkward in your current state, but he'll definitely listen, and if you <i>can</i> convince him of your plight, he'll probably have a plan in no time.  He's also the only member of your group with any real athletic ability, a trait which might prove invaluable if getting back to normal ends up requiring more dangerous means than a customer service complaint.</span></div></div>",

This is a problem that needs figuring it out, and of everyone you know, Kyle's most likely to make the connections needed to sort through this bizarre situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou root around in your handbag to find your phone - there isn't as much space as in your backpack, so everything is crammed together. Looking at your thin, manicured hand rooting through the handbag hanging on one strap from your other shoulder, you become hyper-aware of how girly and feminine you must look. Taking your phone out, you walk to a quiet part of the mall. There are only a few shops here, mostly empty storefronts as a result of the economic troubles. This part of the mall was the most remote, and had always had the lowest quality shops, independent and unpopular shops that could least afford to survive difficulties. Some of the remaining ones have gone part-time, and had apparently closed down early today. Hardly anyone is coming past.<br>\r\nYou look through your phone contacts, your long fingernails colliding with the screen. Clearly you're not used to your new physical dimensions. The contacts on your phone all seem unchanged, as is the phone itself. You type a text message to Kyle: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                 I need your help. Can you be home alone, and help me with a problem? Will take most or all of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnxious, you want him to reply immediately. Impatiently, you look at your hand holding the phone, and turn it over to look at your fingernails. Very tidy, smoothly curving nails, maybe an inch or two longer than your fingers. Your dark hair flops down in front of your eyes. You can smell the fruity shampoo, or perfume -  whatever it is. It feels strange having so much up there - normally your hair is so short, but there's a sort of weight to it. Not that it's heavy, but it's like wearing a hat, you're not used to having so much. Looking down, some of your hair reaches your breasts, and, when you move about, you can feel it brushing against your back at the same length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour phone beeps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">Sure, anything I can do. Srs?</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretty serious, yeah. How much do you want to tell him? Would even Kyle believe you if you told him what had happened straight off? Probably not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">I've been in an accident, need help figuring out how to fix it. It's strange, prepare to be shocked. Can you get rid of your parents, so we can talk in private?</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you waited for a reply, you looked down at your cleavage. Well presented in your black tank top, it's definitely a decent size. You can't be sure what size - you'd seen plenty of breasts (mainly on the internet, a few in real life) but never from this angle. <br>\r\nYou wait, irritably, for Kyle to text back. <br>\r\nYou walk around tensely, and rub your fingers against each other. You hadn't noticed how soft they were until now - your hands were hardly the result of hard physical labor beforehand, but these...these are really soft to the touch.<br>\r\nAnother thought occurs to you as you wait. You run your delicate fingers across the top of your breasts, stroking one, and then the other, first with your finger, then your nail. You can feel yourself blushing in arousal, feeling a tingling all up and down your body, you felt a temptation to move lower down, inside your tanktop...<br>\r\nYour phone beeps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">Iv arranged it. Mum + dad going out 4 meal + drink in half an hour. House is ours until late. Can you tell me any details?</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh darkly when you read that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">Better you see for yourself.

You'd been wondering what you looked like ever since the walk to the mall, it couldn't hurt to take a quick look now.<br>\r\nAnd, you reason to yourself, it'd be helpful to see how much you look like yourself, so you know how Kyle will react.<br>\r\nJust five minutes looking in the mirror in the toilets, ten at the max.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can feel the air rush past your hairless lower legs as you walk, the feeling is quite nice. Fleetingly, you think about buying a kilt when all of this is sorted out.<br>\r\nYou hesitate for a second before you enter the ladies' toilets, and walk over to the sinks, each with a mirror, with your head down. You put your handbag beside one sink. You brace yourself, take a deep breath, and look up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl you see reflected back at you...she is stunningly beautiful. A long, thin face, rosy cheeks, large lips and long eyelashes, skin that's tanned just to the point of browning... The hair looks like it took a lot of effort to prepare. Glossy and black, a portion of it swept across the girl's forehead and down beside her face, and more fell down, from the head to the plain black tank top, beyond the lowest point on her breasts, and more still behind the head. <br>\r\nYou realize the girl you're staring at is staring back with a look of confusion. Realizing that's how you're feeling, you smile, and she does the same - a small, sly smile. This face is a serious face, you think - of someone who doesn't smile that much. Perhaps of a model who takes herself a bit too seriously.<br>\r\nSuddenly it strikes you that the girl in the mirror is yourself, that she's not just someone who happens to be doing the same actions as yourself, she actually is you. <br>\r\nYou already knew this, of course, but given how crazy the idea is, you're still finding it hard to digest.<br>\r\nYou press your lips shut, against each other, and watch as your reflected self does the same. You can feel the difference - they feel bigger and softer than your male lips, as if they had little pillows inserted into them.<br>\r\nYou look around, then, sure that no-one is watching you, pull a silly face. Eyes wide open to the point of popping out, and your tongue sticking out of a mouth stretched wide.... You laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look yourself - your whole body - up and down in the mirror. Figure hugging tank top and a skirt that ends just above the knee, both in black, separated by a white belt. Incredible curves - in and out very sharply. You knew about the breasts, but it turns out you've got a similarly cushioned backside, and - you tap your stomach through the top - you've got a tight midriff as well.<br>\r\nOnly a few minutes ago you were panicking, but now it just seems too surreal, you can't help but enjoy checking yourself out. <i>It's going to be a while before you get so close a look at such a beautiful woman again, </i> you tell yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChecking again that no-one's around, you place your right hand on your hip, and whisper to yourself:<br>\r\n\"Elliot Barnes is so sexy!\" Your voice is deep, sultry. With the serious face, it adds to the impression of a self-controlled, sexual woman. Looking into the mirror, you speak more slowly, over-pronouncing your words: \"Elliot Barnes...\" you run your free left hand through your hair, \"is THE greatest lover, any girl, ever had!\" <br>\r\nYou stare seductively into the mirror as you say all this, acting out years' worth of thoughts and ideas, of how an incredible babe like this would come onto you, ideas that have filled your fantasies and wet dreams. After finishing speaking, you lick your lips, aim your face down towards the floor, look up only with your eyes, and smile, naughtily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face is flushed with excitement. Your cheeks, which you've felt blush repeatedly since your transformation, now feel like they're on fire. You think...yes, you think you can feel your panties start to get moist. You lift up the lower part of your tank top, to get a closer look at your new tight abs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hadn't expected that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tattoo, and a large one. You pull the tank top up higher and higher, to be able to see the full thing - a red-haired woman, naked, wrapped in vines, her eyes closed and looking upward, as if in orgasm. <br>\r\nThe artwork is quite detailed, you're impressed by the image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder if this magic has tailored your new body to April's specific desires - if so, the sweet seeming girl clearly has a very dirty mind. You run your hand over the tattoo, and the tight, soft skin below it...and wince when you feel a bit of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou push your body tightly against the chipboard sink, as close to the mirror as possible, to get a closer look. You can see a mark, about level with your belly-button but to the right, and visible through the tattoo-girl's naked rear end.<br>\r\nYou press against it again, and again it hurts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you remember - a week or two ago, you'd went paintballing with the guys, and Matthew had decided it'd be funny to shoot you at point-blank range. You realize how great this is - you can use this to try and convince Kyle that you really are who you say you are!<br>\r\nYour mind focused on the important task ahead, you wonder what you were doing before. You were checking yourself out, and enjoying your body...how far would you have gone with it? The magic was called 'lust powder', did it transform you into not just a girl, but a slut? Or was what you were doing just because of your own, pathetic self?<br>\r\nYou shudder a bit, and decide it's best not to think about it. There's only two possible answers, and neither of them are good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull down your tanktop to cover your entire stomach (and feel the material press tightly against your breasts), then pick up your handbag and head straight to Kyle's house.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But the pressure from the impact dug your nails under your soft skin, causing you a moment of ever so slight pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the sound of footsteps barreling down the stairs, then Kyle opens the door...and a look of confusion spreads across his face.<br>\r\n\"It's me, Elliot,\" you tell him. His eyebrows furrow lower, into an expression of deeper confusion.<br>\r\n\"You must have the wrong house. I don't know any woman called Elliot -\"<br>\r\n\"I sent you a text,\" you interrupt. \"I just sent you a text saying I look really different. But...but it's me. Elliot Barnes.\"<br>\r\nYou stood there silently for a second, inwardly begging that he'll trust you. It's humiliating enough to have this weird change happen to you, you don't feel like you can bear to be cast out by one of your best friends.<br>\r\nTrying to contain your anger, you look down, and are surprised to see your soft skin protruding through the large hole in the top of you tanktop.<br>\r\nIn your anger, you must have forgotten your appearance on some level.<br>\r\n\"Okay, this is a pretty weird prank,\" Kyle laughed. \"But I don't know why Elliot thought I'd fall for it. How do you know him anyway?\"<br>\r\nYou felt the rage building up inside you - you want to punch him. After all you've done together, now he doesn't recognize you? Do your shared experiences count for nothing?<br>\r\n\"It's me,\" you insist, your voice raised. \"I've been texting you, I told you I've been changed. It's some sort of magic, it's turned me into a woman.\"<br>\r\nKyle leans against the frame of the open door, smiling.<br>\r\n\"Really? That's the best he can come up with? Normally he's good at pranking me, but he's off his game a bit with this one.\"<br>\r\n\"Ask me something only I would know,\" you demand.<br>\r\nFor a moment, Kyle looked at you suspiciously, then began to think.<br>\r\n\"Okay. When James Cameron was planning to direct a Spiderman film, who did he want as Doc Octopus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy really is useless - that's what he came up with?<br>\r\n\"Arnold Schwarzenegger. Now how about you come up with something millions of people don't know, that only me and you would know?\"<br>\r\nKyle is a smart guy - he honestly is - but at times his intelligence can be so... impractical. He can store up thousands of little facts, recognize the signs that match different famous UFO sightings, but ask him to come up with a practical test, and for some reason he can't focus his intellect in that way.<br>\r\n\"Who's your most serious ex-girlfriend?\"<br>\r\n\"Rachel Adams.\" The two of you had dated for almost six months.<br>\r\n\"Why did you break up?\"<br>\r\n\"Her parents moved to Canada.\" Also, she said you were getting clingy. But you tend to gloss over that fact.<br>\r\n\"Who do you have a crush on?\" That was slightly more complicated, and a bit embarrassing to say out in the open, where anyone passing in the street could hear. But you were learning to deal with embarrassment today.<br>\r\n\"Penelope, Kate, and Annie. It's all, a bit complicated...\" Embarrassed, you look down, straight at your protruding cleavage. Hair fell from behind your ear across your face. \"Penelope knows I like her, but she doesn't feel the same. Kate...maybe she might, but she's got a boyfriend, and besides, I don't want to make things awkward like they are with Penny. Annie Breen...I don't know Annie that well, but she's smart and cute, and I think she might like me.\"<br>\r\nYou'd told Kyle all this before - he was one of two friends who you felt close enough to talk about this stuff with, and as Kate was the other, she'd been out of the question. From the look on his face, he was considering what you were saying.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but this talk about magic, it's just not something I can believe in. Tell Elliot good try, but he'll have to come up with something less weird next time. Sorry.\"<br>\r\nKyle stepped out of the door-frame, and began to swing it shut.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Acting quickly, you stick your foot in the door. It hurts - while these shoes had the advantage of not being heeled, there was hardly anything to them. They feel like they're made of far thinner material than black leather shoes for men would be.<br>\r\nWith Kyle taken by surprise, you shove him in the chest with both palms, pushing him down on the lower steps of the stairs. Your handbag starts to spill as you move forward, spilling your phone and the Spiderman comic, and one of the books containing your schoolwork.<br>\r\nYou bend down to pick them up, almost tearing your skirt as you do so. You'd positioned your legs slightly apart in a masculine manner before going down, and the skirt doesn't give you the freedom that motion requires.<br>\r\n\"If I'm not Elliot, why do I have these?\" you yell at him, waving the Spiderman comic and what turned out to be your math book at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then get to your feet, and head into his front room, where you slip the handbag off your shoulder and throw it down heavily to the floor. You dump the school book and comic as well, then sink into the armchair with your usual bad posture, the middle of your spine at the base of the armchair, where the coccyx should be.<br>\r\nSlumping in one of the chairs in Kyle's front room should in theory be familiar and reassuring, but it puts you at an angle where the lower half of your vision is taken up by your breasts. You close your eyes so you don't have to think about them, but your smell - either perfume or shampoo, smelling of strawberries and peaches - is impossible to escape.<br>\r\nYou open your eyes again, and Kyle is stood over you, eyebrows furrowed in confusion.<br>\r\n\"What do I have in my spare room?\" he asks.<br>\r\n\"What?\" You're not in the mood for some stupid game.<br>\r\n\"Things only Elliot would know.\"<br>\r\n<i>Finally, he's getting the hang of it,</i> you think to yourself. His recent obsession had been a secret from his parents, and he didn't share it at school.<br>\r\n\"You've been trying to make your own alcohol. You've got...\" you realize you don't know what they're called. \"Plastic tubey things. Is it a still, it's called?\" <br>\r\nWhy did he have to ask you something you don't properly understand? <br>\r\n\"There's metal springs as well!\" you add desperately, almost as a last resort.<br>\r\n\"How would we get up to my loft?\"<br>\r\nThat was better.<br>\r\n\"The stepladder only comes down into your bedroom. But the window up there's just about wide enough to squeeze out onto the flat part of the roof.\"<br>\r\nKyle looked shocked, as if he was starting to come around. You realize it probably would be shocking, to spend all that time learning the rules for how UFOs work, and now he was going to learn the secret to gender-altering magic instead.<br>\r\n\"Elliot?\" he looked at you with complete disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit up, on the edge of the chair, legs apart as wide as the constricting skirt will allow. You can't resist the temptation to run your hands across your lower legs. The naked, smooth leg against your palms feel incredibly erotic - you feel a sort of arousal, but without the physical pressure of your manhood.<br>\r\nKyle looks you up and down in disbelief. You follow his eyes, and wonder why he's stopped by looking at the lower part of you. You realize, with your legs so far apart, he can probably see your underwear. You close your legs tight, your cheeks bursting into flame at the embarrassment. You wanted to jump up out of your chair and thump him, but in your current state you're not sure it's a good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" your friend says, looking you in the face. \"It's just...you know.\"<br>\r\nHis cheeks were red as well, but you felt flushed with pleasure at the admission he was checking you out, you suddenly felt...erotic. It was a shock - not just the sensation of being aroused, as you had in the mall bathroom, but the realization that <i>you</i> were causing this reaction...<br>\r\nYou enjoyed the feeling, but struggled to put into words the reasons why. Thinking in the context of past experiences, you thought about times you'd fooled around with Rachel, when Annie had laughed at your jokes and punched you in the arm, at a party when you'd copped a feel with some girl whose name you never learned.<br>\r\nIn those moments, seeing a cute smile or with a boob in your hand, you felt like you'd been granted brief access to the joy of female sexuality - when Kyle checked you out, it felt like you were swimming deeply in it. It was the same feeling when you were checked out at the mall, you realized, and when you looked yourself in the mirror at the mall bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought crosses your mind - you can show Kyle the bruise on your lower torso, to remove any doubt that it's you. <br>\r\nBut he'd need to look closely at the bruise, maybe even feel it. And you're not sure you feel comfortable letting Kyle close to your body when he's clearly attracted to it...</span></div></div>",

You claim to be feeling sick in order to avoid coming down for dinner\u2014the prospect of accidentally touching a family member is something you shudder even to contemplate.   Instead, you watch some funny videos on the internet, work your way through the single-player campaign of Strike Force III, and just generally waste as much time as you can.

You could pretend to be sick, then head back to the school after it ends\u2014ostensibly to pick up missed assignments but really in order to bump into Annie.

You don't even realize that one of the woman glaring daggers at you was once your mother. You give a breathy sigh and sway your bountiful hips a bit more as you walk towards the door, sending your girls bobbing pleasurably in your tank top. Your smaller, manicured hands press up agaisnt the door's push handle and just like that you exit from the hospital and into a sunny new world where you drew the eyes of men from all around. The sun felt perfect on your cleavage as your click-clacked your way across the pavement towards your cute hot pink convertible Beetle, and you smile once more at tonight's festivities as you slide into the vehicle and begin to pull out of the parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, for the newly minted Kaley Roberts, life was perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drive back home to your cute little rental house in the suburbs, laughing as the wind pulled your hair in every direction as you drove down the streets of the city. At every stoplight you could feel the eyes upon you, men staring at you from theri vehicles, as they walked by on the sidewalk, everything about you screamed that you were something to be desired. And with your slightly below average intelligence, that was all that you could ever really be. But you didn't worry your pretty head about that. After all, your mommy and daddy helped you with all the hard things you couldn't understand and you were more than happy to just spend your nights dancing and your days shopping or having fun with your girlfriends (and numerous boytoys).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull into your driveway and mince your way to your front door, unlocking it and pulling yourself inside with a clatter of keys. The interior of your home is generic; dull neutral paint adorning the walls, frilly curtains that you found ohsocute during a day of shopping, the pile of clothes leading into the single bedroom that were a mixture of yours and someone else's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slide your heels off and creep towards the bedroom door and the darkened room inside. He was still right where you left him, snoring away in a sex induced slumber from the bronco ride hours before. You couldn't remember what his name was, but you did know he had been especially fun. A twinge of wetness filled your crotch as you thought about the massive cock that slid into you over and over, your breasts heaving, your body climzing in a cascade of blonde hair. IT had been sooooooo much fun. But as far as you knew the man was just another patron of your work; someone who was generous enough with his tips that you decided to reward him. Little did you realize that in your former life, this man had been your father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gently wake him up and help him to your small shower. He stills reeks of alcohol and his incoherent mumbling and groans of pain mean that he's still far too hungover. You pity him and while he clumsily bumps around in your bathroom you gather up his clothes and call a taxi to take him back to the club. He could find his way from there. The man seems slightly more alert after pulling himself from your shower and he attempts to pull you into his arms, but you push him away gently with a slender arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, sweetie, I, like, totally don't date customers!\" You giggle and you do feel a twinge of regret that you'll probably never see his monster cock again as he stumbles his way to the waiting taxi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well! My doctor is sooo much cuter anyway!\" You sigh in your singsong voice, and you quickly clean up around your house, washing your bed spread and cleaning up the signs and smells of sex. As you wait for your laundry to finish you settle back on the huge couch your daddy bought for you and click on the TV. Most of the shows move too fast for you to understand and the news makes you sad, but soon you find a movie that you have seen before. You still don't really understand what it is about, but you love the male lead sooo much! You start to get wet again as you watch him bravely stride through danger as his appearance become more and more rugged. You try to ignore the female lead and imagine yourself in her place as the two make love near the end of the movie, and your hands find their way to your crotch as you bite your lower lip in anticipation. Soon the movie and your enjoyment is over and you realize that you need to start getting ready for your date with your doctor man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hop into the shower and cover yourself with with soap and try to be a good girl and not play with yourself. The temptation is great but you make it, and you spend the next two hours primping and preening yourself with makeup and trying on outfits until you find the little red dress that is simply perfect against your creamy skin and mane of blonde hair. Even your blue eyes seem to sparkle even more with the makeup and the dress's effects on your natural, now amplified beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had just finished putting on the perfect coat of lipstick when the door bell rang. He was here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm coming!\" You cry out as you slide on your dress heels and click towards the door.</span></div></div>",

You only have a moment to brush the long, dark hair out of your eyes and glance down at the twin mountains that are protruding from your clothes, which had morphed into a single hospital gown. You could feel your bare skin of your no doubt large rear resting against the sheet of cloth on the hospital examination table. You gulp in fear as you realize you've transformed into a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, we could get in big trouble for this\" The nurse coos as she turns back to you, her hands quickly unbuttoning her shirt and revealing her ample cleavage resting gently within a deep purple bra. \"But what can I say, I just can't resist the kink factor\". She takes two quick steps across the room and pulls the blind down over the room's door, blocking the small window slit and sliding a key into the door's lock, twisting it shut with a near silent click. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that the nurse scoops you up in her arms and begins passionately kissing you on your new lips, her slender hands caressing your neck as her own mountains press pleasurably against your own. You're too shocked for to do anything but respond in kind and suddenly everything feels fuzzy in your head as warmth and wetness blossoms in your new found womanhood. Things that once felt strange now felt natural and exciting, the alien hands, breasts and tongue rubbing against your own now familiar. You find yourself responding to the woman's searching kisses as you drape your own long, slender arms around her neck and pull her in closer to you as you return her hungry kisses with that of your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you had not been intoxicated in the moment, you would have realized that reality had changed, and that you were no longer Elliot Barnes, the young adult male, but Ellie Cunnigham, a twenty-four year old woman who was currently making love to her partner Rachel Harrington at her place of work. You weren't really sick, but you had both been interested in taking a risk beyond your nightly sessions of lovemaking and had snuck into the hospital for the excitement factor. But the thoughts were blurred away by the etcasy of sex, and you giggle girlishly as your new lover's hands slide across your bare back and undo the simple knot holding your hospital gown in place. Your newly green eyes flutter closed as the warmth in your newly yet always had been in this reality feminine crotch reached critical mass as she slowly pulled you down onto the examination table, her breath hot and heavy, comforting warmth to the table's cold leather surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hands pull at Rachel's uniform as you rapidly approach a climax.</span></div></div>",

Luckily, this mutation of the Girl Flu, as well as all the other mutations, lose their ability to be infectious after mutation, so the silver lining, if any, is you need not worry about infecting others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne fell to her knees distraught.

Just how much longer do I have?\" She muscles out, trying to keep her composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor shows both of you a chart, much like he had just done with you to show what you had in store in path to girlhood, but now it was for Anne to show her what she had to expect as she began to devolve into a ditzy airheaded big boobed blond bimbo:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDay 1-4: Loss of concentration begins.<br>\r\nDay 3: Intelligence begins to diminish very slowly.<br>\r\nDay 4: Hair begins to lighten. If hair is shoulder length or shorter, hair will also begin to grow longer, and will continue to grow until it reaches posterior over three day period.<br>\r\nDay 5-10: Breasts begin to grow, always growing to a minimum size of G-cup. Skin and genital nerve endings will increase in sensitivity to pleasurable sensations over this period as well.<br>\r\nDay 5: First of three major boosts in libido.<br>\r\nDay 6-8: Tissue of the glutenous region begins to fill out and firm.<br>\r\nDay 7: The infected will acquire a sudden aversion to wearing anything but the most revealing of clothing, regardless of their previous opinions of said clothing, and will acquire a disdain for pants and shorts, only wanting to wear miniskirts of some form. This psychological trait is still being studied.<br>\r\nDay 9: Second of the three major boosts in libido. Waists contract to 20\", or what is commonly known as 'size zero,' as hips flare outward.<br>\r\nDay 10: Skin begins to darken, acquiring a tanned complexion. Loss of concentration accelerates.<br>\r\nDay 12: Third and final increase in libido. Intelligence loss increases rapidly throughout the day, exacerbated by intercourse, which by this point the infected will have little desire to resist an offer to have, or failing to find a partner, will masturbate. Regardless, orgasm seems to help accelerate the IQ loss the infected experiences, with those that started with higher intellects losing more and more intellect each time over those that had less intellect to begin with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So in 12 days, I'm just going to be some big-breasted slut?!\" Anne exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More like nine, as like Elliot, your infection is already on it's third day, so you should begin to feel your intelligence loss beginning today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god...\" Anne sobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe...\" you put your hand on her shoulder, \"...maybe we can help each other through this, together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds good....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you walk out of the office back to the waiting room, when the doctor, whom has gone to his lab to look at your bloodwork and Anne's side by side, has a concerned look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phyllis. Contact the CDC. I think there's someone deliberately spreading a new more contagious strain Girl Flu out there, one that's also more likely to mutate in natural-born women as well, and I have a nagging feeling they're not done yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*flash-forward to the present*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girl Flu... Your dad is going to be shocked, maybe a little paranoid. Ever since he heard about on the news, he's become a little bit of a hypochondriac. Eh... don't be surprised if he tries to avoid contact with nya-ou until... until you fully change. I wouldn't put it past him to try to quarantine you... or himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise an eyebrow. Did your mom just utter a minute meow in that sentence?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, this is gonna be fun. Always wanted a daughter, yet I ended up with 4 sons. Nya-ow with the Girl Flu, I get my chance!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething is definitely off, but you don't want to spook you mom, since she is DRIVING right now, so you don't bring it up. \"Well, I do have a friend who is dealing with a variant of the Flu herself that will be helping with the change, a girl from school. Her name is Anne...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A girl, eh?\" your mom coyly remarks, before being puzzled by this. \"Wait? How did she get the Flu?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She got a mutated version of it - er, 'Bimbonic Necrosis,' I think it was called. She's torn up about it, because she used to be one of the smartest girls in school, and now it's going to turn her into one of those big boobed blonde bimbos in nine more days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's terrible!!\" your mother laments. \"I never knew the Girl Flu could do... that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout then, you pulled up to your house and got out. That's when you saw your dad dressed up like he worked for Hazmat or the CDC himself, wearing a piecemeal biohazard suit he seemed to learned how to make on the internet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi son...\" his muffled voice echoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night's supper went mostly like usual, except for one of your two younger brothers, Jacob, poking fun at the fact you're turning into a girl, you breathing on him to scare him, your dad eating supper in the garage, which he had converted into a makeshift \"clean room...\" oh, and the fact that the your mom wanted milk with her supper. Wasn't she lactose intolerant?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to get some rest, but this was a strange day indeed. Just what will lay ahead for Anne and you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, how do things proceed?</span></div></div>",

The one good side to the girl flu is that you are excused from school for the next two weeks. Today your testicles supposedly will stop working, so you reach into your underwear to feel them. They are still there, but noticably less sensetive than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shower as per normal, but then you open your wardrobe to find... Horrors. It is full off girly clothes. You yell loudly,\"Just what is the meaning of this?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mum comes upstairs to respond. She explains, \"Your father and I decide that you might as well get used to this. In 3 days time you will need to wear them, my dear. Don't be upset. I know you must have a hard time trying to adjust.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to grab the least girly clothes possible, a yellow bra, a black t-shirt, a pair of pink (there were some others, but all with too many frills) and a pair of dark blue shorts. The panties still press against your crotch badly, but luckily it is not as sensitive now. The bra at the moment hangs loose, so your mum decides to put water balloons inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel and look weird dressed as a girl, since your face and skin are not going to change until day 7. You decide to shave all the hair off of your chin and body so that you will only look moderately weird. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mum also has a blonde wig, because for some reason apparently, victims of girl flu usually have their hair change colour due to distruptions in their DNA. You can already see bits of yellow at the base of your hair, so you guess she must be right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day is spent reading on the internet for information on girl culture. You still have 3 days to go.</span></div></div>",

Doing so is quite a new experience, it feels like runny poo in large quantities. You have to remember to wipe your bottom now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to be a bit more adventrous today, so you put on a more frilly, but also pink pair of panties. Today, you choose a bra that covers up your still-flat chest very well. You don't want anybody to notice that they are fake. You also get a knee-length skirt, but you keep the t-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt feels strange to have air rush up your skirt and touch your butt, especially now you use it to pee. You feel almost naked. Your legs are also restrained by the skirt, making walking difficult. You walk around a bit to get used to it. Today, your crotch is even numb-er than before. You only notice the bulge when you try to put it on. It's almost like it's not there...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elly, we're going out today. I want you to get more used to life as a girl.\" Your mother's voice snaps you out of this. It's a good thing you wore a bra that covered well.

You keep worrying that somehow your panties will fall down and your bra will come off to reveal you. Fortunately that does not happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrive there not as nervous as when you started off. You don't know how to cope that you are getting stared at by guys and not girls. You are also paranoid that someone will recog nise you or that some pervert will look up your skirt. You do bump into a few old friends, but luckily they don't see thriugh your fake breasts and makeup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also nearly step into the wrong toilet a few times. You are initially very nervous, but you soon realise that you are simply in a toilet, not some sacred covent of feminity. You have to try to avoid your genitals being spotted in there by ladies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou come back home exhausted.

It comes out higher pitched and smoother. You freeze in surprise when you notice that. Your chest, or rather breasts, is/are kind of sensetive now, and swells a bit as if it's swollen. You feel inside your butt. It somehow arouses you now, like your penis did just a week ago. Speaking of which, you penis looks kind of wrinkled and shrunken now. You can't feel anyhting there anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are going to go out again today. Again, you shower, but this time you clean your breasts very carefully. Today you don't have anything more to hide, so you wear a not-too-revealing tanktop. Though you don't fear your chest being exposed, you don't like to flaunt it to the world, as that would remind you that you are female. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, you aren't as nervous as yesterday. You don't mix up the toilets anymore. At noon, which came sooner than you thought, you feel a kind of tickling in your butt. You excuse yourself to the toilet, and you see that your vagina is indeed open. It's not very big, only large enough for perhaps a pencil tip to fit in. Your penis is only half the size it started. Your are only one ste away from being a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend a few hours more at the mall. At around 4, you leave to go back home. At 4:30, you are there. You and your mum start to redecorate your room. Now, pictures of rock stars have to go down and be replaced by a pink wall. You don't have anything to paste there yet, but your mum says you will find something, sooner or later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt 6, before you have dinner, you lock yourdelf in your room, sit down and strip. Now, your breasts take up about 3/4 of your bra, and would probably need one. Your penis is hopelessly small, numb, and your ballsac seems to have merged with your soon-to-be-vacant crotch. You can't bear the thought of orgasming yet, so this round of \"exploration\" is kept brief. One day more...</span></div></div>",

Your only missing thing is your figure and periods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, you are going to try out tampoons for the first time. Like your vagina and other things, you will have to adapt to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up as usual. You are in a nightgown and matching white panties. You notice you have feeling in your crotch again, and so you reach down into your panties to feel it. Wow! A whole new set of feelings you previouly hadn't known, because your penis was in the way. Now all that remains is a smooth, feminine surface, free of any interruption. You also reach into your bra to feel for your breasts, now fully formed. Apparently they and your vagina will still expand today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head off into the bathroom again. You still find peeing an intrigueing and new experience, which you rather enjoy now instead of hating. You never felt like this before. Never...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour shower gives you a chance to admire yourself once more. D cups are very big for your age, so you can't imagine how much bigger they'll get. You can't stop thinking of how jealous <br>\r\nall the other girls must be, at your new and- You realise your last step to feminity is here. Today you become sexy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far, you haven't started that. Your figure is still mainly male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, shock of the day coming soon. You almost dress up as usual. Then, you panic as you stick your hand into your butt, only to find blood! You remember now. Your first period. Right on the dot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou as of now can't bear to stick your hand in your vagina. So, you realise you should have gotten used to it before this. The tampoon feels small in your hand, but as soon as it  gets into your pussy, it suddenly seems to expand. You, for some reason, are very agitated by this. You don't want to be a girl anymore! You just hate your life...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly you realise you're PMSing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou overcome this and try to focus on the tampoon. It seems to simulate previously unused nerves, arousing you somewhat. However, your body is not used to periods, unlike most girls your age. Your vagina is in pain now. You try to ignore the agony as you proceed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would have to come sooner or later, so you put on a short pleated skirt and a tight sleeveless blouse that shows off your cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are by no means unskilled at this, but not very good either. So, under pain, your standards slip a bit, forcing you to redo this several times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go down to the breakfast table, and you can't help but mention it to your mum. Your dad would be of no help, and anyway, and has already gone to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm on my period now,\" it feels awkward just saying that, considering you were male just a week ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really, dear? Don't worry. You'll soon get over this. In truth, the PMs is actually the worst bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is of no comfort to you. Time to change the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" What will I be called now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see, Elly doesn't sound nice. Rebecca? Brittany? Hmmm.... Ah! I'll call you Christine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... Christine...\" that name kind of suits you. \"Okay, mum.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll write to the school and the government to change your name, Christine. In the meantime, you may as well get used to your period.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you go out for more exposure again. Now, other people can see your panties more easily. By now you don't care. Not as much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are really getting the hang of shopping now. You saunter around, trying on clothes and dresses. You start to think that you really could get the hang of being a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround 11, your body starts to tingle all over. You don't really notice until the tingling gets much more intense, and your skin partially goes numb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel your breasts expand to E cup, exceptionally big. Your butt expands to match that, rounding off as a perfect bubble butt. Your head changes shape, becoming more round and smooth. Your panties and bra don't fit anymore, much to your surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hips widen while your waist shrinks, forming perfect curves. Your arms become more slender and lose muscle to become shapely, with your legs doing the same. You shoes become loose as your feet become more petite and sexy. You also feel your neck lenghten to extend the curves and your lips puff out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this happened in 5 mintres, in full view of everyone there, including your mum. After a stunned pause, your mum brings you into an underwear store to find something that fits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour transformation is finally complete. Your hair has naturally lengthened so you no longer need tthe wig. From an average boy, you are now a sexy blonde girl. What a day. What a week. What an experience of your lifetime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A note to furture authors: Remember to include Vince turning into a girl too! Annie must also be included somewhere. I think the storyline from here will deal with him meeting his friends, seeing Vince, hanging out with Annie and adjusting to school.

Why, it certainly renders the lust powder obsolete, even if it is more than a little evil.  Thus decided, you grab the collar and walk up to the front of the store, where the elderly proprietor is hanging a freshly-painted sign over the counter.  After he hammers the last nail into place, he turns to you and smiles, gesturing elaborately at the elegant lettering which reads: 'Because I am a wizard.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" he beams, \"what do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou search frantically for a tactful reply.  What to say to a grown man in a bathrobe claiming to be a wizard?  You've suspected since you first saw his robe that this guy might be more than a little senile\u2014if not actively insane\u2014but you hardly want to say that, especially if it's true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's\u2026  nice,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I most certainly am not!\" huffs the old man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not nice?\" you ask nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  No, I'm not senile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a step back.  \"How did you know\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a flourish, the old man points to the still-wet sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um\u2026 right,\" you say.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I know you don't yet believe\u2014that doesn't matter.  I only mentioned it because you asked.  Well, that and perhaps a little excitement with the new sign\u2014but mostly because you asked.  I used to have a rather nice one, you know, with embossed gold lettering and all that.  I was really quite fond of it.  Quite an unfortunate affair what happened.   There were these luchadores, and\u2014ah, well, never mind.  It's a rather long story and I'm sure you have places to go.  Now, what can I help you with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuchadores?  As in masked Mexican wrestlers?  Whatever\u2014the man's probably crazy anyway. Better to make your purchase and get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh, how much for this collar?\" you ask, brandishing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man turns suddenly serious, all trace of his grandfatherly smile gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" he says.  \"The Collar of Mind Control. That's a very powerful artifact, young man.  Are you sure you understand what you're holding there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you realize that it is not something to be used lightly?  Once that collar is around someone's neck, it can never be removed\u2014the individual will be subject you your will for the rest of their natural life.  You will have absolute control of everything they think or do.  You can make them do anything you wish\u2014even murder.  Are you sure you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess,\" you say, blushing.  It sounds a little more evil put like that, but your decision is made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man looks at you sadly.  Finally, he nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well,\" he says.  \"You may have the collar for sixteen dollars and seventy-three cents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmptying your pocket, you are surprised to find that you have exactly that amount.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's weird, how did you know\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, the old man simply sighs wearily and points to the sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.  Right.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanding him the money, you pocket the collar and walk hurriedly out of the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce back out in the food court, you idly run your finger along the Collar's edge.  Who, you wonder, should wear it?  You decide straightaway that if you're going to have mind-control powers over someone you definitely want her to be female, but beyond that you're not sure. The easiest thing would be to simply ask one of your friends to wear it.  The only problem with that was that, well, they were your friends.  As exited as you are with the prospect of power, you're not yet sure you want to subject your best friends to a lifetime of absolute slavery.  You could always trick another classmate into wearing it, you suppose.  That said, it looked simple enough to fasten\u2014it shouldn't be too hard to just walk up behind someone and snap it shut.  That way you wouldn't have to worry about using it on someone you know at all.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She has a devilish smile and a gymnast's frame, and was once your first crush\u2014not that you ever worked up the courage to ask her out. You're no longer neighbors\u2014she moved into a bigger house across town when her dad was promoted a few years ago\u2014but you've retained that special kind of friendship that can only childhood playmates can forge.

So far, she hasn't returned any of your romantic overtures, but she has in the process started to spend more and more time with you and the gang.

Thus decided, you call her immediately to tell her about your purchase.  As you predicted, she is willing to try it with you, if a little skeptical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get to her house, she's waiting in the front yard for you, as she'd done since you were little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Elliot,\" she says, \"How's it going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been busy,\" you say, \"trying to find a job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on,\" she says. \"Why would you want to spend all day working anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe it or not,\" you say, \"we don't all have rich boyfriends to buy us gifts all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marcus isn't rich,\" she says.  \"Besides, maybe you just need to be more careful with your money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm very frugal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Says the guy who just spent sixteen dollars on a magic choker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a collar.  And for genuine magic, I'd say sixteen dollars was an excellent deal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see.  Did you bring it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate motions for you to hand it to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe examines it for a moment, then shrugs and moves to put it around her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right,\" she says.  \"Here goes\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is at exactly that moment that you hear a tiny metallic 'click' as the clasp snaps into place.  Suddenly, you feel an intense, unbearable pain, as if your very soul is being ripped from your body.  Then, in an instant, it's over and you find yourself looking the in opposite direction, out across the street instead of toward Kate's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled, you whip your head around to look for Kate.  As you do so, a thick sort of brush thumps against your neck.  Snatching at the apparition, you are surprised to find that it is not a brush but a neat blonde ponytail.  You are even more surprised to find that it is apparently attached to your head.  That's when it dawns on you.  Gulping, you slowly bring your hands down to your chest, your heart sinking as they come into contact with two small, firm lumps that can only be Kate's perky breasts. Reaching back up to your neck, you run your fingers along the smooth black leather of the Mind Control Collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt gave you control over Kate's mind, all right\u2014very, very direct control. Frantically scratching at the collar you scramble for the clasp\u2014only to discover that it has somehow disappeared.  The blood drains from your face as you remember the shopkeeper's warning:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> \"Once that collar is around someone's neck, it can never be removed\u2014the individual will be subject you your will for the rest of their natural life.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" you mutter to yourself in Kate's clear, smooth voice. \"No, no, no!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping to your knees, you grab frantically at your new body, pinching and pulling painfully at everything, producing several bruises but not a reversal of the Collar's magic.  Rising unsteadily to your feet, you rush inside and throw open Kate's kitchen drawers, searching for scissors.  Upon finding some you begin to cut at the collar, desperate to get the accursed thing off, but struggle as you might you are unable to produce so much as a scratch on the smooth leather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"For the rest of their natural life\u2026\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing the scissors to the ground, you run to the bathroom, glaring angrily into the mirror.  Staring back at you with a ferocious expression is Kate, her chest heaving and eyes red with tears.  Slamming your fist into the mirror, your frustration only increases when it doesn't shatter dramatically.  Sinking to the floor, you grope your new body in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm\u2026  I'm Kate,\" you say softly.  \"Forever\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i41.tinypic.com/14lr0op.png\">Illustration</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"http://i41.tinypic.com/14lr0op.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill in shock, you wander mechanically around Kate's familiar house,  suddenly made alien by the realization that this was to be <i>your</i> house now.  When you reach Kate's room, you pick slowly through her things, seeing them\u2014literally\u2014with new eyes.  Kate's volleyball trophies; her rugged pink laptop; the collage of photographs stapled energetically above her desk.  Most of them used to feature you, Kyle and Matthew; now they're mostly of Marcus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the chime of the doorbell snaps you back to attention.  Glancing out the upstairs window, you see who it is\u2014who else but Kate's boyfriend, Marcus.  Darting away from the window before he sees you, you consider your options.  You could always just pretend not to be home, but if Kate had invited him over that might just create bigger problems than you already had.  You might be better off just answering the door and pretending nothing was wrong.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It had a little giggle but was still tight. You bend over and grab a cheek. You feel your thong, and it is most definitley wet now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand back up and slip off your thong to take a closer look at your pussy.

You sit up and pull away the elastics from your hair, alowing your blonde hair to fall down beside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lie back down, but as you swing your hand backwards you hit something hard underneath the pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n``No way!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After much debate, you eventually decide that your crush Penelope would be the best target for the Mind Control Collar.  Thus decided, you call her immediately to tell her about your purchase.  As you predicted, she is extremely skeptical and demands that you bring the collar to school the next day so she can disprove your superstition.  You, of course, are quick to agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally meet up with Penelope outside school the following morning, she has just one thing on her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Elliot,\" she says, \"let me see this magic necklace of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a necklace Penelope, it's a collar,\" you say, reaching into your backpack for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well, in that case I retract my all my objections,\" she says, rolling her eyes.   \"I can't believe you let some old man trick you into spending sixteen dollars on that thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you're not just a little worried?\" you ask.  \"If this works , I'll be able to <i>control your very mind. OOOoooOOOooo!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou say that last in a spooky vampire voice, wiggling your fingers for added effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just give me the stupid necklace,\" says Penelope, snatching it from your hands.  \"We're going to be late for class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold your breath as Penelope places the collar around her neck, raising one eyebrow as she does so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See,\" she says.  \"Nothing even\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is at exactly that moment that you hear a tiny metallic 'click' as the clasp snaps into place.  Suddenly, you feel an intense, unbearable pain, as if your very soul is being ripped from your body.  Then in an instant it's over and you find yourself staring out across the parking lot, where students are arriving and going about their business as usual.  That in itself isn't odd, but what <i>is</i> odd is that just a moment ago you'd been facing the other direction, toward the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled, you whip your head around to look for Penelope.  As you do so, a tangle of light brown hair bounces across your vision.   That's when it dawns on you.  Gulping, you slowly bring your hands down to your chest, your heart sinking as they come into contact with two very large, very soft mounds that can only be Penelope's prodigious breasts.  Reaching back through the tangled brown curls that surround your neck, you run your fingers along the smooth black leather of the Mind Control Collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt gave you control over Penelope's mind, all right\u2014very, very direct control. Frantically scratching at the collar you scramble for the clasp\u2014only to discover that it has somehow disappeared.  The blood drains from your face as you remember the shopkeeper's warning: <i>\"Once that collar is around someone's neck, it can never be removed\u2014the individual will be subject you your will for the rest of their natural life.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" you whisper to yourself in Penelope's too-high, squeaky voice. \"No, no, no!  I was just supposed to control her\u2026 not like this\u2026 not forever\u2026.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stand there in shock, the first period bell rings and students begin jostling around you as they reluctantly make their way into the school.  One of them, a football player, bumps into you as he passes.  The force of the impact isn't tremendous, but it's just enough to upset your rigid pose.  You let out a high-pitched squeal as you find yourself toppling forward, suddenly confronted by an unfamiliar center of gravity.  As Penelope's generous assets smoosh painfully against the pavement, your vision suddenly blurs nearly beyond recognition.  Afraid you may have a concussion, you lay still, waiting for your vision to clear.  When it doesn't, you eventually realize why\u2014your glasses have just come off.   Once alerted to the problem, you manage to snatch the blocky frames and bring them back over your eyes, only to discover that one of the lenses now features a large crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that you can't simply lie down in the middle of the walkway without being trampled, you manage to push yourself to your knees and then, unsteadily, to your feet.  It's difficult to stand normally with so much new weight pulling to your front, and you find yourself having to constantly roll your head and shoulders forward to keep your balance. Even moving slowly and carefully it is only with difficulty that you manage to walk up the stairs and into the school.  You don't really come close to falling over again after that\u2014you soon realize that Penelope's body isn't actually unstable, just unfamiliar\u2014but your movements are still far from but graceful.  Even without the balance issues, your masculine, high-impact gait is ill-suited to your new form. While you don't exactly have any comparative experience from this perspective, the bouncy jostling of Penelope's massive breasts under the sweatshirt seems to you excessive for a simple walk down the hall\u2014and you don't seem to be the only one to have noticed.  The oppressive stares are so disconcerting, in fact, that you have to duck into the bathroom to double-check that your new body is in fact wearing a bra. A quick peek proves that you are\u2014a peach-colored one apparently sized 34E\u2014but the revelation does little to put you at ease.  The large bathroom mirrors only make things worse; even though you are by now well aware of exactly what has happened, it's still extremely unsettling to watch Penelope's reflection copy your movements.   Hesitantly, you give a little wave as the dorky brunette in the mirror waves back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm\u2026 I'm really Penelope,\" you whisper, again unsettled by the pitch of your new voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You run a finger through your mousy hair, still transfixed by the image before you.  After a moment, unable to restrain your curiosity, you hesitantly squeeze your large breasts through the sweatshirt.  After a quick feel, though, you sheepishly snap your arms back to your sides and put aside indefinitely any 'exploration' beyond that\u2014this is a public restroom, after all, and someone could stumble in at any moment.  The last thing you need is for someone to see you fondling yourself in front of the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, you decide to take decisive action.  Exactly <i>what</i> decisive action, you haven't quite\u2026 decided. Yet. On the one hand, you're already late for class\u2014if you are going to be forced to live Penelope's life forever you should probably try to avoid messing it up, which truancy would probably do.  On the other hand, what if there's still a way out of this?  What happened to the real Penelope and your old body, anyway? Maybe the crazy Wizard who sold you the Collar could set things right\u2014or at least give you some answers.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Thus, you make your way unsteadily out of the bathroom and back out to the parking lot, determined to find the old Wizard and set things right. Your own keys seem to have disappeared along with your original body, so you are forced to take Penelope's boxy little Volvo instead of your own car.  The advantage of this is that the mirrors and so forth are already properly adjusted for your new stature, but you soon discover that no amount of adjustment will make the seatbelt rest comfortably across Penelope's generous bosom.  No matter how you turn it, it soon ends up painfully pinching your skin at one point or another.  In the end, you simply leave it unbuckled, safety be damned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally arrive at the mall you are suddenly confronted by a much bigger problem\u2014the magic shop isn't there.  In its place stand a Pretzel Palace, employees hawking twisted dough as though nothing was wrong.  Frustrated, you storm up to the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's the magic shop that used to be here?\" you demand in Penelope's squeaky little voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pimple-faced cashier looks taken aback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2026 we just sell pretzels,\" he stammers.  \"I don't know anything about any magic shop\u2026.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slam your tiny fists down on the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not now, moron, yesterday!  Where's the shop that was here this weekend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2026 I don\u2019t know what you're talking about. Pretzel Palace has been here for almost seven months now\u2026.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bullshit!\" you scream, grabbing at the black 'mind control' collar fastened around your neck.  \"I bought this yesterday, right here, from some geezer in a bathrobe!  Where is he?  <i>Where is the man in the bathrobe?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, just calm down, Miss.  I don't know any\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Don't call me 'miss!'</i>\" you screech, face flush with rage.  \"It was <i>right here!</i>  Right where you're standing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you should talk with my manager\u2026.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, just forget it.  Thanks for nothing, you worthless sack of\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, an elderly man comes out of the back of Pretzel Palace.  He's wearing their trademark yellow and white uniforms and a tiny plastic badge that says \"Manager,\" but there's no mistaking that wizened frown.  It's the Wizard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You\u2026\" you start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now, no need to cause such a ruckus.   Perhaps we should speak in private.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wave of his hand, the old man brings the chaos of the Mall to a stop.  Shoppers freeze in mid stride, trash hangs suspended in the air above bins and the Wizard smiles faintly.<br>\r\n\"That's better,\" he says.  \"Now, I take it you're not entirely satisfied with your purchase?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Satisfied?\" you demand.  \"Satisfied?  Do I <i>look</i> satisfied?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heft Penelope's ample assets for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now, I think you'll find that the merchandise I sold you works exactly as advertised, does it not?  Or are you claiming that you have not, in fact, received control over what this young woman's actions?  Because I think you will find the evidence suggest otherwise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know full well this isn't what you implied would happen!  You deliberately misled me, old man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wizard frowns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful where you throw those accusations, young lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I am not a young lady!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wizard merely raises an eyebrow.  You pause to take a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides,\" you continue, \"what happened to Penelope?  Where's my old body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's safe,\" says the wizard. \"No thanks to your efforts.  As for your old body, well\u2014perhaps something can be arranged.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" you demand.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you first came to me, you had no concern for anyone but yourself.  I imagine that's still largely the case, but your inquiry after the welfare of your young friend demonstrates there may yet be some small shred of decency within you.  Therefore, I propose a bargain.  A test, if you will.  If you can salvage this situation, turning your possession into a positive development for your friend Penelope, I will remove the collar and restore your original body to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the collar <i>can</i> be removed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By sufficiently powerful magic, yes.  But I will do this for you only if you complete the task I have set forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How am I supposed to do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man waves his hand, within which a small, neatly bound white book appears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is your friend Penelope's diary.  In it she has recorded not only the events of her daily life, but her aspirations, both petty and tremendous.  If you can use this opportunity to further those goals, helping her to achieve that which she could not herself, I will consider your end of the bargain fulfilled.  \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And If I refuse?\"<br>\r\n\"Then I suggest you get comfortable using the toilet sitting down.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As usual, he requested permission to use mine as the example for next year's pupils.  I'm thinking of asking him to write one of the instructor recommendation letters for my college applications.  For the other, I can't decide between\u2026 </i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div class=\"bquote\"><i>...Is my voice really that high?  That Ashton girl called it \"squeaky!\"  I'm not squeaky, am I? I'm certain I would have noticed something like that.  At the very least, someone would have told me, wouldn't they?  What does she know?  Just because she's had years of vocal training doesn't mean everyone else is\u2026</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat kind of thing went on for pages at times, and didn't really help you in identifying \"dreams and aspirations.\"  Equally irrelevant\u2014but much more interesting\u2014were her occasional references to you.  Unfortunately, they weren't always flattering:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div class=\"bquote\"><i>...I caught Elliot staring at my boobs again today.  I think he's planning on asking me to the spring formal.  Why doesn't he ask that Kate girl he's always talking about?  'Kate and I used to do this; Kate and I always did that.'  I don't know what I'll do if he does ask.  He's a good friend, but he can't seem to take the hint that I'm not interested in him that way.  Then again, who else is likely to ask me?  It's not as if Andrew's ever going to notice me.  Maybe I should just go with Elliot\u2014I'll just have to make it clear that we'd be going as friends and nothing more.  How hard can that be? I just hope\u2026</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div class=\"bquote\"><i>...Elliot wanted me to come help him study for history again tonight\u2014I lied and told him I was visiting my aunt.

Maybe if he has to suffer through this test on his own he'll finally start to put a little effort into his schoolwork\u2026</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, here and there you did manage to come across a couple of nuggets that look like the sort of thing the wizard meant:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div class=\"bquote\"><i>...Why do those yearbook girls have to bounce around all day taking pictures of everyone but me?  Don't they have classes to attend? It's not like I'm mean to anyone.  Kyle, Matthew and Elliot all seem to like me\u2014why am I so invisible to everyone else?  It's not like I'm especially quiet; I participate in class discussions all the time.  So why is it that as soon as the bell rings it's like I no longer exist?  Why doesn't anyone notice me?  For the past\u2026</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div class=\"bquote\"><i>...I saw Ashton flirting with Andrew again today.   How am I supposed to compete with that?  Ashton's hair looks like something out of a Disney cartoon, always falling in perfect little red waves, never a strand out of place.  He probably doesn't even know my name\u2026</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div class=\"bquote\"><i>...Deferred!  I can't believe they deferred me!  I scored perfectly on the SAT\u2014what more do they want?  I talked to Mr. Welles about it, and he suggested that the admissions office may be looking for more 'well-rounded' applicants.  Apparently the ability to put a ball through a hoop is as important as twelve years of practically perfect grades.  I suppose that's not quite fair; Mr. Welles says it doesn't have to be a sports team\u2014other clubs would qualify as well.  Even so, it's not right for an institution that claims to be focused on academic\u2026</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat particular rant goes on for several pages. Leaning back in your chair, you ponder what to do next.  The wizard's task certainly wouldn't be easy\u2014Penelope's concerns seem fairly typical of a high school girl and to be honest you're probably even less qualified to tackle them than she was; if indeed they are achievable at all.  Popularity, an Ivy League college, romance; why couldn't Penelope have aspired to play videogames or something?   Still, it's your only shot, so it will just have to do.  The question is\u2014where to start?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're hardly an expert in teenage girl drama, but after some brainstorming you do manage to come up with two possible courses of action.  First, you figure many of Penelope's social issues are tied to her geeky image.  Made-for-TV teen comedies suggest if you can shed that, you'll be one of the cool kids in no time.  They also suggest that along the way you'll learn important lessons about the meaning of friendship or something equally trite, but that wasn't on Penelope's list and is therefore irrelevant to getting your body back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, you could just follow through with what Penelope apparently already had planned\u2014you could join an after-school club in order to diversify her transcript.  Surely getting accepted to a good college was more important in the long run than dates and peer pressure, right?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Besides, joining a club has got to be orders of magnitude easier to accomplish than navigating the minefield of high-school girl-drama.  All you have to do is put your name on the form and show up to a few meetings, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, even that doesn't prove to be quite as straightforward as you'd hoped.  Popping into an Internet Caf\u00c3\u00a9 to check your school's website, you find to your dismay that most of the groups aren't even accepting new members this late in the year.  All of your first choices\u2014like film club, computer club, and gaming club\u2014fall into this category.  Even of those that are accepting new members, most are still impossibilities for one reason or another.  Spanish club is accepting members, but Penelope only took Latin and you can barely master English.  The Marching Band is taking on new members, but only those proficient in the trombone.  Military Drill Team is actively recruiting but\u2014oh, irony\u2014only accepts guys.  In fact, out of nearly sixty organizations, there are only two that are both still recruiting and might actually accept you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne is the Model United Nations.  You don't know a thing about international politics, or indeed even exactly what the Model United Nations does, but they're open to anyone.  How hard could it be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other choice is Drama Club.  While auditions for the school play are technically over, they're still accepting any girls who want to participate.  For that, you can thank Ashton.  With her lustrous red hair and silky soprano voice honed by years of vocal training, she's had the female lead in every single school production for the past three years.  These days, so few girls even bother auditioning that Mr. Michaels\u2014the theater director\u2014usually has to either cut or combine several minor female roles.  Of course, there's never any shortage of male actors competing to act opposite Ashton\u2014a few out of genuine passion for the theater but most probably enticed by the prospect of long evenings alone in a rehearsal room with Ashton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither sounds like much fun, but you should be able to suffer through, given the circumstances.</span></div></div>",

As he does, the mall suddenly springs back to life, shoppers returning to their business as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened.  Which, for them, you suppose it hasn't.  Whatever.  If the old man isn't going to help you, you'll just have to find another way to remove the accursed collar.  You don't suppose it could simply be cut away, but the old wizard had mentioned that \"powerful magic\" could overcome the collar's effect.  All you have to do is find some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, finding powerful magic isn't as easy as it sounds\u2014which, given how difficult it sounds, is saying something.  However, you do stumble across a lead, if a distant one\u2014a long and embarrassing call to the Better Business Bureau reveals another self-proclaimed 'magic shop' in town, this one apparently on a more permanent basis.  Called \"Reagents 'n Things,\" it's about half an hour's drive from the mall and you head over there as quickly as you can manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe similarities with the wizard's shop are striking.  A small wooden door\u2014albeit this one covered with anti-burglary bars\u2014causes a tiny brass bell to chime as you enter the shop.  As before, you seem to be the only customer, and the shopkeeper comes to address you personally.  Unlike the wizard, though, this chap is rather young, boasting dreadlocks and appropriately new-age attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome, sister, to this humble house of the mystical arts.  Rest easy, you are among friends here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't see anyone but the shopkeeper to merit the pluralization of \"friends,\" and don't appreciate being called 'sister,' but this guy may be your only hope so you grit your teeth and bear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm looking for some kind of powerful magic,\" you say.  \"Do have anything like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young shopkeeper gestures to the walls and tables, most of which are lined with various baubles and crystals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps you could be more specific?\" he asks.  \"I have many powerful artifacts here, from stones of warding to hand-crafted talismans of protection.  Or perhaps you'd be interested in a spirit crystal?  Such crystals are known to possess great healing properties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance hesitantly around.  None of that sounds like what you need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I was hoping you had some magical scissors or something.  See, I just bought this collar from this old dude in a bathrobe, and now I can't\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You <i>what?</i>\" interrupts the man, eyes wide.  \"You visited Spells R Us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reaches forward and brushes the hair from your neck, gazing in wonder at the collar around your neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're into serious magic, young lady, serious magic indeed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I noticed.  So will any of these crystal things help me remove the collar?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, this junk?\" laughs the shopkeeper.  \"This stuff's not really magical.  Just trinkets and baubles to amuse Goth kids and hippies.  I do have a few genuine items in the back, but nothing to rival the Wizard's magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart sinks.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you can't help me?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shopkeeper shakes his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid not,\" he says.  \"But I might be able to point you in the direction of someone who can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shopkeeper beckons you to sit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said, most of my clientele are posers and wannabes, but on occasion I do conduct business with the genuine article.  One particular group came in a little while ago, looking for demon blood.  Powerful stuff, that.  I didn't have any, but I told them I'd let them know if I got any in stock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe produces a small slip of paper with an address scrawled on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is where they said I could find them.  I don't know what they're up to, but I could practically taste the magical energy coming off of them.  Whatever they're doing, it's serious business\u2014way out of my league.  They might be able to help you, I don't know.  Be careful, though.  These are not people you want to trifle with, understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod slowly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there any other way?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shopkeeper looks thoughtful for a moment, and then reluctantly nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've also heard a rumor\u2014just a rumor, mind you\u2014of a genuine genie bottle popping up somewhere in Los Angeles.  Thing is, apparently whoever found it was some careful archeologist type, so he never touched it with his bare hands.  So instead of granting the three wishes and disappearing like genies usually do, it's still there, still waiting for someone to touch it.  If you can find that, you'll have that thing off your neck easy as cake. I don't care how powerful that choker is, it's no match for genie magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that dangerous?\" you ask.  \"Won't a genie try to trick me or twist my wish or something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shopkeeper shrugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's dangerous, sister,\" he says.  \"But that's how it always is with magic, you know?  As for twisting your wish\u2014well, that's possible.  I imagine a genie could do whatever he damn well pleased.  But most of them won't.  No, your biggest problem is going to be getting the bottle in the first place.  You think it'd still be up for grabs if any old schmuck could just drive to L.A. and take it?  No way, sister.  I don't know exactly where it is, but I guarantee somebody does.  Probably several somebodies.   People who will do anything\u2014anything\u2014to get those wishes for themselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nods meaningfully, then passes you the slip of paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, here's the address of those cultists.  I wish I had something more specific for you on the L.A. Genie, but not many details make it this far north, you know?  Whatever you choose, good luck.  Just\u2026 if you get into trouble, don't tell anyone where you got your info, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, you thank the young shopkeeper and head out the door, brass bell chiming as you exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you return to Penelope's car you struggle in vain to adjust the thin straps of her bra, which the effort of supporting her heavy bosom is causing to dig painfully into your shoulders.  After a few minutes of movement fails to produce any lasting relief, you eventually give up and turn your attention to the more important problem\u2014getting out of this stupid body altogether!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, sitting alone in the parking lot, you ponder the young shopkeeper's suggestions.  Should you drive south to Los Angeles in order to find and acquire the genie lamp, or stay in town and try to get help from the cultists?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Why drive all the way to Los Angeles searching for a bottle which may or may not even exist when the solution to your woes could be right here in town?  No, the shopkeeper has given you a concrete lead and you're not about to waste it.  Pulling the address card out of your pocket, you put Penelope's boxy little car in gear and head for the cultist's hideout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd 'hideout' is indeed the appropriate term\u2014the address leads you to a desolate machine shop on the outskirts of town, complete with boarded-up windows and long-since-faded graffiti. Indeed, you'd have been certain this place was still abandoned if not for the several sets of fresh tire tracks leading around the back of the facility.  Parking Penelope's car some distance away, you silently observe the compound and ponder what to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough you're understandably eager to be free of the accursed collar and back in your own body, the unrelenting and increasingly uncomfortable tug of Penelope's generous assets is enough to give you pause.  The mountains of flesh growing sweaty and itchy beneath your sweatshirt serve as an unfortunate reminder of your previous blundering encounter with matters of magic.  You wonder if perhaps it would be wise to exercise a little more caution this time around.  You could observe the cult from a distance first, become acquainted with the members and their customs before gradually insinuating yourself into their group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, such a process could easily take days\u2014or longer.  You don't exactly relish the thought of remaining trapped as a squeaky-voiced, topheavy nerdette for such an extended period of time, especially if such caution turns out to be unnecessary. </span></div></div>",

If you want to get back to normal\u2014or at least avoid making things any worse\u2014you're going to have to act a little less impulsively from now on.  Therefore, eager as you are to return to your male body, you'll take the time to observe these so-called 'cultists' before making any rash decisions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPredictably, exercising such caution turns out to be maddeningly uneventful; particularly compared with the frantic pace of the outlandish morning.  For hours you sit staring silently at the machine shop, the monotony broken only by the painful pinching of Penelope's bra and your useless attempts to adjust it.  The sun has almost disappeared over the horizon when, finally, something catches your eye.  Sinking back in your chair to avoid notice, you watch with rapt attention as the cultists begin to file out of the machine shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey aren't exactly what you'd expected.  They aren't wearing blood-red robes or mysterious cowls.  They don't seem to be carrying any twisted daggers or mystical staffs.  There is, in fact, nothing especially sinister about them at all.  While they are dressed in stereotypically Gothic fashions, it's nothing more extreme or authentic than what you see people wearing at school.  There are five of them, three guys and two girls. One by one they circle around the back of the building and one by one they emerge behind the wheel of surprisingly expensive automobiles.  As you watch, the five luxury vehicles circle around on the overgrown grass in front of the machine shop and make their way onto the street, the single-file procession obviously headed downtown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, your hand jumps to the ignition, but then you pause.  You could follow the cultists, hopefully finally getting a chance to observe them as you'd planned, but you could also stay here and scope out their lair.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shaking your head, you put aside the notion of snooping around here.  Even if you were able to find some occult artifacts, what then?  If they were anything like the artifacts at the Wizard's shop, they'd probably look just like any ordinary object; besides, even if you could identify them you don't know enough about magic to understand what they were for.  No, your best bet would be to follow the cultists themselves.  Thus decided, you start Penelope's car and set about tailing the procession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Luckily, this doesn't prove to be very difficult\u2014the small convoy of luxury vehicles takes an essentially direct route back toward the center of down, and you're able to follow at a respectable distance without doing anything especially suspicious.  Just to be safe, you continue driving once they reach their destination\u2014some kind of club downtown\u2014circling back and parking nearby only after the cultists have gone inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you return, you realize you have a slight problem\u2014you're not exactly dressed to go 'clubbing.' The club\u2014which a large industrial-looking sign declared 'The Refinery'\u2014doesn't have hordes of hopefuls stretching down the street, but there is a doorman.  For a moment, you're afraid he won't let you in dressed as you are.  In the end, though, while the bouncer does raise his eyebrows at your unkempt hair and baggy sweatshirt, he simply shakes his head and waves you in regardless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping inside, you discover the interior of the club to be everything you'd expect in a place like this\u2014loud, dark, and crowded.  All around you, young men and women laugh, drink, and dance in a wanton frenzy of sound and motion.  You could hardly be more out of place.  You wouldn't exactly describe this place as a 'gothic' club\u2014this city isn't big enough to support an entire club exclusively geared towards such a specific market\u2014but there's definitely a dark feel to the place.  While only about a quarter of the patrons seem to be full-on Goths sporting the whole fishnets-and-black-lace thing, dark clothing does seem to be the norm; your shapeless grey sweatshirt attracts more than a few disdainful looks from better-dressed passers-by.  Mostly, though, people just ignore you\u2014which is fine by you.  If nothing else, it makes it easier to focus on your objective: watching the cultists.  For a moment you're worried that you might not be able to find them in the darkness\u2014you never really got a great look at them to begin with\u2014but eventually your eyes adjust and you spot the five serious-looking young people sitting by themselves in a circular booth on the far side of the club.  That's them; you're sure of it.  Gradually working your way over to that side of the club, you manage to slip into a chair at a nearby table from which you can observe the group without being seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe apparent leader of the group is a tall young man wearing some kind of long black coat.  His multiple piercings and ashen-white skin would probably look rather silly in the harsh light of day, but here in the darkness of the club he actually looks rather frightening.  To either side are two other men, a few years younger but similarly attired in black and chain.  These two are obviously flunkies\u2014while the tall leader speaks they merely nod enthusiastically as if every word is a priceless revelation.  Finally, to the far right of the booth are the women.  The first\u2014a skinny girl with unnaturally sangria-red hair\u2014is wearing a dark, silky dress and long black gloves extending up past her elbows.  The second, a blonde even more emaciated than her companion, sports a long black skirt and an extremely low-cut camisole that displays her tiny breasts to scandalous advantage.  Both the men and the women sport copious amounts of eyeliner, though only the leader and the blonde have visible piercings.  None of them appear to be drinking\u2014all are focused intently on their conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just saying,\" says the redhead, \"You know the ritual would be easier if we had more people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I've said before,\" says the tall leader, \"our current number will perfectly adequate once we acquire the last of the necessary reagents.  In the interim we cannot afford to fritter away our time looking for new recruits\u2014not at such a critical juncture.  Our focus must remain exclusively on the completion of the rite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know how important this is,\" says the redhead, \"but you have to admit things have gotten a lot harder since we lost Fingers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit,\" says the blonde, \"is that what we're calling it now?  'Lost?'  We 'lost' Fingers?  He fucking exploded! Ka-Boom!  Did you guys miss that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fingers was fully aware of the potential risks when\u2014\" says the leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aware of the fucking risks?\" says the blonde. \"Don't give me that law school bullshit! Fingers was the best goddamn\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That is quite enough,\" says the leader, his tone icy.  \"We are all well aware of your involvement with Fingers.  Romantic entanglements aside, I assure you that we all feel the same way. He was a friend, not to mention a valuable element of this circle. He will be missed.  But it has been six weeks since the unfortunate incident, and your emotional outbursts are becoming a liability.  If you cannot control yourself during a recreational outing, how can we expect you to uphold\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's fine,\" says the redhead.  \"She'll be fine.   But this is exactly what I'm talking about.  Since we lost Fingers, we've all become stretched too thin.  If we just had another\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough!\" says the leader.  \"The entire rationale for this excursion was that you needed a respite from matters of import.  The phrase you used was 'recharge your batteries,' was it not?  I concur with that assessment, but if you are going to squander the entire evening bickering over recruitment policy we might as well return to the sanctum.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what,\" says the blonde.  \"Stop fighting or you'll turn the fucking car around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A crude phrasing,\" says the leader.  \"But not inaccurate.  You came here to dance; I suggest you do so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde rolls her eyes, taking the redhead by the arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, Red,\" she says, rising from the booth. \"Boss wants us to dance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the two girls make their way out across the dance floor, where you can see them flitting through the crowd, dancing and talking with some of the more gothic-looking clubbers.  It doesn't really look like they're flirting, though\u2014this is something else, and the men at the table notice it too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, boss,\" says one of the flunkies. \"I think they're still looking for someone to replace Fingers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" says the leader. \"They are.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want us to stop them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But\u2026\" says the flunky, \"Didn't you just say\u2026.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed,\" says the leader.  \"And because they believe me opposed to the idea, they will not waste my time with an unending procession of second-rate posers.  They will seek to prove me wrong, and as such return to confront me only once they have located an individual I cannot possibly turn away.  They will be critical in their screening, tireless in their hunt, and decisive in their final selection.  Meanwhile, I am spared the headache of overseeing a process those two are perfectly capable of handling on their own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But,\" says the flunky, \"you said this was a one-time thing.  What if they don't find someone today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd be most surprised if they did.  But the girls are resourceful; I suspect that around this time tomorrow they shall approach me with an emergent situation that absolutely necessitates their presence at this establishment.  Else, they will scurry away and return here in secret, providing us with some highly-plausible excuse for their absence.  Either way, their search will continue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two flunkies nod excitedly, clearly smug about being selected to share in their idol's 'secret' plan.  Neither seems to realize that the girls are actually the ones to have been given an important responsibility.   A responsibility which, it seems, could be your ticket in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only question is: how do you make your move?  Do you walk up to the girls now, or should you come back tomorrow night, better prepared?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After what seems an eternity of twisting and turning, you do eventually manage to fall asleep, but even then it's more a matter of sheer exhaustion than actual comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you awake to the blaring buzz of Penelope's radio alarm-clock, you're sore, angry\u2014and initially quite confused.  Once you recover your wits and remember the events of the previous day, you're mostly just sore and angry.  Rolling lethargically out of bed, you fumble to silence the infernal machine, which you finally manage only by yanking the power cord from the wall.  Yup, today is going to be another <i>fantastic</i> day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting dressed, at least, is fairly simple; Penelope has even less fashion sense than you do.   She doesn't literally wear the same clothes every day, but she might as well have; another sweatshirt\u2014navy blue this time\u2014and another pair of department-store jeans is all it takes to complete a totally in-character ensemble.  The only real change you make from yesterday is the underwear; you select one of her F-cup bras, in the hope that the larger size will mean less of the painful pinching that so plagued you yesterday.  Once dressed, you gather Penelope's things, eat a quick breakfast\u2014the one advantage to all of this is that Penelope's grandmother is an <i>amazing</i> cook\u2014and prepare to face the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, Penelope,\" asks Grams, \"are you going to be tutoring at the middle-school again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is referring, of course, to your hurried excuse for yesterday's absence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If so,\" she continues, \"I'll just call in your absence so those ninnies at the office don't get confused this time.  I swear, sometimes it's like that school is <i>trying</i> to hold back their gifted students.  I mean, there you are, trying to do something good for the community, and meanwhile they're so caught up with bureaucratic nonsense that they can't even keep track of their own programs.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No, you'll just have to trick someone else into wearing it.  A couple of possibilities come to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne obvious choice would be Ashton of the Drama Club.  For one thing, she was stunningly gorgeous.  Her deep red hair fell in perfect, gentle curves around her face and her eyes practically sparkled when she smiled.  Everything about her was just perfect\u2014her teeth, her nose, her skin\u2014and she knew it.  She hoped to become a Broadway actress one day and might even make it.  It was well known that the theater director had long since stopped holding serious auditions for the female lead and instead chose productions specifically for Ashton.  She would do anything for exposure, and would also almost certainly wear the collar if you told her that you were trying to sell it and needed someone to model it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i41.tinypic.com/u084x.png\">Illustration of Ashton</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"http://i41.tinypic.com/u084x.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other choice would be Lizzie.  Lizzie was\u2026 well, to put it bluntly, Lizzie was the school slut.  She wasn't bad looking, even if she did wear way too much eyeliner and her deep brown bangs were teased into a perpetual state of 'sex hair.'  Not that you spend much time looking above her neck; while her breasts are actually a little on the small side, her provocative outfits somehow always manage to produce\u2014and display\u2014an astonishing amount of cleavage.  More to the point, she was one of the few girls at school who might actually want to wear the Collar simply as a fashion accessory.   Plus, once she was under your control you could make her tell everyone that you were the best lover she'd ever had\u2014given her 'extensive experience' with most of the popular guys, that would be quite the endorsement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i44.tinypic.com/27ymvz7.png\">Illustration of Lizzie</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"http://i44.tinypic.com/27ymvz7.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the end, there was never any real debate.  Who else could you possibly choose over the gorgeous Ashton?  You don't have any classes with her this semester, so it isn't until after school that you manage to catch up with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Ashton,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns to face you, surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hi,\" she says.  \"Elliot, is it?  We had Spanish together, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah,\" you say, disappointed that she didn't seem to remember you very well.  \"I was actually  hoping that you could do me a favor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshton smiles one of her perfect smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing!\" she says.  \"What do you need?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm trying to sell this collar on E-bay, but I can't seem to make it look good just sitting on a table.  I was hoping you'd be willing to model it so I could get a good close-up picture of the collar as it's meant to be seen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshton smiles again, her eyes lighting up at the word 'model.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" she says.  \"I'd be happy to help.  Do you want to do it now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'd be great,\" you say, handing her the collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeftly reaching behind her head, she slips the collar around her neck and starts to fasten the clasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right,\" she says.  \"Do you have your camera with\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is at exactly that moment that you hear a tiny metallic 'click' as the clasp snaps into place.  Suddenly, you feel an intense, unbearable pain, as if your very soul is being ripped from your body.  Then, in an instant, it's over and you find yourself staring down the empty hallway, facing the opposite direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled, you whip your head around to look for Ashton.  As you do, brilliant red bangs bounce across your vision.  That's when it dawns on you.  Gulping, you slowly bring your hands down to your chest, your heart sinking as they come into contact with two firm, shapely mounds that can only be Ashton's perfect breasts. Reaching through the silky red hair that cascades around your neck and shoulders, you run your fingers along the smooth black leather of the Mind Control Collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt gave you control over Ashton's mind, all right\u2014very, very direct control. Frantically scratching at the collar you scramble for the clasp\u2014only to discover that it has somehow disappeared.  The blood drains from your face as you remember the shopkeeper's warning: \"Once that collar is around someone's neck, it can never be removed\u2014the individual will be subject you your will for the rest of their natural life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" you mutter to yourself in Ashton's soft, melodious voice. \"No, no, no!  I was just supposed to control her\u2026 not like this\u2026 not forever\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ashton!\" someone shouts from down the hall.  \"What are you doing out there?  Rehearsal starts in five minutes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to face the source of the sound, you see that it's Mr. Michaels, the theater director.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i40.tinypic.com/358cigj.png\">Illustration</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"http://i40.tinypic.com/358cigj.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Ash,\" he says. \"We've got a lot of work to do today.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm\u2026 I'm coming,\" you say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently satisfied, Mr. Michaels turns and heads into the theater, where he begins shouting theater-y things to the people inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould you follow?  Ashton seems to be expected, and the last thing you need right now is even more trouble.  Then again, you have no idea what to do in a theatrical production, so participating might be even worse for you than skipping.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The next thing you know, you are facing in the opposite direction, looking at no one, with a puff of smoke dissipating around the spot your gaze met.

At the end of the aisle, you discover that you're back at the front of the store where you just started. You don't remember turning a corner or the aisle bending, and you look back down the aisle scratching your head then shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you now is the table with the jewelry and gum along with a pair of glasses and a small, brightly colored, crystal loop with an even smaller arrow and plus sign in the middle. You check you watch and see it's almost five o'clock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis place seems useless and to have wasted even more of your time causing you to have accomplished absolutely nothing today. As frustration builds up, you look around to make sure the old man has not come back then reach towards the table to swipe one of the items. Only when your hand latches onto something, it isn't what you expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you need to get a job?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man's voice startles you coming from above, and you tremble from being caught and look up.  He seems to have materialized on a step-stool behind the main counter where he has just hung a sign that says: \"Because I am a wizard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, ... yeah. But how'd you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gentleman turns his head and points to the sign. The place and this ancient geezer is creepy enough without the fact this guy has some sort of real magical ability, as if that were even possible, or thinks he does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That and the fact you just picked up the help wanted sign.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down and see that is exactly what's in your hand. You look back at the table and are sure that this sign wasn't there before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you see now that your time in here hasn't been wasted. Besides, I'm sure you have an honest heart when not too stressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hairs on your neck are tingling like he knew exactly what you had been planning, and you contemplate whether you even want to be a store clerk here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you do. Besides, it's not just a clerk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaught completely off guard by his answering your thoughts, you respond in the best way you know how.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man again turns and points up at the sign. Then after a proper pause, he comes back around with a flourish and continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As an apprentice, you would obviously have to monitor sales, but also you will be \"checking\" the inventory to make sure it is properly marked and in working order. You must know and understand the merchandise and its use so that any customer gets what they deserve. That's why there is always a full money-back guarantee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, like I get to play with these things.\" you say as you sign the application and hand it to him not even realizing you filled it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dear boy, you do not play with magic.\" he sternly retorts before slowly looking up in deep thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>This might not be so bad.</i>\" you think. \"<i>Although it's probably just minimum wage. At least dad will be off my case about it.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sixteen seventy-three.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" your lightening repartee repeats itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sixteen seventy-three, minimum apprentice wage per hour. ... Your dad will be very happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd you ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother flourish of his hand toward the sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can start now and get a few hours experience if you like. It will be more enlightening than your friends house hunting experience and put a little cash in your pocket.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your mouth opens to utter your unique surprise word because of his inference to Kyle and Matthew, he merely points his finger up to the sign before you speak, and then continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now here at King Applied Magic Enterprises, you must be properly outfitted to ensure the best customer experience. Proper sales technique will require experience, so you wear this to entice young men like yourself to leave some money here in place of some merchandise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he scrambles underneath the counter searching for something, you get concerned you'll have to wear some dorky robe like his or a pointed hat. Fortunately, he comes back up and hands you a folded apron or the like with a small box on top of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can change in the back or you can start tomorrow after school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning over at you, his face goes seriously dark and evil, and in a deep gruffly whisper commands, \"Do NOT open the box until you have the smock on.\" Then he pulls back and smiles straightening his robe and adds, \" It's not dorky nor is there a hat. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis finger points to the sign.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The wood it's made of is rough cut, and it's set into a simulated old stone wall. A sign on it is in that medieval script reading \"Authorized Subjects Only.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>This guy really goes for the whole effect.</i> you think. \"<i>But if being the right image is what it takes to make this kind of dough, then I'm all for it.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering through the door, you find a stone storeroom with flickering lanterns. To each side are similar doors one with the same old script that says \"Change Yeeself Within.\" You roll your eyes and go through to a small chamber, again of stone, which has a large hand hewn chair with lacy cushions of a pink, yellow and red design and a full length mirror held in place by heavy iron brackets. There's also a small table that you set the smock and box on while sighing, wondering about how intense this fantasy is going to get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you move the box to pick up the smock a note falls off that you retrieve and read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A good apprentice becomes completely immersed into the world at hand.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0signed \"Because ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Now that's just too freaking weird!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTossing it aside, you pick up the smock and see it is rather nondescript except for pink and yellow script letters stitched into the back: \"K A M E.\" There's also a note attached that instructs you to remove outer garments before wearing. So you drop your jeans after removing your shoes and pull off the \"T\" then pull the smock over your head like a dress. There's a tingling as it slides over your body, but you figure it's just the coarse material it's made of. The thing fits oddly being loose at the top and bottom but cinched tight in the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug off the poor fit and open the box to see what appears to be a name tag, a very fancy one, that is partly under some material and only revealing the letters \"Ell.\" Again, you wonder how this guy got your name on the tag and in the box, but you immediately look up and chuckle, \"I know. Because ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up the cloth wrapped item on top, you find a leather cord holding a small amulet with a crystal in the middle. It's more something that you think you'd see a girl wear but do remember pictures from your history book of men of this time often having similar jewelry. So you tie it round your neck. There's just enough cord so you don't choke yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you turn to reach back for the name tag, you become very dizzy and grab the arm of the chair to keep your balance while you close your eyes. There's no strength left in your legs, and your whole body starts to tingle again and get warm.  Thinking you're going to faint, you turn yourself quickly so that you sit hard in the chair. Flashes of scenes and events like a rapid slide show or dream fly by too quick to focus on any one, but the theme seems to be medieval history and various items you saw in the store. You figure it was just something in that slice of pizza conjuring images in line with this whole bizarre situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn less than a minute, it fades as quick as it came. You take a deep breath and open your eyes to find a woman with long dark brown hair sitting in a chair staring back at you. She's wearing the same smock and has the same necklace but with a bright pink crystal. Closing your eyes again, hard, to rid your mind of this last remaining illusion, you blink a couple times towards the floor then look up only to see the woman partially obscured by something dangling in front of your eye. You reach up and pull aside some long hair as the woman in the mirror does the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE ...\" you start to shout watching the woman move her lips in synch with you, but stop when the voice you hear is of a woman. Immediately you stare down at yourself to find the smock now filled out with a woman's chest. You slowly put your hands on them to be sure they're yours and discover - they are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, a thought of terror shoots through your body, and you jump up and pull the bottom of the smock above your waist. You see nothing. Nothing! You slide one hand down and confirm by touch what your eyes behold. All your manhood has disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you let the smock drop back, you think, \"<i>Maybe it's the amulet,</i>\"  and try to get the necklace off but can't undo the knot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrustrated by this, fear now sweeps through you, and you gaze into the eyes of your reflection while you step backwards just as she does as if either of you might escape or hide. On the second step, your leg collides with that table followed by the sound of something hitting the floor. A downward glance discovers the box with the name tag. Still mesmerized, you pick it up and glare at the full name now revealed. Not Elliot, but Elle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere you are, seemingly transformed into a girl by magic. The old guy said he was a wizard and that you had to be properly outfitted, but you don't know whether to just assume this is part of the job and put on the name tag or if something worse, an evil spell, has been cast upon you. A bit of anger now boils up in you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat <i>because-I'm-a-wizard</i> has some real explaining to do!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You are beyond angry as you toss the name tag aside and almost rip the chamber door off as you throw it open and look for the door back to the store. There are two doors that both look the same, heavy wood with large iron strap hinges. Since you weren't paying attention when you came in, you aren't sure which to take. This makes you fume even more, but you figure if the one you take isn't the store, you'll just go back to the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttacking the door to your right reveals a dim aisle with light at the end. You stomp in and pull the door hard to slam it, but it takes an awful lot of your strength, more than you think it should which causes more festering in your attitude. After it bumps closed (not as satisfying a sound as you hoped), you charge down the aisle muttering curses until you enter a large area with several rough old tables and benches covered with large old books, bottles, jars with stoppers, as well as a couple bowls and quite a few candles in candle holders. High windows send shafts of light across the room, and there is a slight smell of sulfur among other pungent scents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis obviously isn't the store nor out in the back corridors of the mall.  Bewildered you glance all around, but no one is visible, so you move further in trying to find anyone. As your feet shuffle across the dusty stone floor, they create a swishing sound that echoes off the stone walls like people whispering. There's a table with several piles of bones including both human and animal skulls that seem to stare at you. It's really creepy and shivers run up and down through you. Instead of turning back, curiosity takes over sending you wandering about looking at the odd things trying to figure what this is and where. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the looks of these surroundings, you could be in a building from the middle ages, perhaps a castle since a room this size and all the large stones would require great expense. But you were just in the mall, so walking out a door into a castle is just ridiculously impossible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>There's no way!</i>\" you think while opening a large, leather-bound manuscript. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you are startled by a man's voice coming from behind you that is vaguely familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic is not ridiculous nor is anything impossible if it is used properly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou literally jump and spin around to see a shadowy figure standing in a doorway. There's so much light behind, you can't see his features. Then you realize his comment is referring to your thoughts, but how?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the wall behind you.\" he says as he closes the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly turn cautious that he isn't about to come at you (you are a girl now after all as you were reminded by your bouncing chest when you jumped). There mounted on the wall is a board with old script that says, \"Because I am a wizard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, you recognize that it is identical to what the old man in the store had hung, and the voice was obviously his, although it sounded much younger and energetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-b-b-but the store and how could ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dear, I know you can read.\" he says pointing again at the wall as he pushes by you and abruptly closes the manuscript. As he turns round to face you, you see the same features of the store proprietor but a much younger face than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you did not wear the store name tag when you came out, you entered into King Applied's Majestic Empire. This is part of the King's castle about a dozen centuries earlier than before. It's where I teach young apprentices their duties and responsibilities in using applied magic, that is when they aren't performing their other duties in the castle. You, my young woman, are a wizard's apprentice and will spend the next year or so here learning and practicing the trade of wizardry while not occupied otherwise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand there disbelieving any of this especially that you're stuck for a year as a woman in some castle a thousand years in the past. You close your eyes as if this is a dream and figure that there's gotta be a way to get back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dear girl, you are already normal. Above average even, and will be here <i>with me</i> for quite some time.\" he replies and smiles, almost leers, at you. After a pause and a sigh he continues,  \"After basic spells, you will taught to change into various outfits and alter facial features. The first challenge of a wizard is to be able to disguise yourself for any possibility in order to move about undetected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I will be able to change back and go home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head, he chuckles, \"Time travel is one of the most advanced skills after passing the journeyman's quest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you can't keep me as something I am not, trapped in history. What gives you that right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe points to the sign and says, \"And the employment application you signed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eventually, you will be sent on a mission to demonstrate your mastery of magic. Should you succeed ... and survive, you will also uncover the ability to change yourself to the person you originally were and then be capable of learning how to move back and forth through time. HOWEVER, until then you best finish all your castle chores and do them well and do them first. Otherwise you will not have much time for learning and will spend years trying to succeed, perhaps finally give up in despair and just live your remaining years as a cook's assistant or maid, ... or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice trails off as he says the last with quite a bit of sorrow and head shaking, almost coming to tears. Obviously, there have been others that did not do very well, and that experience has affected him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Maybe it made him a bit tetched in the head.</i>\" you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alas, until I can train one to take my place, I am sworn to remain a lone wizard working hard and diligently only on magic and have no time for any other more enjoyable endeavors. No time off. No vacations. Just repeatedly teaching young ones who have little regard or belief in the benefit of the knowledge I am bestowing on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, I could return you to the store and you could just work there as a young woman with those minimal trinkets of simple magic, or you can stay to learn the true power of magic without having school, bullies, or parents to interfere, except your chores. And I am definitely fully in control of all my mental faculties.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Hardly a grand heist, but still kind of cool in a quirky way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging, you pop one into your mouth.  It is, as promised, strawberry flavored.  A little oversweet for your tastes, but perhaps that's just the sweet, sweet taste of victory.

That was lucky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around, and see a curious crowd gathering.  The man dramatically removes the entry box, and shakes it into a large, glass ball, which he spins with gleeful abandon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are, folks!\" he says as the ball spins, scrambling the entries.  Finally, the ball spins to a halt, and he reaches in to remove one card.  \"The winner of a brand new car is\u2026. Elliot Barnes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour jaw drops in shock.

One by one, your clothes fell off your body as you spasmed, except for the magical underwear. Your erect breasts were practically in contact with the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were soon joined by your two friends, in matching clothes. Your clothes soak up several litres of vagina juice that would otherwise have become part of the huge and ever-growing puddle on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn another snap of her fingers you recover, and realise where you are.

This leaves you completely naked. You feel something slushing around in your head. You realise it is the mist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy!\" Immediately time un-freezes, and everyone starts moving again. You scrramble to get your clothes on, as however wet they may be, they still help to cover you up. Soaking, you walk back to the car and drive home.

The drive to the abandoned mansion is fairly quick. The final part of the journey up the pot-holed drive making you worry for the car's suspension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the engine is turned off, darkness descends, and you realise how isolated it is. The trunk is packed with torches, blankets and portable heaters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go exploring.\" Sheila suggests, heading towards the front door. Emerging from the car, Matthew and Mandy are soon arm in arm. Kyle has Brandi already snuggling into his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile indulgently at Sheila offering her your hand.

She is not interested in Elliot romantically, though he for his part has something of a crush on her.  She is insecure about her squeaky voice, her mousy hair, and her unusually large bosom, which she hides under baggy, shapeless sweaters as best she can. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Kate</b>:  An athletic, tomboyish friend of Elliot.

Don't you know the difference?</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: This is an excellent point, and one I dithered over for some time.  I'd have called it the 'Sex Transformation Mega-Adventure,' but that title seems to imply that the transformations relate to sexual intercourse, which for the most part they do not.  Since most people do not differentiate between sex and gender anyway, I decided that the technically inaccurate 'Gender Transformation' label would be less misleading for the majority of readers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Q: I made a mistake in my chapter!  Can I edit it?</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: Of course!  While technically only the owner of an Interactive Story can edit chapters, I'll be happy to introduce any corrections you submit.  Just send me a message with your desired changes and the chapter you wish to change,  and I'll usually have them edited into your chapter within twelve to twenty-four hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Q: One or more of your image links are not working!

I'll fix it as soon as possible, even re-uploading the image if necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Q: What is the 'Codex?'</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: The Codex is a sort of mini-encyclopedia that describes the various characters, settings, and objects within the story.  As new chapters and new authors continue to develop the fictional world, the Codex is updated to include these additions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Q: Do I need to read the Codex to understand the story?</b><br>\r\nA: Absolutely not.  The Codex is simply a resource for authors, consolidating pertinent information about the story's world in one place for easy reference.  While anyone is welcome to read it, the Codex may contain spoilers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Q: Why isn't my favorite storyline listed in the Index of Existing Storylines?'</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA:  This may be an oversight.  If you know of a well-developed storyline no listed in the index, please let me know. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Q: Why, in the \"Transformative College Experience\" storyline, are all the white girl profiles listed as \"White Non-Hispanic?\"  Do you hate latinos?</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA:  The designation \"White Non-Hispanic\" is the form used on official U.S. Census surveys and statistics.  Since the profiles are supposed to sound \"official,\" I used that form.  As to why <i>they</i> use that wording, there are actually pretty understandable reasons, but they are available elsewhere so I won't reproduce them here.</span></div></div>",

Whether you submit a single chapter or return frequently to develop entire plotlines, your creativity is what keeps this project from stagnation. This is particularly true now, as the story has just been opened up for submissions; if you're thinking about adding a chapter, please, take the plunge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, while the creativity and collaboration of so many authors are what make modern interactive stories such an exciting medium, such diversity can\u2014if not properly managed\u2014make maintaining a consistent level of quality difficult.  In particular, contributions of different authors can be very different in style, creating a jarring experience for readers.  Therefore, below you will find a list of guidelines intended to keep this story  as stylistically consistent as possible.  These guidelines are in no way intended to restrict the creativity of authors, and exceptions may always be made at your discretion if you feel that good storytelling demands it.  That said, authors should do their best to respect the established style of the adventure when possible, as described below:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div class=\"bquote\"><br>\r\n<b>1.)</b>\tFollowing the tradition of other game-books\u2014including the famous Choose-Your-Own-Adventure series\u2014The Gender Transformation Mega-Adventure is told from the second person perspective.  Thus, all direct narration should refer to the protagonist, Elliot, as \"You.\"  <b>Likewise, the options presented at the end of each chapter should represent a choice available to the protagonist. </b> For example, \"Go through the ominous-looking door\" would be a valid option, while \"Suddenly, your best friend arrives\" would not.  The former is a choice available to the protagonist, while the latter is not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>2.)</b>\tThe protagonist and viewpoint character is a native of the United States, and as the narration should generally use United States Customary Units (inches, pounds, degrees Fahrenheit, and so forth) when such measures are required.  In general, the cultural backdrop is assumed to be American unless otherwise noted in your storyline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>3.)</b>    An overview of the currently established canon is available in the <b> \"<a title=\"Interactive Story Chapter in Item # 1666793\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/interactive-story/item_id/1666793/action/view/chapter_map/152\" target=\"_top\">&gt;Codex</a>\"\u00a0<a title=\"Open in new window.\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/interactive-story/item_id/1666793/action/view/chapter_map/152\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a>.</b>  While continuity between branches is not required, it is both fun and encouraged!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>4.)</b>\tThis is the Gender Transformation Mega-Adventure. This means that, ultimately, every storyline deals with that subject at one point or another.  Such transformations can\u2014and usually do\u2014occur in addition to other circumstances, (like time travel or reality manipulation or armies of robots or evil cults or what have you) but ultimately the theme of the story should be included.  This is important because it allows readers to behave as they like without worrying about 'missing out' on the transformation even if they decide not to pull every lever that says 'WARNING: Do Not Pull.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>5.)</b>\tIn the narration, pronouns should refer to characters in the way the protagonist and veiwpoint character, Elliot, sees them.  That is, whether a transformed character is called 'he' 'she' or 'it' in the narration is determined by how Elliot sees the individual, not necessarily their current, future or original sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>6.)</b>\tWhen possible, offer more than one option at the end of a chapter even if you don't intend to continue the second path. Other authors may be jumping at the bit for a chance to pursue that particular storyline!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>7.)</b>\t<span class=\"clred\"><b>[NEW!]</b></span> I hate to have to add this one, but <b>long chains of extremely short chapters containing nothing but endless empty options <i>will</i> be pruned.</b>  By this, I mean those long chains of \"How about [Franchise X]?  Yes/no?\" where the list of potential franchises goes on forever without any actual content for any of them.  I really want to be as inclusive as possible, but these sequences can really hurt the quality of the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>8.)</b>\tHave fun!  Really!<br>\r\n</div></td>",
