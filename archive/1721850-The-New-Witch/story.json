She wanted her brother as alert, awake, knowing of his physical demise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom was loving of her children, though more so of her daughters, and kindly toward you. As what you knew was occurring, to soon becoming profoundly undeniable, if done by Mom the duration would be short lived. Your sister wanted her brother as a pet, demeaned in the extreme. She had said often of her wish to degrade, dehumanize, as humiliate you in any way she was allowed by Mom, or with the help of other of her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust about then the Caucasian color of your skin began to grow darker, as continued to darken, becoming a deep hue of charcoal black.

The sudden sensations from becoming furry were arousing in many ways, the wildest being between your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoaning from the feelings, seeing growth, a new maturity, as the scrotum swelled and the male member extended, it swelling of new girth, gaining many inches of new length. What was your handy maleness became in just minutes as something a pony stallion would feel pride for letting it hang or stretching it stout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only real ouch' feeling came when the tailbone protruded, as flourished, sprouting coarse feeling hairs what swished, tickled, and felt then as something quite nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen your pelvic region knew changing, thighs and buttocks became as equine their contours. A hunching of the legs became as hind legs, while heels changed to stronger hind hocks, feet grew longer, and toes merged to form new single toed hoofs. Your body changed in a flow of devilish directed power, as in the outer hallway you heard Sarah laughing of glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unlock the door dear, do it before your hands change into hoofs and I must damage the door to let us come inside your bedroom.\" Mom said, as Sarah continued her laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, the twist of the hand did the unlocking of the door.

The expected changed of your body would if Mom did it, not then cause your genitals as change of more than color. What you had as extended and changed, looked wholly equine of color, contour, and length. Mom knew from what she did to Dad, when seeing how his genitals changed, conforming to his new species, he then not capable to revert back to being human anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wriggling feeling as the shoulders realigned, arms became as forelegs, wrists as fetlocks, and hands changed into hoofs. While then the transitions moved upward, growing a longer neck, a mane, and began conforming of a human skull to being equine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if your skull seemed to soften, bone shifting, your jaw and teeth ached only to think more of how your lips and nose merged to form then a muzzle. As eyes moves and became huge, ears trailed higher on your head, and that perfect smile your teenage braces made, changed positions, as a gap formed to allow the use of a bit and bridle to keep the animal of you as within the control of the rider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NEIGH...,\" you whinnied as cried aloud, announcing then to Sarah, she had gained the ownership of a pony for her to ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah, for shame upon you, what is this I see here, your brother as so changed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI told him his degraded self was for two days, not two years, and your enhanced spellbinding, keeping him as equine his species, while growing bigger as you grow, keeping him captive for you as your private mount!\" You heard and understood Mom rebuking your sister, but Sarah laughed,, she ignoring Mom for some odd reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoovering in your upright stance the urge to become as if born an equine, and you fell forward, landing as walking on all fours, you then feeling as if you were a real animal.</span></div></div>",

As Mom turned to leave Dan in his new miseries, she saw then too what Sarah held, it a whirling ball. Dan and his enhanced hearing ears heard Sarah muttering her words, she speaking to a legion of those creatures from Hell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom then wrestled with Sarah to give up what she held, but she walked to and fro, as she waited, until ready for Dan to know as him and he being Sarah's to enjoy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Dan, as with these my darlings let loose, they shall gift you to knowing both your inner and deepest desires, and of those common to a male equine! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow fly, rise up and grace him with all that makes my brother Dan a worthy stallion, as a stud.

Yes, oh yes, a little more muscle added on his rump, and I think your work for tonight is done!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hellish sulfur smoke cleared the new stallion pony took one step toward his owner. Then he stopped and turned to see his entire self reflected by the full-length dressing mirror hung on the closet door. Standing there as staring is awe, looking a mature pony form, he black as the sin in his dear sister's evil heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderstand me brother, you are an animal now, and shall be for as long as I live my life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Sarah, standing like a furry statue, gawking at the bedroom closet mirror, the reflection, stood with his same color of eyes peering back at him, Dan realized his black pony self as being his new, permanent embodiment. He eyed too at his thick mane drooped over his long neck and about strong shoulders as he saw tall ears, round eyes, wide nostrils and lips of his muzzle for to graze; rather than plant a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBending his broad neck to look and take inventory downward his eyes about fell from their sockets. His youthful torso was looking as beastly stout and very strong. Dan forgot Sarah for that moment, and stood thinking, eyeing what was his hind legs, gaining an odd sense of appreciation, knowing of how much stronger they were then of his human legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whirling cloud of devils did more to changing his pony self, adding to his fetlocks of each leg of feathering hairs grown above each hoof, and how his long feet with short legs gave him the stocky look of a pony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA swish of his tail reminded Dan of how nervous he felt, worried of how his spiteful sister would treat him. He craned his neck to look back as seeing in the mirror as he sidestepped, turning his bulky self, Dan saw his tail, as felt the coarseness of the hairs draped over what felt sensitive, it puckered larger, protruded, not hidden. The whisking of the coarse tail hairs across a sensitive part of his changed anatomy, breed a small grin of sensual satisfaction what Sarah noted on his muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Legion of devils had done their duties, if more in favor for Dan the doomed human, leaving him feeling enthralled of his changed self. As they knew and inspired Dan to realize, he having a fun feeling, watched with delight when seeing and feeling his sheath stirring, the larger, as black, pony stallion male member stretching to rise from out the sheath and hang into the light of day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome heavy breathing worked to inspire adding length to the stoutness, arousing what a hour previous if asked Dan would have pleaded of not ever being changed to be a pony for the fur thrill of his sister Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack hoofs stomped at the parquet wood floor of his bedroom, as a young stallion was feeling an urge to spread his seed. As what he liked became hard and stiffer, the sensual urges brought on new desires, preferring mares rather than girlfriends. Mom had walked away, she leaving Dan and Sarah facing each the other. Sarah noted with a disdain feeling the growing delights her \"Ponified\" transformed brother stood before her with him feeling hornier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly all fear and doubting was gone as Dan stood gallant, he happy, felt like a real born stud, as then stepped forward and sniffed at Sarah, mimicking what a stallion would do if near to a mare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You come with me, do as I say, or expect to feel my wrath!\" Sarah said, but Dan did not change his stance or try to house back his swinging delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must calm yourself and go reside in either a corral or the stable, living there with horses and other ponies as for now!\"<br>\r\n\"Remember sir be careful!\" said the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful, as those here can do you of injury or worse. Your changed pony body will ache for finding a female companion. As your are of strong bones, solid muscles, a summertime seasonal coat of hair, you shall know what it is to feel a rich sexual drive of both equine and human while being a pony. The reproducing drive is what you must be mindful of most. To be a human and become a virile stallion will be a distraction the like of is now your life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPent up in your stall, whether by night or on a rainy, stormy day, your lions may need a release! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn time, as after some months of training to accept a rider, when that masculine urge arises, then I might allow you to meet and mount one mare. If you respond favorably to breeding with mares, then the mountings would increase to an additional three. So say you mount four pretty mares during a day, this could become bad, as the legion foretold, most who were born to being human, usually lose some or all human connections to their past. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce lost, you can not change back! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf lost in part only part of you may change back, then to live as a creature in the sideshows. So I suggest you try your first outing in a lonely field, or a private barn,\" explained Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Upon seeing what it was, however, your face turned pale. It was a large, thick book with the title, in large bold letters, Chaotic Science. Your uncle John had given it to you in private on your twelfth birthday but you did not fully understand what he meant when you first laid eyes on your book...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Things happen for a reason, Mat.\" said John. \"That is why I am passing this book on to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chaotic Science?\" you asked. \"What is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something I have studied, practiced, and perfected during my interesting life.\" replied John. he then pointed a finger of warning at you. \"You must not tell <i>anyone</i> about that book, especially not your grandmother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Things happen for a reason, Mat.\" repeated John. Like your sister, Julie, vanishing for a year without a single word of explanation why, right after her thirteenth birthday...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou became alarmed, swallowing hard. You had an argument with Julie before she had varnished without a trace and secretly blamed yourself for it happening. Dozens of missing persons posters were hung by you, all over town, hoping that someone would know something. Julie did return after a year of absence and you were very relieved and happy to see her back home but she acted as if nothing had happened. She did tell you that it was not your fault and that she appreciated your efforts to 'find' her but it never went passed that. Only you could sense that something about her had changed, it had bothered you since but you could never find any proof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... You mean I'm going to vanish too!?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn frowned, you could tell he was holding something back and that scared you deeply. \"Study and practice this science well. Mark my words, Mat, it will, someday, save your family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you first opened the book, you found instructions to a hidden door in the basement and how to open it. Beyond the door, you found a secret room that extended out, under the back yard. It was fully equipped with everything any scientist could want, including libraries of books on the subject of Chaotic Science. You could only guess then that it had all, somehow, been set up by uncle John. Fearing that you may vanish and returned changed as well, you took your uncle's instructions to heart and began to study the book of chaotic science inside the secret room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed and you practiced the forbidden sciences, soon developing a love for them. You understood then why you could not tell your family, your mother would have forbid you to study the science any further. Also, you guessed that your grandmother would 'kill' uncle John for giving it to you. Still, you were hooked on it and you were not about to just give it up. Volunteering to do all of the family's laundry after school and on the weekends was a brilliant plan in your mind to practice your new found powers without arousing any suspicion. Unknown to you, that was the same ploy your uncle John had used when he first started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, nearly a year later, you had become quite talented and, after a few very successful experiments, highly intelligent. Only that too came with a price. School became too easy for you and a real pain to endure as you could literally teach the teacher. Fortunately, at home, you found that just being yourself kept any suspicions from rising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning your mind to the present, you looked at your book again, worried. \"How could I have been so careless to leave it out in the open!?\" you asked yourself quietly. \"Someone could have found it and my secret would have been blown!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, a thought came to you and you became alarmed. \"Wait a minute... I wouldn't hide my book under a seat cushion!\" you whispered, louder. you then gasped. \"Someone knows!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you heard someone clear their throat and you shot your eyes up to find...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I guess I was a bit of a loner for a while.\" you said. \"It was not intentional. I couldn't tell anyone about this.\" you paused. \"May i assume you are the one who found my book?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie nodded. \"I found it.\" she said. \"Which is the only reason I am showing this to you.\" she handed you her book. \"This is the reason I had to vanish for a year, the same reason you had to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Julie shocked, then opened the book to examine it's pages. As you did, your face turned an ashen white, seeing that the two books were nearly identical with the exception that your book explained everything in technical terms while the 'magic book', as it was entitled, explained things more poetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How... How is this possible?\" you asked, turning back to Julie. \"Did uncle John somehow mimic magic with science?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're close.\" replied Julie. \"Your great uncle Jack found a way to do that then passed his knowledge and power onto uncle John when he turned 12... without permission.\" she suddenly smiled. \"Uncle John perfected that science and passed it on to you, most likely on your 12th birthday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just as it was passed onto him.\" you mused. \"But did uncle John ask permission?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie shrugged. \"I don't know.\" she replied honestly. \"When I first discovered your secret, my first instinct was to tell mom but I decided not to until I talked to you about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uncle John made me promise not to tell anyone, especially not grandma.\" you said, wincing. \"I decided to tell everyone tonight, at my 13th birthday party.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll let you tell mom yourself.\" said Julie, slightly relieved. \"I am sorry I could not tell you that I was a witch, Mat but, you see, only girls can use magic. Boys do have the potential but it lies dormant, unusable unless you are turned into a girl or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Or it begins to sleepwalk, giving them the ability to throw waves of sheer will, similar to a witch's power blast.\" you finished. \"Another way is to gain chaotic science.\" you grinned. \"Uncle John outlined all of that in chapter two of the book he gave me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie looked at you for a moment, then giggled. \"Then, I assume you also know all of the laws a witch must follow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. \"Chapter eight; Laws of super science and witchcraft.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like uncle John covered everything great uncle Jack did not.\" said Julie. \"do you also have a hologram teacher?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, you nodded. \"Hologram John.\" you replied. \"He's a little more serious than uncle John but he's still fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie nodded, understanding. \"Well, until tonight, this will be our little secret.\" she told you. \"But, um... could you do one little favor for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sensed a trap and rose your hand in defense. \"I don't want to be a girl.\" you warned, silently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie laughed. \"Not that, bro!\" she laughed. \"I just want to see your laboratory, that's all.\" she then paused. \"That and maybe have a practice duel with you, just to see how good you are with that science.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled at the prospect of testing yourself against your older sister and nodded. \"You are on, with one condition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" asked Julie, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Power blasts only, no spells.\" you demanded. \"I don't want mom to sense a duel and ground us both for fighting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie smiled, seeing your logic. \"Agreed.\" she said.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was your dad's work station before he had passed away. You shed a single tear, thinking of him and wished he could see you now before stating the command phrase to open the door. \"Tamami!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shelves on the wall moved aside and the wall behind it slid down, into the floor, revealing a large, well lit chamber beyond, which you entered with Julie quickly following. Once the door closed behind you, she looked at you, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tamami?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged. \"I am Mat, said backwards.\" you replied. Julie giggled to which you asked, \"Would you have guessed it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie shook her head. \"Never.\" she replied. then she turned to your laboratory and her jaw dropped. \"Woah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled at her reaction. \"This is where I had been spending most of my time during the past year.\" you said. \"Only, John told me that I am at the level of a pseudo witch but I still need training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, feeling as if she had been pulled into a high budget science fiction movie with countless of high tech equipment that she could only guess did what. Julie had seen uncle John's laboratory at grandma's house but this one was far more advanced. Then, she saw a full holographic image of uncle John approaching her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good day, Julie.\" he said. \"Welcome to Mat's laboratory.\" he then turned to Mat. \"I thought you had planned not to tell your family until your birthday party this evening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was practicing reveal spells in the living room and accidentally summoned Mat's book.\" explained Julie, defending you. \"Mom does not know, I confronted Mat alone and asked him to show me his laboratory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn turned back to Julie. \"I understand.\" he said. \"Would you like to participate in Mat's final test?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of test?\" asked Julie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn smiled. \"A duel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were planning just that.\" you said. \"Julie wants to see how strong I had become.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo round platforms rose from the floor and lit up before you and your sister took your positions, facing each other in a dueling posture. \"The rules are simple.\" said John. \"Energy blasts only, the first to knock the other off their platform will win the duel... begin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie started first with a powerful energy blast, not wanting to go easy on you, but you managed to dodge it and fire one of your own as she fired again. Back and forth for nearly twenty minutes, you and Julie exchanged blows with you, soon after, sweating and gasping for breath. You sister seemed relentless but you had your mom's iron will and fired one last powerful blast, hoping it would throw her off her platform. Only, to your shock, she caught your blast and threw it right back, giggling, \"Catch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were out of breath and on the verge of passing out but you managed to catch it and weakly throw it back before falling from your platform, no longer able to stand. Only to your surprise, Julie was there to catch you with hologram John, watching over you, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations, Mat.\" said John. \"You have proven yourself powerful enough to hold your own against a witch with a year of training, I am very proud of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I win?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie winced slightly. \"Sorry, Mat, you lost.\" she said. \"Don't feel bad, though, I have three years of training over you.\" she then smiled. \"Despite that, you really made me work for that win, I'm impressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mat still requires training.\" said John to Julie. \"When your uncle John was trained by Jack, he gained five years of training in one year, making him very formidable against even adult witches.\" he frowned. \"However, this also caused John several porblems among the witching world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How so?\" asked Julie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you be worried if a 13 year old girl suddenly gained the power of an adult witch?\" asked John. \"Take that fear and and the fact that the witch is a boy, someone who is not supposed to have 'magic' at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie shivered that the thought. \"I see your point.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John has been teaching me gender spells.\" you told Julie. \"That way, I can practice in the open after my birthday and everyone, who knows, will think it was magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John's mother felt robbed and betrayed as Jack had trained him instead of her.\" said 'John'. \"Therefore, I had been programed to only train Mat to the point where he can defend himself and allow his mom to continue his training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to John, hurt. \"Does this mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I will always be here to guide and protect you, Mat.\" said John. \"I am merely opening the door for your mother to participate in your training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You followed her down the stairs to the front door where you saw that aunt Hayley had arrived with her husband Paul along with aunt Mel with her husband Harry. Behind them all were your cousins. Stephanie(7), Katherine(14), and Jack(13) from Hayley's family and Kelsey(14), Gina(8), and twin brother and sister Jessica and James (both 13) from Mel's family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good to see you all again.\" said mom, giving her two sisters a warm hug. \"I'm glad you could come to the party.\" she paused. \"Where is John, Megan, and their kids?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley giggled. \"John's eight year old son, Hank, got into a little mischief.\" she replied. \"Megan and her twin thirteen year old daughters, Jane and Joann, gave their 'little sister' some makeup tips.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled, knowing that John's only son had either discovered a magic book or stumbled upon his father's laboratory, resulting in him becoming transformed into a young girl. Only you, visualizing the same thing, stifled a laugh, catching your mom and aunts' attention. \"They gave Hank a makeover!?\" you asked, still chuckling. \"That's funny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley smiled, thinking you would not be laughing after you are told the truth about magic. \"It's not nice to laugh at other people's expense, Mat.\" she warned lightly. \"I learned that myself the hard way, you could be next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped laughing, remembering that you were out gunned when it came to magic. \"You're right, aunt Hayley.\" you said, pouting slightly. \"I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mat wants to ask Jenny out at his birthday party tonight.\" said mom, still unaware. \"It's going to be an interesting night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley and Mel nodded in agreement, not yet knowing you had a few surprises of your own planned for the party.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Both twins had quite a figure, just like their mother, with honey blond hair and blue eyes. They both smiled, waving at their aunts and cousins, as they dragged a reluctant little girl behind them. She was blushing brightly, wearing a pink princess dress with white stockings and black mary janes. Her face was covered with a light amount of make up and her hair was in braids. You struggled not to laugh as you saw her shaking her head, begging to return to the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, aunt Hayley.\" said Jane, pulling her new sister in front of her. \"Say hello to our new sister, Holly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, you're so cute!\" cooed Hayley, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly teared up, her lips trembling. It reminded Hayley of her brother, John when she first transformed him into a little girl. \"Please, aunt Hayley...\" she begged, \"I'm not a girl and they won't change me back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did she do?\" asked Mel, smiling at her new niece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoan giggled. \"Hank got a pet frog, he called Igor, from uncle Tim for his birthday last week.\" she explained. \"Well, he decided that Igor would like jumping around in my closet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane giggled. \"Only, that's where Joan hid her magic book and Hank found it.\" she said, smiling. \"He put the frog back into his pocket and opened the book, triggering the trap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan smiled. \"John has been rather protective of his little girls.\" she said. \"Searching their rooms at random for boys hiding in the closet or under the bed.\" she giggled. \"Being a witch myself now, I set up a trap to change John into a girl as Joan often used her magic book to hide her diary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never thought John would be <i>that</i> protective.\" mussed Hayley, surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan sighed. \"Witch boys are still coming to our house, begging to be trained in chaotic science.\" she explained. \"John only looks to see if the magic seal on the diary had not been tampered with, he does not read it.\" she then smiled. \"However, he needed to be reminded that girls need their privacy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only Hank is learning that lesson instead.\" said mom with a wicked grin. \"Sounds familiar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour aunts all giggled as Holly moaned. \"Aunt Melanie... Aunt Hannah?\" she asked, trying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom shook her head. \"Sorry... Holly.\" she giggled. \"Being a little girl for a while won't hurt you and besides, changing you back is up to your sisters, not us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then John came into view. Looking at him, you smiled. He was a powerfully built man with longish brown hair and blazing hazel eyes. You were surprised to see him in a suit, rather than he usual lab coat and casual clothing. \"Happy birthday, Mat!\" he said with a slightly booming voice. \"I have a feeling this party will be remembered for quite a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then turned to his sisters, hugging them all in turn before shaking hands with each of their husbands. \"It's been a while since the family has been together like this.\" he said. \"What do you say to some childhood fun tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at uncle John confused and concerned as your aunts all smiled. \"Only who will be watching over us kids?\" asked mom, a twinkle in her eyes. \"Someone has to stay an adult.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn laughed, shaking the room. \"Why who else but...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I can't break a promise either, what should I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you promise not to tell who asked you to keep this secret?\" asked Natalie, trying another approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paused, thinking back, then shook your head. \"No, I didn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie nodded then leaned in close. \"Just between us.\" she said. \"Who asked you to keep this secret?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallowed hard then whispered, \"Uncle John.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie sighed. \"Your uncle gave you his chaotic science?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't ask me!\" you begged, sobbing. \"I told you who made me promise, I... I don't want to get anyone in trouble!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one is in trouble, Mat.\" said Natalie, giggling. \"You see, this was test.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were surprised. \"A... A test?\" you asked. \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Loyalty must be tested, Mat.\" said Natalie. \"John passed his test by asking me, the witch council, and your mother before passing his knowledge on to you.\" she paused, giggling at your shocked expression. \"Yes, your mom knows, but your two sisters don't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was this a test for me?\" you asked, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie smiled. \"I took your book from its original hiding place inside the coffee table and planted it under the cushion of your favorite chair for you to find.\" she explained. \"I had John make you promise not to tell anyone, especially not me, to test if you would honor your promise.\" she giggled. \"You passed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, relieved. \"So, what happens now?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, first off, in case you had not yet noticed, I am a witch.\" replied Natalie. \"So is your mother, your aunts, your girl cousins, and your sisters.\" she paused, smiling. \"Only girls can work magic, boys in witch families can not unless they are transformed into a girl around the age of thirteen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shivered at the thought as, like your uncle John, you were a fan of science fiction. \"I can think of a few unpleasant things they could do to me.\" you said. \"I hope they don't though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie chuckled. \"Your uncle John had the very same fears when he discovered our magic book.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Natalie, confused. \"Magic book?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Natalie produced a book, just as thick as your own, and handed it to you. \"Compare this to your own book, Mat.\" she told you. \"Note that they are practically identical.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened the magic book and was immediately bombarded by an eerie light. Natalie knew what it was but said nothing as your chaotic science made you completely safe from its effects. As you flipped through the pages, your face turned a familiar ashen white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was John's expression when he discovered magic.\" thought Natalie. \"Only, Mat will have it much easier, he is not a twin to a witch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This... This is impossible!\" you whispered, to Natalie's giggling. \"My science is a technological version of magic itself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct, Mat.\" said Natalie, producing a much smaller book. \"Now, I need you to study this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pseudo magic is a science so advanced, it becomes magic.\" explained Natalie. \"Your chaotic science is equal to magic, therefore, you are a pseudo witch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter flipping through the pages of the smaller book, you turned to Natalie, serious. \"These are the laws I am expected to follow as a young pseudo witch, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie nodded. \"You are basically expected to follow the same laws as a witch as well as any rules your mother might impose upon your use of your science while in the house, at school, or where ever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, mom walked in with a warm smile on her face. \"Well done, Mat.\" she said, giving you a warm hug. \"I'm very proud of you for keeping your promise without directly lying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You knew about my studies all along?\" you asked, looking somewhat downcast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom giggled, releasing you. \"Don't take it so hard, Mat.\" she said. \"Even if John had not asked permission, I would have sensed that power within you the instants you began to harness it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to take this science away form you, Mat.\" assured mom, kindly. \"But I am going to enforce the same rules  upon you as I do your sisters and I am going to expect you to follow them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly nodded. \"Yes, mom.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled, rubbing her hand in your hair. \"Relax!\" she giggled. \"Sarah and Julie don't know yet. I want to see their reactions to your power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do I.\" replied Natalie, before she laughed. \"When are you going to 'tell' Mat and Sarah that magic is real?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just as soon as Julie brings Sarah back from ballet class..\" she said. she then turned to you. \"Want a few lessons?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly shook your head before smiling. \"Only if Sarah asks me nicely.\" you replied. \"Otherwise, no way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and Natalie slowly nodded at each other then smiled at you. \"Deal.\" they said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a step back at that, not knowing what to expect. Minutes later, Julie returned with Sarah to find mom waiting for them in the living room with Natalie and Mat. \"Please come sit down.\" said mom. \"I have something very important to discuss with all of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie did well to hide her smile as she knew what she wanted to talk about, as it was your thirteenth birthday. Sarah had a small grin on her face and you suspected she already knew as you could sense a power emitting from her. Once your sisters had sat down, mom explained the family secret, that all of the girls in their family were witches and that boys do not have this power, unless they are transformed into girls. She told them that boys are usually more muscular and athletic, using their uncle John's Tia Chi and athletics as an example. Only, she made no mention of the fact that you were a pseudo witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not be overzealous when you use your magic against Mat.\" warned mom. \"I know from experience that doing so brings dire consequences...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" asked Julie, knowing well what but playing along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will find out, if you go too far with Mat.\" said mom, serious. \"Remember my warning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do your sisters react?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As the pink colored energy ball came closer, your face hardened and you rose your hand to stop it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah grinned, \"That won't save you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly her words died in her throat as her spell hit an invisible wall, just beyond your outreached hand. \"Sorry, siblings.\" you said, furious, lowing your hand. \"I have powers of my own!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie and Sarah turned to you, shocked, then screamed as you summoned a pyrokinetic flame to your hand. It was not as strong as Julie's magic flame but strong enough to hold your own. You grinned at their shocked expressions then canceled your flame, turned, and walked away. As you slowly walked towards the basement stairs, you kept your senses on high alert of any magical attacks. Mom and Natalie both had shocked looks on their faces as well, knowing that it was an act made you grin more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you do that!?\" demanded Julie, sounding concerned. \"Only uncle John could...\" you turned to her with a sly grin on your face and she turned pale. \"Oh, crap! He didn't...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He did.\" you replied. \"I have nearly a full year of training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did not tell them that you were not as powerful as you had hoped to be. Your uncle John was a twin to a witch, creating a magical balance that made it easy for him to learn and develop his science quickly. As you had no twin sister, you had to work extra hard to grasp the fundamentals of chaotic science. However, like your mom, you had a steel determination and became just as powerful as any witch your own age. When John first started, he was as powerful as any witch with one year of training... and beyond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah seemed confused. \"Uncle John did what?\" she asked, turning between Julie and you. \"What did he do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uncle John is a pseudo witch, Sarah.\" replied Julie, explaining. \"That means he has a science, equal to magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was shocked. \"Uncle John, a boy, a witch!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom laughed. \"Yes, Sarah, my brother is a chaotic scientist.\" she said. \"The witching world had dubbed him a pseudo witch, or like a witch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" said Sarah, slowly. \"So, he's like a witch.\" she shrugged, \"Why did he give this power to Mat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John's son, Joe, is too young, right now.\" replied Natalie with a sigh. \"That, and he's a known girl taunter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joe doesn't hate girls.\" protested Sarah, lightly. \"He just likes to mess with our heads.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just like a certain sister in law I know.\" thought Natalie. \"Joe is not ready for that power, science or magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree your cousin, Joe is not a girl hater.\" said mom, patiently. \"However, he takes his jokes too far and punishments from both magic and science don't seem to detour him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom thought about John, he had married Megan Thompson and had four kids. Jessie (14) fresh out of witch school, she had long honey blond hair and green eyes. Lucy (13) with long honey blond hair and blue eyes. She just found out about magic and is eager to play with Joe. Jenna, (7) also having the same hair color and style, does not know about magic but carries a 'certain talent' that she keeps quiet... feels like a freak, making her very shy. Joe (8)  short brown hair and very strong, has a love for anything that builds his muscle mass. He taunts girls, just for fun, but does not know when to quit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The point is, John passed on his science to a boy he and the council believed deserved it.\" said Natalie, reeling mom from her thoughts. \"All of his closest aunts have girls in their family who will, no doubt, want to play with him as well, when they come visit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think of this as a challenge, kids.\" said mom, smiling. \"Mat has the power to fight back but, he is still learning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we still play with him?\" asked Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly smiled. \"Only if you ask nicely.\" you replied. \"Also, I  have the power to change myself back... and change all of you, please do not force that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie nodded. \"I won't go too far with you, Mat.\" she said. \"I promise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want to play with you.\" said Sarah, tearing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine.\" you told her. \"I don't mind helping either of you but I will not allow you take anything too far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and Natalie turned to each other, smiling, they were up to mischief. \"so, Mat.\" said mom, smiling. \"Who would you like to play with first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A blind man in New Jersey could have seen <i>that</i> one coming.\" you thought sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The squad is really in a bind, Mat.\" said Julie, wincing. \"Could you please help your big sis out.\" she paused. \"I've been given a few lessons in chaotic science at witch school, maybe I can help you get stronger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want to have someone to play with for a few hours.\" said Sarah, competing with her older sister. \"You always told me that you wanted to be more flexible, like Uncle John, ballet will teach that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned from Julie to Sarah, wondering what to do as mom and Elvira silently giggled in the background. They knew that you would fight against a magical experience so they had to trick you into one. \"At least they are leaving me with a choice.\" you thought. \"As little choice as it is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho do you decide to help first?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

My friend Tina's son they know of magic as Tina and her daughter Lily are witches aswell, and I invited Jake because he has taught himself some magic somehow.\" She adds, \"Actually Mrs. C, it's actually a special kind of chi that few males possess. It's like Chaotic Science, only it mimics magic even more so than Chaotic Science due to it actually waking the male's inner magical roots up quite a bit to where some of a Witch's spell can be used without it affecting the physical body to alter the genes.\" Jake says before adding, \"As such, I can use the chi whether I'm male or female. It just isn't pure magic. So if the battle gets way out of hand, I can interrupt a duel if it becomes too dangerous, to where even your own mother could get hurt due to the duel.\" \"Wow. I didn't even know that was possible, as it was never mentioned in Uncle John's book\" You say surprised. \"That is because Mat, It hadn't happened around the time he gave you the book. Only at that time, it was between two witches that're sisters, And the spells got so out of hand, That their mother who tried to interfere the slow it down almost ended up having her brain get damaged trying to block the blasts.\" He says. \"Well, thanks dude.\" You say before you notice Sarah is staring at Jake with eyes that you recognized as the eyes of someone who's been struck by Cupid's arrow. (News from the the author. \"The interruption option will be heading far into crossing over with Power Rangers, as the original version of this chapter went differently where Jake was named Nick and he's the Mystic Force Red Ranger. So, if you want to stay in The New Witch storyline with no crossover, just click \"The Duel Begins\" Option when it has a chapter made for that option that is. But if you want to see the essence of The New Witch's world crossing into Power Rangers, Just click the, \"Interruption\" Option. And sorry if the this chapter isn't making much sense to the logic you're probably used to from Runner's story. I just couldn't come up with a better idea for why Mat's mom wanted Jake/Nick to come over for the duel.)</span></div></div>",

An army of the Mbahgwie, led by a powerful warrior named Morticon, swarmed into the land with their sights set on taking over the magical realm, the human realm and beyond, but they would have to combat a legion of brave and powerful wizards. The Mystics battled valiantly against overwhelming odds until they drove the evil back from the edge of the human world. The strongest wizard of all, Leanbow, cast a spell and sent the evil warriors into the Underworld, having the Gatekeeper seal the gates for all eternity. The forces of truth successfully thwarted the dark forces' attempt to take the surface world, but they lost Leanbow, as he made sure the evil forces did not escape by sealing himself on their side of the Gate. The human world would never know of the Great Battle, nor of the sacrifices made to spare their lives from destruction. Even to this day they live in peace and tranquility, totally unaware of what is about to awaken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe city of Briarwood was struck by an earthquake, which was just enough to crack the seal, allowing evil to renew its attempt to invade the human world. The sorceress Udonna, realizing that the forces of evil had returned, sought out the warriors of legend, five teens living in Briarwood, to become the Power Rangers alongside her. While one of the teens was reluctant at first, he realized his destiny and joined the others in the fight against the Master of the Underworld and his numerous minions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Udonna loses her Ranger powers to the mysterious Koragg, it is up to Nick, Chip, Madison, Vida, and Xander to save the Earth on their own. They are assisted by Udonna's bumbling apprentice Clare, and eventually Jenji the Genie and his master Daggeron, the Solaris Knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing their powerful magic and incredible martial arts skills, the Mystic Force Power Rangers rely on teamwork to hold back the forces of evil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To protect their families, the members of the Power Rangers sent all of their immediate families to this dimension.\" said mom releasing you. \"Here, they will remain safe as your grandmother, the head witch, and the Mystic Mother, the head witch in Nick's world, are the only two who can open the portal between the two worlds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This Octomus sounds like a real problem.\" you said. \"Let me come with you, my chaotic science should come in handy and give that villain a real nasty surprise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick looked at you for a moment, then replied...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
