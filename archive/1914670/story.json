A few more presses later, and he has matching toe nails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill Joanne is oblivious to his changes. He starts to look a little impatient, as you type away. When he fidgets with his hat, you change direction. Instants later, a new hank of hair falls free and bouncing off the shoulder of his blue shirt it falls down to his waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a moment, I'm just checking the data.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiles back, his smile plastered insincerely on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you look over to him, as your finger hovers. He is completely blind to the fact that he is now she... and her name is much more suitable. Her trousers change their tailoring, shifting to become slacks. Their cut leaving no question as to her gender. Her bust a perky B-cup, supported by a simple white underwired bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks very professional, a breezy. Her outfit smart casual, bright and projecting quiet confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking back to your first meeting, you decide it's time to land the killer blow. You move the slider on the model.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoanne goes from a reasonable B-cup, up to a fulsome C-cup. You pause to enjoy the moment, the shirt... blouse just a little too tight now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the slider has further to go... she leaves behind the average figures of C-cups, and into the heavyweight category of D-cups. The blouse buttons strain as they are now too tight for their contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey slip past E-cup, and you see a pained look on Joanne's face as her bust is squeezed tighter and tighter. As the slider passes F-cup and G-cup you see the top shift. Becoming a loosely tied top, the buttons now just ornaments. Her bra shifts from a simple white material into a contrasting black, as you leave the slider at an eye-watering... eye-catching K-cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://40.media.tumblr.com/4dda5c61fd58d7de1621a045aa472c70/tumblr_nl4pgeUsnX1u3wdwxo1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://40.media.tumblr.com/4dda5c61fd58d...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Joanne what's your company bringing to the table?\" you ask her.</span></div></div>",

Yes babe, you've got to make me breakfast as usual and also clean the lounge. I have people over this afternoon for business and I can't have this place looking untidy can I?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at your clock. 5 AM. This is way too early for you to be going to work, Enrica woke you purposefully for this reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on. You'll get cold stood there like that.\" Enrica says, rolling back up in the covers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want to protest that you are not her maid but you find yourself sliding on a skimpy dressing gown and heading on through to the lounge. You can't help but obey her commands, it seems this submissiveness goes much further than work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou set to work cleaning the lounge, dusting, tidying things and moving furniture. You decide to vacuum just before you leave since it will wake up Enrica so looking at the time, 6:30 AM, you go to get yourself dressed and ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have a quick shower and then change into another outfit similar to yesterday's. Short skirt, tight blouse and stockings and heels. You do your makeup and then make a start on Enrica's breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finish her French toast with just enough time to grab yourself a small bowl of serial and glass of juice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, babe.

Although you've enjoyed your share of Lesbian porn. Heh! Probably your share and somebody else's too. It feels more intense when you're on the receiving end. When you're the receiver. Your heart races, as you imagine how this will play out. Even the idea of her taking you with a strap-on, is scary. But in a good way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a moment, she has worked some kind of self-defence move. Without effort she has you sprawled across her desk. Your arm driven up your back, leaving you helpless to resist. You feel the chill of the glass surface against your smooshed boobs. The cold making your nipples stiffen. Her free hand, you feel trace it's way down your spine, slowly caressing each vertebrae, until she reaches, the waistband of your skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body reacts to her dominance, submitting eagerly to whatever comes next. Your mind is more reluctant, trying to rationalise it away. Her fingers slip lower, pressing the fabric deeper into the cleft of your ass, as she continues further. You feel yourself twitch in anticipation, a smug giggle comes from Roxy, as she feels it too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leans over your her body pressing against yours. You feel her legs either side of one trapped thigh, as her hair slithers across yours. Her face inches from your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oooh,</i> you naughty girl. You're enjoying this...\" her voice a sensual purr. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she eases herself off of you, she spots the tablet in your free hand. With a swift gesture, she smacks it spinning away to land on the floor. You snort in fear, terrified that she's broken it. Terrified you'll be stuck as this submissive secretary. You can still see the screen through the glass surface, and watch as it goes black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTelling yourself, this is normal, this is it simply saving battery, a niggling thought teases you. Ah! But what if it isn't...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All work and no play make Jill a dull girl.\" Roxy chants like the nursery rhyme. \"Oh, and I'll keep that, to ensure, you're ready to play.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your heart, you dread what you know. You've lost control of the tablet.</span></div></div>",

One where you have no control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to a world where lowly secretaries don't have to be burdened with wardrobe choices. You my sweet, haven't earned the right to wear clothes.

The same unsettling un-natural feeling as eating broken glass, you simply don't want to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, girl. Back to work.\" she gestures you back to the door, and your waiting desk outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even the modest control of underwear, you feel how much your body moves.

You half-expect to see your skin covered in a red rash, inflamed and irritated. But your skin remains pristine. The pleasure, the absolute relief you feel at not covering up is undeniable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, there's an immense pile of distracting paperwork to deal with. Casting a furtive glance around, you don't feel much relief at the sight of the other secretaries outside of their bosses' offices. A disconcerting wave of pride washes over you as you see how modestly proportioned the other girls are... You shudder at how easily you are adjusting. At the idea of being <i>one of the girls</i>. You try to imagine them from a male view, to see them as Tom would see them. But your body refuses to become aroused, their bodies are just like yours. No erotic thoughts or fantasies come to mind.</span></div></div>",

But it looked the same, with his name in gold characters embedded in the wood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Rex Harrison : Sales Executive', as you turn back to your work, you find the screen was getting harder to read. Well, more that it was becoming harder to concentrate on what was on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA buzzer rang out across the floor, and you see all the other secretaries break out into relieved smiles. All of them reaching into the drawers, curiosity drives you to check your own drawers. You have to suppress the squeak of surprise, as you see three sex toys. As much from disbelief as anything. Half expecting them to evaporate at your touch. Your fingers brush against the smooth metal vibrator. Recoiling in shock, as it rolls to clink against the edge of the drawer. Worse still you see an immense vibrator, with a mains lead! You can already imagine the way it'll shatter your world, as you look at it's large padded head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLow muffled hums start to spill from the other desks around the floor, interspersed with muffled whimpers, softly chattering perfect white teeth, and satisfied moans as you find your own fingers drawn to the last item. It lolls heavily, a simple latex/rubber dildo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/31/8a/87/318a87b19acd7c18e66b0aa052cdb0e8.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's silence is about it's only appeal, but you still pull it from the drawer, the need to restore your concentration. A thud, wet squelch from the desk opposite, and you see her adjusting her seating. Lifting herself up, before settling back down onto her chair, and the joy spread across her features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpreading your own legs, you tenderly place your dildo against the cold plastic of the chair. Despite your caution and timidity, it still squeaks and farts as it stick in place. As it stands there, you appreciate it's size more. The damned things is as long, and as thick as your forearm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it looks so inviting, it's purpose clear, a goal you desperately need. You need your clarity of thought back. This teasing, distracting itch scratched. If you have any hope of demanding your tablet back from the boss, you need to be able to concentrate. As you reach this conclusion, you realise you're half-way through lowering yourself down. The feeling of fullness, calming and completing you. Settling in your seat, you give your hips a shimmy, and feel it move inside you. Every detail every little ribbed detail bringing you pleasure. Your body snatches control from your conscious mind, knowing instinctively what to do. Reducing you to a simple animal mind, a need, an undeniable craving. Soon, you are bouncing up and down in your chair. One arm cradling your massive bosom, stopping the sheer weight from ripping your shoulders loose. The chair creaks in protest, the springs failing to compensate for your rapid movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA warbling cry of delight fills the whole floor, and it only takes a moment for you to work out. The cry is coming from your own throat, your fingers buried in your own crotch, as you work up a sweat, your clit flicked, and twisted, teased and tugged. You feel the sweat beading up on your eyelashes, a loose rivulet trickling down your face, too near your mouth. A darting tongue sneaking a salty treat, until your yodel, quavering voice reaches a crescendo and you just shriek and shriek until exhausted you slump back down impaling yourself on the centre of your universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the sound of a door opening, you allow your head to roll backwards, to rest against the back of the swivel chair. Nothing more energetic possible with your bliss stuffed body. You see an upside down Rex Harrison emerging from his office. His business suit tailored to perfectly fit, enhance his body. You see his well stuffed trousers, and smile, as you see him twitch in response to your display. Perhaps, you can get the real thing rather than have to satisfied with just a substitute. He looks you over, his eyes taking in your whole body as a smirk appears slowly on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurely you can turn that smirk into a proper smile, and he'll listen. You need to show him you're ready. With a heave, and a semi-liquid sucking, you lift yourself off the dildo. Slapping it from the chair, it flops to land on the floor with a wet, sticky splat.</span></div></div>",

That just reminds you of your predicament, causing you to blush even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Harrison looks so commanding standing in the doorway of his office. His tablet in one hand, the fingers of his other hand dancing over the screen with pride, and joy. His face watching you intently, a tsunami of memories crash over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recall Ms. Dickson, a trace of her wicked sneering smile still visible on Mr. Harrison's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get a flash of your own body... your old body...

She wasn't defined by her body, like you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you try to square these two battling body images, you give a snort. As even Tonya fades. You look in horror at Rex, no words are exchanged, but he nods his assent, your memories are real. You were the man,... and she... no, He..., she was the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoying yourself, <i>Juicy</i>?\" he asks, his voice taunting.

To make it a fun experience for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly it hits you like a cannonball in your guts, taking your breath. Half-rising out of your chair, you feel that teasing friction, hear that semi-liquid sucking as you surge of the dildo. Your arm reaching out towards her.

You see reality, ripple around him, pulling him towards a new destination, leaving you behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour shoulders shake as your muscles quake, and you break out in floods of tears. This is your life, for now and ever more, you're just another interchangeable slutty, naked secretary, addicted to fucking yourself to peaks of loud, pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne last present comes from Rex, as your old memories return, despite your compulsive nudity, and your ingrained, instinctual inability to wear clothes, you still recall being Tom Barnes, the slightly frustrated office worker. A flare of hope lights brightly, as you dive for the keyboard, as you scan your e-mails. Your breasts dance wildly as you type feverishly, but as quick as it came, your hope fades and dies, extinguished, as you scan, again, and again. But the e-mail, that e-mail stubbornly refuses to appear. The link as far beyond your reach as your former boss.</span></div></div>",

It's 1:00, lunch time. Looking back to the closed door, Roxy Dickson's name is embedded in thick golden letters on the heavy oak door. Your stomach rumbles as you wonder if you should leave, or stay. If you leave, should you just go, or ask Roxy's permission, or are you meant to get her lunch at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get yourself into a tizzy, your timidity feels overpowering and new.

It takes you a moment to recognise him, a vague memory stirring. With a gasp, you recognise your husband. Yeahh! He can go in the office, and demand the tablet back for you, then you can end this nightmare. You admire Jack... Yes, Jack, that's his name, Jack's taut pecs, and those tiny sharp nips, that stand firm against his crisp shirt. A low whimpering purr escapes as you imagine ripping that shirt away, that powerful man. A man allowed clothes, a privilege you hadn't appreciated until Mistress Roxy helped you to that realisation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere isn't an ounce of fat on his body, and you enjoy the equally flat stomach, and the bulge in his trousers, makes you smile. You inspired that bulge. He's thinking about you. His eyes are devouring your naked body, with it's incredible curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, you get ready to race over, and leap into his embrace. Your legs to wrap around his waist, as you cover his face in kisses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jack gets closer, you see him falter, his outline judders and shifts. Before your eyes, you watch, as confusion fills his eyes, blank incomprehension clear in every fear laden glance. Sensing you don't know what he rips open his shirt, he hands slap against his flat chest. A moment later, it's no longer flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA ripe full bust, with wide pink areolae revealed along with her deep red lingerie.

You see her gesture for you to come closer, as you do, she pats her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head, surely she can't be serious. You manage to keep quiet, not expressing any objections. But it looks like ... like she wants to give you a spanking. To your own horror, you find your keep walking the short distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a wise girl, who learns her lesson.\" she cooes, mockingly, approvingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSinking to your knees at the side of her chair, there's a soft hiss. Her chair descends making it easier to lie across her lap. You feel the heat of her thighs, as they press against your abundant curves. You squirm into a better position... or a worse one. Oddly, instinctively, you know this IS normal... normal for this world. You nipples stiffen in anticipation.</span></div></div>",

First was her comment. She'd called you a cow. You were both embarrassed by how accurately the insult fit; your big sweet brown eyes, your stupid simple mind, your fat heavy tits, and your swollen frame. It was embarrassing but it also turned you on, this new bimbo personality obviously getting a kick out of how she treated you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second was her look. Miss Roxy was standing next to her desk looking over a file. She stood several inches taller than you, both from a natural height advantage but also from taller heels. Her dark hair was loose and curly around her pretty face, bright make up and expensive jewelry drawing the eye. She wore a tight, form fitting sleeveless black dress that stopped about mid thigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all fine and good but what really interested you was her actual body. Gone was the slim, yet curvy statuesque figure that you knew you gave her before everything went wrong. Instead, like you, Miss Roxy had plumped up. Not nearly as much as you had; she was more chubby where you were rather fat. Large heavy breasts packed tight into her dress, her fat gut wobbling ever so slightly as she breathed, and her chunky rear squishing against her desk. You were equal parts surprised, scared, and aroused by the sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking this in, new facts of this reality filled your head. It was the same before; woman were fewed as less, used for pleasure and breeding by most of the male populace. It was just as horrible as before only now, instead of thin and curvy bimbos being ideal, large and fat bimbos were the peak of beauty. Miss Roxy was chubby enough that, combined with her wits and drive, she was able to jump the corporate ladder. You, on the other hand, were dumb and much fatter so you made a great secretary; able to do mindless busy work and look good. Glancing around the office you noticed all of the other woman had fattened up as well. All varying weights but you noticed, mildly proud, that you were the fattest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I do for you, ma'am?\" You asked Miss Roxy, happy and bubbly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God you're obnoxious. You stupid cow,\" she muttered, though you could see her smiling faintly. This caused you to blush more, a faint dampness forming between you thick thighs. She shook her head and shut the file, offering it to you. You stepped forward and took it. \"Take care of this for me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, ma'am!\" you exclaimed excitedly. You moved to leave but she raised her hand to stop you. \"Ma'am?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold it. Let me just...\" Miss Roxy stepped forward and put her hands on your round gut, sending shivers up your spine. Her hands were cold but the touch was nice. She squeezed at your rolls, shaking and jiggling your fat body. The action only served to arouse you more, coating your body in a sheen of sweat and the dampness between your thighs grew. \"God I love your fat body, my dumb 'little' cow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-is that all y-you need, ma'am?\" You stutter, embarrassed and aroused, simultaneously wanting it to end and also wanting it to never end.</span></div></div>",

Your large gut and large breasts, still held in a lacy blue bra, hung out for her to take a good look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive me your bra,\u201d Miss Roxy commanded in a breathy tone. You didn\u2019t hesitate. You reached behind yourself and expertly unhooked your bra with your chubby fingers as if you had done this a million times. You realized that in this reality you probably had. You handed Miss Roxy the bra. She studied it for a moment before grinning and then threw it behind her desk. \u201cYou\u2019re an LL cup now? I\u2019m proud of you. Now, my cow, I\u2019m gonna suck on these gorgeous fat tits of yours and you\u2019re gonna moan - no, you\u2019re gonna moo for me. Got it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t even wait for you to respond before wrapping her plump lips around your swollen nipple. You were nodding anyways, the immediate pleasure of her lips and tongue forcing you to let out a sensual moan. Suddenly you felt Miss Roxy\u2019s nails digging into your love handles, the pain surprising and turning you on more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMoooooooo,\u201d you moaned, much to your boss's pleasure. You felt and uncomfortable pressure continue to build in your breasts the more Miss Roxy sucked until finally it gave out and you felt a wave of pleasure and her Miss Roxy moan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down you were total shock to see a white liquid leaking from your swollen right tit and Miss Roxy\u2019s cheeks fill and her swallow and she drank away. You were lactating! You really were a swollen cow. This \u2018milking\u2019 session continued on for quite a while. Every few minutes Miss Roxy would stop drinking to take a breath, congratulate you on the taste and your \u201cexcellent mooing\u201d, and then switch tits. Every now and then you\u2019d reach between your thick thighs, hoping to touch your own dripping pussy, but Miss Roxy would wordlessly swat your hand away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, when you were pretty sure both your breasts had been emptied as they were no long leaking and seemed a tad smaller, Miss Roxy stood and wiped her mouth with her hand. She let out a small belch and smiled. You couldn\u2019t help but notice how swollen her tummy was now, full of your milk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, that better than yesterday. Keep this up and I might be as big as you soon,\u201d she chucked, slapping your ass playfully but also hard enough to make you wince, her hand leaving a mark. You liked it though. \u201cNow, on your knees.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain you didn\u2019t hesitate. It was like your body was on autopilot. A small, tiny glimmer of the old you, the person you had been this morning that you didn\u2019t even remember screamed in defiance. But it was useless. Not even your stupid bimbo mind was in control. It was only your body; it just wanted to please and be please. You smiled upon feeling the sensation of your fat ass squishing against your heels as you lowered yourself into the kneeling position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, good,\u201d Miss Roxy purred, her praise making your smile wider and your panties wetter. She ran her hand through your hair. \u201cNow, I want you to do what you do best. Eat.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Miss Roxy leaned against her desk and spread her thick legs and you saw her pussy, shaven and dripping. Instinctively you leaned forward eager to get to work but you paused, a request on the tip of your tongue. You shrugged it off, not bothering to try to ask, and moved forward but Miss Roxy stopped you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it cow? You looked like you wanted to say something,\u201d she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I just,\u201d you stammered, finding it hard to concentrate. \u201cI was just going to ask if I could touch myself while I ate, ma\u2019am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh of course,\u201d Miss Roxy grinned. She leaned back and reached into her desk. After a moment she found what she was looking for and handed a giant dildo, at least bigger around and longer than your own fist and forearm, to you. \u201cBut only if you use this. I gotta it just for you.\u201d Miss Roxy winked, obviously proud of her choice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, ma\u2019am!\u201d You eagerly took the toy and, spreading your thick thighs and lifting your fat belly with one hand, easily slid it into your moist pussy, moaning and mooing the the whole time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d Miss Roxy gasped, mouth agape. You just giggle and smiled at her, no longer able to form words, and leaned forward and got to work. Miss Roxy was obviously surprised by your reaction and gasped in surprise and your tongue entered her. She had assumed it would be too much for you and she'd get to enjoy you struggle for a bit, but no. In this new reality, this bimbo version of you was used to toys actually bigger than this but you still loved it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou worked feverishly for what seemed forever, working your tongue across Miss Roxy\u2019s clit like an expert and simultaneously pumping that giant toy into yourself as quick and aggressive as possible, mooing into your boss\u2019s crotch all the while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, you and Miss Roxy reach climax near simultaneously. Multiple orgasims racked your bodies as you refused to stop either action, working mindlessly like this is what you lived for. Miss Roxy\u2019s thick thighs squeezed your head and she screamed in pleasure but this only drove you to continue more vigorously until Miss Roxy pushed you away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god, you slutty little cow,\u201d Miss Roxy panted affectionately as she slumped against her desk. She watch you tumble backwards, you fat ass spreading across the floor, belly shaking, and tits flopping to the sides as you continued to pump the toy in and out of yourself for another five minutes until you had worn yourself out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eventually released it, though it was still in you, and just laid there, panting. Your big body and little mind were exhausted.</span></div></div>",

Equally yourself, more as Tom, than Jenna. Despite knowing this for a fact, and wanting desperately to get back to your computer and restore yourself. There's a growing part that's comfortable... well, finds this normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cradling warmth of your bra, no longer feels like the alien tightness constricting your chest like a smothering snake. Taking a couple of calming breaths, you breathe in time with her. With one hand on the handcuffs, she lowers your bound hands until they rest in your lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer ignorance of the past do make her more comfortable, and you try and embrace that aspect. A sense of vulnerability makes your stomach flutter, as you sit beside her. Your tushie still warm from her recent attention. The lowered panties still wrapped around your knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" she mutters in a low impressed voice. Her eyes fixed on your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll make some young man, very happy... or,\", she adds with a smirk, \"some lucky lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer words startle you from your own thoughts. 'Tushie', isn't how you've ever referred to your own arse before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flinch, as her hands come to rest on your breasts, as she lifts them, her face having the merest hint of jealousy, as she pulls the girls forward. With your bra proudly on display, you feel a degree of ...not comfort.... but safety, that Roxy is female, as female as you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sense of femininity, of weakness and vulnerability... make you intensely aware of your body's reactions. You're becoming aroused. Your body is warm and squirming, and Roxy is radiating her own warmth and proximity. The absence of a cock, in the room, the barest of comforts. Hell, even the word 'cock', brings up images, sensations, and fires your imagination. A sense of innocence, <i>in this body</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut your Jenna body, is taut with tension. Ready to release like a plucked bow. Your cheeks burn as you try to bury your nervousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you a virgin?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head<i> 'No!'</i>, rapidly, but you can't force the words past your lips. The niggling at the back of your mind reminding you, \"In this body, you absolutely are....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gentle.\" she assures you. As she slides her thumbs over the soft curve of your bust, and the electric teasing embrace of your bra. Your breath catches, as she catches the material. Her caressing thumbs, pushing the bra away. Exposing more and more ripe, succulent flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a taunting friction, you feel your nipples spring free, and the look of wanton approval on her face is pure lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://68.media.tumblr.com/5df4e9cab7de87f0e80d9369cfe568bf/tumblr_oqieb2lL4F1w2lwkto1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://68.media.tumblr.com/5df4e9cab7de...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have been keeping this from me?\" her eyebrow raised quizzically.</span></div></div>",

Your eyes flicking away, at the intensity of her gaze. You mumble around the gag, a trickle of drool slipping from the corner of your mouth. You fight wildly, but only succeed in making that trail of saliva, leap from your chin, to land and continue trickling lower. The curve of your bosom directing it's travel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's your reaction that confirms her guesswork. You see an idea form behind her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a small experiment.\" You aren't sure if she meant to speak, even that bare whisper.

Her toes drum against the desk, as she tries to escape the blows, but the desk prevents her. If anything her boss is inspired, as she grinds her crotch against the edge of the desk. The same fruitless escape attempt, her crimson arse not allowing her to quit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the door behind her, she barely masks the sound of discipline, as Roxy returns her attention to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll like it here.\" she purrs, as she looks you over, drinking in the details of your helpless vulnerability.</span></div></div>",

His socks crawling up his legs and turning into stockings as his legs slimmed down and became more toned and sexy. His shirt and tie soon followed his new skirt: the tie becoming a cute bow while his shirt was the top half of the dress. His arms and torso slimmed down until two buds began to form on his chest.

It seems a shame to leave the lost little Haruko without a companion. Your eyes run down the different sliders controlling Fuyuko's personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne shows her as almost completely submissive, you slide that to the same distance from the other side. Instantly you see the effect on her, with her back straighter, she carries herself with more authority. She struts more confidently around the office, as her gaze passes over you, you feel the withering contempt. She knows you're not working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding the body sliders, you proceed with your plan, the slider shifts upwards, A-cup \u00bb DD-cup. You smile as she looks remarkably top-heavy with those slender legs, and her blouse clinging tightly to her curves. With a bust like that, there's no point in trying to minimise it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shift her sexual preference to lesbian skewed bisexual, with a tendency towards domination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext with her frustration rising towards the surface, you send Fuyuko to join Haruko, to guide her on her place in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwitching the view back to the Japanese Villa, you see once more the former Jim, now Haruko, still not adjusting to her lovely body. A moment later, it shifts to the living room, and a moment after that, the sofa is filled, as reality shifts, and Yukiko appears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dilly-dilly-do.tumblr.com/image/159489261924\" target=\"_blank\">https://dilly-dilly-do.tumblr.com/image/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, her mind has reprogrammed her clothes as she transported there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soft creak of the corset, as she breathes has you stiffening even more. With a Yukiko as gate-keeper, you don't see Haruko leaving, unless she can sneak out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith predator-like awareness, she hears the soft noises coming from the bedroom. Despite her boots, she moves silently towards her target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking down the narrow corridor, Yukiko's hand runs along the wall decorations. A selection of strap-ons, leather paddles, swing gently at her caressing touch. On the opposite wall, you spot the future '<i>clothes</i>', for Jim/Haruko. It's mostly leather, mostly bondage, and you doubt if it's terribly comfortable.</span></div></div>",

The noise of the door opening draws Haruko's eyes to the new arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks stunned and scared, her first instinct, is that it's for her bum. Then with her eyes widening, she realises there's a more natural home for it. Followed immediately by the thought that crouching on the bed, her mouth is at the perfect height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo terrified to speak, to object she mutely shakes her head in a slow 'no'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko's reply is just as silent, as she nods 'yes', with a flick of her hand she sets it bobbing, drawing Haruko's eyes in terrified fascination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only takes a moment for her to pounce, in a moment, she's atop Haruko, her weight resting on her victim's plump, perfect rear. With one arm twisted up her back, Haruko can do nothing but squirm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether defeated, or resigned, her struggles are brief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps she's rallying her strength for a renewed burst, but she doesn't get the chance, as in one smooth fluid motion. Yukiko lifts herself up, and with her free hand guides the dildo towards it's new home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe look on Haruko's face, as the full length slips inside her is a mix of surprise, disbelief, and pleasure. As Yukiko gets a steady rhythm going, the open-mouthed look of confusion on Haruko's face takes on a more animalistic look. Her breathing comes in time with her domme's thrusts, growing more guttural, more sexual with each panting breath. Her face fills, the screen, as you watch her try to battle, try to deny the whole body joy she's experiencing. The joy she's being brought as a woman, by a woman, while she still struggled to understand her former male memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTilting the tablet, you try to get a clearer view of the whole coupling. The clenching of Yukiko's buttocks, as she takes the man's role. Those powerful thighs controlling the girl beneath her. The bouncing counter-point, of Yukiko's bust in the corset, as each thrust impacted against Haruko's rippling rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut instead, you have only Haruko's face, her sexual panting dissolving into a cry, a warbling rising continuous cry as she heads inevitably towards her climax. You find yourself stiffening at the sight of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I'd a better view.\" you mutter under your breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Voice command accepted.\"</i> The words come unemotionally from the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you are struggling to formulate a reply to the unexpected response, \"<i>What... wait... Um.</i>..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the blink of an eye, your vision changes to floorboards. They're only about a foot from your face, and the sound of sex draws your attention. The aromas make your nostrils prickle, and every detail, every liquid sound, merges with the breathing, the warbling climax, and you turn to see Haruko slump forward. Her sweat streaked hair clenched in Yukiko's knotted fist. Also holding her in place is the dildo still buried in her back-hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's your turn to swallow nervously, as she looks over to you and wink, \"Your sister's awake... Just in time for round two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take in your own body, the heavy weight pulling at your shoulders, your bust is massive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://68.media.tumblr.com/61630270af9b212f017beae112ca0942/tumblr_ojydzogApG1w2lwkto3_r1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://68.media.tumblr.com/61630270af9b...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanic fills you, as you see and hear Yukiko slip out with a sucking, squelching as she frees herself from the exhausted Haruko.

Her hand runs caressing down your spine, every vertebrae feeling her touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've kept you waiting long enough.\" her promised whisper sounding like the most intimate threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn horror, you realise you can't read the screen.

A pistoning rhythm starts, and you find yourself breathing in time to her thrusts. Your breaths becoming grunts, your grunts becoming moans. Your moans rising in volume and pace as she expertly brings you to a climax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbelievably, she doesn't stop, until you are shrieking with a joy you've never felt before, never knew you could experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're mine now, body and soul.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mistress, thank you Mistress.\" you purr in delighted response, as you surrender to your body's needs, pleasures and her control.</span></div></div>",

That your own humiliation is about more than just being an new office girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe directions on the piece of paper are clear. But you instantly want to retreat back home. As soon as you step outside, you feel eyes on you. Men openly leering, and other women also checking you out. Their looks more intent, more focused on what artifice was giving you such a prominent bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel the swish of your skirt with every step. The tightness keeping your steps short and lady-like, when you want to race, away, to rush to your destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crushing indignity of the train is probably the worst. The sheer press of bodies, crushing all around you. The hands that squeezed and pinched as you were pinned in place. Your lack of height made the experience akin to being in a forest of male chests, stopping you seeing your assailant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping angrily, and burning with humiliation off the train, you try and restore some dignity. Running your hands down your hips, you smooth out the wrinkles, both real and imagined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an angry tug on your hem of your blouse, you make it more presentable, too. Although, at the cost of making the girls more prominent. The girls bounce, as you walk down the stairs to the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCursing to yourself in a low voice, you hear a filthy chuckle inside your head confirming what you suspected. Jasmine has removed your much needed bra from your outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a drunk, you  walk the street, muttering to yourself, your face contorting until you reach your office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large sign above the door welcomes you to the 'Sakura Pantyhose Company.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDetermined not to be defeated before you start, you tell yourself, the product is irrelevant, this is an office job, and you're here to do it to the best of your abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u3044\u3089\u3063\u3057\u3083\u3044\u307e\u3059...

Apart from your sumptuous bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls swirl around you like the perviest creeps. Their fingers probing, checking your bust... is yours... You skitter forward like a new born foal, as you feel fingers caress your tights. You move en masse past the reception desk, the empty reception desk. Giggling approval at your expected success, a girl as cute as you will surely bring in the business.</span></div></div>",

You've never felt so intimidated before, and never imagined you'd feel harassed by their attention. In your imagination, it was a lot more fun. As the girls caress your thighs, and run their hands over your full rear. You gasp in shock, as another girl, rather too firmly grips your bust, running her thumb back and forth across your stiffening nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to breathe in time to her attentions. Your head snaps around as you hear the door click shut behind you. The girls chuckle and oooh, appreciatively, as they unbutton your blouse. A squeak of surprise slips out, as you feel another of the girls working on your skirt. With a pop, the button works loose, and she smirks, as she lowers the zipper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the girls have you stark naked, and you try to protect your modesty as best you can. However, predatory their glances and caresses feel, you hear their appreciation, their jealousy of your curves. While you are an inch or two taller, than all of them, and almost a foot taller than the shortest girl, you feel skittish and alert for the next assault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls separate, allowing you to see your work-wear. Apparently, you are expected to wear Sakura clothes entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the girls nudges you playfully, blushingly telling you of her experience as receptionist. Telling you that you are expected to enjoy the attention of the visitors. Suggesting they experience how soft the pantyhose are, with a simple caress. This is a big selling point of the brand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl tells you that you'll meet some lovely husband material in this job... She smirks, looking enviously at your body... if you're looking for a husband, or a wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEager to get dressed, to have something between their eyes and your naked flesh. A soft moan of disappointment, comes from a couple of the girls as you slip on the bra. Though an admiring murmur at how well you look, as the girls are lifted and supported boosting their profile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe panties cleave tightly to your flesh, the shiny material catching the light and highlighting every soft contour. As you slip the pantyhose on, you feel an electric frisson, as they slide up your legs. It's as if they're making your skin more sensitive, more alert to ... to everything. Smoothing out imaginary wrinkles, has you fighting an arousal you never expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour reaction doesn't go unnoticed, as the girls around you giggle their appreciation, or blush at their own fond memories. A few more wandering hands have you hissing through your clenched teeth, as you try to maintain control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00abEnjoying the attention.\u00bb The voice comes from nowhere, and none of the girls react to the sound of Jasmine's taunting voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer words inspire you to get dressed faster, slipping the blouse into place, you feel your bust bounce. Fastening the buttons, you start to feel almost clothed. Although it's not terribly big, or long, you really wish it covered more. However, you slip the skirt up your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00abJust imagine how it'll feel when it's not simply <i>other </i>girls...\u00bb she taunts. Her words dripping with malice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skirt is incredibly short, and tight as you button it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00abI can ensure you win.\u00bb Jasmine offers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suspect a trap, and wish you could spit back an angry response. But you'd just look mad addressing the empty air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00abOf course, there's a price.\u00bb she adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you put your shoes on, you see the other girls leaving, heading off to their jobs around the company.</span></div></div>",

Most of the men's hands tend to wander a little too high, and end with a friendly pat. The underwear is smooth and sensual, and even seems to enhance your sensitivity. Each touch becoming a caress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour lunch is a simple bento box, and you find you have a natural proficiency with chopsticks. Your wider hips and fuller rear are cause for comment from those who also work for the company. The comments are discrete, but you manage to pick up the gist of them. A few of the leggy secretaries snigger at your figure, clearly thinking it's the only reason you have the job. They seem to find you, either unsettlingly curvy, or hope their boyfriends or husbands don't see you as a new ideal. With their hands over their mouths, they turn the patronising smiles, and dismissive laughs into cute coughs, and sneezes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt leaves you thinking of Jim and her situation. As you put the empty lunch box away, you return to your desk. But your calm equilibrium is disturbed by a worrying thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHas Jim been promised the same thing.

Perhaps the game is still being played, but for higher stakes, with both of you risking a worse fate in a more extreme body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpitting and snarling under your breath at the treachery and deceit of Jasmine, you make a terrible receptionist, with bits of rice and spittle decorating your computer screen as you rage impotently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of the door opening helps you recover yourself. You certainly don't want an extension of your work hours, now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, it's just a gaggle of slender secretaries returning from lunch themselves. Their tight clothes enhancing their taut curves to accentuate the slightest of figures. The short skirts and perfect make-up to draw eyes to their supple, slim legs, or to their perfect faces and demure smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they pass, you tell yourself, this is not your fate. Not your future. Wiping the mess from the screen, you decide to take control. Besides, you're now fairly confident that Jasmine isn't watching all the time.

No sooner have you pressed, enter than a flurry of pink sparkles shoots upwards past your eyes, shimmering and glittering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou land with a squelp... as you fall the few inches to land on the toilet seat. You sound a lot more excited and startled than you would like to admit. Even that sends a tense pulse through your nethers. You also feel the shifting, as your breasts bounce and settle. The constraint of the bra, unfamiliar but oddly calming, as it holds you firmly. Your nips are a little offended by the sharp rubbing they just received.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCradling your breasts, you try to estimate their size. A difficult task from this unfamiliar angle, but you think they're above average. The corner of your mouth quirks up, at the idea of your status in the company being visible in such a manner. Your thumbs shift, and brush over your nipples, which spring back to diamond hardness. Another moist flush tingles and you squeeze your thighs together, to hold on to that feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour clothes have changed too, reflecting your new gender. The short skirt, tightly tailored to accentuate the minimal curves of your waist and hips. The jacket,cannot hide the swell of your bust. You want to see your face, more desperately than you want to admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling of vulnerability, sends a fire racing up and down your spine. Stopping to keep you moist, and your nipples at attention. A sniggering wicked thought inspires you to turn the tablet off. Making it harder for you to flee your current situation. You give a little sexual grunt, as the icons vanish and the screen fades to black. You slide it inside the clutch bag that now hangs from your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to stop your hand shaking as you reach for the bolt. Your eye line is much lower, but inside the cubicle you can't guess your new height very well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a solid -snick- the bolt slides aside, and you step out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hide your gasp of surprise. You're the shortest in here now. Barely reaching to the shoulders of the <b>other </b>women. You can't be more than five feet tall. But as you jostle for position to see your reflection it is clear that you are packed with curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou catch one of the women's glances in the mirror. Her look is.... is.... it's hard to define. But she's certainly looking at you differently. More like she's judging you, assessing you. Checking you out as competition, as a rival.</span></div></div>",

One argument is loud enough to make out pieces of the conversation. One lead salesman and his secretary are defending some poor performance... Tellingly, they're not making any impact on the boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's irresistible to listen in, the raised voices making it harder to tune out. The thought of being caught eves dropping sets you back into motion. However, before you can even pass the door. It starts to open. Fear drives you to take a few steps backwards, rather than walk-by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA puff of pink drifts out, settling towards the floor and thinning to disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is your fault.\" One woman hisses angrily pushing her friend before her. One hand thrusting angrily into her back, the other gesturing to her clothes. It trembles, as it hovers near her short skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care about that, Suzie....\" She gestures to Suzie's torso, her bust barely fitting inside her top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second push, sends the Suzie to collapse over the desk. Suzie looks terrified, and crest-fallen. Her boss seems furious with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S.S..Sorry... Ms. Winters...\" She stutters an apology, hands cradling her bust that ripples and surges at the violent shoves. She appears contrite, but a twinkle in her eye as she addresses her boss, tells you that Ms. Winters was until a moment ago Mr. Winters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA resounding thwack, to her well-presented rump, ends her smirk with a pained gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still. your. boss.\" Ms. Winters insists through gritted teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne hand keeps Suzie pressed to the table, while another knots itself, into the low cut back of the dress. Twirling until it's balled around her fist. A yank has the stitches popping, and a second heave pulls it entirely free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe show is too hypnotic to interrupt, as Suzie lies naked but for her panties. Ms. Winters taking her hand from Suzie's back, pulls them down with a teasing slowness. Her fury daring Suzie to even attempt to escape, she dutifully steps free from her panties as they reach her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStraightening up, Ms. Winters gives Suzie another couple of spanks. Leaning across her, pressing her body against her secretary she presses her into the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gasp, ensures the panties are rammed home between her teeth.  Eyes widening, Suzie coughs, struggles, gags, but the panties remain in her mouth. Ms. Winters hand pressed firmly across her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep them.\" she snarls, as she straightens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could've avoided this... if you'd given me the right data.\" Her voice sounding more petulant, rather than commanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rip as the tape is pulled almost lost in the exchanged glances between the two women. In moments, Suzie is helpless and vulnerable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/30/83/0b/30830b48c761de4074f857053baae0c0.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/30/83/0b/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You deserve this...

In her place, a shorter curvier woman now stands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a sense of dread building as you look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will I...\" you start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut are engulfed in a -<span class=\"cppink\"><i>pooof</i></span>- and a pink cloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the smooth steel of the elevator doors you see the terrified girl looking back at you. Her erect nipples demanding attention, even breathing means they scrape teasingly back and forth in your humongous bra. You never realised how sensitive they could be, and soon your breath comes in needy, heaving pants as your arousal builds. Your libido rockets, and you feel your mind sink into the background, as baser drives take control, and you fall back to a more instinctive creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your last coherent thoughts fade, you realise why Haruko was so nervous in the car. -<i>Tee Hee</i>-.

So you quickly slipped back into the dress and clicked away on your red pumps before anyone had a chance to ask you to do something.  You currently felt so humiliated and feminized that you were afraid you'd give into any request and transform further into more submissive roles until there was no going back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHome as your only hope, as the head of the household you could finally regain your maleness and undo this crazy reality!  After a humiliating drive home, you clicked your heels through the front door, setting your red purse on the counter as though it wasn't the first time you'd been through this.  You felt a fuzzy memory in your head that suggested it was a nearly daily occurrence when coming home from work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetie, I'm home!\"  You called out in a singsongy young woman's voice, feeling humiliated just by the sound of its innocence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard your wife, who was named Sakura in this reality, call back from the other room.  \"Oh don't you sound cute today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she rounded the corner and made eye contact with you, she smiled, taking in your gorgeous feminine look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were going to come back with something, but you stammered, \"I- cute?  I uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when you felt your face flush with a mixture of embarassment and horror, as your fears about what had just happened were about to come true.  You saw your wife erupt in a -pooof- of pink dust, and when it cleared, was a tall handsome, middle aged Japanese man with a sly grin on his face.  \"Well, well... looks like they really took a lot out of you at work today.  It's been a while since I've got the privilege of being in charge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a step back in fear at the sight of this strange man who you felt like you knew intimately, but were strangers with at the same time.  Sakura was now Sato, and your wife was now your husband.  After all the modeling today, you had all the masculinity beaten out of you, so to speak, and couldn't even stand up to your wife anymore.</span></div></div>",

You were afraid that somehow you'd messed up once again, when you looked down and noticed the pair of breasts still sitting on your chest.  You nearly flipped out until you noticed what you were wearing, and how you felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red mini dress was now replaced with a more comfortable blouse and sensible women's slacks.  Your breasts were still as perky as ever, but with only a hint of cleavage showing.  Your shoes were no longer red pumps, but replaced by fashionable black ankle boots which peeked out nicely from under your slacks.  You inspected your body and brushed a long lock of jet black hair aside.  You weren't sure, but you felt like this was somehow an improvement.  You certainly felt less vulnerable all of a sudden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally looked back to your husband, and noticed his reaction seemed... relieved?  \"Well Taeko,\"  Which was apparently your feminine japanese name in this reality, \"Good to see they didn't completely break you down.  It's been so long since I've been Sato, I didn't want to spend that time with a bimbo of a wife.  You're much more beautiful when you're mature and womanly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were lost in emotions and simply nodded at what he said.  You were still not the dominant one in the relationship, but you'd taken a step closer, and had transformed into a more mature woman.  You leaned into your husband and reminded yourself not to cry or this would all be for naught.  You looked up and pulled his face towards yours for a kiss, not waiting around for him to make the first move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a smaller -poof- this time, this time coming from your head.  Your hair had shortened down to your shoulders, instead of coming down your back, and you felt your breasts shrink half a cup size to a full C cup.  You smiled as you knew this was how it had to be done.  You couldn't be the woman in the relationship.  You had to show your -wife- who was really in charge, or you'd end up being the wife forever.</span></div></div>",

This is truly the good life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt purges all the stress from your day, and with a deep yawn you re-open your eyes. The heat of the Sun, and the nearby loungers seem wonderfully tempting. A break from Sato's eyes staring at your ass, even your modest bust getting it's share of the attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIntending to only rest for a moment, you lie back on the warm soft cushion covering the lounger.

His face inches from yours, the scent of his last meal still on his breath. His warmth as he stradles your slender but voluptuous body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilently your mouth opens and closes, no answer coming to mind. The bulge of his trunks resting on your taut tummy, only the thinnest of fabrics separating you from his cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking your silence as consent, he leans forward, and plants a passionate kiss on your ripe lips. As he eases himself back upright, you try to sit up, to continue the contact, the sweetness of his kiss. But his powerful hands rest on your shoulders, his fingers teasing away the stress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he sits more erect, you also feel -<i><b>it</b></i>- as it stirs towards life and action.

As his trunks catch your attention, you find your mouth incredibly dry, and your lips parched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it was a fun experiment.

You want to reverse it, but you aren't sure you could find it again. That you can remember the password to grant you access. However, there are more pressing matters on your mind, as you see Sato, untie his trunks and fish out his cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body responds, driving coherent thought from your mind, as you feel your nipples crinkle erect, and an aching itch building in your crotch, as he pulls out just what you need to scratch that itch. It looks big enough to split you in two, especially with this body. It looks to be almost a foot long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remain hypnotised, transfixed, as he eases your bikini bottom aside. With one smooth powerful stroke he's inside you. Filling you, completing you. Your breath held as you try to also hold onto the ecstasy of the moment. It only restarts as Sato gets going. Your breathing coming in time with his thrusts. Each one dismissing your office day further and further into the recesses of your mind. Each thrust confirming... This... This! is your purpose in life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing your head back, you let out a warbling shriek of absolute pleasure as you cum....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeside, Sato's earned it.

Quickly you find an explanation that starts to make sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In an effort to be the leader in workplace gender equality, this company has been the first of many to employ a new strategy.  All employees must spend a minimum of half their work hours as the opposite gender, to understand how the other half of society lives.  Every day upon arriving at the office, you'll be transformed into the opposite gender until after lunch time, and half your daily tasks are complete.  If you're unable to complete these tasks, you will not change back, even when leaving company property, until your work is complete.  You're encouraged to not fall behind on your work, and work from home if necessary to change back.  Gender swapped employees are forbidden from accessing the internet to promote productivity, until they are back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe explanation continued on and on like it was some sort of legal contract, which you learned was what you were forced to sign when this system was put in place, or lose your job.  In this reality, systems like this were becoming commonplace across all across the country, and it had revolutionized gender equality.  But you weren't sure you liked the sound of it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit... what have I done?\"  You said in a feminine voice as you realized the gravity of this situation.  \"Wait they said something about no internet...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you tried to access realityshift.net through your tablet, your browser simply showed the symbol of a flashing red hand and the words '<span class=\"cred\">BLOCKED</span>'.  You tried a different browser, and disabled AdBlock just in case, and nothing you did seemed to be able to get to ANY website.  You looked down at your pantyhose clad legs, and tiny delicate hands, and knew that you were stuck this way for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I guess the only thing to do is get my work done then?\"  You sighed.</span></div></div>",

You were lucky they hadn't shut off access to the company network as you had to start shooting off dozens of emails to people.  But before you could get started on any real tasks, a pretty young woman came hurrying towards your desk, taking small steps in her heels.  She looked like she was in a real panic.  You wondered who on Earth she might be, considering you'd genderswapped the whole company (and made them all Japanese to boot), but then you noticed the name-tag.  It was Jim, your boss... actually your boss's boss, the CTO.  His nametag actually showed his real name, and then right below it was his gender swapped Japanese name, Junko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tom!  Err, I guess you're still Taeko.  Looks like you haven't finished your work either yet huh?\"  She said with a nervous giggle.  It was strange imagining the mind of Jim, the 6 foot 4 CTO inside that giggling Japanese girl, Junko, but you supposed you looked the same from his... her perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head, noticing the way your hair flew to either side as you did, \"Sorry I've only just got started... I was busy this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed, \"Right... well I hate to do this to you, but we've got an emergency.  There was a lightning strike that took out half our client's network, and we're having an emergency meeting on how to fix it ASAP.  Get your things together and meet us upstairs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Junko left, you cursed, knowing that a meeting like this would likely take all day.  There was no way you'd be able to get any work done today.  You gathered the papers you needed and absent mindedly slung a small purse over your shoulder without even thinking about it.  When you stood up you smoothed your skirt and adjusted your breasts in their bra, subconsciously wanting to look nice for your bosses.  You found yourself navigating the halls in office heels with ease, and noticed you were one of the shortest girls in the building, nearly being run over by people in a hurry.  You found yourself muttering \"gomen\" apologizing in Japanese to random passersby who bumped into you, despite it being their fault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you arrived at the meeting room and sat down with your legs closed, and had to raise up the chair as high as it would go, and still felt like a child.  Most of the other people in the room were also Japanese girls like yourself, but you noticed they seemed more mature and well endowed than you, possibly due to their position in the company.  Then there was a few of your coworkers who you instantly recognized, because they hadn't been transformed at all?  Or perhaps they had already finished their work for the day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taeko!\"  One of the men said, authoritatively towering over you.  \"Look we have no time for gawking, you heard about the situation, so let's get started!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meeting went on for hours, and halfway through, a few of the girls -poooofed- and changed back into men, but you didn't change at all.  Turns out they were managers and it is their job to have meetings, so they completed their tasks for the day...  That hardly seemed fair to you, but as an engineer, you had to deal with people like them on a daily basis.  Finally though, the meeting finished, and it was already time to go home.  You wouldn't get paid for any overtime, but maybe you could get work done at home, and change back finally?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After hours of grueling meetings, you practically collapsed at your desk, noticing it was already after hours.  You spent a few minutes tackling emails and trying to get some work done, but you realized your new body was just too exhausted to keep going.  You knew it was no use trying to finish all this today, as you'd just pass out at your desk.  It was time to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly headed to your car, easily navigating your way around in high heels, as though you'd been wearing them for years.  You remembered that in this reality, you really had been wearing them for years.  If what you read was correct, every day for the past few years your company has been forcing you to be this woman for at least half the work day.  So it only makes sense that it would feel so natural to you now.  Even driving your car was less of a chore than you expected.  You quickly adjusted the seat and mirrors to your new height, noticing that it was still adjusted for your male self.  You didn't even bother taking off your heels as you drove, hell, you forgot you were even wearing them at one point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally arrived at home, and were about to rush to your PC, when you stopped dead in your tracks.  Your wife, Sarah, was already home and staring at you confused for a second, you panicked. \"Honey!  Look, it's me, Tom-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled and walked towards you, \"Of course I know it's you!  Must have been a long day for you to return as Taeko?  So sorry sweetie...\"  She embraced your tiny body lovingly, and you melted into her arms.  You looked up at her (even in your high heels), and she gave you a sweet kiss on the forehead.  You found yourself on the verge of tears, as the flood of emotions hit you.  Your wife was still so supportive of you, despite how you looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry I look this way, just...  It's ok if you don't want to be with me tonight.\"  You mumbled, flustered by all the emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah broke off the embrace, and looked at you strangely, \"Why wouldn't I?  Oh sweetie, you're self conscious again aren't you?  Well don't be.  Taeko is such a cute, sexy little thing, and you are her.  It wouldn't be the first time we spent time together as two girls.  I thought you enjoyed it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Enjoyed it?</i>, you thought.  This reality change had definitely gone farther than you thought.  Was your wife implying she was bisexual with you as Taeko?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stood there with your mind racing around the possibilities, she leaned down and gave you a sensual kiss on your supple lips.  You felt your cheeks turning red in embarassment as she squeezed one of your full breasts through your blouse.  You moaned as you desperately wanted her to continue, but she broke away with a mischevious grin.  You mumbled \"I uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah stopped you, \"There will be time for more of that later tonight, if you're feeling up to it.  For now though, I need to make sure dinner isn't burnt, and get everything ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your incredible wife left for the kitchen, you stood there for a minute in a strange haze, not sure what just happened.  A part of you suddenly wanted to stay in this body, and find out what being a lesbian with your wife was like.  However you snapped out of your daze as the other part of you realized you still needed to get online and fix reality!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kicked your heels off and padded your stocking clad feet towards the bedroom where your PC was waiting for you.  Quickly bounding into the chair, you noticed the jiggle of your good sized breasts as you sat down.  But there was no time for that as you quickly tried to get online to realityshift.net...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your horror, your browser simply showed an error page: '-<span class=\"cred\">BLOCKED</span>- Internet restriction chip is detected in user, access denied.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit... internet restriction chip?  They put a fucking chip in me?!\"  You looked up and down your smooth hairless arms for any sign of an implanted chip, but found nothing.  You hadn't the slightest idea where they'd put a chip.  Maybe it was buried inside your brain for all you knew.  But you knew there was only two choices left to you.</span></div></div>",

If she found out you tried to make your company a harem full of Japanese girls, she'd be furious.  No, you knew you had to fix this yourself, and without internet access it would be difficult.  Your best bet, you assumed, would be to work extra hard tomorrow to get everything done as soon as you could, so you could get your internet access back, and undo everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found yourself absentmindedly rubbing your smooth leg under your skirt.  You had been enjoying the way it felt, the tight clothing clinging to your body, a lot more than you expected.  \"Maybe... it's not so bad staying like this for tonight?  I mean, Sarah seems fine with it, happy even.  It's been a while since she's seemed so into me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was decided then, you closed the website, and logged out of your PC for the night.  You looked down at your tiny feminine body and tried to psych yourself up for today.  You could see a valley of cleavage as your blouse's top few buttons were undone, and you decided to leave it that way.  If Sarah liked you like this, you decided to play it up a bit.  You reached down and pulled your stockings off, revealing silky smooth ivory legs without a single blemish on them.  You tried to pull your skirt down for modesty, but it was so short you could give anyone a view of your pink panties by sitting the wrong way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Taeko~\"  Your wife called, exaggerating your Japanese girl form's name.  \"Food's ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One second!\"  You called out in a meek, high pitched girl's voice.  If it didn't suit your body so much, you'd have felt so emasculated when you talked.  But somehow you just didn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hurried barefoot to the dining room, and were shocked to see Sarah had arranged the table like some sort of fancy date, with candles, and nice tablecloth.  As you stood with your mouth agape, she was already seated and eagerly waiting for you to join her.  You wasted no time in sitting down across from her.  In the chair, you noticed your toes barely could touch the ground if you tipped them down like you were in heels.  You wiggled your butt comfortably into the seat and smiled at your wife who placed a juicy steak on your plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know you'd be coming home as Taeko, so I made us steaks how you like it.  But remember she doesn't quite have as big an appetite as you normally do?\"  Sarah teased, reminding you of your greatly reduced weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It smells great!  I.. I'll try to eat as much as I can, but no promises.\"  You said, patting your thin waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs dinner continued, you couldn't put your finger on it, but everything just seemed to be going so well.  Too well in fact, like your relationship was somehow closer than ever before, even when you had just gotten married several years ago.  Sarah seemed so open and understanding around you right now, as you talked about everything from work, and friends, to how you felt being Taeko.  Could it be that in this reality, forced gender equality was somehow... a good thing?  You never thought you'd think that, but having a partner who has experienced both sides of the gender fence seemed to bring Sarah and you closer than ever before.  The differences in men and women just seemed so trivial when put into perspective of having to change genders twice a day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner you found yourself cuddled into your wife's lap watching TV together.  As a 100 lb young woman, you were definitely the little spoon right now, but you could barely focus on TV as your wife kept fondling your breasts from behind.  The more you giggled, the harder she would fondle, and it turned into something of a game as you tried your best to hold in your girlish moaning.  In the end, you lost, and the moist sensation between your thighs explained why.</span></div></div>",

You calm down now you have got your bearings and because you feel so safe wrapped in Sarah's arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down and from your ample cleavage, now held by white baby doll lingerie, you confirm that you are still Taeko. You sigh gazing towards the window which is letting in red morning light that illuminates the bedroom and realise it wont't be long before you have to return to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly your eyes widen as you remember the events of last night and a warmth grows within you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter your makeout and fondle session on the couch with Sarah, she suggested that you both take things upstairs. Lost in lust you agreed and before you knew it, you were being carried bridal style up the stairs with ease by Sarah. You remember how vulnerable yet protected you felt with your tiny body suspended in her arms like that. She placed you down in the bedroom and requested you change into \"her favourite outfit\" which consisted of the baby doll you are wearing, a pair of sheer white stockings and a white g-string which didn't stay on long. Mad with passion you didn't object and quickly tore off your work clothes while Sarah excused herself to the bathroom. When dressed, Sarah emerged from the bathroom revealing her new appendage. A 9 inch strapon now hung menacingly between her legs and before you could even squeak an objection, she had thrown you to the bed, pinning your tiny body helplessly beneath hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember her soothing you before she started, running her hand through your hair and stroking your thighs and cheeks. Too timid to do anything, you just lay there, submitting to her fully as she took you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the night is merely a blur of passion, pleasure and moaning. Pictures of you being made love to in all different positions flash in your mind and in each of these flashes, you see Sarah looking at you in a way she never has before, with primal hunger, a desire she never had when you were a man. She seemed to love your passiveness and tossed you about like a doll and for your part, you loved it. What did this mean?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the present you mull over your options. You know that whatever you do, you have to go to work and work hard enough to be a man so you can access the website but you are not yet sure how and if you want to change things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah stirs slightly next to you reminding you of her arms around you. You have to go to work but do you want to slip away so you don't have to confront the events of last night and perhaps have your choice influenced by the lust you feel in this new body or wake your wife and lover and have breakfast together?</span></div></div>",

She mumbles something and her hold on you tightens as she grabs your rear end in her sleep.  You wanted to sit here in her arms forever, but you knew that you had to get up sooner or later.  So slowly you nuzzled your way down towards Sarah's bare breasts, and began teasing them with your tongue.  You weren't sure why you did it, it wasn't your first choice of things to do as a man, but as Taeko you just felt like waking her up in the gentlest, most pleasant way possible, and you enjoyed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah moaned and her eyes cracked open slightly, \"Hmm?  Ohh... Who... Oh Taeko!  You're fiesty this morning huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let you go and you smiled, looking up to give her a quick kiss on the lips before rolling out of the bed.  \"I had to get you to stop suffocating me somehow!\"  You said with a wink, and shuffled your way to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped dead in your tracks as you saw your reflection in the mirror.  The short Japanese girl wearing nothing but a white baby doll, and long black hair looked nothing short of breathtaking.  It was the first time you'd really got a long intimate look at your new form, and you suspected this body couldn't be older than nineteen years old.  The youthfulness made you feel alive again, and you couldn't help but smile.  As the girl in the mirror smiled back at you, you felt a sort of bond with her that you didn't expect to feel.  She was you, but not you at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taeko... why don't you come back to bed...  You're not going to work already are you?\"  Sarah mumbled from beneath the sheets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned back to her, your jet black hair swinging around you.  \"Not yet, I was going to make some breakfast and coffee.  Don't bother waking up, I'll bring it to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what...?  What's gotten into you?\"  She mumbled as she clung to a pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a thank you for making me feel so... comfortable this way!  Don't worry, just stay put!\"  You said excitedly as you bounced your way out of the room on your bare feet, not bothering to put any underwear on beneath your babydoll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat HAS gotten into you, you wondered?  You had never been such a romantic before, but lately you just really wanted to do anything to make your wife happy, and you were enjoying every minute of it.  You did your best trying to cook up Sarah's favorite omelette, and prepared a pitcher of coffee.  With your newly reduced height you found that you had to use a step stool to reach the top cabinet with the seasonings, but this only added to the joy of the challenge for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later you brought her breakfast in bed, and placed the coffee on the nightstand next to her.  You lay down in the bed next to her and set the tray of food on your lap.  She sipped from the coffee and smiled sleepily at you.  Without a word you stuck a fork full of omelette in her mouth, and took a bite for yourself as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the food was finally done, and Sarah was finally awake from the coffee, you noticed how she couldn't stop staring at you.  \"Do you have to go to work today... Tom?  I'm going to miss Taeko when you're back to your old self...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, and realized what she was asking.  It took you a moment, but it was what you were thinking all along.  \"I do have to go to work but... What if I told you I could stay this way, forever?  Would that make you happy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah blinked at you, \"Stay this way?  You mean you enjoy being a woman that much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and shrugged, \"Well, yes and no, I mean... It's not so much that I enjoy being a woman, I just want you to be happy.  But after spending all this time as Taeko, I'm not sure it would be such a bad life after all...  I feel happier than ever when I am like this...  I can't explain it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah furrowed her brow, and brought you into a loving embrace, \"If that's your choice then you know that would change nothing between us, I will still love you.  I don't know how you would do such a thing, because the transformations are never permanent.  But I guess hypothetically... if it ever were possible, then I would embrace the new you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spent the next few minutes crying into her arms, and letting out all your emotions.  You weren't sure if this transformation had messed with your brain or not, but you knew for sure that you felt happy right now, and that's all that mattered.  Today you resolved to set reality on a new course, and rekindle the flame of your marriage in a way that you never suspected would work...</span></div></div>",

Sarah kisses you on the forehead and says she will clean up her breakfast so you can get ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFree of her arms, you pad to the bathroom and strip out of your lingerie and shower. The warm water feels much better running over your new delicate body and its many curves than it did over your male one. You use all the femanine wash products for your body and hair figuring you can't get much more girly and then reluctantly step out of the shower to dry yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you step out of the bathroom back into the bedroom, you find Sarah missing but a set of clothes layed out on the bed. You can only assume that she has layed them out for you because of the small size of the clothes so you set about getting dressed. First come the panties and bra which you struggle with a little. Then a pair of sheer black pantyhose which you find yourself caressing when you have rolled them on, enjoying the silky smooth feeling on your legs. After you then button up a standard white blouse and shimmy into a tight black office skirt which you think is shorter than the one you wore yesterday. Finally you step into a pair of black stiletto pumps which while adding a good 5 inches to your height, you know you won't even make it up to Sarah's shoulder. You are about to grab your purse and leave when you feel called by the makeup products you see as you pass the vanity to the door. Compelled, you sit and expertly apply a subtle amount to your youthful face and when done marvel at your beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe this is me.\" You say to your reflection with a shy grin. Before becoming too enraptured by your own reflection, you drag yourself away and head downstairs finding Sarah lounging on the sofa in a t-shirt and sweatpants, her shift must not start till later. She turns on the sofa and when she sees you she beams at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look so cute today Taeko.\" She says rising from the sofa and walking towards you. You can only smile as she brings you into another close embrace. \"Whatever you decide, I will always love you\" she whispers lovingly into your ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, I just want things between us to be the best they can be\" you squeak, a bit squashed by Sarah's arms but none the less, you feel tears starting to well up again at the heartfelt nature of this time. Not wanting to ruin your makeup, you give Sarah a light peck on her neck (since you can't reach her mouth), and wiggle out of her arms. \"I gotta go but I love you\" you say as you pass through the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt work, you are relived to find that it is a light day so despite being ogled by most of the men in the building, you finish your work by 2pm and just at that moment you feel a tingle in your right forearm.

Even though you were having your doubts about returning to normal, there was one thing you definitely wanted to change.  Your blood pressure started to rise as the website seemed to take a very long time to connect and you weren't even sure it would work.  After fiddling with your network for 5 minutes, you tried again...  Finally!  The website appeared, and it was the same as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately you went to go type in a change: \"I can never be blocked access to RealityShift.net.\"  You pressed Enter, but nothing really noticeable happened... You followed it up with: \"All of the world's governments have outlawed forced gender changes, and it is now completely optional.  Those who choose to do it get incentives from their employer.  Also, further bonuses for being racially diverse in your choice.\" And you pressed Enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there was a flash.  You were still in the same place, but many of the people around you had changed.  Where there were previously many very attractive people in their opposite gender forms, there were now only a few, and they were of all races now, not just Japanese.  Of the people who were not their normal selves, you saw an African woman, a Hispanic man, an Indian woman, and that was just in your immediate line of sight.  It took you a second to realize you should probably look down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, as you expected, you were still very much female.  The website had somehow known your decision to stay female before you even convinced yourself.  But now that you had the choice, you chose to stay...  But the question is, were you still Taeko, or someone completely new?</span></div></div>",

You were a woman with impressive curves and a killer hourglass figure.  Your skin was tan, almost brown, but perfectly smooth and hairless everywhere.  The hair from your head was still black like Taeko's, but it was now much longer and thicker.  Your outfit was still office themed, with a tight skirt and heels, but it was slightly more sexualized than Taeko's outfit.  Your office heels were now more like platform pumps, which you were terrified to walk in.  Your skirt only came down to mid thigh, and your top showed a hint of midriff, and a lot of cleavage.  You were wearing a push-up bra underneath, but you surely didn't need it.  Your breasts were D cup at least, and the bra enhanced them even further.  Your hair cascaded over your chest in waves, and could have covered your nipples if you were naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incredible... I guess I opted for the racially diverse bonus, huh?\"  You said, noticing a slight lilting accent in your voice, which you couldn't pin down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging by your tan skin, and killer body, you realized there were lots of places this body could be from: Brazil, Argentina, Philipines, Thailand, India, who could tell.  You needed a mirror to get a better look at your face.  You decided to get up and head to the ladies room.  You were halfway there when you realized you were walking in your platform heels with no effort at all.  Your body was still fairly short, and the heels brought you up to approximately your old height, which was nice.  Finally you entered the bathroom, which had several women inside, of all sorts of ethnicities.  They looked a bit lost as well, and you realized they were all probably men who'd opted in to the optional gender change.

It's much different from Taeko that's for sure, especially height wise as you seem to be maybe two inches smaller than you where as a man in your heels but looking down you notice that you are wearing very high heels indeed, you estimate yourself to be around 5ft 2, still smaller than Sarah by 6 inches. The rest of you is very curvy and womanly and your large breasts add a heavy yet slightly comforting weight to your chest. Your face, while more confident and mischievous than Taeko's still carries elements of naivety and cuteness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall, you are very attractive indeed and in your new sexy uniform of tight skirt, blouse, sheer nylons and towering heels, you may just be one the most attractive girls in the office, if not the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you are about to pronounce yourself satisfied with the change, the ladies room door swings open revealing a tall blonde woman you instinctively know to be called Jessica.

She's got us all being questioned and she's even getting security to look at the CCTV tapes. It's crazy.\" She says this last part in a funny voice since she is puckered while putting on lipstick. Satisfied, she blows a kiss at the mirror and gives it a cheeky wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway enough about me.\" She turns to you. \"So how are things with you and Sarah?\" She asks coyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think things are going pretty well why?\" You respond politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you know why girl\" Jessica says giving you a wink now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" You ask genuinely confused. Maybe something in the change had innadvertantly affected things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's just that since you told me that you and Sarah were trying for a baby with that new direct female to female impregnator you would have some news. Or at least some stories to tell me.\" She gives you a sultry growl at this and your soft butt a playful pinch which causes you to squeal slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah isn't pregnant.\" You muster, your mind reeling with the news of how things are different in this reality. While you and Sarah had always talked about having a baby, that had been subdued by a sort of gap between you both, one that you really couldn't place. Perhaps in reality that gap has been bridged. You would have began drifting into thought about becoming a father... well, metaphorically now since you are a woman but your thoughts are interrupted by Jessica laughing out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, oh come on Maria, stop messing around. We both know Sarah isn't going to be pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are confused again for a moment. If Sarah wasn't the one going to be pregnant, that must mean...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica seems to finish this off for you. \"Your the one who's going to be the mother remember. It was the logical choice since Sarah earns more than you and well.\" Jessica pauses a second and puts on a sultry face. \"Is such a powerful and commanding lover as you have told me in the past.\" She says, again with a mock growl. \"Common stop playing Maria, your starting to worry me. \" Jessica says in a concerned voice after you fail to react to her teasing. \"You having a baby is all you've been talking about for the past month, has something changed? Are you getting cold feet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no nothing like that\" you say quickly. \"It's just I'm a little tired today that's all. It's nothing to worry about\" you place your on Jessica's arm reassuringly as you say this and put on a small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seems to work as Jessica goes back to her suggestive self. \"Oh I bet your tired honey.\" She turns around and heads to leave the toilet but stops just before she leaves the room. \"You know girl, if Sarah gets too much for you, all you need to is ask and I would be more than happy to share the burden with you. See ya Maria.\" At this she exits, leaving you on your own in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few minutes you just stare blankly at your reflection, gathering your thoughts. Sarah wants a baby and so do you apparently and you are to be the mother. The seemingly futuristic process that is enabling your impregnation doesn't really concern you right and you just chalk it up to another side change of the reality. All you can think of asking yourself is, do you want this? Do you really want this? The website has been right so far about things but can it really about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that you have spent enough time thinking things through in the little girls room, you splash a little bit off water on your face, paying careful attention not to effect your makeup and then mince back to your desk and try and get back to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the end of the day comes, you watch everyone else leave around you, gazing intently at an open tab on your computer displaying Reality Shift.net. With free access you could have changed things at anytime but you decided to leave things till you leave work. You are trying to figure out whether you should again go home to test out this new reality before immediately condemning it and changing it. Things proved to be amazingly good when you were Taeko and gave her a chance, perhaps things could be even better now or maybe worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Maria, see ya tomorrow.\" Jessica says as she passes your desk on her way out. \"Hope you have fun at home\" she adds with a cheeky wink before the elavator doors close on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis interaction finally jolts you to a descision, you are going to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You think it would be best to at least give this reality a try since you do have got power to use the website whenever you want now and also, it has been very good a coaxing out your secret desires and fantasies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlinging your purse over one shoulder, you head for the car park. Since you stayed back late making a decision, the building is pretty dead aside from an old cleaner who bids you cheery farewell as you click your way across the marble reception floor in your heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get in your car this time, you don't have to adjust the seat as you remember you don't change back at the end of the day and Maria is your permanent persona. Again you make the drive home still wearing your heels without any difficulty and you soon find yourself unlocking your front door and stepping into your hallway. You close the door behind you looking for Sarah. You know she is home as you saw her car in the driveway but there seems to be no sign of her now. You turn and hang your purse up on the rack and when you turn back around you instantly feel arms wrap around you and when your face turns too, you see Sarah face quickly approaching yours as your lips meet. Despite you knowing who it is, she did startle you so you squeal into her mouth as she kisses you briefly, before relaxing and closing your eyes. You allow her tongue access to your mouth and it easily subdues your own causing you to moan again but this time for a completely different reason. Eventually Sarah breaks of the kiss and you open your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your reckoning, Sarah looks almost exactly the same as she always did although the smart and professional slim fit pant suit she wears is new. Thanks to your heels however, you are almost at the same height as her, only slightly smaller which is far cry from where you were as Taeko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's my beautiful wife.\" Sarah says releasing you from her embrace. \"For a while there a thought you weren't coming home from work tonight and had forgotten what a special day it is for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rack your brain trying to remember what is so important about today. It doesn't take long for you to remember that it is your third wedding anniversary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy anniversary Sarah.\" You say in your South American accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww babe you did remember.\" She leans in and gives you a quick peck on the lips. \"And to celebrate, I got us reservations at that new restaurant that opened downtown so you don't have to cook for us tonight, no I want you to be relaxed and pampered so you can focus on baking.\" She gives you a wink and rubs your stomach softly as she says this. You catch her drift and realise that Jessica was right about you both trying for a baby. \"However I don't want to rush you, but I didn't know you would be back late so you will have to get a move on to get changed, the reservations are in an hour. Slightly startled by this small window to get ready, you immediatly head up stairs and receive s playful swat on your soft butt from Sarah on the way past which causes her to giggle. \"Oh and don't worry, I've laid you out something to wear so you don't have agonise over wondering what I think you would look best in\" she calls after you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen in your bedroom, you kick off your heels and then dive onto your bed to start undressing. You quickly shimmy out of your skirt and have just removed your blouse when Sarah enters the bedroom. \"Just need the toilet babe.\" She says casually walking over to the ensuit. Her eyes roam all over you half naked body, she stops in the doorway of the en-suit with her eyes fixed on your breasts smiling. You kneel up and face her. \"I can't get changed while your there, as thought you said we were in a rush\". You say playfully while pouting. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/b8/9b/3e/b89b3e39181a52491f8272befa29e2b0.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay okay. I'll stay in here till you're done.\" She says reluctantly and then enters the bathroom, closing the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied she isn't peeping, you strip out of your pantyhose and look at the clothes Sarah has left for you. It's a tight black dress, a pair of black stockings and a pair of black stilettos. You start by sliding the stockings up your smooth legs and then climb squirm into your dress which is very form fitting and shows a lot of leg. You finally step into your stilettos and then mince over to your vanity to fix up your makeup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen satisfied that you are ready, you sit back on the bed and cross your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can come in now.\" You call and almost immediately the door opens and Sarah bursts in. You can't help but smile at her in amusement at her eagerness. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/a5/7a/7e/a57a7e677eb815695bb7ef9204807e02.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736...</a><br>\r\n\"So, how do I look?\" You say stifling a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could tell you babe.\" Sarah starts. \"But if I explained what I fully thought, we would miss dinner.\" You smiles seduectivly at you and runs a hand across your stockinged leg. She then extends her hand to you and you allow yourself to be pulled from the bed and guided downstairs, where you pick up your purse and then escorted into the back seat of an awaiting taxi. Sarah climbs in after you and tells the driver where to go and within moments you are shooting through the night approaching the resturant to celebrate your anniversary.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her longer legs made it hard to keep up, but she was certainly not going to leave you behind.  Finally, the restaurant was in sight, and you found yourself stifling a giggle as you saw the name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>La Comida</i>?\"  You said this in a very fluent Spanish accent, \"This is the place everyone's raving about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah couldn't help but smile. \"What?  Is it not good enough for us?  Don't tell me you're suddenly picky about which Spanish food restaurant we go to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all, it's Mexican, not Spanish.  And second of all, the name literally just means FOOD.\"  You held onto your lovely wife for support as you laughed uncontrollably in front of the doors.  You noticed it was indeed a rather high-end place, and even had someone standing at the door greeting guests.  He was looking at the two of you rather funny now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know right? I thought it was funny! Just hurry up and let's get our seat so we can look at the menu ok?\"  Sarah rushed you inside and since you had reservations, quickly found your table for two waiting for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe host was well dressed in a tuxedo with Spanish flair, and he kindly saw the two of you ladies to your seats, pulling the chairs out for both of you.  For all he knew, you were just two close friends out for dinner, rather than a married couple.  So he didn't think to let one of you be the chivalrous partner for the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buenas noches, ladies.  Can I start anyone off with drinks?\"  The waiter asked once you were both situated in your seats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought briefly, until suddenly a memory flashed in your mind, and you began speaking without any further thought.  \"S\u00ed, se puede obtener los dos margaritas? Y un vaso de agua en el lado as\u00ed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter smiled, \"Por supuesto.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only then that you realized you'd ordered margaritas in fluent Spanish.  The waiter seemed to reply as though you were as fluent as a native speaker. Otherwise, he was excellent at pretending your Spanish was awful.  Before you were able to dwell on how strange it was blurting out words in a new language, Sarah interrupted your thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Maria</i>...  You are just showing off now aren't you?\"  Your wife said as she rolled her eyes at you.  \"Is this revenge for taking you to a Mexican restaurant?  You're going to start roleplaying to the waiter to seem as authentic as you can?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought maybe she was upset, and then another memory hit you.  She was teasing you... \"Well, first of all, I'm Venezuelan, not Mexican, so yes it is a little bit revenge.\"  You stuck your tongue out at her and squished your cleavage together by rolling your shoulders forward.  \"And second of all, no I'm not showing off, that honestly just slipped out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah paused for a second, then her eyes quickly darted back to your face.  She looked embarrassed being caught staring at your chest.  \"Really?  It's been awhile since that's happened.  I thought you had more control over it lately?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure what she was getting at this time, and your memories hadn't fully caught up yet.  \"Wait do you mean I lose control of my language sometimes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've already forgotten?  When you first got that body, I remember you really had to focus just to speak English to me.  I still can't believe it's been almost five years now...\"  Sarah began to muse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I thought this was our third anniversary?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is silly, I'm talking about...  Wow you really are out of it tonight huh?  It's been almost five years since you left your life as Tim behind and re-entered my life as Maria.\"  Sarah explained, this time staring deep into your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wow, if what she's saying is true... Then I've been Maria since before we were even married.  In this reality at least.  This must have happened back when we were only dating.  I wish I could control when these new memories came up.</i>  You thought to yourself, not realizing your thoughts were all in Spanish currently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tambien...  Ah... Yeah it's been quite a long time, you're right.  Since it's our anniversary, I kinda want to relive those days, from your perspective.  Of course I know what it was like from my perspective... why wouldn't I?  But I'm curious what it was like for you back when I became Maria.\"  You felt rather proud of yourself, fishing for information and disguising it as a way to bond with your wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the margaritas finally came, and the two of you quickly ordered your meals, and you urged Sarah to tell her story before she forgot.  With the alcohol beginning to flow, she seemed to jump into the story very easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you know, back then <i>Tim</i> and I were dating, and it was getting a little serious.\"  She started her story, referring to your male name in the third person, as though you'd left Tim behind long ago.  \"You were working as an IT tech back then, and I was helping pay the bills the best I could.  We were happy together but it was difficult.  It was nice having our own place together though, and I was sure you were going to pop the question on me any day, even though there would have been no way to afford a wedding.  Then one day you came home acting very nervous and suspicious, and I knew something was up.  I thought, maybe you were finally going to ask?  But no... you told me there had been this new medical breakthrough, and companies were starting to offer complete transformation packages as benefits.  They wanted to promote diversity and all that.  And you, well, <i>Tim</i>, told me he was considering taking them up on the offer...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was your motive for changing five years ago?</span></div></div>",

Looking back at it now, you can see there was very little logic behind this choice that was driven entirely by masculine pride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then the next day Tim comes home as a Middle Eastern woman called Sadia and also starting the great quest to find the correct body.

It wasn't till he came home as Taeko that I found myself able to be attracted to another woman and after that, there was no going back for me.\" A blissful expression appears on Sarah's face. \"I still remember the fist night we made love as women, it was so soft and gentle and you finally gave up control in bed.\" she hesitates again with the blissful look on her face. \"But though Taeko and I had a lot of fun, she just wasn't the one and it was only when you came home as Maria that I knew that this was meant to be. Even though you could barely speak a word of English I knew we were meant to be together. You were so cute in the first year, having to get me to translate for you and interpret. And then I proposed to you when I got promoted to an executive at my work and you became Mrs. Bennet.\" You gulp at this, realizing in this reality that you have taken Sarah's last name. \"I will always remember our wedding, the way you were so shy when you walked down the aisle in that dress and veil. Oh I'm so glad that you convinced me to save everything for our wedding night as Maria, it was worth wait.\" Her eyes glaze over for a moment in nostalgia. \"And now we are living our happily ever after and thanks to the new female to female inseminator, we have the chance to raise a family and grow old together. Its funny really, you took the change to provide for me but now I'm earning way more than you and now your female haha\" She laughs to herself softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she finished recounting your history, she props her head on her hands and stares at you intently. \" I love you so much Maria\" she says finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too.\" you reply, finding tears filling your eyes. Its at this point that your meals arrive but you don't pay much notice to them, still lost in each other's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A toast.\" Sarah says raising her glass. You mirror her. \"To you Maria, my perfect wife and soon to be the perfect mother. Happy anniversary.\" She moves her glass towards yours. You hesitate for a moment thinking through the content of the toast but meet Sarah's glass with yours.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets dig in\" Sarah says while placing her napkin on her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meal goes amazingly well. The food is excellent, the service is impeccable and you cannot have hoped for better conversation. You casually make fun of Sarah's poor pronunciation of Spanish words and even end up having to apologize to one of the waiters when Sarah accidentally calls his mother a goat when trying to order more drinks. Luckily the waiter takes it in his stride and laughs it off but you are rendered speechless with the giggles as Sarah tries to figure out what she did wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor desert, Sarah ordered a couple's shared sundae and this attracts quite a few looks form, the other dinner guests especially when you start feeding each other with the spoon. You and Sarah ignore them however, too busy enraptured by each other's company.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the bill comes, Sarah pays and leaves a very large tip which causes each and every staff member to come up to you both and bid your farewell personally as though you were family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you are both outside, Sarah links arms with you and leads you to the taxi rank nearby. You press as close to her as possible as you walk, enjoying her warmth and also the romantic light cast by the full moon which seems to bring the city to life. When you managed to flag down a taxi, Sarah holds the door open for you allowing you to enter before taking a seat herself and telling the driver where to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taxi ride goes astonishingly fast. Perhaps it is the excitement of having Sarah paw all over you and kissing your neck that made time fly or it could have possibly been the anticipation for what you are sure is going to come next. Regardless, you soon find yourself being carried over the threshold by Sarah and taken up to the bedroom room and being roughly deposited on the bed after you kick off your heels still in her arms. While not as Taeko, you find something especially arousing being carried by Sarah, as if totally vulnerable. You squeal happily as you land on the bed and turn to look at your wife erotically. She smiles at you with fiery lust in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So considering you didn't let me watch you dress, I think its fair you let me watch you undress\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess thats fair\" you say sultrily as you turn and kneel to face her. You try to put on a show for her as you lift up your dress. You tease her with every inch of flesh that you reveal and you are rewarded with gasps of arousal from Sarah. You linger for a moment when the dress is over your breasts <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/9c/1c/1d/9c1c1d99cbbafe770ffb935824085166.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/ori...</a> but you then rip it off completely showing off your hot body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah leans forward seductively as though to kiss you but just as your lips are about to meet, she pushes you on to your back. \"Stay there\" She growls seductively.<br>\r\nShe disappears into the en-suite to get ready. You lay there panting on the bed but suddenly get the urge to quickly fix your makeup so you look your best. You rise and run to your vanity and quickly touch up your blush and lipstick before you hear the bathroom door open behind you and feel a pair of strong arms wrap themselves around you and toss you to the bed. You giggle as you fall on your back and look back to view your would-be assailant. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://picsfab.com/download/image/94150/2048x1536_charlotte-springer-stockings-legs-brunette-girl.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://picsfab.com/download/image/94150/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah stands above you in wearing only her bra but it is not her amazing body that gets your attention, that achievement goes to the fleshy appendage standing at attention which is emerging from her pussy. If it weren't for the seems down the sides, you would have thought her new member real but in reality it is only a well made dildo which is anchored within Sarah, no doubt for her pleasure. What does strike you as odd however is the small hole on the tip of the dildo as though a liquid was to come from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you to there\" Sarah says in a commanding tone. You just lay there looking up at her in anticipation. \"I think tonight is the night babe. We're making a baby.\" With that, she leaps atop you, pinning your arms under hers so. She lays atop you, her face inches from yours, out of instinct, you wrap your stocking-ed legs around her body, inviting her in. Sarah leans in and kisses you more passionate than you have been kissed before. Your lacy panties are practically dripping with moisture now as your body screams to be taken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck me\" You whisper into Sarah's ear as huskily as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah smiles and slides off you panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tonight's foreplay was like nothing you'd ever experienced before.  The kissing and groping and fondling was all so much more sensual and intimate than when you were a man.  Two soft hairless bodies rubbing against each other, and your rather large breasts squishing against hers as she pinned you into the bed.  You felt the tip of her 'impregnator' occasionally brush against your inner thighs, and it only made you more excited.  Your panties were soaked, and just begging to be taken off, but Sarah continued to tease you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said fuck me, sweetie... please...\"  You moaned in her face a little louder this time, and you caught a glimpse of a smile from her.  She was loving keeping you in suspense, running her hands up and down your soft and curvy body, sending shivers up your spine with every movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah ah, that would only spoil my fun!\"  Your wife whispered before nibbling on your ear gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensations coursing through your body had become too much.  If you had still been Taeko, you might have submitted and let Sarah have her fun.  Taeko was a patient and careful lover, who wanted what was best for others.  But you weren't Taeko anymore, you were Maria Bennet.  You were now a firey Venezuelan woman who knew what she wanted, and knew how to play this game better than Taeko or Tim would have.  Before Sarah knew it, you grabbed her sides, and lifted her to the side, flipping her on her back, and rolled on top of her.  The tables were turned, and you were in control again.  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.erocurves.com/galleries/36223/9_big.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.erocurves.com/galleries/36223...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm... I was wondering how long it would take.\"  Sarah smirked at you as you hovered over her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned her pretty little head to the side, as you leaned in for a kiss, so you began biting her neck, as you now knew she loved.  You of course didn't sink your teeth into her, but you left several red marks behind as your bites grew lower, and began turning into licking around her collarbone.  Your wife squirmed all the while, but gave no effort to stop you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was enraptured by your kisses, you reached your hand down to her hips, and felt the panties with the built in 'strap-on' attached (strap-in?)  The 'impregnator' felt fake, but still fleshy and even warm to the touch.  But you knew there was still an obstacle in the way...  You finally sat up and gave Sarah a moment to recover from the foreplay.  You helped her sit up on the bed and unhooked her bra like an expert, tossing it aside.  Her glorious (but smaller than yours) breasts, dropped freely against her chest in a perfect white teardrop shape.  However, Sarah wasted no time in reaching around and unhooking your bra as well, letting your perfectly large natural tits bounce their way to freedom.  You noted the shape of them was just too perfect, like your body had been created in a lab or something.  Then you realized, it probably was to some degree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incredible...\"  You muttered to yourself, as you placed your hands on the soft mounds adorning your own body.  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.erocurves.com/galleries/36223/11_big.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.erocurves.com/galleries/36223...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour wife quickly took your bra and tossed it aside, as she leaned forwards to take your entire nipple in her mouth.  You were stood up on your knees at just the perfect height for her to begin suckling at your tit, while rubbing and kneading the other with her hands, like a soft ball of fresh dough.  You moaned loudly this time, as the new sensations began to send shocks through your very being.  Sure you'd had nipple play before, but it hadn't felt like this.  As Maria you felt every bump on Sarah's tongue as it slid across your erect nipple, and the suction from her lips brought every nerve ending to the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh madre...\"  You moaned, feeling your knees weaken and give way, as you fell backwards onto the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah climbed back on top of you with a mischevious grin this time.  She slowly reached her hands down and began sliding your panties down over your hips.  They were practically stuck to you, from how wet you'd gotten.  But finally they were free, and the breeze on your moist lips did not last long.  You felt Sarah's fingers caressing the folds, first one finger, then one on either side, then a third finger slipped inside.  Her finger effortlessly glided across your naturally lubed passageway, and she knew you were more than ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing you knew, the entire world was erupting in stars.  She thrust her hips at you, and you felt something enter your body, something that went deeper than you even thought possible.  When you finally recovered seconds later, you were shocked that it went even <i>deeper still</i>, and she kept thrusting until you felt her hit rock bottom, and the two of you simultaneously let out incredibly feminine moans as you were both penetrated down to the very core.  You hadn't even recovered completely as you suddenly heard a <i>click</i> and something in your body began vibrating.  Sarah must have felt it too, as her arms gave way and she collapsed on top of you, pressing boobs against boobs.  The impregnator had started vibrating once it reached both your cervixes, and the sensation brought the two of you to another level of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensations were so distracting, that you didn't even hear the sound of a liquid pumping through the device.  At first it had begun sucking fluids inside of it, and then, after Sarah began pumping her hips again, the device started releasing fluids inside of you, in quick bursts timed perfectly with intense vibrations.  The device seemed to have a mind of its own as it timed each of yours and Sarah's vibrations perfectly so you would both orgasm in unison.  Anyone listening from outside might have thought you two women were in severe pain and moaning for help, but to your ears it was like a harmonious choir of perfect female voices..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the choir was finished, several moments passed where neither you nor Sarah said or did anything.  In fact you were afraid to move, or maybe unable to, you weren't even sure anymore. You still felt this incredible device pressing deep inside of you, but there was something... 'squishier' about it this time.  As Sarah struggled, she finally pulled out of you, and rolled onto her back, relieving the pressure for you both.  As the head slid out, you saw that it was covered in a very sticky, almost semen-like fluid, which was now slightly dripping from between your legs as well.  You knew that this must mean it had worked.  By some miracle it gave two completely female lovers the ability to release seed inside of each other.  And at that moment you squished your legs together, locking in every last drop of it.  You knew this was what you wanted now.  Maybe it was Maria who wanted it, but that was who you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the aftermath, Sarah slipped the device off, and you noticed...</span></div></div>",

Clearly it was only you who was meant to get pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah places the impregator on the bedside table and falls back beside you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Maria, that was amazing\" she says between pants and flops her arms on your stomach and begins rubbing it. \"I just know it's worked baby,\" you enjoy her gentle caressing and also the warmth and fullness you feel inside you, knowing that it is Sarah's seed within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to face her and your lips are immediately met by hers and you both share a gentle and exhausted kiss. Sarah uses the last ounces of her strength to flip you on your side and place you into the little spoon position as she curls herself around you. As you are flipped, you ensure that you keep your legs together to keep in all of Sarah's sperm out of hope of increased chances and also because you just enjoy the feeling of it inside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both lay there, not speaking but sharing a bond and closeness that goes beyond words. The warmth of Sarah's breasts against you back is soothing and soon you feel her heart slow and her body limp as she falls asleep. You are only able to muster a small smile before your own eyes close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes flutter open and you take in your bedroom which is illuminated by the rays of the morning sun shining through the gaps in your curtains. You feel warm and content but you notice that there is no body pressed against your back or arms around you. Turning around confirms that Sarah is no longer in bed with you and you are alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay there for a while longer, basking in the afterglow. Eventually however, you rise, get of the bed and open the bedroom curtains, revealing the beautiful sunny day outside. You look and see people walking up and down the street but then duck down quickly with a gasp when you realise you are fully visible to them and are not wearing a bra. Thinking to play it safe, you wrap yourself in a silky bed robe and head for the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour reflection in the full length mirror shows you all the remaining evidence of the passion of pat night. Your wild and messy hair, the white crust around your nether regions and between your legs and also a radiant glow that you have never seen in yourself before. Before you disrobe and climb into the shower, you see a note on the sink and a long white rod next to it. Picking up the note, you see it is in Sarah's hand and read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to be the first to know babe, this instant and accurate pregnancy test will say if it has worked. I'll be in the kitchen getting breakfast ready. Love Sarah XXX\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put the note down and pick up the pregnancy test. You feel a rush of excitement in your loins so you dash over to the toilet, sit and follow the instructions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, you are waiting over the test with bated breathe. It says that two pink lines indicates pregnancy while one line means it didn't work. You gasp as you see the result. You're...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For a moment you wonder if you're starting to go crosseyed from the tears welling up.  Your vision is slightly blurry, and you quickly wipe the tears away to get a better look.  No, it wasn't an illusion, there really are two lines!  Your mind begins racing a mile a minute, thinking of all the things that this would mean, and wondering if it's true.  You've never heard of a pregnancy test that works after a single night, but in this reality, they have a device that created sperm out of your wife's fluids, so perhaps anything is possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's really real, though... it says two lines is pregnancy...  I mean, why would the packaging lie?\"  You muttered with your voice starting to break slightly as you were flooded with emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nearly dropped the test in the toilet in your sudden clumsiness, but caught it just in time, clutching it in a tight fist.  With a deep breath, you curled up on the toilet, putting your hands behind your head.  You sat there for maybe fifteen minutes, contemplating the reality of the situation, and realizing that this was your life now.  If you wanted to use the website to change reality again, you'd be denying the existence of a life that is now growing inside of you.  A child which, as Maria, you felt was the only thing in the world you wanted right now.  But you knew that wasn't always you.  Had you ever had the desire to give birth to a child when you were a man?  You couldn't even remember now... Your personality as Maria seemed to be all you could remember.  What had even been your opinion on children before this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when you realized your legs had fallen asleep, and the tingly feeling forced you to snap out of your spiral of self-doubt.  You set the test aside, and stood up from the toilet, feeling a bit jiggly-legged as the blood flow returned to them, and you nearly fell over.  When you finally felt normal again, you flushed the toilet and jumped into the shower.  You needed more time alone to think about this, and kept playing out the conversation you'd have with Sarah.  Your shower was basically on autopilot, as you were deep in thought and your Maria mind went through all of her usual shower routines.  You knew, of course, Sarah would be delighted that you were finally pregnant, since the two of you had been trying for a while now.  And you knew that once the initial shock wore off, you would surely be excited too.  You just wanted a good life for this child, and if you were going to stay as Maria forever, then you'd have to do everything you could to raise it correctly, as well as two mothers could raise a child.  You didn't know much about families with two mothers, or how effective they were at raising kids, but the thought worried you.  What if the lack of a father figure caused problems?  Would your child feel like they are being raised in a 'normal' environment, or will they be outcasts at school for having 'weird' parents?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce finally out of the shower, you wrapped yourself in towels and looked again at the preggo test on the counter.  It still showed two lines, you hadn't imagined it.  This was happening, unless you chickened out and changed reality again...  But what would be the fun and adventure in that?  That was when you realized you hadn't even touched the website ever since becoming Maria.  In fact, the idea of going back to it hadn't crossed your mind until now; you had been so enraptured by your experiences so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you were dry enough, you slipped into a comfortable skirt and tank top, and walked barefoot out into the kitchen.  Sarah was just finishing up making breakfast, and you snuck up to place your hands on her hips and give her a tender kiss on the back of her neck.  She jumped briefly, before shaking her butt side to side in your hands, realizing it was just you.  Since you were barefoot, you came to realize just how short you really were as Maria.  Your wife was easily 4 or 5 inches taller than you right now, but you were fine with that.  As she placed food on the plate, you rested your head on her shoulder, standing slightly on your toes.  You caught a glimpse of what she was making, and hummed softly in her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks delicious...\"  You whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the omelet?  It's just how you always like it sweetie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I meant you, hon.  The eggs look nice too, though.\"  You smirked, and went to take a seat at the table as she served the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you were finally digging into her delicious breakfast, Sarah stopped eating to ask, \"So... is there something you need to tell me?  You got my note right?\"</span></div></div>",

I know that it's supposed to be quick and accurate but maybe this morning was just a bit too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch a look of disappointment sweep across Sarah's face. \"Oh\" she says playing with her breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm sure that if I try it again later it will work.\" You say reassuringly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, your right\" she says perking up. \"I just hoped that I would find out before going to work but now I get the excitement all day.\" She grins at you. \"And if I get back and your not pregnant...\" her foot works its way between your thighs under the table and rubs against it. \"We get to keep trying\" she says in a sing song voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the rest of breakfast conversation is normal, Sarah lays out things she needs you to do at home since its your day off but your mind is not really on your housework. You feel guilty for lying to Sarah, especially since you getting pregnant means so much to her and also you yourself are still wrestling with the emotion of carrying life within you and again your thought falls on the prospect of having to raise a child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you are washing up after you have both finished, Sarah comes back downstairs from getting changed into her work uniform and gives you a quick kiss on the cheek before saying bye and leaving for work. When you are sure she is gone, you run upstairs and straight to your computer and boot up reality shift.net. Your housework can wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the website loads up, you are greeted by an unusual message you have never seen before, it reads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CONGRATULATIONS USER!!!!

For example, you cannot undo your pregnancy through the website or even transfer it. You can however decide upon the number of children you give birth to and also choose their genders.

In fact, children with two mothers are generally quite popular and successful in life.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when a flash of greed hit you,<b> \"No matter how many children Sarah and I have, we'll always be able to afford to raise them.  Sarah and I will both get promotions or better paying jobs, and I will get fully paid maternity leave when the time comes.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled, feeling happy with how this was turning out.  Your worries about supporting your children and having them grow up in a safe environment were quickly fading away.  Then you realized, you'd been thinking of 'children' plural, assuming already that you'd have more than one.  How many had you planned on having after this?  The website did tell you that you could change the number of children you're giving birth to.  But you assumed that once you increased the number in your belly, they wouldn't let you go back to just one because that would be harming an unborn life.  If the website wouldn't let you change reality, there were always abortions, but you had no interest in getting rid of this miracle of life anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"The child inside of me...\"</b> You began to type,<b> \"... is actually three triplets, who will all be born as healthy girls.  When it's all over, my body will quickly heal from all the stretching, maintaining my youthful looks.\"</b>  You smirked, liking the idea of that last part, even if it was a bit selfish.  If you were going to give birth to triplets, you didn't want three babies to destroy your body.  You wondered if the website would interpret triplets as being identical triplets or if they would all three have different looks.  You decided to let the website surprise you for once, giving you something to anticipate as time went on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that's everything for now...  Am I ready to finalize...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reviewed what you'd written and after a moment's hesitation pressed accept.  You weren't sure if there were going to be any immediate changes, but since you'd made some changes to society as a whole, you didn't know what to expect.</span></div></div>",

Accompanying the flash comes a heavy shaking and a gravely crunching which seems to be coming from all around you. Fearful, you grab the arms of the chair you have been sat on but find nothing there but emptiness. You thrash one of your arms around trying to find something to grab on to but there is nothing around you in the blinding and weightless vortex you find yourself in. Suddenly, just as quickly as it started, it stopped and you are flung backwards back into the chair causing you to fall off it. You yelp in pain as you fall but then suddenly your eyes widen as you take in your surroundings. You are no longer in your bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room you are on the floor of now is indeed a bedroom but a extremely lavish one that resembles something you would expect to find in a rich Southern Mediterranean villa. You gingerly get to your feet off the exquisitely tiled floor and then notice the chair you fell off. It is indeed an office chair, but an ornate wooden carved one that was to be matched with the oak table with a top of the rang computer resting upon it with the browser open on Reality Shift.net.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around the room once more then it hits you. This is your home now. This must be where you live in this reality. A picture on the wall of you and Sarah confirms it. Overwhelmed, you let out a shriek of delight. Your rich, just looking at this room tells you so. The luxury king sized bed, the beautiful Baroque paintings on the walls, the huge walk in wardrobe, the view.... THE VIEW!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dash to the rooms walk-on balcony and gaze outward onto the blue green ocean glistening in the sun and the beach not far down below that backs on to a sizeable garden with a large swimming pool hewn into the rocks. You breathe deeply the fresh sea air and grin stupidly. The rest of the house from what you can tell is massive and is very much like a Spanish millionaire's villa. Tears begin to pool in your eyes as the beauty of it all gets to you. After a long time staring out onto the ocean, you head back in your bedroom and decide that you would quite like to try out your new pool. Still in a joyful daze, you let shimmy out of your skirt, carelessly letting it fall and then remove your tank top, tossing it to the ornately tiled floor and walking stark naked into the walk in wardrobe. You gasp at how far back it goes and how much is in there. You think you give around 200 people a different outfit and still have some things left over. You squeal girlishly however when you see the shoe rack. Perhaps it's the body, but to you there is something unspeakablly beautiful about the legion of shoes arranged before you. Stilettos, pumps, wedges, ballet flats, sandals every type of lady's shoe concievable but you remind yourself that it not what you are after. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes a little searching but you soon find what you're looking for, a skimpy white, ruffled two piece bikini. You waste no time in covering your ample breast and then slide up the tiny panty. You have never worn anything this revealing as a woman and you like it. Your reflection poses and pouts as you look your self up and down. When done with your posing, you grab a pair of sandals from the rack and leave your room for the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour journey through your new house leaves you bewildered, the scale and the richness of it speaks volumes of what must lie in your bank account. You pass, several bedrooms, a bathroom with a jacuzzi and built into the floor a large dining room and to get to the garden, you pass through a traditional Mediterranean kitchen, filled tastefully with all modern appliances. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpen a screen window and step into the garden and stop for a moment as the midday sun warms hits you. If the ocean view hadn't given it away, the sun does, it is clear you are no where near your old home geographically. You continue on, discard your sandals and climb into the large swimming pool hewn into the rocks of the beach, a mere stone throw away from the blue surf itself. The water is lovely and warm, heated to perfection by the sun so you lazily swim about before turning on your back and staring up at the sky feeling the most content you have ever felt. You stay like this for around half an hour, enjoying the water around your body but you eventually tear yourself away and swim to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you are on your knees climbing out, you hear a voice call out to you from the beach in front of you. You look up through a gap in the rocks to see who is calling you. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://press24.mk/sites/default/files/styles/node_gallery_display/public/2013/12/18/charlotte-springer-topless-white-bikini-20-cr1387229068860-900x675.jpg?itok=Eluky6rj\" target=\"_blank\">http://press24.mk/sites/default/files/st...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Maria, how is our favourite neighbor this morning\" You follow the female voice and see a two women on the beach, in embrace looking at you in the rocks looking as happy as you feel. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://t4.ftcdn.net/jpg/00/23/27/57/500_F_23275758_yS39NdKud4MCmeCoZWIIHTk8OQfGaMGO.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://t4.ftcdn.net/jpg/00/23/27/57/500...</a> Both women are in bikinis and from the way they are holding each other, they are a couple. The one being held, is a young tanned, South American woman a little taller than you but less curvy and the one holding her is an older middle aged red head. A flash in your mind tells you that the South American woman is called Gabriela and the mature red head is called Helen. Helen seems to be the one addressing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm great, how are you two?\" You ask, climbing to your feet, feeling their eyes inadvertently fall on your breasts as you do so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're great thanks. We thought we would have a walk down the beach since it's such a nice day and the girls won't be back till later from school.\" Helen says, still holding the smiling Gabriela in her arms. You realise that they too must be parents, you didn't expect to find another couple like you and Sarah so quick even though you made sure that lesbian families were smiled upon. \"We were just about to go for a dip in the sea, want to join us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm, no thanks\" you reply. \"I'm just going to dry off now. Thanks anyway' maybe next time\" you add.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah alright, well we can still have fun can't we babe\" Helen says to the tanned beauty in her arms and then kisses her on the neck causing her to giggle. \"See you later Maria.\" Helen says guiding Gabriela into the sea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter watching them get in, you retire to a sun lounger overlooking the beach but hides you from being seen from the beach and let yourself dry in the sun. You close your eyes and smile, listening to the waves crash lazily, the sea birds call and the soft splashing and laughter being made by Gabriela and Helen. With all this therapeutic sound, it doesn't take long for you to fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes and are almost blinded by the dazzling Ray's of the sun and you smile. It wasn't a dream. You sit up and can tell from the position of the sun in the blue and cloudless sky, you have been asleep for perhaps an hour. You are now dry so you stand, then quickly sit back down as you burn your feet on the floor and then try again after putting your sandals on. You scan across the beach before heading inside and see two prone figures on the shore. You smile as you recognise them to be Helen and Gabriela curled up together on the sand. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://image.shutterstock.com/z/stock-photo-two-gay-girls-at-the-beach-enjoying-the-sun-54662095.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://image.shutterstock.com/z/stock-ph...</a> It seems their frolicking proved exhausting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing back into the villa, you look at the time in the kitchen. 4:34 Pm. If it's like the old reality anyway at all, Sarah will be back from in half an hour and you want to be there to greet her and give her the great news of your pregnancy after lying to her in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go back to the bedroom and strip out of your bikini and then go through the pain staking process of choosing what to wear. You settle on a lacy bra and and panty combo, a shiny metallic blouse and form fitting skirt and a pair of black sheer stockings and textured heels. You notice that all of your clothes are all designer label, even the stockings say from the box they cost $35. You then apply some makeup and tame your windswept hair before looking out the window and seeing a black, top of the range Mercedes pull up outside the front door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dash downstairs as fast as you can in your heels to make sure you are waiting for Sarah when she gets in. You hear keys scraping in the lock just as you practically dive onto a couch and curl your legs up in a sexy position. You quickly ensure your hair is in place and then the handle turns and in walks Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is wearing an expensive looking pantsuit with low heels and her hair down, she carries a leather briefcase in her right arm. You smile at her in a seductive manner from the couch. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/6b/29/70/6b2970f039250a40ceb47721ec24b736.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/ori...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey baby\" Sarah says closing the door and walking over to you. She seems a little down, most likely from the false inconclusive pregnancy test you told her about this morning. \"How was your day?\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it was lovely. I swam, sunbathed and talked with our neighbours.\" You say calmly, trying desperately not to shout \"I'm pregnant\" at the top of your voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah snorts at this. \"Some of us get all the luck. My day was rough, I got a new secretary today and he's useless. I know men aren't as bright as women but it just seems like every man younger than 25 is as dense as a brick, and they wonder why male unemployment is high.\" She shakes her head at this and you wonder if this make unemployment problem may have been caused by your changing reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I know the rest of your day will be unforgettable\" you say with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? And why is that?\" Sarah says unbuttoning one of her blouse buttons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep breathe and say it. \"Sarah.... I'm pregnant\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah drops her brief case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sarah is left stunned, and her jaw slowly drops open.  She struggles to find any words, as she begins fumbling to pick up her briefcase off the ground.  You smile as it seems she's lost all sense of grace and coordination at the news.  She drops the briefcase again before quickly setting it on the coffee table next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P...pregnant?!  Are you sure?  Sweetie, you said this morning that it didn't work... I...\"  Sarah's hands were shaking, and you could see her eyes were quickly welling up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got up off the couch, standing in your high heels to nearly match eye levels with hers.  You took both of her hands in your own and squeezed them tenderly.  \"I took the test again, and it worked!  This morning must have been too soon to tell, but it's definitely true now.  I'm 100% pregnant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour wife burst into tears and pulled you into the sweetest embrace you'd ever felt from her.  \"Oh god... this is incredible, you have no idea!  I never imagined such a thing would ever happen to me... I'm married to the most beautiful woman in the world, and she's going to give me the most beautiful child, I just know it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you returned the embrace, you felt your cheeks redden.  \"The whole world?  Come on...\"  You teased her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean it!  Oh, do you know what this means?  We have a lot of planning to do!  Have you thought of what her name is going to be yet?  I want you to have the first choice since you'll be the one carrying her.\"  Sarah suddenly grabbed you by the shoulders and her face was lit up with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her? How do you know I'm going to have a girl?\"  You wondered how she would be so certain.  You knew that you'd changed it to triplet girls with the reality shifter, but how could Sarah know that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour wife wiped her tears and sniffled a laugh, \"Because silly... we're both women?  It's simple genetics.  After you became Maria, neither of us has a Y chromosome to give.  Remember they changed your body on the genetic level?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was making sense to you. \"Right... so it's impossible to have a boy then.  No, I hadn't started thinking of names.  We should probably come up with a few options just in case, but there's plenty of time for that later!  These nine months are going to feel like a lifetime I'm sure...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to think of just what you'd signed up for and realized that pregnancy with triplets might not be the most comfortable experience in the world.  But it was too late to back out now.  The website wasn't going to let you change that.  You had to man up, or perhaps 'woman up' for the next nine months.  You were sure glad you'd made the change so your body would be able to handle it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah broke you out of your worries by surprising you with a deep kiss that lasted a good thirty seconds.  Then she pulled away and smiled into your eyes.  \"And I'm going to be there for you every day of those nine months.  I know I won't be the one with the belly, but I'm going to do everything in my power to make this easier for you!  My baby mamma is going to be so pampered, you just wait and see!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but smile back at her, \"I know, just look at this incredible house you've provided for me already!  Our kids are going to be so spoiled...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey don't sell yourself short!  You forget that you paid for your share of it too right?  I know you don't work full time anymore, ever since you hit it big.  We wouldn't be here without your incredible talent as a stock trader.  You're just lucky you get to work from the comfort of home and still make money!  Just don't spend it all on fashion ok?  I know you're retired from modeling, but we don't need two hundred more pairs of shoes in our closet.\"  Sarah sniffed your hair, \"And I can tell you were out swimming again today.\"  She sighs, \"Without me again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a good nose. It was only a quick dip, though.  I saw our two lady neighbors were out together today.  Hey.. you don't think they're trying for a baby too, are they?  It's crazy that we just happen to live next to another couple of married women.  What are the odds?\"  You mused for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah looked at you curiously for a moment, \"Well actually...\"</span></div></div>",

Are you all right Maria?\" she asks, concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise an eyebrow at this. Perhaps your changing the world to encourage lesbian couples may have gone a bit far, 65% is a lot of women. \"Ahh right I remember, just a little light headed from the big news\" You say, hoping to detract attention from you slip up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt works. \"Of course, what am I thinking?\" Sarah says \"It doesn't matter right now and I better get ready for more of your nonsense when the hormones kick in\" she pokes you playfully. \"And the cravings.\" she laughs to herself. \"And what are you going to do without being able to have a glass of white wine or a margarita for nine months? You'll never make it babe\" You both laugh as Sarah embraces you again. \"I can't believe I'm going to be a dad\" she whispers into your ear. \"And I just know you're going to be the best mom in the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe releases you and you both look each other in the eye smiling, knowing that both of your dreams are coming true. Sarah eventually breaks the tender moment. \"Well I would suggest us going out to celebrate but since we were out last night and I have to be up early tomorrow for a takeover meeting, how bout we just order pizza instead. Save you cooking eh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like that\" you reply smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great so one Hawaiian for you and a pepperoni for me\" She says pulling out her phone from her pocket and dialing the pizza the place. \"Could you lay the table babe while I order?\" Sarah asks while she is dialing. \"I want to wash up before dinner... oh hi, I would like to order to pizzas to go please...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile as you leave Sarah to the ordering and start laying the table in the smaller dinning room. As you place the plates and cutlery you keep stopping and staring through the window wall, watching the sea going up to the horizon and the evening sun giving the beach a lazy and relaxed feel. It occurs to you that you have no idea where you are since you changed reality. Obviously you are somewhere hot and on the coast but aside from that there is no clue. Florida maybe, perhaps even Hawaii. It matters little to you right now. As far as you are concerned its paradise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never get tired of that view.\" You jump from your trance and spin to see Sarah standing behind you holding two pizza boxes. You must have zoned out longer than you thought. That or the delivery service was excellent. She places one of the boxes in your spot and then sits with her own. You join her and open up the box to put a few slices on the plate. When you open it, your nose is assaulted by the most perfectly delicious pizza smell you have ever experienced. Immediately your mouth starts to water. You grab a slice of it and scarf it down almost without chewing at the same time rewarding your taste buds with the one of the greatest flavour journeys they have ever been on. Sarah smirks at you as she watches you wolf down another slice. \"Wow, I didn't know cravings started that fast\" You give her an embarrassed smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, this pizza is just so delicious\" you say between bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should hope so for what they're charging\" Sarah says taking a bite of her own. \"So I know you get the final choice to name our daughter but what do you think about the name Sof\u00eda?\" She watches you expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sof\u00eda?\" you repeat thinking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Sof\u00eda Bennet, sounds pretty good right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou agree that it does seem a pretty name but you remember that you will also need two more. \"I like it\" you pause for a moment, \"But maybe we should make a list first, I get a feeling we may need it.\" you say with a grin.</span></div></div>",

I can see great things in our future.\"  A portly middle-aged man said to your wife, shaking her hand and looking very excited about this deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were standing by her side, wearing an incredibly expensive dress, which was designed to show off your Latina curves.  But one curve, in particular, the baby bump pressing your belly outwards, was emphasized most of all.  You wanted everyone to know that you were expecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah smiled at the man but then turned to you, \"I'm sure there are great things in our future Mr. Montague, but the greatest thing in my future is right here.  I'd like you to meet my wife, Maria.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave a slight nod of the head out of politeness but made sure to look dignified and not make this man feel like he was superior to you.  You smiled brightly and held out your hand for him to shake.  He took it hesitantly and gave your body several glance-overs before releasing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, and pleased to meet you as well... Miss Bennet?\"  He then turned back towards Sarah, \"I was under the impression you were married to a man?\"  Charles asked her as though you weren't even in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA younger woman stood by Charles' side and looked disapproving at his attitude.  You assumed this was the man's wife.  Every wealthy businessman brought their trophy wives to these gala events, but she had an intelligent look about her.  Not just some airhead gold digger that was clinging to a rich man, but someone who aimed to make something of herself, without his help.  She looked into your eyes apologetically, as though regretting the way her husband was talking about you.  You found yourself sighing and with a quick smile to her, you already felt a bond formed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Sarah cleared her throat and looked at you.  \"Maria was a man once, many years ago, but she's going to be the mother of my children, and she's as much female as any woman in this room.  She is not only my wife, but my business partner, and wherever I go, she goes.  If that makes you uncomfortable, then I have a dozen other investors lined up and ready to jump in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharles looked to be speechless momentarily until his wife stepped in to save him.  \"Sorry my husband didn't introduce me, my name's Astrid, pleased to meet you both.  You're going to be a mother I see!  You look lovely, dear. You must be very far along?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I'm at 18 weeks currently,\" You said, with a glowing smile and patted your protruding belly.  \"But triplets grow three times as fast as one baby.  Makes me look farther along than I am.  Still, quite a ways to go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Triplets?!  My god, that's incredible!  And with that dress you look absolutely radiant, really shows off your lovely belly!\"  Astrid complimented you, earning herself a glare from her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharles remained silent through all the female bonding until he decided it had gone on far enough.  \"Yes, well, Miss and Miss Bennet, I... I hope we can continue to work together, I really believe we can do great things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief exchange of handshakes and a quick hug from Astrid, the couples parted ways, and you glanced back to your wife who looked pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Men like him are still holding on to the old guard way of the world.  He clearly doesn't like how so many women are becoming successful, but he hides it well most of the time.\"  Sarah took a sip of juice from the glass in her hand.  She'd sworn off alcohol during your pregnancy since it wouldn't be fair that you couldn't have any and she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed in response, \"Yeah... and he clearly isn't a fan of men taking the plunge into becoming women either.  Did you see the look on his face when he realized the pregnant lady used to be a man?  I can't blame him...  People like me are responsible for what'll eventually be the extinction of the male gender, at this rate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was truer than you would admit to Sarah.  It wasn't just people like you; it WAS you who was responsible.  Your change to reality had set this chain of events in motion.  With men able to become women capable of reproduction, and two women giving birth to only girls, men were in danger of disappearing entirely in the next few decades.  It had been 18 weeks since you changed reality, and in all your observations, you were growing concerned that this reality was simply not sustainable in the long run.  But your wife seemed to disagree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it sweetie, I support you, and so many others do as well!  I know it hurts when people like him spout their prejudices, but society is going to move past this, and our children will have the best mother they could ask for.  No one is going to think twice about girls with two mothers by the time they're old enough to realize what that means.\"  Sarah tried to comfort you, placing her hand around your waist, pulling you closer to her for a quick peck on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure her comforting words helped at all.  In the end, this was still undeniably your doing.  Even though you liked this reality with Sarah with every fiber of your being, the intellectual side of you still knew that messing with something on such a scale as this was not going to end well.  Perhaps you could still do something to fix this.</span></div></div>",

You try to ignore the news reports and documentaries that all warn of the gradual decline of males in society and instead busy yourself with wife duties, accompanying Sarah on her business meetings. You are surprised by the amount of men in ceo positions you meet on these trips considering the state of the world however all of them seem to share similar attitudes to Mr. Montague when you are introduced to them. As your pregnancy continues, by 29 weeks you have ballooned massively and find even walking, or waddling in your case, to be extremely tiring so you take a more supportive and secretarial role for Sarah when at work and with clients. You also start feeling the babies moving inside of you, kicking and such and this brings tears to your eyes every time this happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you are not working, you spend your time enjoying your beautiful beach front home and going to dinner with your neighbors. As it turns out Helen and Gabriela were trying for a baby around the same time as you and the once lithe and svelte, Latina Gabriela now sports a huge baby bulge reviling yours since she is only two weeks behind you. You all laugh and joke together but also discuss the future of your children and how nice it would be if all your girls could be friends growing up. Helen also reveals on one such night out that Gabriela will be leaving her job to be a full time, stay-at-home mom since they don't want their children raised by strangers or child careers. This had been a concern for you and Sarah as you both worked high flying jobs and even the one you worked at home would not give you enough time to look after three baby girls. One night a few days after your dinner with the neighbors, Sarah proposes that you consider doing the same as Gabriela and be a housewife, while she remains the breadwinner. You are taken aback by this as to had always assumed you would work something out or take turns as carers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe point she makes is that, while you are a successful business woman, she is even more so, earning more and having more contacts. She suggested you sign over your company to her so you could focus on caring for the kids. \"Think of it as a promotion\" she said. \"You get the joy of raising our girls, what better job can there be?\" You know that it is the most logical and practical choice to make but you can't help but feel as though it's step down and you're some how the lesser partner in the relationship since you will support while Sarah provides so you tell Sarah you will think about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, you go and visit Gabriela in her's and Helen's beautiful home just up the beach. Since she is going to be housewife and seemed content about it, you wanted her advice. Since Gabriela was now here near as smart or as successful having once been a waitress in a Brazilian hotel where she met Helen, she had never brought much money to the relationship so was happy to be provided for by Helen's career as a world class lawyer. You explained to her you problem that you were the equal partner and brought almost as much money as Sarah into the home and by giving that up you felt somehow weaker. Gabriela explains that that feeling is natural and something that you should learn to embrace as you know you have a wife who loves you enough to support and protect you. You still aren't convinced but you can't deny you know this is the best thing for your family so you thank Gabriela for the talk and head home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you trudge along the beach, you can't help but wonder if you hadn't been the financial success you are, maybe you wouldn't be feeling like this, maybe if you had only been a model and dancer, you would have less qualms about being provided for. You also remember that when you were a man, the main reason you became a woman was to get more money to support Sarah, so maybe of that past personality is rearing its head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get home after a long waddle down the beach, you sit at your computer and bring up reality shift.net. You are really considering changing things so you were never the financial success you were as then you could enjoy being a housewife like Gabriela. You know that you will end up in this position regardless as its best for all concerned and all other options you can think of would require hiring a caregiver which neither you or Sarah want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end you...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After thinking it over a long while, you just couldn't bring yourself to undo all of your past achievements.  You were aware that in truth you had never been responsible for any of these achievements since they were all part of your new rewritten history, but they felt as real to you as the babies in your belly right now.  You had strong memories of rising through the ranks of your company, only to go independent and partner up with your wife in your own business venture.  These memories were a part of you now, and giving them up would just be making yourself blissfully ignorant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn addition to those memories, you remembered as a hobby you'd dabbled in modeling as Maria.  You were never a famous supermodel, but it was something you enjoyed and helped pay the bills while you were still building your life up to where you are now.  Just the thought of it made you smile, and you realized that it had indeed become one of your passions in life.  But once you started becoming a successful businesswoman, you no longer had time for photo shoots and socializing with the entertainment nightlife.  But this could change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you caught a glimpse of your reflection in the computer screen, you were reminded of the changes you made to yourself the other day.  You were a woman in your 30's, but you looked barely a day over 19.  You'd gotten a bit vain and started tweaking your appearance out of curiosity, and nearly forgot about it until now.  You looked younger than you were when you first became Maria, by several years.  And you'd even gone ahead and given your bust a slight boost as well, and cleaned up some imperfections in your facial features.  With these renewed looks you could jump back into modeling after all, and still have time for raising the kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if I'm going to do this, I'm going to do it on my own terms.  It'll be interesting to do photoshoots with a belly this size, but there's always a need for maternity models!\"  You said to yourself, with a smirk in the reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day you let your wife know that you were retiring from work, like she suggested.  You agreed that you could no longer keep up with this work while you were carrying triplets, and it would only get worse when they were born.  She seemed glad to hear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was worried you'd try working yourself to death sweetie...  It's good to know you're going to dedicate your time to the kids.\"  Sarah told you with a quick kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not all though...\" You said, avoiding eye contact with her.  \"Sarah I want to get back into modeling.  When I have time, of course!  The kids come first for sure, but you know this is a passion of mine that I've avoided for so long!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't read her reaction, as she offered a mix of emotions.  You weren't sure if she would be angry or encouraging.  \"Maria... what?  You don't have enough time to work but you have time to model?  I thought you retired years ago anyways?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, it's only going to be when I have time!  And right now... well I have time while I wait for these kids to come out.  I have a unique opportunity to be a maternity model, and I want to take it!  I need to do <i>something</i> to pass the time while I'm out of work.  I can only tan out by the pool so much before I burn!\"  You point out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn't seem convinced and looks at you in concern.  \"Is this... is this about reliving the youth you never had?  I know you've been really taking care of your looks lately, and you look younger than ever, but is this really what you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah, I became Maria after my prime years already passed me by!  I never got to experience being a young woman, it's true.  People treat me different now that I look like I could be 19, and I have photography agencies lining up to give me offers!  It's not even about the money, or I would just stay with my current job.  This is about me expressing myself.\"  You attempted to explain to your wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she nodded and cracked a smile while placing her hand on your shoulder.  \"It's your body, my love, and I certainly can't complain that they've been able to make you look so youthful and somehow prettier than before.  I've been considered taking the youth treatment myself, or else people might think I'm robbing the cradle!  But I see this means a lot to you, and I really can't blame you for wanting to pursue your hobbies.  Just don't let this interfere with the children, ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!  The children are my whole life!  This is just something to pass the time with!\"  Then, with all your might, you embraced Sarah with a thankful kiss.  As your lips locked, your very round belly bumped against her, causing you both to burst into laughter.</span></div></div>",

The camera flashes slightly blinding you but you are used to it by now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay darling thats enough for today.\" comes the voice of Tracy the photographer. \"I've got all the shots I need and let me just say that you're the best model I've had the pleasure of working with. These pictures will be on the cover\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Tracy\" You say massaging your now heavily swollen stomach. \"I think this might be the last one for a while though. My due date is nearly here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to worry darling, there's no rush. Spend time with your family, relax get a puppy I don't care.\" she says with a grin as she packs up her camera. \"Whenever you're ready I'm ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for being so understanding Tracy.

While the magazine was intended for fashion purposes and the pictures you took in it were never nudes and always tasteful, it was no secret that teenage girls would use the pictures in them to please themselves sexually. Three days after the pictures of your first shoot were printed, you received a lot of love letters in the post and by email from girls between 14 and 22 all wanting you to be there wife or girlfriend. Most were innocent enough and were very flattering but as always with these things, some weirdos take it too far. It was on a Wednesday evening when you were taking out the garbage when you saw a figure in the bushes watching you. You immediately ran back inside and had Sarah check it out. Sarah returned dragging a girl from the local college by the collar who apparently had wanted to get pictures of you in the pool. Aside from a few more creepy letters, you haven't had any problems with fans. While at first unsure, Sarah loves the idea that she is married to a super model and has expressed her appreciation rather frequently in the bedroom. Overall it would seem that things are going well for you and with your due date now in less than a week, its a very exciting time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou park up on your drive and enter your house. Since it is now late evening, you find Sarah lounging on a couch in the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Maria. How was the shoot?\" she asks putting down her book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great Sar and I did what I promised. Now more modeling till after the girls are born and everything has settled down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stands and embraces you being careful of your stomach. \"Thank you it means a lot to me\" she says when she has released you. \"I want you to be relaxed on these last few days so I got time off work so we can spend it together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile knowing that the next few days would be spent being cuddled by Sarah by the pool. \"I can't wait\" you say smiling. Your smile turns to a frown as you feel liquid quickly running down your legs. \"Ugh, what the?\" you say looking down to see you are now standing in a pool of water. Sarah stops dead and an expression of shock and panic appears on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your water's broke\" she says almost in a whisper. \"YOUR WATER HAS BROKE!!\" she repeats at the top of her voice this time now hoping from one foot to the other like a maniac. Its at this you feel a great painful pressure down bellow. You grab onto Sarah's arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The babies are coming\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah composes herself and wastes no more time by leading you panting and groaning to the car. When she fastens you in she starts the engine and her car leaps down the drive and onto the road. \"Don't worry Maria. Just breathe.\" she says reassuringly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

You knew the doctors would take care of you, but you weren't thinking rationally anymore.  The pain and pressure around your abdomen was driving you mad.  You barely even remembered being placed on the gurney and wheeled into the maternity ward.  You waited in the hospital room with Sarah by your side, keeping you company, and clutching your hand the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe this is happening\u2026\"  You muttered, for what seemed like the hundredth time today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah just nodded, \"I know sweetie, I know.  It's hard to believe the time's finally here!  We finally get to see our lovely daughters!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I mean\u2026\" You shook your head weakly, \"All of this.  I know it's been months\u2026 well\u2026 years I guess.  I used to be male, once upon a time, isn't it funny to think back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour wife frowned slightly, looking very concerned, \"I know, but you aren't anymore\u2026  You're Maria and you're about to be a mother.  Are you having doubts all of a sudden?\"\"I don't know, not really.  I mean, yes I'm absolutely Maria, and I want to be a mother with all my soul\u2026  But part of me wonders if I would have wanted this before I changed.\"  You began to muse out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps, but you were a different person back then.  The male you from the past didn't have years of life experience living as a woman.  And even then, it's a little too late for regrets now honey.  This is all happening whether you want it or not!\"  She said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, I -\"  You stopped mid-sentence as a contraction hit you hard.  The rest of your sentence was just moaning and screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse quickly came in and administered a drug to you, which made your mind begin to haze.  The painful contractions became less bothersome, and your mind began to wander.  You saw memories of your life before reality changed, and they blurred together with this new reality where you had become Maria nearly 6 years ago.  You hadn't been transgendered, you never identified as a woman.  But the transformation changed all that.  Sarah was right in that you were a different person now.  You had your old memories, but your mind had been changed just as much as your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou came to accept that as Maria you had different wants and desires that your old male self never had.  He would have never wanted to bear children, he would probably have thought it was strange to even have such thoughts.  You weren't upset about it, because ultimately this reality was your own fault.  You created this reality, but you were enjoying your new life so much, that any regrets were quickly fading into obscurity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when the contractions hit you full blast and you realized you had been daydreaming under the effects of drugs for several hours.  The doctor was standing over you and it was finally happening.  The nurse's voice echoed in your mind, telling you to push, push, push.  The pressure built and built, and you screamed numbly as it reached unbearable levels.  As it peaked, you were given a brief moment of relief, when you heard your first daughter crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were crying yourself, as you caught a glimpse of the lovely tan little baby, being handled by the doctor.  You barely had time to touch her tiny little hand when the pressure hit you once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aghhh\u2026 right\u2026 there's still more\u2026\"  You mumbled through the screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse took your daughter safely away, as you began to push once more.  The pain was incredible, but somewhat less intense than before.  A short time later, your second daughter's cries filled the room, and you saw a slightly lighter tan skinned baby girl with an even louder cry than the first.  You couldn't make out any other details through your tears, but you could tell that she was healthy and safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after, you began pushing once again, desperate to be done with it.  The last baby was somehow stubborn and harder to get out than the first two.  She was oriented the wrong way and it took some time for the doctor to finally coax her safely out.  At last, the pressure began to subside, as your third daughter was brought into the world kicking and screaming.  You could tell she was much paler than the first two, and her hair might even be blonde like Sarah's.  It was hard to tell at this point, so you just laid back in relief, as your body began the recovery process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations Mrs. Bennet, three lovely, healthy girls.  The most impressive birth I've ever seen from a former male, absolutely stunning!\"  The lady doctor congratulated you, beaming with delight as your three babies were brought over to see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour wife held your first daughter in her arms, leaning over you to offer a better look.  You weakly placed your hand on the baby's forehead, and smiled at the warmth you could feel.  \"She's a real live beautiful baby, that's for sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sof\u00eda\u2026  we should call her Sof\u00eda.\"  Sarah said with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled in return, \"Yes, I agree, she looks like a Sof\u00eda.  Can I see the others?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two girls were held before you, and you reached out to caress each one's head.  The second daughter was slightly less tan than Sof\u00eda, but still reflected much of your body's South American heritage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2026  I always liked the name Alexandra\u2026 Alexa.\"  You said, giving your second daughter a loving kiss on the forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the odd ball of the bunch\u2026 the third baby was quite pale and wouldn't sit still, she was a feisty little one.  Even with her mother's touch, she wouldn't quit crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's quite loud, like your mother Eleanor.\"  You winked at Sarah, who simply held her mouth open in shock.  You continued, \"How about we call you Elena\u2026  Or Ellie for short.\"</span></div></div>",

All those late night nappy changes, and feedings, school, Christmases, birthdays, sleepovers, puberty\" she pauses and shudders a little. \"Dating\" she says coldly. \"Yeah we've got one wild ride ahead of us. But I know we can do it because you are going to be the best mommy on the planet.\" She takes your hand and kisses in gently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy\" you say. \"I can't wait to hear them say it.\" You stop for a moment as a thought comes to you. \"So what will they call you? Obviously I'm mommy but do you want to be too?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah looks thoughtful for a moment before replying. \"I guess we could do what most couples like us do now and call me daddy. Having two moms will be confusing when they call for one us so yeah, just call me daddy.\" She says grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Sarah talk for some time before you feel strong enough to move around. When you get out of bed you discover, much to the astonishment of the nurses and Sarah that your body has returned to that of a 19 year old woman, curvy with a flat stomach. Your breasts are still swollen however but your vagina shows no indication of having let three baby girls through. You try to act as surprised as them remembering your sneaky use of the website to prevent lasting damage to your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah leads you to ward where newborns are kept and shows you to your daughters' cots. You again begin gushing with joy as you feel the great love only a mother can have as you look down upon them. You find Sof\u00eda and Alexa sleeping peacefully while Ellie is wide awake and looking around with curiosity. Her eyes meet yours and you even though she is a day old, you can tell there is some understanding there. You pick her up and hold her little body in your arms and cradle her. \"You know who I am?\" You ask. \"I'm your mommy.\" Ellie looks up at you and reaches up at you with her little hand. You spend a few moments like this before you put her back and look over the other two who are still fast asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're beautiful\" you say finally. \"And they've all got your eyes\". It's true as each of your daughters, even Sof\u00eda and Alexa, despite reflecting more of their Latina heritage than their sister have piercing blue eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet they all grow to be stunners like you though.\" Sarah says patting you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet they do\" you agree, thinking again about the website and the new options you have to help you have to ensure your daughters have the best futures possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are kept in hospital for the next two days to ensure that both you and your girl's are healthy. You would have liked to have left sooner but Sarah wouldn't hear of it and made sure you got your rest. She rarely left your side and kept you company through the tedium of recuperation but you got to spend a lot of time with your daughters so that helped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn your last full day in hospital, when Sarah had gone for some lunch, a nurse who came into your room to check your results recognised you from the magazines you have moddeled for and told you that her 16 year old daughter was a huge fan, had her room covered in posters of you and most likely has a bit of crush on you. You were a little embarrassed by this admission but took in your stride and took a selfie with the nurse and wrote an autographed personal message to the daughter. After many thanks, the nurse left. You later told Sarah of what happened and she just laughed. \"You better not think about replacing me with a younger model\" she joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are now standing outside your home with Soph\u00eda in your right arm and Alexa in your left wearing a light summer dress and a pair of ballet flats that feels so much better than your hospital gown and slippers, waiting for Sarah to open the door. She struggles slightly as she is holding Ellie at the same time but she soon has it open and you both head in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So who's in what room?\" Sarah says retrieving her keys from Ellie's surprisingly strong grip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince you knew you were going to have triplets, you decorated three of your spare rooms that were next to each other and filled them with a crib, stuffed animals and other things expected in a child's room. You had painted them all different colours though. One pastely pink with hearts and stars dotting the walls, another green and the last one blue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I think Ellie here is boistress enough for the blue room\" Sarah says as she again removes the keys from the newborn's grasp. \"I'd say put Alexa in the green middle room since she has already proved herself a good buffer between Ellie and Soph\u00eda and the squabbling will only get worse as they get older.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know that this is the right choice and nod your agreement. In the hospital, Ellie, when left lying next to Soph\u00eda would keep poking and prodding her which would result in Soph\u00eda crying. You found that when you placed Alexa in between them when lying them down, Ellie would be calmer. Already their personalities were developing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Soph\u00eda gets the pink then.\" You say as you enter the Alexa's new room. You place her in her crib and kiss her forehead before carrying Soph\u00eda into the pink room and laying her down to. Head downstairs and fall heavily into a couch and sigh. Sarah comes down and sits next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And so it begins\" she says wrapping an arm around you. \"Enjoy this rest now because there most likely won't be time for it anytime soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, you hear crying from upstairs as all three triplets begin wailing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just to open your mouth didn't you.\" You say grinning as you both stand.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your new full-time job had just begun.  Being a mother to three newborns was not something you thought would be easy, but even with Sarah's help, the first few weeks were a struggle, to say the least.  You typically let them sleep in their separate rooms since you had the real estate to afford it, but that meant running around the house, checking on each girl individually all day long.  When they weren't sleeping, you made sure to keep them all together in the same room, and took turns cradling each of them in your arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the first week, you'd already run out of diapers and baby food.  You quickly learned to start breastfeeding as soon as possible and found that your breasts were more than capable of providing ample milk even for all three girls.  While they slept, you pumped extra milk into bottles, with extra left over by the end of the day.  By the end of the second week, you no longer had to buy baby food at all!  Sarah however, found it relaxing to come home at the end of the day and give you a break.  She'd begun lactating as well, and when she had time, would help out with her own milk.  The girls were mostly used to your milk, however, and seemed to prefer your attention over Sarah's.  The exception turned out to be Alexa, who grew to prefer Sarah's milk instead.  Neither of you could figure out why, but each girl had their own personality, and these things were bound to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiapers, on the other hand, were not something you could grow naturally.  You were going through them faster than you could buy, and you were tempted to start having them shipped in by the pallet load.  Sarah talked you out of it, however, saying there must be a way to do it in a cleaner way.  Bulk amounts of disposable diapers polluted landfills and were such a waste of resources.  She insisted there must be a way to reuse diapers, but most of the ones out there just didn't seem good enough.  Finally, you turned to your old friend, the realityshift.net website.  It was still running after all this time and was more than happy to shift reality once again.  A short while later, you'd made perfectly reusable diapers a real product that was easy sanitary, and fast to clean.  It made your life with the triplets so much easier, and you silently thanked Sarah for giving you the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a good thing they can't walk yet\u2026 or we'd really have our hands full trying to keep them from getting into things.\"  Sarah told you with an exhausted sigh.  \"I'm going to need to start spending more time at work soon, are you sure you're going to be ok with all three of them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I can manage\u2026 it's my job now, you know?  So many teen girls are going to be sad to learn that I have no more time for modeling.\"  You told your wife with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm serious!  This is going to be tough for you; it would be tough for any mom!  But we can definitely afford to hire help if you think you need it.  We've got a spare room, and someone could stay here to raise the kids with you.  It's not unheard of, plenty of moms get help like this if they can afford it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know, but\u2026 I don't know.  I am pretty confident that I'll be able to take care of things.  If it gets too much for me, then I'll reconsider.  But for now, just focus on work, and don't worry about me!  The company needs your guidance after all.  I really love taking care of the girls, so it's not like I'm being forced to be a mommy.\"  You reassured her with a kiss, which caused Ellie to start crying in your arms.  You and Sarah both laughed at the timing and went back to tending to their needs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore weeks went by, and soon the girls were four months old and beginning to make bubbly baby sounds that almost sounded like words.  You were still actively breastfeeding, which had bumped you up a few cup sizes from all the swelling.  You took this as a blessing but knew you couldn't keep doing it for many more months.  Alexa was even more picky, almost insisting on 'daddy's milk instead of yours, as though she could taste the difference.  Sofia and Ellie never wanted to feed at the same time, and would get fussy if they did.  They both got along well with Alexa but preferred your milk instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping up with all of their growing needs and diverging personalities was starting to take its toll.  If you hadn't altered reality to keep your body in youthful tip top shape, you'd certainly be putting on weight.  You had no time for swimming, or any other exercise, other than running around the house keeping track of babies.  What was worse, was you'd been studying baby development and knew that it was only a matter of time before they started crawling around, and even walking.  You would have to baby proof everything, and even then, there was no way your mommy-eyes could be in three directions at once, no matter how hard you tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was time to get help\u2026 Sarah was right.  You could hire a nanny or someone who could stay here with you and help to take care of them.  It would give you time to relax and do fun things outside the house again.  But you knew you didn't want to hire someone who would take your place as mommy.  You wanted to be there for these girls every minute of their development.  They were your pride and joy, and you weren't about to ship them off to be raised by someone else.  But still, you couldn't do this alone.  Maybe you could use the reality shift web site to make this job easier, and then you wouldn't have to hire someone?  You could make yourself a super mom, or even have yourself in two places at once so you could split your time easier.  Or perhaps Sarah was right, and all you need is a nice lady to help out.</span></div></div>",

You said you hated the idea of paying someone to raise our girls, even if you are around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know\" you say \"but if I don't get help soon I think it won't be long till we have an accident. I want to be the one to raise them but if that means putting the girls in danger I'll take all the help I can get.\" You sigh knowing that this isn't what either of you want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah sits there for moment, weighing things up. \"Well there is one option left before we can consider hiring someone.\" She says looking up you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" You ask, hopeful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well my mom, has recently retired and wants to spend more time with her granddaughters so we could invite her to stay in the guest room and help you with the kids.\" She pauses to let this sink in. \"I know you two don't always get on but it would be better to have family raising the girls rather than a stranger no matter how qualified they are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mull this over. She's right that you and Eleanor have never got along that well. Even when you were still a man she disliked you. You shudder thinking about all the time that you would have to spend with her if she does come and stay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah reads your expression. \"It will only be until we work something more permanent out. It's not like she's going to be staying with us forever. Besides, I heard Helen and Gabriella are doing the same. Gabriela's mom is coming from South America to look after their twins so maybe my mom and her can spend time together to give you a break from her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod at this. Gabriela had delivered her babies two weeks after the triplets were born and you were astounded when Helen announced they now had twin daughters, Amy and Beth. Both had their mother's Latina skin tone while oddly also had Helen's red hair. You hadn't seen mudh of them since the births for understandable reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you think?\" Sarah says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess it's the best option we've got right now.\" You say. \"How soon can she get hear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ran the idea past her and she says she can get hear in two days, you can manage that long right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I guess.\" You say and slump down on a chair next to Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pats your arm \"you okay babe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It just feels kinda like admiting defeat. Raising the girls was my job and I couldn't do it\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't talk like that, you've been the best mother ever. Think of all those times I've been late home and you've still managed to look after them without a break while also making me dinner. Think of all the nappies you changed when I was still struggling how to put them on. Your not a failure, your all I could have asked you to be.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile, tears welling at your wife's encouragement. She kisses you and you share a rare moment of intimacy since the girls came along. You savour every second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Sarah. I needed that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And think of it this way. We could ask my mom to take of the girls for a night every now and then and spend some more intimate time together.\" Sarah says sultrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like the way you think\" you say giving her a quick peck on the lips before standing up. As you move your chair out, crying starts from upstairs. You can tell from the wails that it is Sof\u00eda but it won't be long until her sisters are up and screaming too. \"It's your turn.\" You say to Sarah. \"I've got to make dinner.\" Sarah nods and heads up stairs leaving you with preparing the meal and a mind now at ease that your aren't hiring someone.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A week later, Sarah's mother Eleanor had agreed to move into the guest bedroom to help raise the girls.  She arrived in the morning before Sarah headed out to the office, carrying a couple suitcases of clothes and personal items.  It was clear she wasn't planning on moving in permanently, and she travelled light.  She was in her sixties, and her natural blonde hair had begun graying at the roots, except she periodically kept it dyed so no one could tell.  She typically dressed very plainly, in long skirts or pants, quite the opposite from your usual clothing style.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEleanor entered the house giving her daughter a loving embrace, and a kiss on the cheek.  \"Oh it's so good to see you honey, I can't wait to see my grandkids again!  Are they walking yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah smiled, \"No mom, not for another couple months.  That's when we'll really need your help especially.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEleanor scoffed and nodded, giving you a nasty glare.  \"You mean Maria can't keep up with three babies that can't even crawl yet?  You have all this money and when I was raising you and your brother I had nothing, just keep that in mind, Sarah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to defend yourself, arguing that triplets were different, but you held your tongue, not wanting to cause an argument with her.  She was here to help, after all, so it would be best if you got along with your mother in law.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, you said, \"I'm just glad you're kind enough to help out, thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEleanor gave you a condescending look through her bifocal glasses, and simply grunted, \"Mhm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah awkwardly stared at the two of you, before blurting out, \"Alright, good, everyone's friends then!  Now if you'll excuse me I am really needed in the office today.  Super super busy, I'll see you tonight honey!  Thank's again mom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour wife gave you a tender kiss on the lips and hugged her mom before rushing out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEleanor unpacked her things in the guest bedroom, and you poked your head inside to see how she was situating, \"Settling in alright, Eleanor?  Anything I can get you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat on the edge of the bed and stared at you, before simply shaking her head a moment later.  \"You don't have to be all friendly with me, I'm only here for my grandkid's sake, and because Sarah asked nicely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frowned, not liking where this was going... but you tried to maintain your cool.  \"Alright... I'll keep that in mind.  Again... thanks for the help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch of the time spent home with Eleanor went this way, as she didn't seem to have an ounce of respect for you.  However, when she was around the babies, she was a whole other person.  She was very attentive to them, changing their diapers, feeding them by the bottle, and even attempting to play with them.  She would make silly faces and noises, and the girls seemed to laugh and enjoy it.  Except Sof\u00eda, who would cry whenever your mother-in-law made a silly noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral days later, it was Eleanor's turn to feed the babies again, and you heard the screaming and wailing of your daughters from the other room.  You rushed in immediately to see what was going on, and Eleanor seemed to have her hands full.  Sof\u00eda and Ellie were both together on Eleanor's lap, as she tried to feed them both at the same time.  Neither girl was having it, flailing their little hands around and screaming their heads off.  Alexa was sat in her high chair watching her sisters freak out, and seemed to be giggling and enjoying the show.  Eleanor was practically pulling her hair out in frustration trying to get them to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eleanor, you know you can't feed Ellie and Sof\u00eda at the same time?  They really don't like it; that's just how they are.\"  You advised her while picking up Sof\u00eda into your arms.  She quickly calmed down when she felt her mommy's embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother-in-law glared at you, still clearly on edge from all the trouble she was having.  \"Oh, and you expect ME to take your advice on how to parent properly?  I raised your wife MY way, and she turned out perfect.  So don't tell me how to feed a baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally had it; she pushed too many of your buttons.  Your face turned red, so you quickly sat Sof\u00eda down in her crib before turning around and getting in Eleanor's face.  \"What the hell does THAT mean?!  You may be my wife's mother, but you did NOT carry these <i>triplets</i> for nine months.  I am their mother, and I know their personalities better than anyone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEleanor sneered, \"You can't fool me. You're still just a self-righteous know it all like a man.  That's all you are, how dare you call yourself the mother of my grandchildren.  A <i>man</i> can not be a mother, everyone knows that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?  DO I LOOK LIKE A MAN TO YOU?!  DO I?  NO.  I am a mother, and a woman, and your daughter's <i>wife</i>.  And don't you forget that.\"  You practically spat in her face, standing over her as she continued to sit on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat your daughter, Ellie, down, and stood up to face you.  She was taller than you since you were currently wearing flats, and you were forced to look up at her.  She saw what appeared physically to be a beautiful nineteen-year-old Venezuelan girl where you stood, but in her eyes, you were just a perverted man posing as a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you're right, you don't look like a man.  You look like a freak.\"  She snarled at you, before grabbing her purse and leaving the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew she was old-fashioned, and still wasn't used to a world where people could change their appearance for a price, but that was just cold.  She really cut you deep.  You picked up Ellie into your arms, and holding her was the only thing keeping you from breaking down into tears.</span></div></div>",

She immediately sits you down and asks you what happened. You tell her all about your fight with Eleanor earlier and about how she called you a freak. Sarah took you in her arms and comforted you but what she has to say was less than comforting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gotta realise Maria that my mom isn't used to all this and it's hard for her to come to terms with how her family is now. She's been against all this gender change stuff from the start and my brother doesn't help things when he visits her and puts ideas in her head.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's little brother Jake was a small time office worker and had been badly affected by all the changes going on in the world. He had lost his job as a floor manager to a young girl fresh out of collage and in an effort to keep his job, reluctantly agreed to become her secretary so he was especially bitter like a lot of men now. He lived close to Eleanor so visited regularly and placed the blame (rightly in your case) on people like you and Sarah for all his troubles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, you can't believe what you are hearing, Sarah is actually taking her mother's side in this and making you seem insensitive. \"She was just being nasty for the sake of nastiness.\" You protest. \"She tried to say I had no right raising my own daughters.\" You stare at Sarah in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know she may say things like that but she doesn't mean it. She's just venting\" Sarah says trying to take your hand but you withdraw it away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're joking aren't you?\" You exclaim. \"She called me a freak. A FREAK! That's a hell of a thing to not mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah sighs. \"If you want I'll talk to her when she gets back\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah, I want you to want to talk to her. Your my wife want you to take my side in this. I've been nothing but accommodating to her. I made her breakfast in bed for the first week for goodness sake but do I get any thanks? No, just snarls and grunts and complaints about how I've over or underdone the toast.\" You pant for breathe having practically shouted all that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah looks at you dumbstruck by your outburst. \"Well... Umm, you do sometimes overdo the toast babe\" she says with a small apologetic grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hit the roof. \"WHAT!\" You yell standing up. Sarah immediately realises her poor choice of words and ducks for cover as you fling an egg timer at her. \"Well if my cooking is so dreadful why don't you get mommy to do it for you, I'm sure she'd be happy to show how better she is at than the FREAK!\" You pick up a plastic jug and hurl that too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down Maria\" Sarah says poking her head up from under the table as though it were a trench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're on the couch tonight.\" You say stalking out of the kitchen and up the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pass your daughter's rooms and marvel that none of them have woken up with all the noise downstairs. You keep going, go in your room, close the door and then fling yourself on the bed and start sobbing into a pillow. You can't believe that after all you have been through Sarah would take her mom's side in all this. After all you have done for her. After about ten minutes of crying, you hear a knock on the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maria, I'm sorry.\" You hear Sarah say softly. \"I'll speak to my mom as soon as she gets back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't say anything and wait for her to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll leave you alone now\" she says and you hear her footsteps going away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stay curled up on the bed for some time. You hear the front door open as Eleanor returns at around 9:00 PM and you wonder what she could have been up to all day. You eventually get up and change into a babydoll nightie and climb into bed. You shiver a little, not having Sarah there to cuddle you but you know you made the right decision. Thankfully sleep comes and your mind rests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, your alarm goes off at its usual time of 6:30. Your the first up in the house each morning so you can make breakfast and give the babies their morning feed but you are surprised that you were not woken in the night at all by any of them crying. Perhaps you were so tired that you slept right through. The events of yesterday come floods back and you immediately feel guilty. It always happened, even if you were in the right or had the moral high ground when you had an argument with Sarah, you were the first to apologise and make things up. You hated fighting and you can't help feeling now that perhaps you were unreasonable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter showering, doing your hair and makeup and dressing in a summer dress you knew Sarah liked you in, you made your morning rounds and fed each of your daughters. Soph\u00eda was particularly quiet today as though she knew something had happened but the other two seemed happy as normal. You took all three of them down with you, but them in their high chairs and started on making a special apology breakfast for Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you had finished as well as laying the table for you and Eleanor to eat as well, you take Sarah's tray up to the guest room you figured she slept in and knock on the door. She opens it, clearly in the middle of getting dressed and looks at you wearily, perhaps expecting another salvo of kitchen utensils. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile at her sweetly before handing her the tray. \"I'm sorry about yesterday Sarah. I kinda blew a fuse, can you forgive me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah gratefully takes the tray and places it down inside the room. \"Of course babe.\" She says and draws you in for a quick kiss. \"Oh and I talked to my mom and she said she's willing to move on and forget yesterday if you apologise\" Sarah says this as if it is good news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" You say, trying to hold back the anger that had just resurfaced again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she felt really sorry about saying all those things but you did start it by shouting at her for feeding Ellie and Soph\u00eda at the same time and for rubbing in the fact you used to be a man. You know how she feels about that Maria\" she says in disappointed tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes buldge cartoonishly, is she really again laying the blame on you again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But but\" you stutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No buts Maria, I'll be down in minute and I expect to see you apologise to her before I leave for work.\" With that, Sarah closes the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly Eleanor had spun a tale implicating you as the bad guy but how could Sarah have believed it, was she that blind to her mothers spitefulness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head downstairs and find Eleanor sat at the breakfast table reading the morning paper. She smirks at you as you enter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I heard you through a right old tantrum last night.\" She says while tickling Alexas foot causing her to giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You lied to Sarah and blamed it all on me\" you say keeping your voice low.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it is all your fault Maria.\" She says plainly, turning the page of the newspaper. \"You're the problem not me. But don't worry I'm more than willing to let all slide when you apologise to me in front of Sarah.\" She chuckles at this softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clench your fist and are about to reply but Sarah enters the kitchen. \"Morning\" she says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning dear\" Eleanor says beaming at her daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah looks at you both. \"Are you both getting along?\" She asks cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are about to say that you most certainly aren't getting along but Eleanor beats you to if. \"Oh yes dear. In fact I had just said I was sorry for talking inappropriately to Maria yesterday. I shouldn't have let her wind me up like that.\" You glower at her. \"Oh and Maria was just telling me how bad she felt for starting it all and was about to apologise.\" She smiles at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Maria?\" Sarah says expectantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel totally helpless. If you apologise Eleanor wins and you are branded the bad guy so she will be more likely to believed in the future but if you don't and start another argument, you are still the bad guy, Eleanor will no doubt feign innocence and Sarah will fall out with you again since she seems to have already chosen her side.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You knew what Eleanor was up to, but there was no way you were going to let her disparage you in front of your wife that easily.  You felt a hot flash rising through your body, to your head, as your temper began to spark.  You noticed as Maria you were definitely quick to anger, a lot more than you used to be as a man, or even as other women before you settled on Maria.  As Taeko you had been more submissive and quiet.  And as Maria, you were extroverted and open with your emotion.  There was just something about being in a different body that seeped into your personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this time, you closed your eyes and took a deep breath, not wanting to let your fiery temper get the better of you.  You knew that you had to show that you were a reasonable and civil woman who would stand up for her children and her principles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll apologize.\"  You started.  You saw a smirk begin to form on Eleanor's face.  But then you added, \"I'll apologize if you agree to apologize as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEleanor took a breath to speak, but Sarah beat her to it, saying, \"Maria! You're just being immature now, this is childish!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou calmly responded, \"Sarah, I am your wife, and all I want is for this to be fair.  Don't you trust the word of your wife?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah folded her arms, feeling cornered between two people she trusted, \"Well... yeah.  But we all know how quickly your Latina temper gets the better of you.  I don't know why you can't just apologize.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because that is not the whole truth.  Eleanor misrepresented what happened.  Yes, it's true, my temper was quite high yesterday, and I apologize for escalating the argument.\"  You tried to remain as calm as possible so they couldn't use your temper against you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEleanor jumped in before you could continue, \"Yes, apology accepted, now we can-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>However.</i>\" You interrupted her, struggling to maintain your composure. \"If I recall, it all started when I was trying to give you <i>helpful</i> advice about how to feed the babies that I gave birth to.  Sarah told me that apparently I yelled at you for that, which is absolutely not true.  If you misinterpreted my advice as somehow condescending, then perhaps that's where our misunderstanding started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took every ounce of your being to contain yourself, since you really wanted to just pick up the nearest object and hurl it at your mother-in-law in her smug face.  Meanwhile Sarah looked back and forth between the two of you, apparently conflicted about who to believe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEleanor responded, \"Well, whoever instigated the argument is quite irrelevant.  In the end, I was not the one yelling in front of the babies.  I would never raise my voice around children so young.  Sarah knows that for a fact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah nodded, \"She's right.  Mom has always been quiet, and I think I've only heard her yell once in my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes but I...\"  You blurted out, but no words were coming to you.  She was right, you had yelled your brains out at her, right in front of all three girls.  Eleanor was always quiet, deviously so, even when she was irritated.  <i>Right, but she doesn't have to be loud to be a cruel old bag...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cleared your throat, feeling like this whole conversation was getting you nowhere.  You couldn't win with logic, but perhaps they could be swayed by emotion.  \"I... sincerely do apologize, to my daughters, for using harsh language around them...  I just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped midsentence, channeling all of your anger towards Eleanor into raw emotion.  You couldn't let yourself be angry, so the emotion had to come out somewhere...  You suddenly clasped your hand in front of your mouth and flopped down into the nearest chair.  Your hand was legitimately shaking as you burst into tears.  This was something you rarely ever did, even as a woman, so it quickly got Sarah's attention.  At first, you had planned on faking tears, but to your surprise, it was actually coming naturally.  Your mascara was starting to run, as you closed your eyes and began rocking back and forth in the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maria are you alright?  Sweetie...  You don't have to go into detail if you don't want...\"  Sarah sat next to you and cradled your head in her embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment Eleanor continued to stare smugly at you, but when she saw Sarah's worried reaction to your breakdown.  She looked annoyed that you were getting all the attention now.  To her, this was just a man trying to abuse feminine tactics to get what he wants.  She expected you to fake crying, but with your legitimate breakdown, it was beginning to look all too real.  She wanted to slam you for confessing to using harsh language around the kids, but knew that now it would make her sound like the villain for being insensitive.  Eleanor just kept her mouth shut for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wiped your face with a hand, smudging your makeup even further, which only made you more emotional.  \"I just want to be a good mother Sarah; that's all I want.  These girls are my whole universe!  They're more than just my life, because I gave that up already to make sure they could exist safely.  They're more than my world, because I gave that up as well.  They're my universe, Sarah.  There is nothing more important.\"  It wasn't a lie; with the changes to reality you had created a whole new world, and left the old one far behind, along with your male life.  The fact that this weighed so heavily on your conscience conveniently helped ensure your breakdown didn't look fake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah understood most of what you said through the emotional blubbering, and just continued holding you, rocking you back and forth almost like she was your mother, rocking her child.  She just kept repeating, \"I know, honey, I know.  And I'm grateful for everything you've given up, I truly am...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEleanor continued to stand there with her arms folded and scowling.  She watched as her daughter consoled a physically young latina woman that was her spouse.  For a split second, Eleanor may have seen the sobbing young woman for what she truly was: an actual woman.  In that moment she didn't see you as a perverted man wearing false skin, but simply as someone her daughter loved dearly.</span></div></div>",

The whole kitchen echoed with the wails of your family. Eleanor looked around at chaos and her expression of disgust changed to worry and then sympathy as her eyes fell on you once more still being cradled in Sarah's arms. Something in her changes at that moment and it allows her to see clearly what she has for the first time. A beautiful and successful daughter and a beautiful daughter in law who has just brought three of her grandchildren into the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maria.\" She starts with a sigh trying to speak over the screams of the babies. \"Maria can we put all of this behind us and bury the hatchet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widen as you hear this and you turn to face Eleanor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You clearly want the best for you family and I just didn't see it until now. I can honestly say that I love these girls with all my heart and so do you and that's enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl's crying starts to calm as they see you are now longer distraught. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mean that? Really?\" You say wiping away mascara tears from your cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do\" she says firmly. \"I think it's time to stop being silly and while I may not agree with things about you\" she pauses for a moment. \"We have to move past our differences for the girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't believe where all this is coming from. It seems a woman's tears really are a dangerous weapon. \"I'd like that\" you say with a sniffle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great\" she says with a small smile. \"So why don't we start things right. I'll tend to the girls and you go and fix up yourself. Your makeup has run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look to Sarah who still has her arms around you and smile. \"I think I will do that.\" You say and stand and head for the stairs. \"Thank you Eleanor\" you say before you leave the room and go upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen in your room, you go straight to the mirror to examine yourself. Your makeup is ruined making you look a complete state and the tears have run and landed on your dress staining it. You tut as you get to work, stripping out of the dress and heading for the bathroom to wash your face and reapply. When done with that, you throw on a black top and a grey miniskirt before leaving your room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore heading downstairs you stop and smile thinking on what Eleanor said about putting aside differences and working together. You notice Eleanor's room is open and see that her washing hamper is full and her bed isn't made so perhaps doing her personal chores will show your sincerity to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hum as you work, gathering clothes together and then rearranging the sheets on the bed. Just as you finish, still leaning on the bed, Eleanor walks in. You give her a small smile. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dncache-mauganscorp.netdna-ssl.com/thumbseg/1866/1866886-bigthumbnail.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://dncache-mauganscorp.netdna-ssl.c...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you Maria\" she says sounding a little surprised. \"You really don't need to trouble yourself,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine\" you say standing up and grabbing her washing hamper. \"We need to help each other out remember\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods. \"I appreciate it\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both stand there in an awkward silence for a few moments before you make the first move. \"Well I better get started with this\" you say and move towards the door. You breathe a sigh of relief when you are out of earshot half way down the stairs. It seems like Eleanor wasn't lying about wanting a truce. When you get to the kitchen, you see Sarah cuddling Alexa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks up when you come in. \"I'm really proud of you both\" she says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too\" you say loading the washing into the machine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squeal as you feel arms wrap around you from behind and pull you to your feet. You spin round and find yourself being held by Sarah who is looking at you lustfully. \"You know, my mom said she would watch the kids tonight so I was thinking that maybe we do some exploring. It's been a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that's a great idea\" you say wrapping your arms around her shoulders and stairing deeply into her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't wait\" Sarah says before kissing you tenderly and giving you butt a little pinch causing you to giggle. You disentangle she heads for the door. \"See you later\" she says seductivly before closing the door behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile to yourself thinking about how great you life has become again and all without the use of reality shift.net. You mentally congratulate yourself for solving a problem on your own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Eleanor comes into the kitchen. \"I've had a thought. You've been trying to get me to meet up with your neighbour Gabriela's mother so maybe, we go over and talk the girls to go see theirs?\" She looks at you awaiting your answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are bewildered at how far she has come in less than an hour. Sure that sounds great. Let's get them cleaned up and we can head over.</span></div></div>",

She didn't quarrel, or snipe or sneer but came across as a perfectly civil and polite woman and she got on well Gabriela's mother Camila. Gabriela was very glad to see you to and you spent the day just talking and playing with each others daughters in their garden. Naturally you two gossiped a little about how each other's sex life had been impacted by the coming of the kids. To your surprise how ever, thanks to Camila watching their twin girls in the evening somethings, this has allowed Gabriella and Helen much time to stay close. You both also talk about how you are both liking your new roles as stay at home moms and without a doubt, neither of you have any complaints. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen its finally time to go, you return home with Eleanor and feed the girls. All of them seem to be content and even Alexa is happy with your breast milk which is a rarity since she usually prefers Sarah's. When the girls are fed, Eleanor bundles them all up their buggy, grabs the day bag full of diapers and formula and other items deemed essential for traveling with babies and bids you farewell before taking the girls out for the night. You are a little sad at seeing them go and still a little wary with leaving them with Eleanor but you think of your time with Sarah and all reservations disappear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are now lay on your stomach on the couch in your living room, eagerly waiting the return of your wife who is due back now. You hear the car pull up into the drive and your heart starts to pound, you hear the key turn in the lock. You take a deep breathe and then the door opens revealing Sarah with a hungry look on her face. She doesn't see on the couch at first as she dashes right past towards the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Halt right there\" you shout in your most serious voice. Sarah instantly freezes and spins around. Her eyes widen as she sees you on the couch. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dncache-mauganscorp.netdna-ssl.com/thumbseg/1955/1955763-bigthumbnail.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://dncache-mauganscorp.netdna-ssl.c...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that it had been a while since you two had done the deed, you thought that mean you would spice it up with a little role play and so you dressed up as a slutty police officer, complete with handcuffs. Sarah says nothing as you stand from the couch and march over to her, swaying your hips heavily. A grin appears on her face as you approach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What seems to be the problem officer\" she says in mock confusion. You too smile seeing as she is playing along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There have been reports of a burglar around here and you match the description perfectly.\" You say halting in front of her. \"I'm going to take you in and oversee the interrogation.\" You grin wickedly, holding the cuffs out in front of you. You are really enjoying this as you aren't usually the one to take charge in sex and are generally passive to Sarah in bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm innocent officer, honest\" Sarah says, feigning shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll determine that in interrogation. Now hold out you hands so I can cuff you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah does as she is told and holds out her hands. You start to cuff her but suddenly, she grabs the cuffs from your hands and quickly seals you arms together in them. She is too fast for you to stop and you weren't even expecting resistance in the first place. \"What?\" You say genuinely confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah lets out a villainous cackle. \"Haha, you didn't think you could catch me that easily did you?\" She leers at you lustfully. \"They don't train them like they used to in the academy\" she continues. \"And now that you are at my mercy, I think I'll have a little fun with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realise that your time in charge has quickly passed and now you are the helpless police woman completely at the mercy of this ruthless criminal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please let me go\" you wail, playing your part. \"I was only following orders, I won't tell anyone I say you\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's too late for that\" Sarah growls. \"Now I want you to go upstairs slowly, no sudden moves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do as she says and walk timidly up the stairs, arms still bound and Sarah guides you into the bedroom. \"This will do nicely.\" She says and then suddenly tosses you onto the bed with enough force for you to lose one of your heels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please let me go\" you wail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut it\" Sarah snaps. \"Now, where do they keep the goodies?\" You watch as she rummages in a drawer you know contains all your toys and surprise suprise, she finds one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah ah. This looks interesting.\" You holds up a bulbous and bumpy feeldoe, where one side is long for penetration and the other short and nobly so as to be held firm in the penetrator's pussy while she thrusts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widen as you see it. \"What are you going to do with that\" you whimper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry, all will soon become clear.\" She says now advancing upon you.</span></div></div>",

Just you wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour wife quickly slid her pants off, revealing her light green bikini panties. She carefully moved the gusset of her underwear to the side just long enough to slide the feeldoe inside of herself. You heard a quiet moan escape her lips, but she quickly turned her attention back to you. With your hands still cuffed, she easily overpowers you by climbing onto the bed and pushing you roughly onto your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gonna think twice about trying to arrest me, lady! I bet you're scared now huh?\" Sarah said, trying to be tough as she knelt over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried your best to suppress a giggle at how silly this was, \"I'm... I'm not afraid of you! Just wait until my reinforcements get here, then you'll be crying your way to jail!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah ha! Oh, I won't be the one crying soon enough. There's no time for your friends to help you now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she grabbed you by the cuffed wrists and flipped you over so hard your remaining high heel was thrown off your feet, leaving you barefoot. Your face was thrust into a big fluffy pillow, knocking your police hat off as well, and causing your long hair to flutter all over. You felt your wife's hands running down your torso, frisking your 'uniform' for weapons, and feeling you up at the same time. She paid extra attention to your skin tight shorts which clearly weren't concealing anything. Her hands finally landed on your belt buckle, as your belt quickly slid away and she threw it aside. She pressed your face back into the pillow as you tried to look behind you, and pulled your butt up in the air by your hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing? I don't have anything interesting in my shorts.\" You said with a teasing wiggle of your butt towards her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said nothing and just unzipped your shorts, slowly pulling them down, caressing your thighs the whole way. With your butt exposed, she slapped one bare cheek with a nice <i>*whack*</i> sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! You'll pay for that!\" You said, barely able to stop yourself from laughing at this point, just trying to keep the character going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's too late for anyone to save you now, your crying is of no use!\" Sarah said while she pulled your panties down to your knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could respond, you felt cool fingers feeling around your moist vulva. It'd been so long since you and Sarah saw action that your body was more than ready. It was eagerly waiting for this. You waggled your posterior in her direction again, goading her to make a move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all you've got?! Please, I've been trained to take much more than that! I dare you to show me what you've got, you'll regret it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah obliged, \"If you insist, officer\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't have to wait long. Before you knew it, it was no longer her fingers feeling around, but the tip of a much girthier flesh-like object. Sarah's fake member was greeted by your natural juices as she slid herself up inside you. You let out a funny sounding groan. It'd been at least a year since she'd used this feeldoe on you, but it was just as good as you remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh\u2026 stop, you horrible woman, what are you doing?!\" You cried out in fake pain as she thrust inside of you. \"Ahhh, oh god\u2026 Please\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hesitated a moment, but continued to pleasure you with the toy. As you continued to stay in character and screamed in \"pain\", Sarah eventually stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright sweetie? I didn't mean to\u2026 Was it\u2026?\" Sarah suddenly broke character and leaned over to look into your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were panting heavily at this point, \"What\u2026? No\u2026 Gosh I was just trying to stay in character, it's wonderful\u2026 Don't worry about me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laughed and nearly pulled the feeldoe out of Sarah as you clenched your thighs. She yelped and quickly went back to continuing where she left off. She pushed your face back down into the pillow and continued giving it to you doggy style.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a small laugh, \"You're such a good actress I thought maybe I was actually hurting you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bull\u2026 Uh\u2026 Bullshit!\" You said, laughing in between her thrusts. \"I'm terrible and you know it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a terrible cop, that's all I know! Couldn't even cuff a criminal!\" Sarah teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes of playful banter and sex, you finally found yourself sprawled out on the bed, having possibly the best orgasm in months. Without the kids to worry about, you and Sarah were free to get all of the pent up tension out, and it felt amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay on the bed for a few minutes and then turned to your wife, \"You know, I <i>really</i> needed that, thank you\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah smiled and cuddled up close to you, \"Well I'm glad my love is happy, but what about me? Where are those reinforcements you promised?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reinforcements?\" You asked, still in a bit of a haze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, all those cops that would come and teach me a lesson! I don't see them!\" She giggled and kissed your forehead.</span></div></div>",

A maid has just broken her mistress's priceless family heirlooms, (Alexa's sippy cup) and now she is about to get punished. You ended up in the part of the maid and now you are about to receive your punishment. You are dressed in a skimpy maid dress, complete with white stockings and headdress while Sarah wore one of her casual outfits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You leave me no choice, that vase was priceless. Your fired.\" Sarah says with a sneer on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fall on your knees before her. \"Oh please mistress don't get rid of me, I have three daughters to take care of.\" At this you both can't help giggling slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegaining composure, Sarah continues. \"I'm sorry but you've got to go now. There is only one way that I may even possibly consider keeping you around and you wouldn't like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please please. I'll do anything\" you say theatrically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything huh?\" Sarah says thoughtfully \"Well if you want to keep your job you need to do everything I tell you from this moment and I mean everything, understand?\" you rise to your feet with a slight grin on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes mistress everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now lie on the bed.\" she says rubbing her hands together in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do as she says, taking care to make sure your panties and stocking tops aren't on show. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now stay still and don't move at all.\" Sarah says and then suddenly pounces on you. She straddles your waist and leers down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mistress! What are you doing?\" she exclaim as she starts to caress you up and down.

You eyes never separate, even with the especially hard thrusts which scramble your thoughts and curl you toes. She brings your legs up around her and hammers you until both of you are crying out like women in pain and then the orgasm hits. You cling tightly to each other as you both swirl around in a sea of pleasure before eventually reaching shore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah... that was... wow\" you muster, still huddled in her arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats mistress to you missy\" she says with a light laugh. \"But yes, I think I will keep you around a bit longer.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kiss her playfully at this and then drift off in her arms.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning, Eleanor shows up with the girls, and finds you and Sarah enjoying breakfast together. You'd woken up early and cooked your wife something fresh, and for the first time in a while, the two of you could just enjoy eachother's company again. Your mother in law saw the two of you smiling and walked in as Sarah stuck a forkful of egg in your mouth. She hadn't even knocked so her appearance nearly made you spit the food out as you chewed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see your little vacation from the kids went well?\" Eleanor said smugly, but pleased to see her daughter happy again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah laughed, \"It was much needed, thank you! Maria and I had a really great time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded with a mouthful of food, and Eleanor winced slightly at that statement. But she hid it with a smile, \"Say no more sweetie, I know. And before you ask, they're all doing fine! I set them in their cribs already, since they napped the whole drive over. They tired themselves out last night with all the crying and tantrums... It was obvious that they missed their mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Sarah both looked at each other, wondering who Eleanor meant by 'mother'. Sarah had definitely been taking on a fatherly role in parenthood, but Eleanor had never gone so far as to admit it. She had always imagined her daughter would be a mother, and not in a million years did it occur to her that a woman could be a father figure. You hoped she was finally coming around after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Eleanor didn't clarify, and just smiled at your confusion. She continued, \"I... assumed you would be more eager to see them?\" This time looking distinctly in your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallowed a bite of food and nodded, \"Of course! But maybe just... one more minute before we go back to being parents? I want to savor it... Not that I don't love the girls, but this is nice too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't need to savor it that much, because I'm sure this won't be the last time I watch over the kids. As fussy as they were, they are my grandkids, and I really don't mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter quickly finishing your breakfast, you and Sarah hurried into the kid's rooms where they were already mid-nap. Alexa woke when you entered the room, but instead of crying, just began muttering random sounds. You all looked at eachother as this was something new...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did she just...?\" Sarah asked, picking Sofia up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexa continued to babble, \"Babadaba...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEleanor said, \"Well she wasn't making sounds like that around me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went up to Alexa and brushed her face with your hand, \"What was that Alexa? Did you say mama?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wiggled her fingers out and reached towards you, grabbing your finger while giggling. \"Baba...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just baby talk, but it's a start. She's a bright girl to be making sounds like that so early.\" Your mother-in-law stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough you already had done plenty of research on what ages to expect what from your babies. Alexa seemed to be developing a month or two ahead of schedule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my girl... always full of surprises huh?\" You smiled, giving Alexa a playful tickle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you went to check on the other two girls as well. Sofia continued to sleep like a rock, but Ellie was already up and wailing about something. You took the pale baby in your arms and she slowly calmed down. You knew it was back to a life of taking care of these little ones, but you wouldn't trade it for the world.</span></div></div>",

While Eleanor can still be frosty towards you at times, her general attitude towards you has increased steadily which has made daily life much nicer for you and chaotic for your girls. Because of Eleanor's delight at taking the girls of your hands every now and then, you and Sarah have had great times bonding and growing closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust a week after she started her babbling, Alexa finally spoke her first word. Much to your disappointment and Eleanor's shock, it was \"dada\" when Sarah was putting her to bed one night. Clearly the girls had picked up on your referring to Sarah as the dad figure in the family. Sarah was elated however that she was the one to hear it and the subject of it. You received much comfort however when she quickly started calling you mama. Soon after, on the same day, Soph\u00eda and Ellie both said their first words, \"mama\". You wonder just how much of their affection towards an individual parent is based of their first word and reading all the baby books doesn't help much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings kicked up however when Alexa started trying to walk, weeks before the expected time. You and Eleanor took turns watching the kids while the other baby proofed everything at knee height. Your caution was worth it however as while Alexa was a careful walker, when Soph\u00eda and Ellie started, again not long after their sister, many bumps and falls followed. It was like they were aiming to walk into the things that would hurt them most. Table corners, door frames and chair legs, just to name a few seemed to be like magnets for Soph\u00eda's and Ellie's heads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls themselves really developed unique traits and mannerisms. Ellie always seemed to demand attention at all possible opportunities and would throw a tantrum were you not watching her when she was playing. She also seemed to make life as hard as possible for Soph\u00eda by taking her toys and once, you swear you saw her nudge Soph\u00eda over as she was trying to walk again. Soph\u00eda herself is nowhere near as boisterous or demanding as Ellie and seems to have a gentle and easy going nature unless directly provoked by Ellie. She seems to love your cuddles more than the other girls and sleeps the easiest out of them all. Alexa really is showing herself to be very clever. She seems to understand basic puzzles designed for infants much older. That said she can still throw almighty tantrums when she can't seem to understand something and always hates it when Ellie and Soph\u00eda start squabbling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, the girls are keeping you very busy, and with potty training fast approaching, things are going to get a lot more intense before things start to calm down again. Although you are looking forward to spending your first Christmas with the girls as a big family and you have even invited Sarah's brother to stay over the holiday on the condition that he is civil around you and the babies since he is much is very angry with the world at the moment since he lost his job and can't find a new one without making the change and becoming female.</span></div></div>",

Eleanor kept trying to convince you that you needed her help, but you insisted that you could handle it all. After slaving away all day at preparing a family meal, plus keeping an eye on the girls, you were nearly at your wit's end. Luckily you had Sarah around to help out, and she was doing a great job at keeping you level headed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah sighed, \"No I'm not sure it was a good idea, but Jake's my <i>brother</i>. He deserves to be included, and you can't exactly blame him for his life situation right now. The poor guy's still single, and it's getting harder and harder to find a job that'll hire men. Though you'd think it'd be pretty easy for him to find a girlfriend at this point... There's a lot more fish in the sea nowadays.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, the world's changed a lot in the past few years, and I can't blame him for that. But he's got a massive chip on his shoulder, and I just don't want him causing a scene around the girls' first Christmas!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just... make sure not to talk about anything that might set him off, alright? He knows all about what happened to you, whether he likes it or not is another story. So if he asks about your life, just... try to shift the conversation to the kids, alright?\" Sarah advised, placing a kiss on your cheek from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*ding dong* The doorbell rang, and you made sure to let Eleanor get it as you were still busy putting the finishing touches on dinner. You could hear she was happy to see her son, but you couldn't quite judge his attitude from the kitchen. After several minutes, Sarah finally poked her head in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake's here\u2026 you think you could stop for just a moment to say hi? He wants to meet his nieces too.\" She said, then left as quickly as she entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around your kitchen and saw that everything could be left alone for at least a few minutes. So you set the knife down and headed into the living room to greet your brother-in-law. It probably wouldn't have been the best idea to show up with a knife in your hand\u2026<br>\r\nJake was standing there talking to his sister, who was carrying Sofia in her arms at the moment. Sofia reached out towards Jake with her little hands, but he looked rather nervous around the baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She won't bite, Sofia's our most well behaved, I would say,\" Sarah reassured her brother with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Merry Christmas, Jake...\" You said, trying to sound cheerful and welcoming. But you were afraid your nervousness came through, and it didn't sound sincere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at you and saw a Latina woman with the body of a twenty-year-old (thanks to very expensive anti-aging technology), standing there in a festive apron over your designer quality red dress.  You stood there wearing high heels as always, and he still towered over you. Sarah was tall for a woman, but Jake was tall for a man. Additionally, you saw Jake dressed super casually in jeans and sneakers, and hoped you hadn't overdressed. It reminded you how not everyone in the world was as wealthy and well off as you and Sarah were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey\u2026\" He paused for a moment, as though thinking of a name, \"Maria\u2026 It's been quite a while hasn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou searched your memories, trying to remember the last time you saw him. Though it had been two years since you used that website to become Maria, in this reality you had been a woman for over seven years. You had memories from the past reality of seeing him several times over the years when you had been a man, but in this reality as Maria, you suspected those meetings never happened. Likely the last time you saw each other in this reality was at your wedding with Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, yeah quite a long time, like six years I think?\" You guessed. \"It's good to see you again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused again to look at his sister who was rocking Sofia back and forth in her arms. He shrugged, \"Yeah\u2026 A long time for sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah looked up at him with a stink eye and mumbled, \"Jake\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tossed his hands in the air, \"I\u2026it's good to see you too Maria,\" he said without even making eye contact with you.</span></div></div>",

It isn't long before you hear chatter and occasional laughter come from the living room and you smile as the festive mood hasn't died. When you poke your head back into the living room to call everyone through to dinner, you see Sarah sat on a sofa with Jake, with Soph\u00eda on her lap. Soph\u00eda is sitting very still, even for her and is watching Jake suspiciously. Eleanor is on a chair with Ellie and Alexa and seems very glad to have her son over for Christmas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinner is ready everyone.\" You say happily. \"Head through to the dinning room and I'll bring it all though\" you disappear back into the kitchen to sort the portions onto the plates and also attend to the Girls' dinners too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dinning room is extremely lavish with a large, old wooden table at the centre surrounded by matching chairs. It has a view of the beach which is now glowing red in the sunset and even has a mini chandelier. When you emerge with steaming plates and start laying them, Sarah, takes her seat at the head of the table and Eleanor sits too before putting the girls in their high chairs around the table. Jake however is still standing and surveying the room intensely. He looks over every nook not skipping any detail. You can tell he is awed by the richness of the room but by noticing his clenched fists and scowl, you can tell he is also angry about something. You look at him out of the corner of your eye as you take your seat next to Sarah, but to your great relief, he sighs heavily and then takes his seat at the table and thanks you for the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meal goes great for a time with you asking everyone whether or not the food is too hot or cold or salty. You are glad to hear that everyone is enjoying it and are particularly pleased with a compliment from Eleanor which you gratefully accept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven the girls enjoy their dinner, with Ellie enjoying it a little too much. She end up with it all over her forehead her look of satisfaction on her little face tells you that she is clearly pleased with the results. Everyone laughs at this and the atmosphere seems to be finally lightening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings take a turn for the worst however when Eleanor starts asking about how Jake is going on. You cast a worried glance at Sarah when Eleanor asks if Jake has found any work yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I haven't found any work yet.\" Jake grumbles. \"All the companies are paying peanuts unless I get a gender change. So much for equal pay and opportunities\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he is keeping his griping as civil as possible, you can tell in his eyes that there is much anger there. You are thankful that he is holding back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything falls apart when Eleanor tries to dig deeper. \"Dont worry dear, I'm sure you'll find something. Anyway, I've been dying to know, have you found yourself a nice young lady yet.\" She asks in the way all mothers do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething in Jake snaps at this. You see the vein in his temple raise and brace yourself for a the coming explosion but it doesn't come. Instead, Jake lays down his fork, wipes his mouth with his napkin and then starts. \"No mother, I have not found myself a nice young lady yet because there aren't any.\" He keeps his voice low but the coldness of it cuts straight through you. \"All the girls I have dated always end up coming to the same point when things get serious. Either they ask me when I am going to get a gender change or they ask me to leave work so I can stay home and clean their house and cook their meals while they pursue their career.. Women don't want men anymore, they want women. Well I for one ain't going to sell myself out just for an easy life like some\" he fixes his eyes upon you and you are frightened by the rage you see in them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah steps in now. \"Come on now Jake, you've had your say.\" She says soothingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis head swivels towards her now. \"Oh, I've had my say have I? I haven't even started. It's high privilege women like you sis who are causing all this. I read about your company's employment. 98% of all the jobs paying over $40,000 belong to women or changers and then you have the audacity to back politicians who silence what is left of the male voice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe has her there. When you acted as Sarah's secretary/personal assistant when you were pregnant, you were aware of her supporting some matriarchal leaning politicians and as for employment figures, the simple truth was that females and \"changers\" as Jake called them were just better employees and deserved their pay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite all of this, that familiar feeling of guilt returns as you once again remember that it was your meddling with reality shift .net that caused this division.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you should take your dinner in your room Jake.\" Sarah says rising to her feet and laying down her authority. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake just stands, grabs his plate and heads for the stairs. He turns to you finally before disappearing. \"Thanks for the food... Traitor.\" He spits and then he is gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence falls upon the table as Sarah takes her seat again and you all pick at your meals, noone seeming to be hungry anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silence is broken by a loud splat as Ellie launches what is left of her dinner at Soph\u00eda who takes it all fully in the face. Ellie giggles and babbles while Soph\u00eda begins to wail. Despite what has just been said, you all can't help but laugh at this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get her\" Eleanor says, rising from her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sarah and Eleanor take care of the girl's you tidy away meal, washing up the plates and storing the desert, a homemade cheesecake which you are quite proud of, away since you didn't get chance to start it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah comes in and kisses you on the cheek reassuringly. \"Im sorry about Jake. I'll ask him to leave as soon as we have opened the presents tomorrow. You were right, it was a mistake to invite him.\" She kisses you again trying to make it up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to do that. He may have made a scene but he didn't upset the girls. He kept his voice down and I'm sure he just needed to get it all out. Just look where we live Sarah. It's like a continuing reminder of what a failure he is. Plus he did have a point, things have changed and not all for the better.\" You say this last part glumly, fully aware of your part in his strife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know he's right Maria but now is not the time to be blaming me or insulting you but if you are sure, I'll give him another chance. Lets just hope he cools down up there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of Christmas Eve is pretty uneventful. You all watch a few holiday specials on television and then have an early night before the big day. You especially need one as you will need to be up very early to prepare the Christmas dinner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you climb into bed with Sarah a thought hits you. Maybe the socks and aftershave aren't the presents Jake needs from you this year. Maybe he needs something a little more, maybe something to help him to adapt to this new world or maybe change the world a little for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is only one way you know you can do this so you quickly climb out of bed, tell Sarah you will be right back and then pad over to the study to boot up the computer and bring up Reality Shift.net.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Merry Christmas from all here at Realityshift.net.

You smiled as you looked at your sleeping wife before you crept out of bed and into the shower. You dress in your Chistmas costume of a red Santa like dress, white stockings and red heels before doing up your makeup and hair and then going down stairs trying your hardest not to wake any of your girls up. You succeed and stop at the foot of the tree and smile again. There is quiet over the house that only ever seems to be enjoyed by the first up on Christmas morning. The presents glisten under the tree, waiting to be opened by your girls. You sigh and head to the kitchen and almost jump as you see someone already in there holding a knife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't scream but watch as the woman with the knife proceeds to use it to chop vegetables on the counter. She is just a little taller than you, with long blonde hair and pale skin. She is wearing a sexy Christmas costume too, her's being a reindeer from what you can tell from the antlers from the head band. <br>\r\nDeciding she is not a threat you call out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" You say<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman turns and you see the woman to be what looks to be a smaller, daintier more feminine version of Sarah. Her face lights up as she sees you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Merry Christmas Maria\" she says in a naturally sweet voice. \"Ready to start on the dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at her trying to figure out what has happened. \"Who... Are you?\" You say slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman giggles lightly. \"Oh did you have too much sherry last night? It's me Jessica...\" She pauses to let this sink in but you still stare blankly at her. \"Sarah's sister.\" She adds looking a little confused now herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Sarah doesn't have a.... Oh\" you stop yourself as you remember using the website to change Jake last night. This must be him now. That would explain why he looks so much like Sarah. Your brain catches up with this reality as you remember now that Jake finally gave in and got the change four months ago, now goes by Jessica and has been loving it. You feel like you two are quite close now as memories of you two meeting up regularly come swirling back. \"Sorry Jess, I still half asleep\" you say making up an excuse and clicking over to her in your heels. \"Yeah, let's get to work.\" You pick up a knife and start peeling potatos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both chat easily as you get dinner ready as though you have known each other a while. The memory of the angry Jake of the night before is quickly fading as all you see now is the happy petite blonde Jessica now stood before you. You are glad that your present has worked out and that all seems well. At 9, you hear movement on the stairs and the everyone else comes down stairs. Eleanor is carrying Ellie looking happier than you have seen her before while Sarah carries Soph\u00eda and Alexa down wearing a pair of jeans and a Christmas jumper Eleanor knitted. Eleanor puts Ellie in the girl's pen and then immediatly comes over to you and Jessica. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe comes over and gives Jessica a big hug. \"Happy birthday Jessica.\" She says happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at this as you would have expected Eleanor to be extremely bitter about losing her only son if you were anything to go by but no. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy birthday mom\" Jessica responds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey break their hug and to your shock, Eleanor turns to you. \"And merry Christmas to my favourite daughter in law\" your brain has trouble registering this but you hug Eleanor back none the less. Perhaps her son changing was enough to convince her that changing is a good way to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe not your favourite for too long.\" A voice comes from over Eleanor's shoulder and you see a tall woman with long black hair and sharp beautiful features standing in the living room next to Sarah. <br>\r\nYour mind quickly comes up with a name for her. Ella she is Jessica's girlfriend, the one who originally encouraged to make the change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Merry Christmas baby\" Jessica squeals, running up to Ella. Ella picks her up as she arrives and kisses Jessica heavily before setting her down on her feet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Merry Christmas Jess.\" She says with a grin. \"Dinner smells delicious, you and Maria have done a great job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\" Jessica says with a playful curtsy and returns to the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all exchange festive greetings before getting down to opening presents around the tree. You gather the girls round, ensuring Ellie is not near Soph\u00eda and with Sarah videoing it all, you begging opening the parcels under the tree.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With all of the excitement of gifts being opened, you quickly forgot about Jessica's transformation and began to accept her as your new sister-in-law.  Firstly, your daughters all got to open presents of their own, though of course, they needed a little help.  Once shown how to open presents, Ellie learned fast and eagerly tore into the wrapping paper. You kneeled down and opened the box for her, revealing a cute little yellow toddler sized dress that you knew she would soon grow into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what's this? It's a dress, for you sweetie! How did Santa know your color?\" You explained to Ellie, beaming at how happy she seemed as she looked it over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexa opened hers shortly after, finding a red dress in hers.  Finally, Sofia opened her gift, which was a purple dress in the same style as her two sisters.  However just as you thought the girls were happy with their gifts, Ellie waddled over and grabbed the purple dress out of Sofia's hand, causing her to fall backwards onto her butt. Sofia began to bawl, swinging her arms around in Ellie's direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ellie Bennet! That gift was for Sof\u00eda! Give it back now!\" You immediately switched on your stern motherly voice and even slipped into your old latina accent for a moment, which you had tried so hard to hide all these years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ellie refused to give back the dress, Sarah crouched down and gently tried to take it from her. This only made Ellie cry as well, but finally, she dropped the dress and it was returned to its rightful recipient.  The whole time Alexa just sat on the floor holding her red dress and staring at Sof\u00eda and Ellie in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Merry Christmas girls!\" Sarah said, exasperated and trying to clean up the mess of wrapping paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile everyone waited for the remaining gifts to be handed out, you noticed Jess and Ella sitting together like a lovely couple, with Ella even holding Jess's hand and muttering something to her.  You had a feeling you knew just what they were talking about after seeing how adorable your daughters were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral gift exchanges later, and it looked like all of the gifts under the tree were gone. But Jessica hadn't received anything from her lovely girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... is that it?\" You asked, taking a better look under the tree and making double sure you hadn't missed anything. When you looked over to Ella you saw her stand up from the couch and reach deep into her purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry I think there's one more...\" Ella said softly as she knelt down on one knee and pulled a small box out of her purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone gasped, and you even covered your mouth with one hand out of surprise. However, when you looked over to Sarah, she didn't seem all that genuinely surprised. She just had a silly grin on her face as she watched her little sister break down in tears. It was obvious what was happening, but seeing Jess like this suddenly made you remember Jake. It was hard to picture Jake as this petite blonde woman, and acting so emotional at being proposed to. But clearly, as Jessica, her personality was quite different. <i>Makes sense, my personality changed quite a bit when I became Maria, even different from when I was Taeko...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god!\" Jessica screamed from behind her hands as the box opened, revealing a sparkling ring with a giant rock on the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you were hit with a flash of memory about Ella. You recalled her being from a middle-class family, with a decent paying job as a saleswoman. There was no way she could have afforded a ring that nice, but the way Sarah was grinning was a bit telling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was no way you would ruin the moment by saying anything like that.  You just watched as Jessica screamed out \"Yes!\" and leapt into Ella's arms, nearly causing her to drop the ring.  Luckily Jess was petite enough to be carried, and Ella seemed like a rather strong woman, so she briefly carried Jess back over to the couch and laid her down for a long kiss in front of the whole family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother-in-law was cheering them on, and you joined in, while keeping an eye on your daughters so they didn't crawl away into trouble.  \"Congratulations, it's about time, you two!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a long time kissing and cuddling on the couch, Jess finally drags herself away from Ella, albeit very reluctantly to help you with the rest of the dinner. You congratulate her and smile as she keeps holding out her hand so she can admire the sizeable diamond ring on her finger. She chatters endlessly about how this is so romantic and the best Christmas present she could ever have hoped for. You feel gladness deep down that your reality shift really did seem to work out for the better, even if there is little left of the original Jake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes you a little longer than planned to cook Christmas dinner, what with Jess being in a lovey daze but it gets done and you both call people in for the food and place their portions in front of them. Sarah gives a quick toast to the couple and then you all dig in. Everything seems to be out of a dream. Everyone is laughing and joking and just generally enjoying each other's company. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen dinner is over and you and Jess are washing up while the others are watching TV in the living room, you click on the kitchen tv to help pass the time with some background noise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou seem to catch the tail end of a documentary regarding changers. Jess requests that you change it to something less boring but you are somehow compelled to keep it on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the documentary, you learn that the 97% of male to female changers in relationships now, identify as the more femme partner and adopt that role very easily. 95% percent of them take their partners last name in marriage, 91% of them are the ones who bear the children in female-female relationships, and 86% become full time homemakers and stay at home moms. Scientists are still debating why changers exhibit such hyper feminine traits and behaviour while ordinary woman seem to becoming more assertive in all areas of life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are stunned by the conclusions of the programme as this was not the state of the world the day before the change. Perhaps your change to Jake inadvertently messed with the minds of all men making them more naturally submissive and then even more so when they make the gender change. You shake your head trying to rid yourself of these thoughts. \"Everything is great now. The change is for the best.\" You think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the rest of Christmas Day progresses, Eleanor becomes more and more tipsy from eggnog to the point where she is giggling uncontrollably in her arm chair. Everyone finds this funny since you all have had too much booze as well but Sarah finally takes her to bed when she walks into the kitchen wall when going to get a refill. She bids everyone one a cheery goodnight before being led to her bedroom by Sarah. The girls are all napping quietly in their pen. Ellie was the last to fall asleep, keeping her eyes constantly upon Soph\u00eda's purple dress until she couldn't keep them open any longer. You look over at Ella and Jess. Ella is sat on the adjacent couch with Jess sat on her lap. Jess looks back and smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to thank you for having us over\" she says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's now problem, your family, both of you\" you nod to Ella who grins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your such a good friend Maria, so that's why I can't think of anyone better to be my maid of honour at our wedding.\" She says beaming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are taken aback by the suddenness of all this and the booze makes you all emotional and flustered too. \"What me.... I'd love to\" you say gushing and tears welling up. You stand and wobble on your heels slightly. Jess stands too and you both hug very tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" You say when you move apart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was an easy choice, plus who else can I trust to organise my hen night?\" She laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widen, you had foot ten about all the ins and outs of the bridal party, it wasn't all going to be dress fittings and flower arranging, you had a serious job ahead of you. You settle back in your chair and try to wrack your addled mind for ideas but come up with none.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we'll turn in now.\" Ella says standing, picking Jess up as she did so causing her to shriek happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night.\" You say with a smile. \"I won't be far behind, I've just got to put the girls to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both bid you a goodnight before Ella carries Jess up the stars with her giggling all the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up a moment later and gently scoop up the sleeping forms of Soph\u00eda and Ellie. Luckily, they don't wake or else they would have been squabbling in an instant. You softly head up stairs and first lay down Soph\u00eda, kissing her on her tiny head and then doing the same to Ellie. You smile down at your beautiful daughter and feel all is as it should be. Leaving Ellie's room, you see Sarah pass, carrying Alexa, who is now awake and wide eyed into her room. You tickle her little hand and she grins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take care of her, don't worry. Get some rest babe, you've been working non-stop all day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take her advice and head for your bedroom, change into your lacey nightie and then slide into between the warm sheets. Sarah is not long behind you and snuggles you close with you being the little spoon. You don't talk at all, you just fall asleep in her arms, in rhythm with her heart beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You remember all of it vividily, well the hen night is a little hazy but the rest is all there. Dress choosing, helping Jessica with picking caterers, the mini crisis on the day of the wedding where the Jessica's dress seemed to vanish, only to be found after an extensive search of the hotel the bridal party was staying on its way to the laundry room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe location of the wedding was beautiful, a small grotto on the edge of the beach nestled in the trees. Sarah insisted that she foot the bill for the ceremony, dresses, suits and reception and Ella graciously accepted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jess was finally in her dress and the car pulled up at the location, you will never forget that look of pure happiness on her face, she was practically glowing in her full length dress with her veil down, she was a vision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swear that as she walked down the aisle, Ella's eyes bulged in her skull. Ella herself chose to wear a shirt and trousers and stood at the end of the aisle waiting for her bride to approach. All the guests whispered excitedly about how gorgeous the bride was and Eleanor, who was to give away her daughter to Ella, almost broke down before the \"I do's\" were said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe marriage was simple in itself and when it was declared that Ella may kiss the bride, she lifted Jess's veil and locked lips with her new wife. Everyone erupted with cheers and applause as Ms and Mrs. Kershaw left for the reception and meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's hard to believe it's been five years since then\" you murmur to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are torn from your revery by loud screeching and a terrible bang, closely followed by \"Moooooom!\" Yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, leave your room and head to investigate the noise, knowing you aren't going to like what you find. It is currently around 4pm on a Tuesday and the sun is still bright lighting up the house nicely. As you round the corner towards the obvious place where the noise could have originated,the girls' rooms, you see Alexa stood at the doorway of Soph\u00eda's room, looking in with an alarmed look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexa, like all your girls, has grown a lot in the past five years. She has black hair, and shares a lighter version of your Latina skin tone. Out of all of your girls, she is easily the least excitable and most level headed. She is also the smartest by far. Since starting elementary school, she is consistently praised to be the smartest there despite only being six. You and Sarah are immensely proud of her and through a little encouragement is learning to play both piano and violin. Despite this, you feel that Alexa is your only daughter who has a closer relationship with her father, Sarah than she does with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on\" you say in the stern voice you reserve for the gravest situations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex's looks up and points into Soph\u00eda's room. \"In there mom, they're fighting again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes and prepare yourself for the latest bout in what has proved to be a 5 year grudge match that shows no sign of stopping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are unsurprised to see your other two daughters, Ellie and Soph\u00eda fighting on the floor. This alone does not surprise you, what does is that it Soph\u00eda's wardrobe is now on its side with one of the doors hanging open. \"That explains the bang\" you think. \"But how in the world did they knock it over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour daughter Ellie is the live wire of the family. With her pale skin and blonde hair, she is easily the most distinguishable out of your daughters. She is also the loudest. When she comes across something she doesn't like, everyone knows about it. She is also the most mischievous, regular prancing or tricking, you, Sarah, Soph\u00eda and also her friends. She comes across as a girly girl in her interests but often plays innocent to avoid getting in trouble. When arguments do break out between her and Soph\u00eda, if you trace it back, it is usually her who started it but despite this, she has a good relationship with you, Alexa and deep down really loves Soph\u00eda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoph\u00eda really is a girly girly, preferring, cute things like stuffed animals, dolls and skirts and dresses. She really takes after you in a lot of ways. She is quiet, polite and shy usually but when she is upset, that Latina anger really comes out. Because of her quiet nature, she is usally the one who comes off worse when squabbling with Ellie and is also the quickest to tears. Perhaps as a result of this, she is also the kindest and is praised at school for being nice to everyone. She won't admit it but she too really loves her sister Ellie despite all the fights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take in the scene fully. Ellie has pinned Soph\u00eda to the ground and is trying to pull her hair. Both are screaming and neither notice you enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What on earth do you think you are doing?\" You yell at the top of your voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls stop screaming and look in your direction. Their faces drop as they see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get off the floor this instant!\" You snap and Ellie scrambles off Soph\u00eda and both climb to their feet looking very sorry for themselves. \"Explain this.\" You point at the wardrobe. At once Ellie and Soph\u00eda both begin babbling at the same time, clearly trying to assign blame to the other. \"Quiet!\", they both immediately stop their babbling. \"Soph\u00eda, why is your wardrobe on its side?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ellie pushed it over for no reason mommy.\" She says with puppy dog eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did not\" Ellie yells. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did so\" Soph\u00eda replies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet\" you yell again. \"Ellie, what are you doing in Soph\u00eda's room, you know your not supposed to be in here and why is her wardrobe on the floor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllie looks at the fallen wardrobe with mirth in her eyes. \"I came in to help Soph\u00eda dress for dance but she didn't want any help and pushed her wardrobe at me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You liar.\" Soph\u00eda shouts, shaking with anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alexa, what happened?\" You say with a sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ellie did come in to help Soph\u00eda dress for dance but Soph\u00eda told Ellie to get out but Ellie wouldn't. Soph\u00eda tried to get Ellie out put Ellie pushed her into the wardrobe and it fell over. I told her not to go in mom.\" She looks up at you with mournful eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Alexa. So it seems both of you lied.\" You say scowling at your daughters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Ellie started it mommy.\" Soph\u00eda protests. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No buts, if you had told the truth you wouldn't be in trouble too, as for you Ellie, just wait till your father hears about this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllie's eyes drop to her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry\" she murmurs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh your not sorry yet but you will be, both of you\" you look at Soph\u00eda too. \"Now I want all of you in your dance uniforms in ten minutes, so we can leave. Understand?\" They all nod. \"Good, and if I hear as much as a peep from you, you won't be going to your cousin Hannah's birthday party. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that you leave the room and return to your room. You sigh after you close the door behind. Being a stay at home mom to three really takes it out of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou strip out of your day clothes and into your dancewear. Tuesday and Thursday evenings is ballet class for the girls and you help out as a teacher. You put your hair up in a ribbon and pick up your bag to leave <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://galleries.britishmodelgirls.co.uk/Charley-S-ballerina/images/Charley-S-0.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://galleries.britishmodelgirls.co.uk...</a> when you turn to see Sarah in her work suit, standing in the bedroom door smiling at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to reality shift.net, Sarah has aged maybe a year in appearance so is still as beautiful as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always love you in that outfit.\" She says still smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you wouldn't look bad in it yourself.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you taking them to dance then?\"  She says walking over to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah and could you do me a favour and put Soph\u00eda's wardrobe back up while I'm gone. Ellie and Soph\u00eda knocked it over fighting again, I was hoping you could have a word with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah sighs, much like you did after resolving the situation. \"Will it ever stop?\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When they move out\" you say joking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't let them move out. You'll be looking after then when they're in their forties.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't count on it.\" You say starting to leave. Sarah catches you in her arms and gives you a brief tender kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love you\" she says letting you go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love you too\" you reply, glad for the comfort before heading to dance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now all your girls are 17 and getting ready to finish high school and move onto going to the college of their choice. You are now in your mid 40's though thanks to realityshift.net, who has been you faithful friend over the years, you only look like you are in your late twenties with Sarah looking more she's in her early thirties. Without any help from your website, Sarah's company has grown massivly over the years, securing you and your daughters with a very good future. You remained a stay at home mom, taking the occasional modeling job for magazines when the girls started school properly. As for the girls themselves, they have grown so much over the years and all have matured into beautiful young women. The only problem is, the world has changed too and it is your opinion, not entirely for the better. With more and more men becoming women, the vast majority of the world's population becomes female. Those who have remained male are usually the rich or the strong such as big business men and sports stars. Some areas in Russian and the Middle East have held out however. The result of this is that lesbian relationships are now the most common romantic relationships in the world and since the chance of pregnancy in these relationships without a special piece of equipment is 0, girls are becoming more sexually aware younger now and having a girlfriend is a must for any teenage girl. You have put it in no uncertain terms that none of your daughters will even think about girl's in that way till college. Sarah thinks you are coming down too hard on them but you refuse to budge, this doesn't mean it isn't going on however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexa <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b95f657379a12a7e8fa09b1bf3e15eb7/tumblr_ob3d49dsKz1vps1s4o1_500.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://66.media.tumblr.com/b95f657379a1...</a> has shown herself to be something of an academic prodigy, excelling in all classes and mastering 3 instruments. You and Sarah are so proud of her accomplishments and can see her going very far. She is already writing here applications to several Ivy League universities who have expressed an interest in taking her on. Alexa is the most independent of all your daughters and while having a number of friends, she doesn't mind being alone and is not overly attached to any of them. She is by no means cold but just driven by her desire to succeed. You haven't had any problem with her trying to find a girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllie <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://cdn.pornpics.com/pics/2015-06-07/183202_02big.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://cdn.pornpics.com/pics/2015-06-07/...</a> has become, to your and Sarah's dismay, something of a tart. She flirts all the time and has developed something of a reputation at school. Despite this, Ellie is rather bright and is getting high grades in most of her subjects. You have though on occasion about changing her personality to make her more restrained, but you can't bring yourself to alter your daughter like that. Ellie still tries to act all cute to get out of trouble and still pesters her sister Sophia regularly but she is still in a close relationship with you, despite a few rocky years when she hit puberty. You are sure she has had girlfriends before although the most you have caught her doing is kissing one of her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophia <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.babemansion.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/ftv-teen-sophia-nude-in-public2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.babemansion.com/wp-content/up...</a> while not being as academically brilliant as her two sisters, makes up for it in her good nature and kindness. She truly does care for other's well-being more than her own and goes out of her way to help out with charities. She's worked for a time in charity shops, volunteered at homeless shelters and took part in every fund raising activity the school has ran. She is still something of a girly girl and is the your only daughter who kept up her dance lessons from childhood. She still has a rivalry with Ellie which flares up every now and then but for the most part they are civil. Your one concern about Sophia is her best friend Chloe <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://images.eroticbeauties.net/cms/content/ftv-girls-6663_meagan_the-ftv-monster/full/01.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://images.eroticbeauties.net/cms/con...</a> , one of your neighbor Gabriela and Helen's daughters. They have been best friends since since they were 5, going to the same school and taking the same classes. You think that they are becoming or already are more than best friends, judging by the way they look at each other and are always inseparable. Being honest, you wouldn't mind Sophia dating Chloe as they are both very trustworthy but that would then be unfair on your other daughters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is a Thursday and you are picking up your daughters from school. You are sat in your car waiting for them to come out the gate. You tut to yourself as you see two girls start making out by against one of the buildings. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://galleries2.ftvcash.com/V20_gals/ftvgirlsphoto/536ElleMalena15/pics/02.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://galleries2.ftvcash.com/V20_gals/f...</a> Its because of this that your daughters think your now dating rule is so unfair. Your eyes are torn from the spectacle as your doors open and your daughters get in. Alexa climbs in the front passenger seat while Ellie and Sophia climb in the back with Chloe in the middle. You give her lifts home since you live right next door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi mom\" They all say.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Mrs. Bennett.\" Chloe says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, girls. Good day?\" You ask starting the engine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was boring. Again\" Alexa says. Being way ahead of everyone academically does have its disadvantages. \"At least I finished one of my application letters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mine was okay.\" Ellie says, checking her reflection in the window. \"Got asked to go to the prom again.\" she hints. She had been doing this for months. Since you said no dating, this also meant no dates to the prom. Ellie was really upset by this and has made a big deal of it whenever she gets an invite from someone to be their date. On average she gets two to three invites a week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You keep saying that but every time I still don't believe anyone in the school has a strong enough stomach to ask you to be their date.\" Sophia says. This gets a small chuckle from Chloe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut it dweeb.\" Ellie says, flushing in anger. \"Just, you're just happy since Chloe gets to take you as a date.\" She grins wickedly at this and both Sophia and Chloe blush, look at the floor and grow silent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't press this as this is a common accusation but one that has never been backed up by any proof. Alexa just shakes her head and looks out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its going to be a long drive.\" you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We're doing a joint assignment and she's got the books we need.\" You say quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay\" she replies, \"don't overstay your welcome Sophia.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't,\" you call back, almost jogging after Chloe onto the beach path that links your two houses, anything to get away from the car as fast as possible. You catch up with Chloe but keep the fast pace until you are way down the beach and out of view from your house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a close one.\" Chloe says, letting out a huge sigh of relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, did my mom look convinced? I think she might be on to us.\" You say worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe looks back over her shoulder. \"I don't think so, she would have called us out if she thought anything was wrong, even with Ellie saying all that stuff.\" She pauses for a moment. \"How did your sister know that I asked you to be my date to the prom?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush bright red and smile sheepishly. \"She may have read it in my diary when she crept into my room yesterday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on Sophia\" Chloe says exasperated, \"You know you can't write anything down. What if your mom had read it and figured out that we're a couple?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I'm sorry.\" You say looking sorrowfully at your girlfriend, \"It just made me so happy when you asked me to the prom, I just had to say it somewhere. I really am sorry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe sighs again but then smiles at you lovingly. \"Its okay babe.\" she gives you an affectionate peck on the cheek, which makes you feel very warm. \"Just be careful in the future okay? You know Ellie is always snooping in your room and trying to get you into trouble.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know but she'd never say anything definite, how many times have we seen her with girls over in her room. She must have slept with half the hockey team by now the little skank.\" You both giggle at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, remember that time when we walked in on her with Shenice Walker in your living room?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shudder as you recall the event. You and Chloe had just come home early to your house as your class had been cancelled, only to find Ellie being screwed on the couch by Shenice Walker, a line backer on the football team wearing a strapon. A image of it floats by in your memory but you quickly waft it away, not relishing a picture of your sister naked. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://cdn.pornpics.com/pics/2016-07-24/232576_13big.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://cdn.pornpics.com/pics/2016-07-24...</a> Shenice didn't seem to mind you finding out but for the next two months, Ellie was super nice to you and Chloe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't remind of that. I don't want to have to think of my sister like that, its gross.\" You say, giving Chloe a playful push.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you brought up catching your sister with girls.\" Chloe protests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but I didn't bring up specific events and details.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, really?\" Chloe says looking mischievous now. \"So you don't want to be reminded about how Shenice folded your sister in half on your dad's favorite couch, plowing her with a strapon\" Chloe takes a few steps ahead of you and walks backwards facing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ewwwww! Quit it.\" You say, shaking your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you also won't want to be reminded of her moans either. She really was quite vocal I must say. It must be a family trait.\" She winks at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's it.\" You say hitching up your bag and preparing to chase after Chloe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing where this is going, Chloe, turns and begins to run down the beach laughing. You chase after her, laughing yourself now, all the way up to her house and her back door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe fumbles with the lock as you tear up the back garden path but she makes it in just in time dashes inside squealing. You run through the open door, slamming it closed behind you before running after her. Chloe's house is just as big and fancy as your's thanks to her dad's good job but right now, no one is home as her dad is on a business trip while her mom and two younger sisters are on a trip to visit their grand parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou toss your bag in the hallway as you pass it and rush up the stairs and into Chloe's room. As soon as you cross the doorway, you feel two arms wrap around you and spin you around. As you turn you find the arms belong to Chloe who quickly draws you into a powerful kiss. You put up a token resistance, before melting into her arms and kissing back with equal passion. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://media.babesource.com/galleries/5524025326bbc/122.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://media.babesource.com/galleries/55...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kiss gets more forceful when she lays you down on her bed and climbs atop you. You don't resist and part your legs allowing her between. \"You're such a bottom.\" she says looking down at you smiling as the kiss breaks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am not\" you protest, pouting and try to dislodge Chloe and pin her underneath you. Chloe, counters this effortlessly and pins your hands above your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told you.\" She says grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hummph\", you strain against her pin but again fail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I might just wear a tux to the prom. Show everyone I wear the pants.\" She jokes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do it and I dump you.\" You say wearing your own grin now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dump me?\" Chloe says in mock surprise. \"Won't that mean that we're dating? Gasp! What will your mom say about that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just shut up and kiss me.\" you say not wanting to be teased anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I think I want you naked first.\" Chloe growls before starting to pull your blouse over your head. You respond by tugging at her skirt with your now released hands. You both shriek in delight as you strip each other and before you know it, you are stood facing each other naked, panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe takes your hands in hers and looks at you lovingly again. \"I really do love you Sophia.\" She says, seriously now. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://media.babesource.com/galleries/5524025326bbc/159.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://media.babesource.com/galleries/55...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take in the beautiful form of your girlfriend and honestly reply, \"I love you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you reply, Chloe brings you in for a softer and more tender kiss which has you moaning into her mouth <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://cdn-i30.definebabe.com/_idb/g/59/73/12/76e3cd03f0/13.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://cdn-i30.definebabe.com/_idb/g/59/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tongue explores your mouth and her hands caress your soft skin. Suddenly, her hands firmly grasp your ass and lower thigh and you feel yourself being lifted. Your eyes shoot open and you bring your arms around Chloe's neck for support as your feet leave the ground. She keeps lifting you and you squeal in surprise and wrap your legs around her. You end, suspended in Chloe's arms with her smiling at you. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://ftvmagic.com/post_pics/2015/09/169.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://ftvmagic.com/post_pics/2015/09/16...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told you you were a bottom.\" She says before kissing you while still suspended.

You thought maybe there was a way you could change society a bit, for the better, so that he wouldn't feel like such an outcast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter mulling over ideas for an hour, you finally settled on something: \"The remaining men aren't pressured into becoming women, and aren't discriminated against for making that decision. People should be hired on their merit rather than their gender.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a moment to think about this, and found it ironic that you even had to type this. It seemed backwards compared to the reality you first came from where women were demanding equal rights from men, not the other way around. Somehow your changes had made the world a matriarchy and trans-women were more common than people who stayed male. Was that actually a good thing or not? You weren't sure, but you hoped this new change would at least bring the world one step closer to equality... you hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you hit 'Enter', and there wasn't much of anything that happened, as far as you could tell. You were still sitting at your computer desk wearing a red little Christmas dress, and you felt no different. You were relieved that your change hadn't gone back and made you never choose to become Maria, since all those years ago you really mainly did it for the money. But now you would never go back and change that, not in a million years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly browsed the online news sites to see if you could spot any clues about how society changed as a result. You found the majority of news articles were still written by women, but there were some male journalists as well. Names you'd recognized from before all of this happened. You saw one writer who you remember had gone off and claimed males were going extinct and the matriarchy was oppressing men. He was one of many men who jumped on this bandwagon over the years, and had been ostracized from society from saying such things. Now he was writing normal articles online about regular issues like climate change and immigration. It was hard to even find any news at all regarding gender discrimination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it really worked?\" You wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSociety seemed to have improved, at least at first glance. But the number of males in the world was still declining, just now no one seemed alarmed by it... Women had the option of changing into men, but very few were taking it, except female to male transgender people. On the other hand, men seemed to be eager to change, even those that weren't transgender, and you couldn't figure out why. Were so many men that desperate for the money that they would change their lives for it? Maybe there was something else here that you missed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all of this sociology stuff was really starting to hurt your head, and you had Christmas morning to think about! You hoped this change was the gift Jake needed, and you hoped things would start to turn around for him now!</span></div></div>",

You looked down to see what was different, and strangely, you looked and felt exactly the same.  You were still a petite woman dressed in a rather sexy office outfit, which teased your impressive bust and long legs.  You saw your reflection in the tablet screen, and you still looked like Taeko, with a cute face and black hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did it do...?\"  You said, noting your voice had the same feminine tone to it as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your slender fingers, you went through the website using the touch screen, searching for anything that would tell you what was going on.  Finally you found a log of previous changes.  The most recent change read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"User requested: \"Let Sarah's and my marriage be the best it can be where she will love me the most and be the happiest with our relationship.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSolution: User's wife Sarah cannot be truly happy with a partner that is stressed about being forced to transform.  Previous alterations including: 'Forced gender equality' have been removed, as they conflict with subject Sarah's happiness and marriage.  Other previous changes are still in effect, including \"All employees are Japanese women.\"  This change does not conflict with solution, and does in fact enhance it.  Subject Sarah has been proven to be more receptive to this form.  This alone is not yet optimal, and new changes were required.  Further changes include: 'User received enhanced reproductive system.'  User and subject Sarah have been calculated to one day desire children, which conflicts with preferred appearances.  Minimal modifications were made to preserve appearance without violating critical functions.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe explanation was very technical and wordy, and you were barely able to follow it.  You looked around the office at the mention of removing the forced gender equality, and noticed that yes, indeed every single employee was once again an attractive Japanese woman, no exceptions, especially yourself.  But you were kind of glad that it was once again only limited to this building, rather than the whole world.  Having people being forced to experience both genders seemed rather dystopian for your tastes, even if it did help your marriage considerably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued reading until the words 'enhanced reproductive system' stood out to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck does that mean?  Was it talking about me, <i>my reproductive system</i>?\" You asked, suddenly patting your skirt with a slender hand.</span></div></div>",

Everything still seemed delightfully female down there, so you quickly removed your hand in case anyone got the wrong idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's strange, I guess I'll have to look into it when I get home, and I can get a better look...\"  You muttered to yourself, already getting used to the way your feminine voice sounded.  That's when it hit you.  You were already looking forward to going home, as Taeko.  The day before you were dreading it, and wanted to change back to normal, but today was entirely different.  \"This is me now...  This isn't just something I have to endure; this is my life.  If this is the reality where Sarah and I will be most happy, then this is how it's going to be.  Forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found yourself smiling at this, proud of how you were finally in control of your life again, and not at the whims of a website.  But ironically, you were still very much at the mercy of realityshift.net.  It had decided what would make Sarah happiest, not you.  You didn't even question it because another change it hadn't documented was your more submissive personality.  If the website insisted this would make Sarah happiest, then you wanted nothing more than to make her happy and believed it at face value.  Throughout the rest of the work day, you worked diligently and obeyed your bosses to the letter, quickly getting through your pile of work.  Doing your job and being efficient at it made you happy, and you were even happier when you saw that it was finally time to head home!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I'm home!\"  You called out, straining to shout with your new voice.  You always tended to speak softly now so yelling took a real effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard some rustling from the other room and your wife came rushing out to greet you.  \"Oh my god, it's true then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah practically lifted you off your tiny feet in her happiness to see you and pulled up to her face level for a kiss.  Even in your heels, you were so short next to her.  Once free of the lovely kiss, you stammered a bit before asking, \"W-what's true?  What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You!  You're still Taeko!\"  Your wife exclaimed, sounding excited for some reason.  \"I heard on the news that all the forced changes had been outlawed, and now people finally got to choose to return to normal.  I... I didn't know how you'd react to it, but I honestly didn't expect you'd come home as Taeko again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tilted your head cutely, a bit perplexed.  \"Choose?  Sarah, I decided to stay as Taeko, forever.  There is no more Tim now... isn't it ... isn't it great?  Are you unhappy with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was practically in tears now, and other than that you really couldn't read her reaction very well.  You were suddenly afraid she would be mad at you.  You wanted nothing more than to please her, but if she was unhappy with this then what would you do?  There was no way to change back without changing your entire reality now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, T... Taeko.  I'm not mad, just a bit overwhelmed.  I was afraid this would happen.  After last night we had such a good time together, I knew there was a chance you might have enjoyed it too.  But I didn't expect you to forsake your old life forever.  How... how will we have children now?  I mean I'm very happy, but this presents a real problem, you know?\"  Sarah said through her tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou helped her sit down on the bed and snuggled up next to her, stroking her hair.  You even started to cry yourself, just seeing her like this.  As Taeko you seemed to have an uncontrollable amount of empathy, and if she was crying, you couldn't stop yourself from doing the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think there's still a way.  There has to be.  When I made the change they told me something about enhanced reproductive organs... Something about making sure we could still have kids.  They didn't tell me what, though.  Listen, Sarah, I... I can try to change back into a man if this makes you unhappy.  I just thought you liked me like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah looked at you and suddenly realized her selfishness, \"Oh my god... Taeko, did you even consider your feelings when you made this decision?  Is this the person you wanted to be?  If you did this just to make me happy... I don't know what to say.  I mean, if this is who you are, then I think it's lovely, and I will support you in whatever you choose, but don't do this just for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were starting to have a hard time comprehending what she was saying. You did this for her, but was she rejecting your devotion? You knew the reality change had made you in a way that would make Sarah happy, but she didn't seem so happy right now.  Was it something you'd done?  Did you screw up and make her upset?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Sarah, I...  I did this because I wanted to.  I WANT to be Taeko...\"  <i>To make you happy,</i> you silently added in your head.  \"And I know there's a way we can have kids, don't worry about that.  Science can do anything these days, including turn me into Taeko.  If it can do that, then don't worry about children.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour wife nodded and hugged you closer to her bosom, \"You're right, I shouldn't panic about that.  It was just so overwhelming; that's all.  And if this is going to be the new you from now on, then I love it, I absolutely do.  I always wanted our time together as two women to last longer than just a day, but I never thought it would come true.  I want nothing more than for you to be my wife, Taeko.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's what I am Sarah; that's what I chose to be.\"  You said, wiping your tears away as you suddenly felt elated that she was so approving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were no more words, as you found yourself being passionately kissed, and you happily kissed your wife back in the same manner.  You kicked your heels off and laid back on the bed, pulling her on top of you.  Your wife straddled your petite body and looked at you with a newfound lust.  After such an outpouring of emotions, you felt that she really needed an outlet right now.  And as she was on top of you, you began to feel turned on in response to her lusty looks.  Your pubic area tingled, and you felt a wetness, but also a strange shifting between your thighs.</span></div></div>",

You shake your head a little when Sarah breaks the kiss and rummages in her draw for her favourite toy. Out comes the strapon and she tries to put on a show for you as she climbs into the harness and places her end of the dildo into her dripping pussy. She looks at you ravenously and you quiver in anticipation of being taken. She runs a hand up your legs and then quickly tears a hole in your pantyhose and pulls your panties aside allowing her access to your crotch. She positions herself at your entrance and thrusts in causing you to squeak in pleasure. Sarah moans too but then lies atop your small body in between your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your flesh touches between her crotch and yours as she bottoms out inside of you, you receive another flash of pleasures that obscures your very vision with white light. You cry out in pleasure and wrap your legs tightly around Sarah in a hugely submissive and vulnerable display of passion. Sarah it seems to shared in the pleasure spike as her eyes go out of focus for a moment and blussful look comes upon her face before she starts thrusting her hips into you again and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cry out in pleasure and wail pathetically as you are taken by your wife but then the flashes start again, every time Sarah thrusts into you, one comes magnifying your pleasure a hundred fold. Sarah receives them to as she picks up the pace of her thrusting so that all you can see is bright flashing light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's at this point you seem to be weightless, away from your body even.

All of Sarah's hopes and fears are with you, as are yours but you don't worry because you and her make up a a whole. She makes up the strength, the power and protecting nature while your soul is more tender, gentle, submissive and nurturing and both together you make something great. It's at this moment of total oneness that you are brought crashing back into your body as your body spasms from the biggest orgasm you have ever had. Your legs and arms lock around Sarah and she too freezes and locks too as she orgasms too. You cry out one last long cry, tears of pleasure streaming down your cheeks as your orgasm finally subsides after several minutes. You grow limp and so does Sarah as she falls atop you, panting wildly. As you are getting your feeling back in your body, you notice a certain warmth coming from your lower stomach, at first you mistake it for Sarah's strapon still inside you but you feel that also. Your eyes suddenly widen as you feel something stir inside, something moving before coming to rest and settling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell  was that?\"  Sarah asks, looking down at you with a confused expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shallow hard before answering. \"I think I'm pregnant\", you reply softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Checking her itinerary, and E-mails you work diligently. The thought of returning home, to that small flat, and the endless tortuous abuse that you're as much a cow with your udders, rather than a suitable bride with a desirable body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tear wells in the corner of your eye, and you distractedly wipe it away before it can spoil your make-up.</span></div></div>",

The submission grows, the sense of being a lowly secretary becoming acceptable, part and parcel of your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring at the screen, you try to make the letters re-arrange by sheer will-power. The chill of your ass pressing against the window brings you back to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/946f724ca1f60024489ef8b50c38ba8d/tumblr_ppny7b8k4g1r5ijn7o1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://66.media.tumblr.com/946f724ca1f6...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see other changes with an abruptness that shocks you that you missed them. Finally, you snap the window closed, the tension of doing this in the boss' office too stressful. The vague memories, of leering glances, unsubtle 'accidental' brushes, as he squeezed past you in a 'too narrow' corridor, heat your cheeks. Worst was the steadying hand, as you walked down stairs in these heels. The brushing contact with your bust, unacceptable. You were perfectly steady in your heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking for your desk, outside the office, serving as his interface between the rest of the office and his workflow. You are to block unnecessary interruptions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGasping, you see him standing in the doorway. You bob a curtsy, as you straighten. His gaze locked deep in your cleavage, he barely notices you at his computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHands once again shivering too much, you want to finish buttoning your blouse closed. But not wanting to draw any more attention to your well-displayed cleavage you flee his office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you expect, dread he stands in the doorway. Forcing you to squeeze by. His hands low, they brush against your skirt, as you pass. His crotch too seeming to brush your hips too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe filthy chuckle, as he then steps inside his office only cutting off, as he shuts the door. Queasy, and tottering you drop into your seat. The answering bounce from your chest reminding you of your part of the blame. Too wantonly displaying yourself. Feeling guilty and ashamed, you button your blouse closed up to your neck. Even now the dark outline of your bra a poor choice, as you contribute to your own shame.</span></div></div>",

You run your hand along the legs and find from the touch that these slender legs in tights belong to you. You move them about to see your feet and find them to be wearing black stiletto heels. Its with this you notice your hands, tiny delicate things that are extremely pale. You look up, close your eyes and take a deep breathe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its just a bad dream.\" You say to yourself but as soon as you say it, your eyes shoot open and you bring your tiny hands over your mouth. The voice that came from your mouth didn't belong to you. It was high and sweet but most importantly female. You look once more at yourself and again gasp as you notice something you didn't notice before. The cleavage of two pert breasts emerges from the low neck of the dress. Your hands move to them instantly and to touch and squeeze them. As you do, you let out a moan inadvertently. Your groping actually felt good. You withdraw your hands and turn on your chair remembering the mirror just to the left of your desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't have prepared yourself for what you saw in the mirror. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/a4/08/47/a4084792d8ebacd20b6acf0447cd60c8.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564...</a><br>\r\nAt first you thought that the reflection was someone else in the room with you but as the young, cute Asian secretary in the mirror followed all of your actions and movements, it sinks in. You are her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit there breathing heavily, taking in the new you, completely in shock about the whole thing. The only thing that finally draws you away from it is the appearance of another woman entering into the office area and heading over to the desk next to yours. She is a hot blonde dressed in blouse, tight skirt, sheer nylons and heels you have never seen in before so you can only assume she is new. You follow her with your eyes till she stops in front of what you can only assume is her desk. When there she lets out a heavy sigh and bends down to take off one of her heels.<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/f6/97/e1/f697e124d269942005dbeb01486401d2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can feel yourself getting aroused at this candid display so at least you still are straight, well lesbian or at least bisexual in this new body. You almost jump as she looks up at you after removing her second heel. She smiles at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My feet are killing me.\" She says, falling back into her office chair. \"Halyna has had be run up and down the entire building, distributing letters. I thoughts that what I had you as an assistant secretary for.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Assistant secretary?\" you think. You were a division manager and now you aren't even a full secretary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay Suzuki?\" The woman asks, looking a little concerned, \"You're acting kinda weird.\" At this you realise you have been staring at her, almost unblinkingly all this time so you look down at the floor with a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yeah... I'm fine.\" You say, still freaked out at your voice,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, alright then, just let me know if there is something wrong hun.\" At this the woman turns to her computer and logs on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suzuki?\" You repeat over and over in your head. \"Is that me?\" Suddenly a flash of memories rush across your mind of you living in Japan until you were 17 at which point you moved here. You try to remember why but the memory is shrouded in emotional distress so it slips away as quickly as it came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes inadvetantly fall on your screen and you nearly fall out of your chair as you see the text on the open browser page. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your reality change has been successful. The settings of, Female, Asian secretary has been fulfilled. Thank you for using our service.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all comes flooding back. The email, the Japanese text. You stifle a gasp as you realize the link really was real. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegain composure, you attempt to find the reverse switch. You find it and click it only to be greeted by another popup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're sorry but you cannot undo the change just yet. There is a one day cool down time. Try again later.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou curse silently. \"Ah well.\" Comes a voice in your head which you're sure isn't your's. \"At least I'm the cutest girl in the office, no rush.\" You wonder where that came from. Was this body taking over or had more things changed than just your race and gender?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For the moment, you decide it is best just to lay low and make it through the day so you can reverse the changes tomorrow and be done with the whole affair. You try to settle down and turn to your work. Unsurprisingly, it is very easy and consists mostly of proofreading documents and also filling out tedious pieces of basic paper work which only the lowest members of a business company ever had to worry about. You notice the name of your boss, Halyna pop-up often which is different since your boss used to be a guy called John on the top floor, it seems that this Halyna has replaced you as the division manager. On a further survey of the room, you notice that you and the blonde woman are desked outside Halyna's office, further putting across as your new role as under secretary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hours drag on by and the tedium of the work helps distracts you a little from your situation, things change however when you need to use the bathroom. Unsure of office protocol at your position in the company, you get up and ask the blonde woman if you can go to the toilet. She laughs at this replying she isn't your teacher, so you head off, wobbling a little in your heels to find a bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom standing up you learned a little more about yourself, you have shrunk too. Even in the four inch heels you are wearing, you are little over 5 ft 2. Luckily, the bathrooms haven't moved with the reality change and after stopping yourself at the last minute from entering the men's room, you go into the woman's room and find a stall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext comes the moment you have been dreading since this all started. You lifted up your dress and slowly rolled down your nylons to your knees to reveal a pair of black lace panties covering your crotch. Trembling slightly, you lower them too so that your brand new, shaved pussy is on display. You stare at it as though staring into a portal to another dimension where all logic and reason mean nothing. Being reminded why you originally came into the bathroom by a pang of pressure on your bladder, you sit and relax your pelvic muscles so that a warm stream emerges from your pussy. You don't take your eyes off it, amazed at the whole thing. When you are finished, you take a piece of toilet paper and tentatively wipe, trying to touch as little of yourself as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the bizarre experience over, you redress and leave the cubicle to wash up. Returning to your desk, you find the door to Halyna's office open and a female voice coming from within as if on the phone. As soon as you take your seat, the blonde woman turns to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suzuki, Halyna wants to see you in her office.\" She notices your worried expression. \"Oh don't worry, she didn't sound mad.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand and click over to Hayna's office in your heels and knock lightly on the door and poke your head around the frame. You see a middle aged woman with dark hair, sat behind a desk wearing a skirt suit. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/0b/b9/5c/0bb95cf943330f7843613a54da09bf8d.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564...</a> She is on the phone and doesn't even look up as she waves you in. You walk in as she scribbles things down in front of her and wait expectantly in front of her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you wait, your eyes can't help being drawn under to her legs under the desk. She bounces one leg over the other with the heel dangling from her toes. You follow her legs up with your eyes and see the tops of her stockings and the straps from the garters, along with a thin sliver of bare thigh between the stocking and her skirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel yourself getting hot and aroused again at the sight of her. Your crotch gets warm and you get an odd feeling in your stomach. Before you have time to think about the significance of this, Halyna hangs up the phone and faces you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Suzuki, good.\" She starts. \"I have a few things for you to do for me tomorrow.\" She pulls a huge stack of envelopes from her desk and gestures for you to take them. \"I'm sending you to another branch tomorrow to distribute these. I would use post but the new policy on corporate espionage says it needs to be kept in house. You'll find all the names on them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand\" You say and turn to leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One more thing Suzuki.\" You stop in your tracks and turn to face her. \"I received a report from the tech department that an unauthorized site was assessed from your computer earlier today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your mouth to reply but Halyna beats you to it. \"Now I know that it was followed from an email link so I understand it most likely have been a mistake considering your great work in the past but I have to warn you to be more careful in the future. You're only 21 dear, you don't want to throw your career away over a silly mistake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod at her, glad that she seems to be a fair boss with your interests at heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No run along. You can head home now, the day's finished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that you leave her office and place the heavy pile of envelopes on your desk. The blonde woman looks up from her screen. \"It seems you didn't get out of delivery girl duty after all.\" she says with some amusement. \"Just leave them there and I'll have them taken to downstairs reception so you can pick them up quickly tomorrow since you're heading off now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay\" you say and then start to leave the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey wait, aren't you forgetting something?\" She asks, gesturing to the black purse hung on your chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right.\" You say and quickly retrieve it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem.\" She says again as you turn to go again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" You ask, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You forgot to say, thank you Mandi.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize at this point that Mandi must be her name. \"Oh, i'm sorry. Thank you Mandi.\" You say sincerely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMandi smiles at this. \"There you go, wasn't hard was it. Now have a good night hun. See you tomorrow sometime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wave goodbye to Mandi and leave the office for the elevators, clutching your purse in one hand. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/31/70/24/317024ca3c67cf749723ef66ebe8fde5.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou when you call and enter it, you find yourself sharing it with two men. Their conversation stops when you enter and you can feel their eyes all over you as the elevator descends. You feel all exposed and vulnerable like this and shoot out of the elevator when it hits ground floor. You quickly leave the building to the car park. You walk up and down the rows looking for your BMW that you drive but can't find it anywhere. You are alerted to jingling in your purse and open it to retrieve a set of car keys. You press the unlock button on them and a small, silver Toyota lights up in front of you. You press the button again find that this really is your car now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, you climb into it, start the engine and leave the car park. The sat nav in it lights up automatically and selects the route marked \"home\". After following its instructions for a few minutes you notice that you are not heading back to your spacious three bedroom house but instead find yourself parked outside an apartment building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving your car, you approach the building and using another set of keys you have in your purse, you unlock the front door and enter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now all I have to do is figure what apartment I'm in.\" you think to yourself. This problem doesn't last long as you pass the mail boxes. Out of all of them, one stands out as it features not only the word \"Michiko\" on it but also \u9234\u6728\u7f8e\u667a\u5b50, the Japanese characters you remember to represent the name you chose. \"Number 408.\" You say to yourself and take the elevator up. You walk down the corridor to your room and when finding it, you unlock it and walk through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time today, you are pleasantly surprised as you see the interior of your apartment. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.yourapartments.com/content/apart/WAR007/det-003-none.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.yourapartments.com/content/ap...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou close the door behind you and gratefully slide off your heels before you explore your home. It definitely has Japanese influence behind the decor. You take some time looking around before you find a few picture frames on a shelf. You examine them, one by one. One, you can only assume is your parents which a memory flash informs you that they both died from illness a year ago. Others are of you with who discover to be your friends here. One picture draws you in further however. It is a picture of a beach. You remember it is the beach near where you used to live in Japan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you gaze at it, you find tears rolling down your cheeks and yourself getting upset. You really didn't want to leave, that much is for sure but the reason why you left continues to elude you. You sit down with picture and focus hard on remembering. As before, the memory is painful and doesn't want to be found but suddenly it comes to you and your eyes widen as you remember a lot about who you are and why you left.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

You had only been caught out by your boss because he actually saw it on your computer, something you luckily managed to revert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the office block and walking to the far side of the complex, you looked at all the variations the website had to offer. It was broken down into various different sections which made a bit of sense. Unfortunately, there was no \"Help\" page for you to take advantage of. The main sections at the start broke into different categories called \"People\", \"Objects\" and \"Other\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \"Other\" Tab featured a plain simple textbox where you typed in what you wanted, practically the same as what you had used before. The \"People\" tab was designed to be used on people and typing in their full name made it far easier to change them. The objects tab was designed to be targeted at specific non-living objects and change them as you saw fit - including ways that didnt seem possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps now was the time to try out the \"People\" tab, or the \"Objects\" tab.

Gina was secretary to one of the higher bosses that you never saw and, like nearly all of your co-workers, was sure that she got the job more for her looks than her qualifications which a quick internet check by Ross had shown up nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, the website said that Gina was actually quite smart, but did confirm that her ability to get the job was based on 73% looks and 27% work history. Unusual average. Either way, you were gonna try something on her. You also noticed that a \"Compare\" tab appeared when you opened her page up.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You decided to go with the NOT AWARE option as it might allow you to have more fun in the long run of things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screen returned to the comparison of you and Gina. You noticed arrows beside each of the options that pointed to the centre. Accidentally pushing the face arrow on Gina, you suddenly saw that your own face on your model had changed. Looking at the reflection from the Ipad, you suddenly noticed that your own face had been replaced with Gina's, stitched in a rather ugly fashion on your male head. An undo option had appeared but you decided that for the sake of trying, you were going to push all the arrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, Tom, a senior network operator was now walking down the concrete path wearing black high heels, a formal black skirt that stopped at his knees and a white straightened shirt over his now female body which sported all the female appendages that came with it - including breasts. His entire head had reshaped to have Gina's long hair ginger hair which was tied back into a pony tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to top it off, nobody even cared that Gina didnt even own an Ipad, or that she was walking into C-block to work on a busted network router. To make you feel even more giddy, you naturally sounded like her after a few quick tests. This website was insanely powerful - how the heck had you been given the opportunity to use it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into C-Block absentmindedly, Gillette approached you quickly.<br>\r\n\"Didnt think you'd get here so quickly Tom\" She said, walking up to you as if nothing had happened. Before you could say anything, she handed you a work report. \"Router in the fridge has finally died.\"<br>\r\n\"Fridge?\" You asked, still surprised.<br>\r\n\"Yea... you know... Sheesh, whats gotten into you today? You look confused or something. The fridge - its the room you named down in the basement because its always so freakin' cold in there because of the busted aircon unit\"<br>\r\n\"Oh yea\" You said, suddenly remembering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody seemed to care that Gillette was talking to a young female secretary who wouldnt even step into this block because she never needed to come here.<br>\r\n\"Get one of the new OE6 models and install it. Once your sure its working, I can install the new firmware and the boys upstairs who sign our paychecks can say that there are some happy clients out there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGilette left you alone in what passed for a lobby in C-Block. Walking down to the basement stairwell, you stopped off at the warehouse to pick up a new network router. This website was insanely powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to test the powers of the website even further, you went into the \"Other\" tab where you could type whatever you wanted.<br>\r\n\"Stop time for everything except whatever gives me access to this website\". Then you pressed enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden... nothing happened. The website claimed it had happened but you didnt see just how much it HAD happened until you passed by the break room. Gillette was in there, staring at the microwave as something inside stood motionless. A man was pouring the last of his coffee down the sink, but the liquid itself had stopped in mid-air, not even touching the bottom of the sink. Clicking your fingers infront of Gillette, she didnt even blink and listening hard, she wasnt even breathing. Time had quite literally - stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the perfect time for you. Quickly dealing with the busted router, you sat down in the breakroom filled with motionless people and got to work, learning more about the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Create an inanimate clone of me five meters from where I am standing. The clone is a perfect replica of exactly how I look at any time and constantly updates whenever any changes are made to me. Destroy the clone when time unfreezes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, a perfect clone of you - well, Gina - appeared in front, arms out wide and legs straight, looking at nothing with its eyes open. It was much easier to work off a mannequin like this rather than the rendering of the website which didnt work too well on your Ipad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to start with your height, making yourself a few inches taller, now standing just below the top of the door frame. Then you toned your muscles hugely which basically made you look like a tall, highly athletic Gina - something that didnt quite look right. You decided this needed to be fixed.<br>\r\nStarting with your hair, you made it black and shortened it to being a few millimeters above the skin while it ran from your shoulders and joined at your back. Then, the white business shirt which had been automatically adjusted to fit your body, was readjusted to show your midriff. You also adjusted your eye colour to be a deep red, something you hoped would be a useful intimidation tactic. After all, you deserved it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the name Tom or Gina didnt seem like the sort of name that would fit with what was now a practically amazonian body. So you decided under the \"mental\" category, to change it to 'Athena'. Perfect. A greek goddess' names now being yours seemed to suit the amazonian body style.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince this was an opportune time to learn about the mental section, you looked at the various other options. While you didnt want to mess with the personality section, you noticed that the \"Mental' tab did cover alot of things, including job, job title, job description and job salary. For all the world cared, you could be <i>Professional Performance Instructor</i> with the job of <i>Maintaining order in the company by being a shining example of how a woman should act and look.</i> Of course, that would probably result all woman in trying to imitate your look so that didnt work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou settled for keeping your current job title of Senior Network Administrator and then decided to increase your paygrade to $110,000 a year. Perfect.</span></div></div>",

You shiver slightly as she mentions your name - it's a name that commands power and respect, something you hope you can garner from this new body. Okay, so you had gone from being a man to a woman - Secretly you had always wondered what it would be like being a woman for a day and how often would this opportunity come up? Even if you only stay as a woman for a day, perhaps you might feel like staying like this - maybe it would be better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting back down in your cubicle on level 23 in E-Block, you notice that your family photos have changed. No longer is Tom smiling beside his mum, dad and sister - instead a happy Athena is with them, her height apparently quite evident in comparison to her parents. And now you were her, in all your shining glory. Anyway, enough of the day dreaming, time to start working and see how life has changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot ten minutes into sorting out the new network software, you get a call from Agatha in HR.

Heck, if she fired you somehow you could reverse that change almost instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lock your Ipad and hide it in your work bag, for fear that someone else could find it. Then you get up and start walking down to the HR office on the other side of the building, noticing a few eye movements as some men give you side glances that you would never have gotten when you came in this morning. Knocking on the office door, the croaking voice of Agatha called out for you to come in. She had you sit down in front of her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Agatha wanted to look down at you to feel intimidating - which she sometimes did due to raising her chair up - it would be completely impossible in this case. Since changing your body, you had increased your height substantially and now stood well over a head taller than her.<br>\r\n\"Whats up?\" You asked, relaxing in your chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your attire\" Agatha said bluntly. \"While you do dress to being within company standards, I am recieving several complaints that you are showing yourself off as being <i>too</i> attractive.\"<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" You cough. You really had no idea that the website would go into THIS much detail.<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately, yes. And as per company policy after recieving a minimum number of individual complaints, I have to deal with this.\" She started.<br>\r\n<i>'This is it'</i> You thought <i>'I'm going to get fired for the second time in one day. Gonna have to reverse this again'</i><br>\r\n\"I'm going to have to move your cubicle space to level 24 where there are less people. I'm hoping that the lack people up there will cause this problem to go away\" She said, finishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nearly screamed in delight, but held a straight face. Level 24 was an almost dream place for people in this building to work in. The company had long ago invested in some future proofing, adding some extra levels incase they needed them in the future as the company expanded. Level 23 had well over 100 employees working in it alone, between cubicles in the middle and offices along the walls.<br>\r\nLevel 24 was set out almost exactly the same way, except that it had about 15 workers at the moment. The place was so silent it was a dream to work there. There was only the odd phone going off a few times a day, nothing like the constant phones here and the constant chattering, the occasional person going insane and the constant slamming of doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Thanks\" You say, standing up.<br>\r\n\"I'll let you move your own things - I know how much one can hate it when someone else touches their stuff\" Agatha said, opening the door for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leave the office and walk back to your cubicle, noticing the moving eyes again. This time you noticed that they were looking at your chest more than anything else.<br>\r\n<i>'Perverts'</i> You thought to yourself, laughing a little inside. Wait, where had that come from? You were a guy in your mind and should find it okay for guys to look at woman secretly. Was it possible that your mind was slowly adjusting to being a woman? That didnt feel entirely okay.</span></div></div>",

Already in the elevator to go up a floor, you typed into the \"Other\" tab the following:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does the Other Tab support questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a brief loading screen and a new message appeared:<br>\r\n\"Questions are still in BETA MODE but most questions should be available. If you intend to make any changes, do NOT format it as a question. Format it as a Statement. Otherwise the change is unlikely to occur.<br>\r\nWell, that was good enough for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I physically swap genders, will it affect my mind?\"<br>\r\n\"No physical swaps should affect a persons mind. However gender swapping tests have revealed over time that a subject's mind may slowly begin to alter to accomodate the new gender. This is considered a normal process and it is advised to allow it to remain happening. Subjects have not, however, completely changed - rather adjusted slightly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell that was refreshing. You werent going to completely change, just become an expert on walking in high heels. You soon found your new desk and sat down in front of it. You never needed to worry about being seen here. The only people who worked here were too busy on their own projects and the manager on this level spent most of his time asleep in his office. Someone always woke him though just so that he didnt get fired. It was a win-win situation. He kept the numbers on this level low and the employees stopped him from getting fired.</span></div></div>",

Such a werid feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator stopped at the parking lot and everyone slowly filed out in an organised group, not caring who got pushed and shoved to the side. They were tired and hungry and slightly bitter. The worst was on Friday, when everyone rushed out of the elevator eager to start their weekend which usually involved nothing productive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked over to your car - a rusty, red, 1985 Toyota Corolla. You only had just enough funds to buy this car at the time - something that you really needed. Although it was really wrecked, at least it still worked and had actually only died once on you in the ten years you had owned it. Thank goodness for their legendary life expectency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept now you decided to change that. Pulling out your Ipad, the internet connection down here was a little weak due to all the concrete. However you managed to get onto the website and open the objects tab. Pulling up the profile of your car, you turned it into a Yamaha Goldwing, something that would really make the heads turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting onto the bike, you turned the engine on, listening to the beautiful purring as it waited to rush off. This bike was designed to go fast, not mill around in the backstreets of a city. Zooming out of the carpark and up the ramp, you felt the blast of air hit you and rush past your face. It felt amazing. When you hit the top of the ramp, you flew into the air for a few seconds, only to come straight back down and land perfectly, going out the parking gate onto the main road and zooming down the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no idea how to ride a motorcycle but apparently the website had modified you to know instinctively how to do it. You accellerated to 100mph and noticed  a police car sitting on the side of the street. Just as soon as he saw you, he lost you, making this particular pursuit pointless. Only ten minutes later, you had arrived at home. Opening the garage door, you drove in and turned the motorbike off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was your home, an extremely small house with a single bedroom, a bathroom, kitchen and joint dining room and living room. The backyard occupied the same amount of space as your house so at least you had somewhere to do stuff outside. You might not have a second story but at least your house was on top of a hill which basically meant a free excellent view out the front over the ocean. This house was another one you got cheap, since realestate agents have extreme difficulty selling houses with only one bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you thought about it, the toilet had become obsolete. Since you didnt need to eat and drink anymore, you didnt need to use the bathroom. Of course, if anyone did come over then they'd probably get worried over why there was no toilet, so you instead opted to keep the bathrrom the way it was.</span></div></div>",

Probably heavily increased your stomach acidity or whatever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince tonight was Wednesday Night, that practically turned the local park into a market where hundreds of people came from around to buy food and cheap things. It was one of few tourist attractions in your town. You figured that down there at the market, you could have alot of fun, especially since it went very late into the night  one market a couple of years back having to forcefully push a large number of people out at 4am.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only problem was that you wouldnt have an internet connection down there. Sure, you had a phone, but a cheap one at that. Looking on the table, you noticed that you had left your Ipod there from the morning before you left for work. Picking it up, you stared at it intently, there must be a way to make this an effective tool. Then, suddenly the idea hit you, like a ton on bricks, only not so literally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogging onto the internet, you used the website to do some heavy modifications to your Ipod. First, you extended the battery capacity to beyond several years (The website didnt have an infinite feature... odd), then you made it so that it could access the internet at all times. Lastly, you transformed an old pie wrapper into thick leather case and strap which you then slotted the Ipod into, which fitted snugly attached to your arm. If anyone looked, they'd see an Ipod strapped to your left arm. Perfectly safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting back onto your motorbike, you zoomed out of the house (Locking it up prior to driving, obviously) and down the street to the market's which you could see had already started, down near the bay. If there was a breeze in the air, you couldnt feel it against your law-breaking speed. Stopping in the parking lot, you turned the bike off and headed into the markets. There were hundreds of things you could do here and money wasnt really an object anymore. Except buying things wasnt really what you were into - makin' some reality changes WAS...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScanning the initial crowd at the edge of the markets didn't reveal anything interesting, so you decided to push forward through the throng of people and head inwards, to the centre, where there would be more people and more opportunities. Hey, maybe you'd even change yourself here if you found something you liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the centre, you once again looked around and found the perfect target for the start. Before you made any changes though, you felt like causing some chaos - some chaos on a front-page news worthy chaos level. So you modified the settings for your user on the website, making it so that when you made changes, people would be aware, even more so if it happened to them personally. Anyway, onto chaos creation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA young couple across the path were making out, her long curly brown hair covering the side of her face against his black hair. Obviously both of them were rich, considering the clothing against what some of the vendors were selling. As a mediocre change, you switched their minds - and while nobody in the crowd noticed the change immediately, the girl suddenly became extremely aware of the lack of breasts, and the guy became very aware of his now extremely femmine hands. The couple broke their kiss in surprise and looked at their original bodies in surprise. Unable to take the shock, the guy (In the girls body) fainted almost immediately, his partner only just managing to catch him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was so frozen in fear at swapping bodies with her boyfriend that you decided to leave them as is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking further through the market, you came across a mother and her highly intelligent teenage daughter. While her mother was an extremely ditzy blonde and the young girl appeared extremely intelligent, nobody would have made a family connection if not for the similair faces.<br>\r\n\"Mum! Why can't I get this pad? Mathematics requires a 4mm grid workbook!\" She complained.<br>\r\n\"Because <i>dear,</i> I came for a beauty makeup. Now drop the book because you I wont let you buy it.\" Her mother replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was almost too much for you. Vigoursly typing into your Ipod, you immediately switched a couple of the life roles with the two woman. The daughter immediately became the one in charge with the money and the life plans while her mother became an idiotic beauty obsesed complainer who never had money because she always wasted it or lost it. You left the group chuckling slightly.</span></div></div>",

Ultimately, nothing really looked that interesting, just bits and baubles for the easily impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you had slowed down immensely. You had noticed that two men with black hoodies had been tailing you for a while now. The first time you remember seeing them was just before the mother and daughter. Either way, their stalking techniques were pretty bad. Having become irritably bored with the market stalls, you left the market, hopped on your motorbike and headed home, very well aware of the two men in the car now tailing you at an extreme distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhoever these hoodlums were, they didnt seem like the usual riffraff. Locking up the garage door, you waited in your bedroom for the oncoming door knock. Five minutes later, you saw the car lights appear outside the front of your small house. The lights dissappeared and two car doors slammed. Then, footsteps, slowly approaching the house. The men were cautious, afraid almost. Since your bedroom was on the road seeing side of the house, you observed them walk up. The taller man seemed hesitant to ring the bell, almost as if he knew he could be removed from reality at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorbell rang. Getting off from your bed, you walked out to the front door but before you opened it, you asked a simple question: \"Who is it to come knocking on my door so late at night?\"<br>\r\n\"Potential work clients\" The answer was, after a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened the door slowly, almost ready to punch their faces if they tried anything.<br>\r\n\"I am Kane and this is Joe. May we enter?\"<br>\r\n\"Why?\" You asked, raising an eyebrow. Anyone would ask that at this time of night.<br>\r\n\"Because, we have something to offer you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stepped out of the way and gestured for them to come in. They walked to the otherside of the dining table but didnt sit down.<br>\r\n\"So, this 'offer' of yours\" You said. \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n\"Purpose\" Kane said. You rolled your eyes, uninterested. He observed that well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are aware of your device, '<i>Tom</i>'. The device which allows you to physically alter the world around you. My associates would like your assistance in a few political matters\" Joe said. It was evident that they actually knew very little of the <i>device.</i> Considering all your power actually stemmed from a website and that you could alter more than just physical things.<br>\r\n\"I'm listening\" You said slowly.<br>\r\n\"You have had the device for only a short while and yet you demonstrate extreme understanding of its power. Yet this power may one day bore you - as there is no goal you cannot achieve without having to push a few simple buttons. We wish to give you a purpose by assisting us with your power\"</span></div></div>",

Typing into your Ipod, the mans head suddenly sucked itself down into his body, yet everyone continued on as if nothing had happened. He still looked at the various stalls, apparently uninterested in most things, while his girlfriend spent ages looking at all the different cheap jewellery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorking a little more crazy this time, you typed into the Ipod again. This time, the girl suddenly ripped her own head off and stuck it on the guys head, again noticing nothing.<br>\r\nThe guy was still walking around as himself, doing his own things, although the girls head was still her own, on his body. Thus, making the girl headless and still walking around happily.<br>\r\nYou almost fell over laughing at how silly the scene looked. Deciding to keep it that way, you moved on. Reaching the edge of the market, you turned around and headed back inside once more, your heels clicking on the pavement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpying a woman with shoulder length black hair, you typed into the Ipod again. All of a sudden, her legs and hips dissappeared and were replaced by the body of a black stallion. Her hooves clicked on the path as she walked, yet nobody had any problem with the fact that an actual, real life centaur had appeared out of nowhere.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sitting down in front of your computer, you wondered what it would be like to enter the internet - literally and physically. Logging onto the website, you began typing into your Ipod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'I want to have a button strapped to my other arm in a similiar fashion to how my ipod is now. When I press it, I can go into the realm of the internet and when I press it again, I can leave'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe website took a considerable amount of time to process that request, but sure enough, a small red button on a strap appeared on your left arm. Keen to see what would happen, you pressed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, there was a whirl of colours as you felt like your entire body - correction, your smoking hot body -  was pulled into the computer screen and into the electronic circutry.<br>\r\nAwakening, you found yourself lying on what looked like a large metal electronic tube, with hundreds of blury objects flying at crazy speeds just above you. Lights flashed and glowed everywhere and there was an odd sense of complete cleanliness here. A wall terminal beside a door was to your left so you walked over to it, notcing the echo in your steps, and attempted to use it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Computer Name: Athena's Computer\"<br>\r\n\"IP: 192.123.4.567\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"REQUEST ENTRY\" was higlighted in a flashing red button, as if you could press it. For the sake of it, you tried pushing it. The button depressed itself and the door opened.<br>\r\nCurious as to what was inside, you were about to walk in when a large object flew up in front of you.<br>\r\n\"HALT\" It said mechanically. <br>\r\n\"ENTRY REQUEST DENIED<br>\r\nSUBJECT IDENTIFY\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SUBJECT IDENTIFY OR FACE IMMEDIATE DELETION\"<br>\r\n\"I am Athena\" You said. You looked closer at the object and suddenly realised that it was your own virus scanner that you had installed on your computer. This was amazing\"<br>\r\n\"SUBJECT UNKNOWN CLASSIFICATION. IDENTIFY CLASSIFICATION\"<br>\r\n\"I am a user\"<br>\r\n\"SUBJECT CLASSIFICATION DEEMED UNSAFE. LEAVE DEVICE IMMEDIATELY OR FACE DELETION\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stepped back, seeing numerous objects sprout from the wall behind your virus scanner. Assuming that it was whatever it used to remove what it considered a virus, you let the scanner close the door and you let out a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n'Well, that was interesting' You thought. Looking up, the stream of strange and unfamiliar objects travelling at super speed continued. Doing your best to make out what they were, the best you could see was what looked like emails, photos and videos. There was a large number of others, but it didnt make any sense to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWondering if the objects were solid (Whatever counts for solid inside the internet), you reached out your hand and jumped up. Something hit it and your hand, with your body, was sent smashed to the ground a few meters in front. Thankgoodness for making yourself invincible or you probably would have lost your hand entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if I could get on one of those\" You said quietly, rubbing your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, out the door to your computer, a small rectangular device appeared. Staying out of view of the other side of the door, you snuck up to it while it hovered a few feet off the ground.<br>\r\nThe object had a marking on it.<br>\r\n\"DESIGNATION: SCANTEC SERVER\"<br>\r\n\"SCAN RESULT: SUCCESSFUL\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe object was your virus scanners results from your computer. It slowly started to move away and you quickly jumped on top of it, clinging for dear life. The parcel rose to the rest of the crowd and shot off incredibly quickly. It sailed at the top of the tube, barely tilting with your weight. Once you had reached the speed of the other objects, you thought that it might be best to jump to something else before you entered Scantec's servers which was probably more locked down that the Alamo in terms of virus security.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiming your jump carefully, you jumped off the parcel onto what looked like a giant envelope.</span></div></div>",

The tube was the same size as the one before, so you werent too worried about bumping your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tube levelled out and the crate suddenly started to get faster and faster and faster - at least six times the speed of when you saw the other objects above you when you entered the internet. A logo rushed past you, but you didn't get a chance to read it becuase you were going so fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, you saw the tunnel end in an all too familiar white light. Rushing into it, you suddenly felt disorientated and nearly passed out.<br>\r\nThe white suddenly faded and you crashed to the ground, sand inside a trench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully checking for broken or bruised bones, you stood up and looked at your surroundings. This place was all too familiar, yet you couldn't place it yet. Climbing a rusty ladder, you saw a massive metal blast door suddenly start lowering and a red flashing light appeared. An alarm was sounding. You didn't know what was going on, but if you were correct, you didn't want to be outside in the next thirty seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiving underneath the closing door, you hid in a dark corner of the room. The door closed and you heard a noise that sounded like several missiles going off. Then explosions.<br>\r\nNow you realised where you were, you had somehow entered a multiplayer map in Half Life Two: Deathmatch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alarm stopped and the door started to raise again. Walking outside, you saw several dead rebel bodies in the trench. Suddenly, heavy boots behind you and the sound of gunfire.<br>\r\nHowever, you invulnerability prevented any damage to your body. The combine soldier player kept firing and then stopped, as if he was confused. You looked at him and smiled. Whoever was on the other end of that controller was probably incredibly confused.<br>\r\nHe walked up to you and then pulled out a stun baton, eager to try it. Repeated attempts at hitting you achieved nothing. The player stopped, backed up and then, obviously bored at what this glitch apparently was, ran away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing to the other side of the trench, you entered a small building.<br>\r\n\"Got a microphone?\" You asked. The rebel soldier you found turned to you.<br>\r\n\"Are you the new model? Your hot\" The player asked, the mouth disjointed in it's movement.<br>\r\n\"Not really, just call me backup. Got a spare gun?\"<br>\r\n\"Are you hacking?\" He asked. \"How did you do that?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm not hacking\"<br>\r\n\"Whatever\"<br>\r\n\"Give me a gun\"<br>\r\n\"Can't drop guns\"<br>\r\n\"Then where's a spare one\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rebel pointed his gun at a locker and sure enough, there was a pistol inside it. Picking it up, you checked the ammo clip, still full.<br>\r\n\"Thanks. So, whats the score?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm not helping a hacker. I'll get in trouble\"<br>\r\n\"I'm not bloody hacking!\" You yelled. The rebel soldier ran off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked out of the room and spied an enemy soldier across the trench. Pointing the gun, you unleashed the full clip and he fell to the ground before he had a chance to retaliate. A string of swearwords soon followed from his dead body.<br>\r\n\"Seriously... Too easy\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing that your clip was now empty, you pulled it out. Without any idea of how to actually reload, you just put it back in. Sure enough, you somehow had a full clip again. A battle had started on the far side of the map so you hurried over there and quickly shot all the enemies down.<br>\r\n\"Hey, your good!\" Another rebel said, a female.<br>\r\n\"Thanks\" You said.<br>\r\n\"Are you the new skin?\" She asked.<br>\r\n\"No\" You said, for the second time.<br>\r\n\"This server doesnt have custom skins. Are you-\"<br>\r\n\"If you ask if I am hacking, I'll rip your head off and shove it down your bloodstained body. No, I am not hacking\"<br>\r\nThe emotionless face of the rebel was silent for a while<br>\r\n\"You should take their gun\" She said, walking up to it and looking at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up the Combine Soldier's rifle, you reloaded the clip again (Magically, somehow) and proceeded inside the building. All of the soldiers had respawned again and you quickly threw a grenade in that you had picked up. They all exploded except for a lucky one who you mowed down with the rifle. Another string of swearwords followed, except also with the words \"Hacker!\" in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two rebels appeared behind you.<br>\r\n\"How did you do that?\" The girl asked.<br>\r\n\"I threw a grenade\"<br>\r\n\"But you didn't die\" She said.<br>\r\n\"Hacker\" The guy said. You turned and shot him. He'd respawn.</span></div></div>",

That was probably going to become quite an important thing in the oncoming days.<br>\r\n\"So whats your name?\" You asked. She turned to you.<br>\r\n\"Jennifer Hale\" She said.<br>\r\n\"I'm Athena\" You said. She seemed surprised.<br>\r\n\"Strong name for a strong woman\" She replied. You grinned.<br>\r\n\"Nice isn't it? Ready to go?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grabbed her arm and then jumped onto a slow, low flying dark grey crate. It started speeding up as it rose higher through the mass.<br>\r\n\"So where does this lead?\" Jennifer asked over the noise of the movement.<br>\r\n\"No idea. Should be fun though, randomness was how I ended up in that game we were in\"<br>\r\n\"Seriously? Because at the moment I'm pretty sure that I am hallucinating this, or I'm dreaming it all\"<br>\r\n\"It's all real\" You said, sitting on the crate. Jennifer shaked her head, it was alot to take in.<br>\r\n\"And this device here? It's how I do everything that I can do\" You said, pointing to your Ipod firmly attached to your arm.<br>\r\n\"And the red button?\" Jennifer asked, pointing to your other arm.<br>\r\n\"Let's me leave the internet, though where we will end up I don't know\"<br>\r\n\"Isn't that dangerous? What if we suddenly reappear on the other side of the planet?\"<br>\r\n\"You opted to come on this adventure\" You laughed.<br>\r\n\"I thought I was dreaming\"<br>\r\n\"Well, we all make life changing decisions every day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mass of information started to split off into different, smaller tubes. This was some sort of junction you had arrived at. Hundreds of different tubes spanned all through a massive room, each going to places you knew not of.<br>\r\n\"So where are we going?\" Jennifer asked again.<br>\r\n\"No idea\" You said again. \"But I'd advise that we hang on tight\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour words were perfectly on the mark. The crate you sat upon suddenly seperated from the larger mass and headed into a tube above you, suddenly going extremely fast - much faster than when you had entered the game of Half Life Two: Deathmatch. The speed increased and you noticed a multitude of seperating tubes around you, though your own crate stayed it's course, going straight ahead. The glowing lights of the tube around you slowly started to dim and eventually you and Jennifer were bathed in complete blackness. The only senses working for you two were the feeling of your hands gripping the fast moving crate and the wind (Which somehow exists here) rushing past your faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crate began to slow down and you entered a very unfamiliar place. There were very few objects passing through here and looking down, there was a multitude of broken and destroyed objects below you. This looked like some sort of electronic dumping ground. Up ahead, some crates were being sent through what looked like a scanner. While the field they passed through mostly went green, allowing them to continue, the odd one or two went red, which resulted in the object immediately falling to the floor and no longer moving.<br>\r\n\"Damn. This could be a problem\" You murmured.<br>\r\n\"That thing is safe, right?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't even know what that thing is so I can't really answer that\" You said. \"But I get the feeling that we aren't exactly on the party list of entrants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, when your crate went through, the field turned red and your crate was suddenly sent plummeting to the floor.<br>\r\nUpon impact, you and Jennifer were sent sprawling over the wreckage of many other discarded emails, crates and unrecognizeable objects.<br>\r\n\"So what now?\"<br>\r\n\"You sure ask alot of questions\" You said, pulling on Jennifer's hand and helping her up.<br>\r\n\"I'm new to this\"<br>\r\n\"So am I\" You laughed. \"Maybe this is the time to exit the internet\"<br>\r\n\"Yea, maybe\"<br>\r\nYou took Jennifer's hand and pushed the red button.</span></div></div>",

Even if she didn't hurt herself, hunger and thirst would eventually build up and that might be a problem. Then she'd have to rest and sleep and do normal people things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Normal People Things...</i> The three words stuck in your mind as if it didn't sound right, sounded disconnected to you. Since the inception of this website into your life, you were probably further than normal for most people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we get out of here? I'm getting a little scared\" Jennifer said.<br>\r\n\"It is indeed a problem that we can't leave. So I'm going to have to modify your body a little bit\"<br>\r\n\"WHAT?\" She asked in surprise. \"How so?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, just some general internal modifications... You won't notice a thing... yet\" You said, waving her off. Jennifer peered over your shoulder as you sat down on a broken folder and began working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, you increased the strength of Jennifer dramatically, but also made a note that she lost all her boost when coming up against you. Then you made it so that she would never tire, or need to eat and drink. That would sort her out for a while.<br>\r\n\"This might take a while. Let's start walking\" You said, standing up as you finished. The changes were instantaneous. At least that still worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of you trudged through the wasteland of broken internet stuff. The occasional crate flew above you but nothing substantial enough to get you out. Besides, plenty of things were coming in, but barely anything was leaving. After what felt like three hours, you reached the edge of this chamber, the glowing lights much dimmer in the walls than when you had first entered the internet.<br>\r\n\"So, what, are we going to climb up or something?\" Jennifer asked behind you.<br>\r\n\"Something like that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyping into your Ipod, you modified your own hands and feet to make it so that they could grip firmly to any surface. Then, you pulled your high heels off. They wouldn't help you in this situation. Jennifer picked them up for you.<br>\r\n\"Climb on my back, don't let you\" You instructed. Jennifer did as she was told, although you barely felt her weight, as if she was nothing but a pencil. Your strength was indeed great.<br>\r\nTesting the grip on the flat of your hands, you were surprised to see how easily you could simply stick to the wall at will. Starting slowly but moving faster, you began to climb up the wall using your hands and your feet. It was difficult at first but you quickly adapted to this new style of movement. Eventually, you looked down, discovering yourself many meters above the ground.<br>\r\n\"Don't look down\" You said, making one last climb and hauling yourself and Jennifer into the tube you had last come out of.<br>\r\n\"We can't get on these ones\" Jennifer said. \"They'll just take us through that device again and we'll be dropped to the ground again\"<br>\r\n\"I have an idea\"<br>\r\n\"Okay\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had Jennifer listen for the sound of an oncoming crate and you flexed your hand. Timing yourself carefully, Jennifer nodded when she heard it in the distance. As soon as it was upon you, you punched it with all the force your enhanced body could afford.<br>\r\nThe crate flexed and shattered into pieces, aside from a small device you hadn't seen before.<br>\r\n\"Whats this?\" Jennifer asked, picking it up.<br>\r\n\"Our ticket out of here\" You said, handling it. The small device was circular with a small rectangular block on it's side with ten small unmarked buttons. In the centre of the circle was a blue that flashed slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking Jennifer's hand, you hoped for the best and pushed down on the light. Your theory was correct, this was what made everything here moved. The device, still in your hand, shot away down the other end of the tube, back from where you had come. Since it had no longer had a destination, it's movement was determined by where you aimed it, something that would probably have made for the most dangerous carnival ride in the history of the universe, considering your speed at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you diverted from your tube and down another one, feeling like exploring a bit more before you left the internet. This tube glowed alot more brightly than any one you had seen before, except only five minutes later, you approached a dead-end. There were no moving objects in this large tube, only an end. There was a large door in the wall you could try and go through, or perhaps now you could try leaving the internet with Jennifer.</span></div></div>",

Except, now you were somewhere else. In a back alley. In an unfamiliar place.<br>\r\n\"This isn't where I started\" Jennifer said. \"I don't recognise this place\"<br>\r\n\"Nor I\" You murmured. Walking out from the alley to the dimly lit road, you looked around. Off in the distance, a well known greenish statue stood watch over the water, a great torch in it's hand and a crown on it's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're in New York\" You laughed. Quite literally, the other side of the United States of America.<br>\r\n\"We're so far from my home!

I'll make it up as I go\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. Sounds good. Wait, you can modify bodies, right?\" Jennifer asked.<br>\r\n\"Yes\"<br>\r\n\"Can you make me a physical clone of you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question astounded you. Jennifer wanted to look exactly like you, for reasons that were partially obvious. Since you were smoking hot, that was easy, but there wasnt anything too bad with her body.<br>\r\n\"Why?

The changes in Jennifer became apparent immediately as she rose in height and her clothes suddenly reformed into yours. Her hair shortened to the exact same length as yours and it kept it's shiny black colour. Jennifer's height increased yet again as her plain brown shoes reformed into black highheels. Her face bubbled and rippled until it reformed into yours and her breasts gained a few sizes.<br>\r\nLastly, Jennifers eyes changed to the same deep shade of red as yours. If anyone looked at you two, it would be practically impossible for them to tell you apart, as even her voice had changed. The only thing she didn't have was a copy of your Ipod or the internet entering button which you also got rid of on yourself as you had no interest at the moment in returning to the internet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, this is amazing!\" Jennifer said, now looking at her attractive, athletic body.<br>\r\n\"'Course it's amazing\" You said. 'It's my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer continued to look over all the angles of her body, admiring the phyisque you 'maintained'.<br>\r\n\"Except I'd rather we make a few changes\" You said. \"So that I'm not constantly looking directly at myself.\"<br>\r\n\"Like what sort of changes?\" Jennifer asked. \"If anything, I don't mind if I keep my old face and a different set of clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did just that, changing Jennifer's face back to her own, except making a few touchups. Then you dealt with her clothing, turning the top into a dark green tanktop with short sleeves and turning her short black dress into leather pants.<br>\r\n\"Hows that?\" You asked. Jennifer was shocked. Evidently she loved it.<br>\r\n\"Thank you thank you thank you!\" She yelled happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you enjoyed it. So, want to take a walk?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" Jennifer said eagerly. She was keen to get used to walking in her new form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of you walked on the footpath beside the water. The fresh ocean air wafting across you inbetween the smog of the city. It was a mix of greatness and minor disgust. This was actually your first time in New York. Spying a still open pizzeria, you both opted to go inside and have some food. After having a whole two pizza's to herself, it was at this point that Jennifer realised that she still wasnt full.<br>\r\n\"I don't get it. I could still eat just as much\" She said, rather confused.<br>\r\n\"Remember when I said I was making some changes back down in the wasteland in the internet?\" You said. \"You don't need to eat or drink to survive anymore, let alone sleep. While you can still do these things if you want, your not impared by it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer looked at you, almost ready to disbelieve you if it wasnt for the adventure you had already been on. You picked up your glass of soda and poured the whole drink down your throat in one go. You could probably do the same with some beer, but for some reason your new body didn't seem to like the taste. Odd, it was something you might want to fix later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this is all great and everything, but I'm not sure how we can pay for all this. We don't exactly have any cash on us\" Jennifer said. \"My purse is back home\"<br>\r\nJennifer was right, you had no money.</span></div></div>",

Jennifer's entire clothing dissolved into the goo you and was replaced by the clothing you had worn, the white business shirt shortened to show your - now her - midriff and the short black skirt. Jennifer's highheels remained the same as they had been though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling was werid. You had completely assimilated Jennifer's clothing and had become it. Now, you didn't have any sort of limbs or body parts that you could actively move. The website was a world away now as you saw everything with 360 degrees of vision. You felt your 'body' wrapped around Jennifer tightly and she seemed to feel it to. You felt warm and well fitted, comfortable in your current position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer had looked 'you' over. All the clothing had rebranded itself to being the \"Athena\" brand. A one of a kind with no other available in the world. The clothing sure did wonders for her looks as you looked up at Jennifer. She definately seemed content with the clothes.<br>\r\nIt was at this point that you noticed that you could stimulate the senses of Jennifer, making her feel more and more relaxed and comfortable while wearing you. In fact she was beginning to feel so comfortable that you became slightly worried that she might pass out from excessive comfort, if that was even possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer started walking down the street, admiring her new outfit and looking at all the various closed shops along the footpath.

Her bust presses forward, swelling larger, it is crushed between the lapels of her jacket. But only briefly, as the jacket transforms in it's turn. The simple, elegant pin-stripe, pulling back becoming less functional and more decorative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't look like it was ever made to button closed. Dana tugs at it, confusion on her face, until with a shrug she surrenders to the obvious, it's not made to close. Her hands run over it, she giggled to herself, it doesn't even have fasteners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore your eyes, her blouse softens, the buttons merging into the fabric, until it becomes a plain white T-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rather immodest one for an office girl, as you can see the outline of her bra through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a more considered look, you see that overall she looks a lot less professional. Although very pretty, she no longer looks like a Network Operator, <i>senior </i>or <i>junior</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks more like Dave's favourite, a bubbly office junior, a temp, easily impressed by her bosses and colleagues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, her bust reveals it's true dimensions. The bra distorting the thin T-shirt, transferring the intricate stitching, and the abundant D-cup breasts it restrains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head, as you can now see the colour of her areola, as she belated realises her display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer cheeks redden, as she once again tries to pull at her abbreviated jacket to hide her bust. When that fails, she tugs her skirt lower, pulling the hem to hide more of her ripe, round thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skirt's professionalism is also a distant memory, the plain, pin-stripe now replaced with a figure hugging Lycra, in a powder grey. It clings to every contour. Pulling herself closer to her computer, she pauses to admire her inch-long nails, like crimson claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt'll be a miracle if she can type with those things.

And look how you turned out. Deciding that there were some far more interesting things to look into, you left Level 24 and headed for the building complex's cafeteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the fact that eating was now complete unneccecary, that didn't remove your ability to eat. Ordering a simple ham sandwich with some hot chips, you sat down at a table at the edge of the large room and began eating, casually watching people come, go and eat. Suddenly, there was a figure beside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit, looks like I lose the bet\" Said Jack, a software engineer from your same building. He put his tray down on your table and sat down opposite you.<br>\r\n\"And what bet is that?\" You asked, swallowing a mouthful.<br>\r\n\"This is the first time that anyone has seen you eat this year. Dave and I had a bet that you never eat at all\" He said, cutting through his fish.<br>\r\n\"Oh?\"<br>\r\n\"And I betted that you didn't eat... at all\"<br>\r\n\"Did you ever consider the fact that I might just eat alot at home?\" You asked.<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding? A woman like you honestly looks like you don't eat much at all\" Jack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know if that was a compliment or an insinuation that you were annorexic, but you decided to let it pass - this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe I'm just a lucky girl\"<br>\r\n\"Yea, a lucky girl who's been moved up to level 24\" Jack said, smiling lightly.<br>\r\n\"Wow, news travels fast\" You said in surprise. You didn't really expect many people to know that information yet. Not that it was important.<br>\r\n\"Dave told me. Also mentioned something about being turned into a girl, but I forget what\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rolled your eyes, good 'ol Dave.<br>\r\n\"What else did he tell you?\"<br>\r\n\"A very odd reason for <i>why</i> you got moved upstairs\"<br>\r\n\"Mhm?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't think I can say\"<br>\r\n\"Come on...\" You said, almost trying to drag the information out of him. Jack leaned in closer.<br>\r\n\"Because your a woman\" He whispered.<br>\r\nYou sat back and burst out laughing. This was becoming an almost rediculous statement, but it was actually pretty much true. People looked around at you for a second and then lost interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what would YOU do if you were a woman for a day?\" You asked Jack. Turning Jack into a woman was going to be far more interesting than turning Dave into a woman. Jack might be just a little bit more level headed about it.<br>\r\n\"I have no idea. Considering the fact that I wouldnt be able to work here at all because nobody would recognise me\"<br>\r\n\"Well, let's not consider whether or not people will recognise you\"<br>\r\n\"I'd certainly find it an interesting experience\"</span></div></div>",

Sure enough, 5pm came around so you shut the computer down and headed for the elevator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it slowly moved down the floors, it gradually became fuller and fuller, until everyone slowly filed out into the carpark. Situated roughly in the middle, your old red toyota corolla sat there. Of course, now you had the ability to have something a little nicer.<br>\r\nPulling out your Ipad, you loaded up the website and targeted your car. Along one panel, several recommended transformation options appeared, but you were hardly interested in those options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrolling through the list of possible vehicle transformations, you eventually settled on turning it into a red Ducati. Your vehicle quickly contorted itself and reshaped into the motorbike.<br>\r\nDue to your inhuman strength, you decided to ignore the helmet which had also appeared, using the website to delete it. Pulling out of the carpark, there were a few idle stares from other people as they wondered why you were riding without a helmet, or even the proper clothing at all. Accelerating, you headed onto the main highway and passed through the busy shops, a few of which were preparing for the night time section of business in this city, which often never stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly twenty minutes later, you arrived home, safe and sound. <i>'Sheesh, that was quick'</i> You thought.<br>\r\nParking the motorbike in the underground carpark, you headed for the elevator and went up six levels in the apartment complex. Owning an apartment here had been much cheaper than owning a full house. Especially since you had no girlfriend or wife, it basically made a single bedroom really nice. Unlocking the door, you headed inside and threw your bag onto a chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even considering dinner, you booted up your computer and logged back into the website, keen to mess around with Jack's form for tomorrow.<br>\r\nThe website apparently had a \"blank slate\" option, in which you could freely create or modify a person without actually modifying them in reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to build the female model, adding dark brown hair, hazel eyes and a well shaped face. Then you made a few modifications to the lips, eye and nose shape.<br>\r\nMoving downwards, you began to work on the body, giving it a very light tan and an overall figure that was comparable to yours. The bodies height was about a head shorter than you, though slightly above the average person.<br>\r\nFinally, you saved the template and brought up Jack's profile. Loading up the systematic events tab, you discovered everything that he had planned for tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Dinner<br>\r\n- Watch TV for two hours<br>\r\n- Get changed for bed<br>\r\n- Sleep till 6am (Next Day)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a fairly simple system to work with. You created a new event directly between when Dave would go to sleep and when he would wake up. His body would change at roughly 3am and he wouldnt feel a thing. You also took the liberty of making some appropriate clothes appear at the end of his bed and a convenient note would appear at his bedside table which explained everything he needed to know.<br>\r\nLastly, you brought up the companys profile on the website and started typing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Jack will be sick from work due to unexplained but completely acceptable reasons. For the duration of the day, he will be replaced by a girl called Janette, who is perfectly capable of completing all his work'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe website started working and a few seconds later, gave the thumbs up that everything had been done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter having surfed the web and played several games, you realised that the time was now 6am so after having a brisk shower, you got changed into a white midriff shirt with a sleeveless leather jacket and a black business skirt. Thank goodness for the extremely open attire rules that you had to adhere to at work. Jack hadn't contacted you yet but hopefully everything was going okay. Going onto the website to see how he was doing was very tempting, but you thought that it would be a nice surprise to see it in full view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grabbed your bag, went down the elevator and hopped onto your Ducati, zooming out of the carpark onto the road. This time you approached work even faster, as you were now more used to the excessive speed of the motorbike. Parking in the carpark, there was another blank stare as you rode without a helmet. Still, at least it was fun.<br>\r\nYou boarded the elevator, only two other unknown people on board, and headed up to your cubicle on level 24. Walking out, you were almost prepared to get more stares due to your attire but then remembered the fact that there were only about five or six other people on this entire floor, including the floor manager who was still somehow asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down at your desk, you began to work on some projects that had appeared overnight.</span></div></div>",

Picking it up, you discover that it's from Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'I'm in the carpark'</i> Was all the message said.<br>\r\n<i>'Okay?'</i> You replied. There was a two minute pause.<br>\r\n<i>'Can you come down here?'</i> Jack asked.<br>\r\n<i>'On my way... You alright?'</i> You replied again. Jack didn't respond so you headed for the elevator and went down to the carpark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou already knew what Jack's car looked like, so it was a simple matter of finding it and going up to the drivers window. Interestingly, however, rather than there being a man in his early thirties, there was a young woman with long dark brown hair tied back in a pony tail. Jack, or \"Janette\", winded the window down.<br>\r\n\"Athena?\" She asked.<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n\"What happened to me?\"<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" You asked, jokingly.<br>\r\n\"You won't believe me, but it's actually me, Jack. We were talking yesterday in the cafeteria.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's okay. I'm messing with you, I know who you are\" You said, going round to the other side, opening the door and sitting in the passenger seat.<br>\r\n\"What happened to me?\" Jack asked again.<br>\r\n\"Well, I can only guess it had something to do with our conversation yesterday\"<br>\r\n\"What?\" He asked, confused. You stared at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you do this?\" He asked, looking at you.<br>\r\n\"I may have had a small part in it, yes\" You said nonchalantly.<br>\r\n\"What the hell!\" She said.<br>\r\n\"Relax. It'll only last for the rest of the day and then you'll be back to your good 'ol self again. I see you took the clothes I gave you\"<br>\r\n\"These are yours?\" He asked, picking at the white hoodie.<br>\r\n\"Not really... Don't worry. Just go do your work as normal and nobody will care\"<br>\r\n\"I can't just walk in\"<br>\r\n\"I fixed that, yes you can\"<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n\"I dare you to try\" You said, smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanette got out of the car and you followed suite.<br>\r\n\"Thank goodness that I don't have anything important on today then\" Janette said, locking the car and walking with you to the elevator.<br>\r\n\"Mhm, lucky indeed. Nobody is going to recognise you here, but a few people know that your filling in for your male self today\"<br>\r\n\"They know that you transformed me?\" She asked, surprised.<br>\r\n\"No, they just know that a girl called Janette is filling in for Jack today\"<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to get used to that name\" Janette said.<br>\r\n\"Hm, I got used to mine\" You said, walking out of the elevator, leaving Jack extremely surprised and wondering what the heck that was supposed to mean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you settled Janette at her cubicle, you then headed back to the elevator, passing Gina in the aisle, who didn't notice whatsoever that there was an almost exact, yet more attractive, duplicate of hers walking past. Once you had settled back in your own cubicle, another message came through on your phone requesting your networking expertise at a meeting some floors down. Once again, you boarded the elevator and went down to level 15.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a particular level that you had never been to before, mostly due to the fact that you never had a reason for ever going here. Yet, here you were, coming to a meeting. The meeting room was apparently down the far end, so you walked through the cubicles, noticing the stares from many people as they had never seen someone like you before. While the woman didn't really seem to care (Or they didn't show it), the men seemed more open to prying than anyone else had been on level 23.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knocked on the door and it opened for you.<br>\r\n\"Ah! Athena, thanks for coming\" A man in a suit said. You didn't recognise anyone here but took a seat down the far end of the table.<br>\r\n\"We were just going over some implementation strategies for getting some radio towers operating at high altitude\" He said, giving you some documents.<br>\r\nIt was fairly rudamentary stuff which was probably going to be easy to work on.<br>\r\n\"However, we don't know the most effective way of running cables up the mountains to the towers.\" He said. \"Any ideas you have, we would be very open to hearing about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went over the documents and the topographical maps, using a pen to mark the best points for each section of cable.<br>\r\n\"There, done\" You said, after about five minutes. \"Use some fiberoptic cabling to get them up there, as you'll need less booster units in order to maintain a clear signal\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The website settings had been set to making it so that people were unaware of changes, which basically meant that you could do anything you wanted without consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirstly, you targeted the man who had called you in here, his name apparently being Terrence Workman. Going into the physical aspects menu, you transformed his entire body in that of a large ape. As his skin started to turn black and hairy, you noticed that his clothes vastly changed to accomodate his increased size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the two woman on the side looking over a document together, you merged both of their bodies, making them share a single body with two heads side by side.

Yet \"her\" clothes automatically adjusted to allowing for two necks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you targeted the man opposite them, who had not taken any interest in the meeting at all.

Her head suddenly began to sink right down into her body, hair and everything, leaving nothing but a skin covered neck stump. Despite this however, she happily stood there waiting for Terrence to finish reading whatever it was she had handed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to try something a little new, you set a timer for this next transformation, making it only last ten minutes before reverting yourself back to normal and returning you to your cubicle.<br>\r\nUnaware of her actions, Miranda came over to you, picked you up by your head and put your head down on her neck stump. When you were lifted, your entire body was sucked into your head, leaving you as a bodiless woman who's head was attached, but not in control, of another woman. Meanwhile, everyone continued with what they were doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda took the document and left the room, then entered the elevator and went down to level 12 where she returned to her own cubicle and started doing some filing. The experience was uncanny, Miranda seemed to find it normal that she had no head, and that there was another person's head attached where her own would be. You find the trip quite enjoyable, as you \"laid\" back and enjoyed the ride. Your head felt like it was properly attached though, so you didn't need to worry about rolling away or anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, ten minutes was quickly up and the website reverted you back to your own body, in your own cubicle up several levels, with the Ipad safely in hand...</span></div></div>",

Going into the \"Body\" section, you completely removed it, leaving you as just a head. However, before you made the physical changes, you utilized the website to sprout six light red two meter tentacles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe changes were almost instantaneous, and you felt your own body being sucked into your head as your vision began to lower to the ground. Then, only two seconds later, the tentacles began to sprout out from your head, flailing onto the ground as they grew.<br>\r\nControlling your new tentacles wasnt something that came easy. Previously, you had been accustomed to the usage of two arms and two legs, yet now you felt like you had an extra set to try and learn how to use. It took a while, but eventually you managed to gain control of each tentacle, and begin moving around the office floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody noticed you as they passed, so you quickly took the elevator down to level 23 by pushing the buttons with the squishy end of your tentacle. Still, nobody noticed you, it was as if you had completely dropped off the face of the earth as far as some people were concerned. You passed by Janettes cubicle, and she seemed to be doing alright, though you noticed that she was looking down more often than she did as a man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPassing by more cubicles, you latched onto someone's back and went for a joyride. Though you didn't recognise the man in question, the ride was brief and you quickly jumped over to another person going in the opposite direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this was interesting as first, you quickly found yourself becoming bored with this new body, longing for your female physique to return.</span></div></div>",

This feature is still in beta but it's nearly done and your welcome to test it out. You can transport as many people as you want to any location in the universe just by typing their names and then typing the location. Or, you can have the website randomly select people from the world based on your selected preferences. Mass Transportation can also be used to transport people to a previously uncreated world which you can also build by typing in the information to as much detail as you desire!</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Whoa, this could be awesome...\"</i> You thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rather sly thought entered your head and you wondered if it was possible. Checking the clock on your computer, you had a few hours before anything worthwhile was going to happen, so you began with the preferences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe website would randomly pick fifty thousand people from around the world based on several different requirements; They had to be<br>\r\n- Within an age range of 18 to 30<br>\r\n- Healthy<br>\r\n- Able to speak English<br>\r\n- Currently awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOtherwise, it was all up to chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you set out the parameters of your new world. This was going to be amazing. The entire process actually took over two hours, while you delicately fine tuned the parameters of your world. You had no idea if the website could actually do this, but here's hoping that it would be good. Finally, nearly three hours later, you txted Janette to come up to your cubicle. She arrived shortly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything's about to change\" You said with a sly smile. She tilted her head.<br>\r\n\"Does that mean I'll be changing back? Because this is just too werid\"<br>\r\n\"That's not all\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you said that, you pushed \"Apply\" on the website. A white light blinded you as the world melted into nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCold white stone beneath you was what you first felt when you awoke. Opening your eyes, Janette had turned back into Jack and was also only just waking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, there were hundreds - no, thousands of people around you, all slowly waking up and wondering what had happened. A short distance away, a figure floated down from the ceiling about a hundred meters above you and came to stand upon a podium about four hundred meters away. Everyone eventually came to their senses and began to ask what the heck had just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WELCOME CONTESTANTS!\" Boomed the voice. Male, deep voice. Everyone turned.<br>\r\nSeveral images flickered into view around the ancient looking stadium, giving a much better view of the man. He was pale with razor sharp short black hair and adorned in black armor with a multitude of engravings and patterns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have all been specially picked and transported from your world to take part in the greatest challenge yet to space humanity! In this world, you can rely only on your Geas, the device strapped to your arm! If you survive the terrors of this world, both inhuman and human, then you may eventually rise to be champion. Only when the great Demon Lord of Ozaharo is defeated can you return to your world! However, be warned. Death here means death on Earth!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a momentary stunned silence as the man rose back up into the ceiling. Then the entire crowd went into a mass panic. Jack turned to you.<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\" He asked, a mix of surprise and horror with a hint of interest.<br>\r\n\"Figured, why not\" You said, shrugging your shoulders and attempting to make yourself heard over the crowd. Everyone had been transported here in their usual attire, but without and belongings including watches, keys, wallets and the like. The only thing everyone owned now was the clothes they wore, and the unremovable device on their right arm (Though they could change the arm it was attached to if they wanted)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The smart people will be the one's who survive\" You say to Jack, leading him away from the panicing crowd and outside. You were standing on a large balcony, overlooking a massive forest down below.<br>\r\n\"Well, obviously. But I suspect the rules here are different\"<br>\r\n\"Indeed. You ever do much gaming before?\"<br>\r\n\"Yea, plenty... Why?\"<br>\r\n\"Health and Stamina. Both are equally important. Look at your device, red is health, green is stamina. If your stamina is low or gone, your tired. But it will come back. If your Health is low...\"<br>\r\n\"I think I get the picture\" He said, looking at his device.<br>\r\n\"These clothes won't provide much protection. We'll need to find something more effective\"<br>\r\n\"How? I mean, we can't just go and dig a mine, find some ore, smelt it and then make some armor... Can we?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, at the moment, no. But what we can do is go hunt in the forest. Food is equally important\"<br>\r\n\"Oh great\"<br>\r\n\"Yup\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's the plan?\"<br>\r\n\"This isn't a regular game.\" You explained. \"Assume the difficulty is on hard, well, 'insane' is a more realistic term. Poison is deadly, getting can kill, that sort of thing\"<br>\r\n\"Then we'll need to stick together.\" Jack said.<br>\r\n\"Yea, but the survivors of the first few days are gonna begin to band together. Some of the people here aren't exactly... Well... friendly\" You said.<br>\r\n\"You picked everyone?\" Jack asked in disbelief.<br>\r\n\"No, it was random. Aside from you and me.\" You said, turning to lean on the balcony railing and look into the crowd. \"Go in there, find someone who can't protect themselves or looks worthwhile and bring them to me\"<br>\r\n\"Why won't you do it?\" Jack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I built this world according to parameters, not hand for hand. I know what to expect, but I don't know the full layout. I need to work out what I have done\"<br>\r\nJack nodded and headed into the crowd.</span></div></div>",

However, you were correct in that they began to form into groups. The head usually being the person who had the biggest muscles. Bah. Muscle wasnt everything here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack came back shortly with three people, making your party five in total. He quickly introduced the young girl as Sasha, the bigger muscle rippling man as Frank and the very wiry boy called Simon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These two already seem to like you. But I will decide on whether or not to join you based on what you offer\" Frank said in a deep russian accent, folding his arms and refusing to come outside. It sounded fair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's the facts. People are very quickly going to form into groups. Though knowing human nature, it's likely the head honcho's will be the person with the thickest heads. I'm not the strongest person here (Well, that's was an obvious lie thanks to the website, but nobody knew that) but I can think. I want to survive this as honourably as possible. Now, maybe that means defeat, but I'd rather die knowing I did right than making everyone hate me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank stared down into your eyes, unmoving. \"Your group is small\" He said.<br>\r\n\"Thus making each mouth easier to feed and each person easier to keep track of. Would you rather keep track of one hundred people or just four?\" Jack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank nodded, smiling. \"I think I like you as well then. I shall be glad to lend my arm to you. What is your name?\"<br>\r\n\"Athena. And it's excellent you decided to join us.\" You said. \"I wouldnt be surprised if this place turns into a bloodbath soon. Let's get out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly found the main entrance and began heading down the massive steps into the forest.<br>\r\n\"Any idea what to expect?\" Sasha asked. \"I've played alotta games in the past and something tells me this forest isnt full of rabbits and foxes\"<br>\r\n\"What would you expect it to be full of?\" You asked.<br>\r\n\"Wolves... Trolls, balverines... Anything that might want to eat us.\"<br>\r\n\"Bandits?\" Frank asked.<br>\r\n\"The only bandits I think we will encounter will be other players\"<br>\r\n\"Then we must strike first, before they get the upper hand\" Simon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked for a full thirty minutes before anything happened. A few meters away, there was some rustling in some bushes, then a low growl. A small dark figure pounced onto Sasha, who squealed in surprise. Frank, however, was quick on the mark and smashed the ambushers head into a tree. The wolf fell to the ground, dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately, your group was surrounded by savage, starving wolves who jumped into the fray. Each one of you had at least three wolves to fight off alone, but Frank seemed to be taking most of them, kicking off at least ten.<br>\r\nYou concentrated on your own pack for now, giving them sharp kicks and punches where possible, sending them sprawling and dead. Sasha and Simon were struggling on their own, so you quickly jumped in and helped them. Frank, meanwhile, had dealt with his bunch and proceeded to help Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fight was over in a matter of minutes and everyone stopped to restore their stamina.<br>\r\n\"That was... interesting\" Simon said.<br>\r\n\"Pick up as many as you can. Let's find a clearing\"<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Jack asked.<br>\r\n\"Nobody's gonna pay for anything here with money. But we do have food and we can start a fire\"<br>\r\n\"My father taught me how to hunt wolves. I shall gut them\" Frank said in his almost arousing accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, you stumbled across a clearing and set down the dead wolves. Both you and Jack began to look for some good burnable wood while Frank happily tore into the wolves with his bare hands. Sasha looked away. Shortly after, the meat was roasting over the fire and Frank was busy doing something with the skins.<br>\r\n\"Is there any water nearby?\" He asked.<br>\r\n\"A river just down the hill there, not one minute away\" You said.<br>\r\n\"Come little one, I shall teach you\" Frank said, taking Sasha with him.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You werent actually expecting that.<br>\r\n\"Yea, only took a minute to happen\" She said. \"Should we take the rest of the skins and do it?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha handed her pieces of leather to you and took some more skins. You proceeded to lay them on the grass and think.<br>\r\n\"They just transformed... huh?\" Jack asked you in disbelief, obviously suspecting you of interfering.<br>\r\n\"It's a game, not reality as we know it\" You said. \"That being, I'm going to try something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ripped proceeded to move around the pieces of leather, ripping off a few pieces to turn into strips.

Jack put the vest over him and tightened the straps while you and Simon watched. It fitted him quite well.<br>\r\n\"I like it. Mind if I keep it?\" Jack asked.<br>\r\n\"Go ahead. I'll fashion some for everyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank and Sasha returned soon with more leather and you prepared the new vests for everyone. Unfortunately, there wasnt enough leather for everyone, so you decided to be nice and leave yourself out. <br>\r\n\"Hey, this is new\" Sasha said, tapping on her device on her arm.<br>\r\n\"What's new?\" Simon asked.<br>\r\n\"A new thing appeared... 'Armor Rating: 5'\"<br>\r\n\"That's quite small\" Frank replied.<br>\r\n\"Maybe, either way, it's better than none\"</span></div></div>",

We cut them down with something like an that we can craft and build a small shelter\"<br>\r\n\"Alright, where do we get an axe from?\"<br>\r\n\"Frank?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank pulled out a sharp rock he had found down at the stream and tossed it to you. The rock was arrow shaped with a single sharp point, almost perfectly shaped. You found a good stick and wrapped the rock in place. Almost immediately, it flashed and turned into a properly made axe.<br>\r\n\"We need to start experimenting.\" You said as everyone looked in surprise. \"If you think you can make it, you probably can. You just need the parts\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPassing the axe to Frank, he nodded thankfully and proceeded to cut away at a tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few hours went almost like clockwork. Frank cut down several trees, which almost magically lost their smaller branches and split down the middle perfectly. Simon fashioned a shovel out of a large flat stone and a bigger branch, which you proceeded to use to dig a small trench in ground as groundwork for the shack. Jack and Sasha began fashioning various stone tools down at the stream, and returned with some handy stuff.<br>\r\n\"You've been busy\" He commented.<br>\r\n\"So have you\" You replied.<br>\r\n\"Just wait, I'm not done yet. Got a good branch that I can use?\"<br>\r\n\"Here\" You said, picking up a nice straight branch off the ground that fitted nicely in your hand. Jack and Sasha returned to the stream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFairly soon, the shack was complete. With a leaning roof and four walls, it actually didn't look that bad. Admittedly it didn't have any nails to keep it together, but one of Jack's tools was like a carving knife, which went through the wood like butter. As such, you managed to find a way to slot the pieces together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout ten minutes later, Jack returned, hauling something heavy with him.<br>\r\n\"Gimmie a hand?\" He called out.<br>\r\n\"Whats this?\" You asked in surprise. It looked like a massive hammer, the wood cut smooth and a large stone on the end which was oval shaped with a flattened end.<br>\r\n\"Yo, Frank. Take this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank came over and hefted the tool. \"I like this very much\"<br>\r\n\"Consider it a present. Took me a while to build\"<br>\r\n\"I shall carry this weapon with pride\" He beamed. You looked at Jack with an eyebrow raised.<br>\r\n\"We'll need weapons\" He said. \"And since we can't make bows, thats pointless. And I'd rather make swords and the like out of proper metal. But I figure that Frank would have no problem defending us with that massive hammer\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack had made a fair point. You nodded in agreement and he returned to the stream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short discussion, Frank began increasing the size of the clearing and with Simons help, you managed to create an impressive fort out of wood, the total size being the equivalent of two houses. Admittedly, the main entrance didn't have any doors but you could soon fix that. The shack had been vastly improved, up to a whole second story and some makeshift beds had been crafted by Frank, who also hunted out some more wolves whose pelts could be used to soften the beds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is impressive\" Simon said happily as everyone admired the days handiwork. The sun had began to set on the horizon and you were moderately concerned by the fact that you hadn't actually seen anyone else in the whole day.</span></div></div>",

I'm fairly certain that there's some quality ore in there\"<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Simon asked, looking up.<br>\r\n\"Keen for a fight?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My hammer is always ready\" Frank said with a wolfish grin. Sasha nodded happily and so did Jack.<br>\r\n\"I'll stay here and guard the camp then\" Simon said, shrugging his shoulders. \"Who knows, maybe I could make some improvements for when you get back\"<br>\r\n\"You sure about that?\" You asked in surprise.<br>\r\n\"Yea, I'm good at building stuff, not at fighting\"<br>\r\n\"This is a game, everyone can fight\"<br>\r\n\"Still\"<br>\r\nYou held your hand up to stop him continuing. If Simon wanted to stay, who were you to stop him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, might as well go now then\" Jack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly ten minutes later, Frank, Jack, Sasha and you were hiding in the bushes a short distance from the enemy camp. The creatures there looked like small goblins, but were blue in colour... and far uglier. Jack had brought an axe with him and Sasha had a hammer. You, on the other hand, decided to just use whatever was lying around in the enemy camp.<br>\r\n\"We can't really jump them or anything, we don't have the tools for that yet\" You said quietly. \"I suggest that we just... run in there weapons blazing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank and Jack didn't wait to argue, they charged in with their weapons brandished, smacking down two of the creatures before they could do anything. You and Sasha just shook your heads and charged after them.<br>\r\nOne of the creatures was riding what looked like a boar, his pitiful wooden stake completely missed Frank as he charged. Meanwhile, Frank brought the fury of his hammer around to smack the boar, sending both enemies sprawling several meters away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe battle was over in about a minute.<br>\r\n\"Great, let's get inside\" You said, finding two pickaxes and giving one to Frank, the other you kept for yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cave was dimly lit by several torches that also appeared to never run out. Frank found what appeared to be a vein of ore and began to break small chunks out of it. Jack, with a keen eye for rocks, identified it as iron.<br>\r\n\"Could be very useful\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you were scouting for something more valuable. RIght down deep in the mine, you found it. An ore vein unlike the others. The ore in it had a dim blue colour and you gently coaxed it from the dirt and rock.<br>\r\n\"Yo! Someone get down here and help me with this!\" You yelled back up the tunnel. Sasha and Jack eventually arrived and you handed them several chunks of ore\"<br>\r\n\"What the hell is this?\" Jack asked. \"I don't recognise it\"<br>\r\n\"Probably because you'll only find this in the game\" You said. \"And I suspect it's rare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vein promptly ended after about two meters and you helped them haul the rare ore out of the cave.<br>\r\nFrank had found a ramshackle cart owned by the previous occupants of the mine and had loaded it up with a large stack of iron ore.<br>\r\n\"There is much iron in this mine!\" He beamed. \"I shall have to return to get more after this load!\"<br>\r\n\"Sure thing\" You said, shifting the weight of the ore in your hands.<br>\r\n\"What is this?\" He asked, picking up a chunk.<br>\r\n\"I don't have a name for it yet\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stalhrim?\" Sasha asked innocently. Frank stifled a laugh. Both of you immediately understood the reference.<br>\r\n\"Stalhrim it is then\" You said, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit of work, the ore was returned to your camp. Simon hadnt sat on his bottom the whole time, and had actually spent it building a fairly basic forge using various stones.<br>\r\n\"It's not perfect, but it should work\" He said. You all admired the handiwork.<br>\r\n\"Thanks Simon, It's perfect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon busied himself helping everyone else move the iron from the mine to the camp. You, on the other hand, began to work the forge and reshape the stalhrim ore. Every once in a while, someone came over to observe, but nobody spoke to you. This required quite a bit of concentration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after many hours, you admired your handiwork and brought it over to show everyone else.<br>\r\n\"First, I present this to you\" You said, giving a Stalhrim longsword to Jack. \"It's fairly sharp, so be careful. Then, to Simon, this axe\"<br>\r\nThe axe you gave Simon was far better than the first one that Jack had made. You spent a short while doing some basic carvings into the weapon and it's handle was wrapped in leather straps to give a better hold.<br>\r\n\"For you\" You said to Sasha, giving her a spear. The tip was made of Stalhrim and was the sharpest of any weapon you had made. Although it appeared to be made of wood, the core was Stalhrim and it was also wrapped in leather to help with grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Frank, you gave a much better hammer. It was very similar to his original, but the stone head had been completely replaced by Stalhrim and was less smooth. The flat edge was also roughened to improve the damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, for yourself, you had fashioned a unique set of armor and a longsword with an iron rimmed heater shield, all of which was made of Stalhrim. Admittedly, the armor was a little revealing. The armor composed itself of thick shoulder guards and a chest piece which came down to show the lower half of your midriff. The leggings almost fully covered you, excluding the top half of your legs. The gloves were quite light, and came up to your elbows. Finally, the helmet looked like a medieval Barbute. The entire armor though, was underlayed with leather to make it more comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't tell if your intentionally trying to be revealing\" Jack smirked. Everyone else stared in wonder when you put it on and showed them.<br>\r\n\"I actually kinda like it\" Sasha said.<br>\r\n\"Whats the rating?\" Simon asked. You checked your arm device.<br>\r\n\"Armor rating is two hundred and the weapon rating is ninety\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone else checked their own weapons and found similar weapon stats.<br>\r\n\"Why do I get the feeling that we may have just gone and found endgame gear?\" Jack asked.<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe. Either way, thats the last of the Stalhrim. Oh, and one other thing. I used my arm device to lock the weapons and my armor. We can't trade it or use anyone elses gear. So there's no point in anyone even stealing the gear as it would be worthless.<br>\r\n\"That is good\" Frank said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, this is interesting\" Frank said, pushing some buttons on his arm device.<br>\r\n\"What did you find?\" Sasha asked.<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't know if you can see it, but for me, your all glowing\"<br>\r\n\"What?\" You asked.<br>\r\n\"Yea. Apparently I can turn on a feature that lets me know how strong you all are in comparison to me. All of you are yellow, probably because of the weapons. But Athena, your a very deep strong shade of red. Have a look at your arm device.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurely enough, the feature was available to everyone.<br>\r\n\"That's going to be handy to know in the future\" You said.<br>\r\n\"Well, it's bordering on evening, how about we call it a night?\" Simon asked. You all nodded and headed for bed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The night passed uneventfully and you woke up in the morning feeling refreshed, or at least, the equivalent of refreshed in a game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, whats the plan?\" Jack asked, as you all basked in the warm glow of the campfire.<br>\r\n\"Well, I'd like to head out and do some scouting\" You said.<br>\r\n\"Any particular direction?\" Sasha asked.<br>\r\n\"North, back to the place where we started.\"<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll come with\" Sasha said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the gang had other plans, wanting to improve the living conditions and seeing what else was nearby, so thirty minutes later, you and Sasha bid goodbye and headed north.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should be good, just the two of us\" Sasha said, her black hair perfectly straight as it went down her back. \"We can get some girl time in\"<br>\r\n\"Girl time?\"<br>\r\n\"You know, girl stuff... Come on, you must know what I'm talking about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering your entire previous life was actually as a guy, you actually had no idea.<br>\r\n\"Not really, no. What do you want to talk about?\" You asked. Sasha looked at you weirdly.<br>\r\n\"Never mind\" She murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trek through the forest passed uneventfully, dried leaves and twigs cracked beneath your feet. Eventually, you arrived back at the great temple building and headed up the stairs.<br>\r\nAs your eyes adjusted to the gloom of the open area, you observed that there was only a small group of about ten to fifteen people off to one side.<br>\r\n\"Looks good enough to me\" You said, heading over to them. They immediately noticed you and three of them stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" One of them asked, a thuggish looking man who had a slight hunch. He had a sharpened stick in his hand, which your arm device determined to be a measily weapon rating of five.<br>\r\n\"Names Athena\" You said, putting your hand over your heart \"And this is Sasha\"<br>\r\n\"And what business do you have with the Terenar Guild?\"<br>\r\n\"Terenar Guild?\" You asked in confusion.<br>\r\n\"Yea, thats right, you noob. This is a game, right? Games have guilds and we made our own one\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought had never occured to you.<br>\r\n\"Alright then. I actually came to see if you wanted to trade.\" You said.<br>\r\n\"Pah. You don't have anything with you\"<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to just walk around with valuables on me and risk losing them.\" You retorted.<br>\r\n\"That armor looks quite good\" He said, looking straight at you. Someone behind him unsheathed a small weapon. It was another stick, also sharpened, but it looked like it was more for throwing than anything else. Everyone else in the group stood up to face you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not trading my armor\" You said firmly.<br>\r\n\"I never said I would <i>trade</i> for it\" He said quietly.<br>\r\n\"Your arm devices let you compare weapon and armor ratings. Why don't you see what I am capable of\"<br>\r\n\"Already know about that. And I think we can win in numbers\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to take me on?\" You asked.<br>\r\n\"Count me in\" Said Sasha, angrily.<br>\r\n\"Not this one\" You told Sasha quietly. \"This ones mine\" Sasha backed away, annoyed at her chance to fight having been removed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, we can take her on after we finish with you\" Your opponent said.<br>\r\n\"Before I smash your face into the ground, might I know your name?\" You asked.<br>\r\n\"Hood. Call me Hood\"<br>\r\n\"Alright then... <i>Hood</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHood charged at you. You brought your arm back and smashed it into his face, sending him flying several meters and bowling over a few of his friends. He quickly got to his feet.<br>\r\n\"Well get her!\" He yelled at his friends. They looked at you for a second and then charged in, yelling at the top of their lungs.<br>\r\nYou prepared yourself for this battle, quickly calculating the most effective way to take them down. Throwing with your left hand, you smashed it into the body of your first assailant and then brought up your legs to quickly kick away the second. The third was the most unlucky, as you picked him up with both hands, spun him around once and then threw him into a group of five more oncoming enemies. Sasha watched with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few charged at you in a horozontal line, so you quickly ducked to avoid the first fist punch, kicking your legs out and spinning around to topple them over.<br>\r\nAll of your assailants slowly picked themselves up off the ground, unwilling to fight again. Most of them now had extremely low health and it would be pitiful to finish them off. It wasnt an honourable fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHood finally decided to come after you himself, but you just punched him in the gut and he fell to his knees. You stared down at him and grabbed his jaw.<br>\r\n\"Know this, <i>Hood</i>. You've just made an enemy of the 'Targe of the Light'. Cross me again, and you won't live\" You said angrily. You let go and he spat blood. \"Now, I believe that I am entitled to the spoils of victory. Sasha, find something good that they have\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha crossed through the crowd and picked through their belongings. \"Nothing much useful here, except for a few scraps. Wait, found this\" Sasha said, holding up a Ruby.<br>\r\n\"Where did you get this?\" You asked Hood.<br>\r\n\"Noneovyourbusiness\" He said. You kicked him over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, lets go\" You said to Sasha. She trailed on behind you. \"Let's get back to camp.</span></div></div>",

Most of the game seems to be in the north, but these wolf pelts are probably the best thing i've come across so far\" Said the centre girl, a tall red head. She was flanked by two other girls, one of which had black hair that was tied up with a pin and the other let her short brown hair hang loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. It's good to know there's other honourable people out here\" Jack said, shaking her hand.<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't let us worry you. Everyone needs to work together to get out of here\"<br>\r\n\"Speaking of coming and going, here's the boss\" Simon said, gesturing to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I was wondering when we would have the honour of meeting such an esteemed woman\" The girl said, turning to you. Her eyes sparkled an iridescent green.<br>\r\n\"Esteemed? Who have you been talking to?\" You joked. Everyone laughed. \"Name's Athena\"<br>\r\n\"I am Esmeralda, and this is Jennifer and Tara\"<br>\r\n\"Pleasure to meet you. What brings you out here?\"<br>\r\n\"To be honest, hunting\" Esmeralda said. You all sat down around the campfire, Esmeralda directly to your left and Jack opposite you.<br>\r\n\"I haven't seen anything but wolves since we first arrived\" You said.<br>\r\n\"Yes, I was just telling Jack here were most of the animals are. This section of the forest seems to mostly be occupied by wolves, but are a few rabbits and other small animals running about. I think I saw a fox about an hour ago. However, if you are interested in hunting, go north past the temple. There's big game there, both docile and dangerous. Packs of deer run through the forest and there are bears twice the size of people\"<br>\r\n\"Sounds dangerous\"<br>\r\n\"Tell that to the first few groups who went into the forest\" Tara said, biting her lip. Esmeralda looked at her for a second, her face placid. She sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been lucky out here, so far away from everyone else\" Jennifer said.<br>\r\n\"How so?\" Sasha asked.<br>\r\n\"We started travelling right from the beginning. We three know each other from Earth so there was little question in sticking together. Did you fight in the evening war?\"<br>\r\nYou looked at Jack and Frank, they shook their heads slowly.<br>\r\n\"It's what everyone is calling it. The afternoon of being here, everyone started to form into groups, mostly around the strongest looking person. Then the fights broke out over the stronger groups, everyone wanting to claim a metaphorical crown. It wasnt glorious\"<br>\r\n\"War is war\" Sasha said quietly.<br>\r\n\"Yea, but this is a game different to any other\" Tara said.<br>\r\n\"Regardless, alotta people got hurt. In the late evening, everyone kinda split up, suddenly realising that they actually didnt have the health to keep fighting. A large group of people grouped together on the eastern plains, but there's no central leadership. They just sit there around small fires arguing over what to do next\"<br>\r\n\"Thought as much\" You said quietly.<br>\r\n\"It's not all bad though. You have this place and there's others who are making a start of something here. We've already made great strides\"<br>\r\n\"How so?\" You asked, looking at the crude leather they wore. Jack threw something at you.<br>\r\n\"Look at that\" He said, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou caught the small object in your hand, it was a coil of string.<br>\r\n\"You made this?\" You asked in surprise.<br>\r\n\"Yea, and there's alot more where that came from if you want\" Esmeralda said, smiling.<br>\r\n\"I'll trade for it\"<br>\r\n\"Already did a deal with Jack and Simon here. We're taking a few pelts and a bit of meat, but you get the better end of the bargain\"<br>\r\n\"I did a quick check and we won't be running low on food any time soon\" Simon said.<br>\r\n\"Alright, but is there anything in particular you want?\" You asked, trying to find a way to cement a long trading relationship. Esmeralda stared deeply at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you have raw iron\" She said slowly. \"And I want it... <i>we</i> want it\"<br>\r\n\"For?\" You asked simply.<br>\r\n\"Improve our armor. We want to stay light, but a bit of reinforcement can't be bad\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone, keep our guests entertained. Esmeralda, come with me. I think I can do something better\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gathered up all the neccecary objects that you needed: Leather, Iron ore, a hammer and a few other small things.<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Esmeralda asked.<br>\r\n\"You'll see\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorking the forge hard, you melted the iron down into thin sheets and studs. Then you created three leather vests and underlayed them with the iron sheets. Lastly, you pushed the iron studs into the leather and let them cool. Then, you presented them to Esmeralda.<br>\r\n\"This is beautiful\" She said, fitting it to herself.<br>\r\n\"The other two are for you friends. I think you may prefer it over your original fittings\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks Athena. We certainly will. By the way, I want to ask you something\"<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n\"Have you been back to the temple?\"<br>\r\n\"We were there this morning\" You said, leaning on your hammer \"Why?\"<br>\r\n\"So you must have encountered Hood\"<br>\r\n\"Yes. I beat him and his friends up. It was quite relaxing\"<br>\r\n\"How many were there?\"<br>\r\n\"About ten, maybe fifteen\"<br>\r\n\"Then you were lucky. Hood actually controls a very large group of people, maybe bordering on over a hundred. He's already formed a guild of his own thats fully structured. I won't be surprised if they come knocking on your doors soon\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the warning\" You said, surprised by the new information.<br>\r\n\"And just one other thing, when me and the girls were scouting, we found some strange statue to the east surrounded by ruins, looks old - ancient actually. Might be worth a look\"<br>\r\n\"We could always explore tomorrow if we get the time\"<br>\r\n\"The girls and I are going to explore there tomorrow, if you do come, your welcome to join us\"</span></div></div>",

However, everyone else was keen to come.<br>\r\n\"There's one other thing. We need to create our own guild\" You said.<br>\r\n\"You already have a name though\" Sasha said.<br>\r\n\"Right. I came up with it on the spot. 'Targe of the Light'... What do you think?\"<br>\r\nJack snorted and Simon and Frank stared at you.<br>\r\n\"Comical, but alright\" Simon muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rolled your eyes, annoyed, but used your arm device to invite them all to your new guild. A few blinking lights indicated that they had all agreed to join.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarly next morning, you Sasha, Jack and Simon left camp and headed to the eastern ruins. The forest ended abruptly to some open plains and you saw the ruins not far in the distance.<br>\r\n\"There\" You said, pointing at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving at a quick pace, you soon arrived and began to look around. The statue that Esmeralda had mentioned stood motionless in the middle. It was a warrior holding a greatsword with two hands, the weapon right in front of him pointing downwards, as if he was forever contemplating something deep and important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsmeralda suddenly jumped down from up high behind you.<br>\r\n\"Whoa! You scared me!\" You said, suddenly jumping back.<br>\r\n\"Ha ha. I knew I would get you\" She said, beaming. \"So, found anything?\"<br>\r\n\"We only just arrived\" Jack said, kicking away a stone.<br>\r\n\"You can get a great view from up there\" Esmeralda said, pointing to a high arch.<br>\r\n\"I can't get up there\" You said flatly.<br>\r\n\"Did you try jumping?\" Esmeralda asked quizically.<br>\r\n\"I can't jump that high\" You retorted. \"That's three meters higher than anyone can jump.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsmeralda stared at you. \"What level are you?\" She asked.<br>\r\n\"What?\" You replied.<br>\r\n\"What. Level?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsmeralda came over and grabbed your wrist device. \"You do know you can assign points at every level up to improve yourself, right?\"<br>\r\n\"No\"<br>\r\nShe rolled her eyes and showed you the relevant screen on your arm device. \"Whoa! You have FIFTY unspent points?\" She cried out in surprise.<br>\r\n\"Is that alot?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm only level 6 and you only get two per level, giving me a total of twelve! Your already level 25!\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I did go and beat up all of Hood's friends yesterday... and we raided a mine...\"<br>\r\n\"Your good\" Esmeralda said.<br>\r\n\"Gimmie a second to work this out\" You told her. She proceeded to show the rest of your group what to do. You really did not know about all this, as you wanted everything in the game to be a surprise. Four spendable slots were available: Health Increase, Stamina Increase, Stength Increase and Agility Increase. Intelligence was based on the actual player.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to go with being a well balanced person, assigning ten points to all four options and then five more to Health Increase and Stamina Increase.<br>\r\n\"Alright, try jumping\" Esmeralda said.<br>\r\nYou took a running jump and suddenly found yourself sailing right over the arch that Esmeralda had pointed out before. You managed to land perfectly on your feet, the expected groundshock never appearing.<br>\r\n\"This is amazing!\" You said.<br>\r\n\"Just remember to check when you level up\" Esmeralda said. \"It can be very helpful. There's also another panel for weapon upgrades, but you can look at that later\"<br>\r\n\"Sure\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour guild and Esmeralda's girls proceeded to look around the ruins, hoping to find something interesting - some sort of access to a dungeon. Indeed, your connection to the website definately indicated a very large dungeon beneath the ruins but you stopped yourself from figuring out how to get inside.<br>\r\n\"Found anything?\" Tara finally asked about an hour later.<br>\r\n\"Nope\" You said, sitting down. Sasha jumped up to sit on the hilt of the statues sword. She had placed her few points mostly into stamina and agility upgrades, hoping to become a prominent archer. Suddenly, the sword shifted and she jumped off in shock.<br>\r\n\"What did you do?\" You asked.<br>\r\n\"Nothing! I just sat on it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sword shifted again, sinking into the ground a few centimeters.<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, a door suddenly opened up beneath the statue, allowing access down into a deep, black stairway.<br>\r\n\"Ready?\" Esmeralda asked, a grin on her face. She ignited a stick with a rag around it and proceeded down into hallway. You and your guild followed on.<br>\r\nThe small hallway soon opened up into a chamber, what looked like some sort of underground gatehouse.<br>\r\n\"This is eerily empty\" Jennifer said, standing closer to Tara. Esmeralda found a few lampposts and lit them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chamber slowly began to light up more and more. It was fairly ruined, with a nearly completely collapsed ceiling in one corner.<br>\r\n\"Fun\" You said. \"Nothing much here, lets keep going\"<br>\r\nYou all proceeded further on, coming to a crossroad.<br>\r\n\"Which way?\" You asked. Esmeralda found another torch in a scone and lit it. Each diverging path had a label above it.<br>\r\n\"Here, this one apparently leads to a grand hall\" Tara said, pointing to the one on the far left.<br>\r\n\"This one's a colliseum of some sort\" Jack said, pointing to the centre.<br>\r\n\"And this one unmarked\" Sasha said. \"Oh goody goody\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like the idea of not knowing whats ahead. Makes it a fun challenge\" Esmeralda said, grinning. So you all proceeded down the unmarked path. Fairly soon, the carved walls gave way to a large cave, a small waterfall in the far corner with light streaming in from the surface.<br>\r\n\"Nothing here\" You said dissappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all headed back to the crossroads and decided to head to the colliseum. It was a far shorter walk and suddenly you were greeted with the sight of a massive underground arena.<br>\r\n\"This, this is cool\" Esmeralda said. You all walked down the steps as Esmeralda lit several torches in scones.<br>\r\n\"Whoa, big\" You said, coming to the edge of the spectator stands and looking down into the large pit. It was about a meter down from where you stood and was half the size of a cricket pitch.<br>\r\n\"Should we go down?\" Simon asked.</span></div></div>",

Esmeralda looked at you with mild concern.<br>\r\n\"It could be a trap\" She said.<br>\r\n\"What could make it more fun?\" You grinned, hopping over the railing and landing in the soft dirt. Everyone else followed behind you shortly as you walked to the centre.<br>\r\n\"Now this, this is awesome\" You said, still grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could have all sorts of fun down here\" Simon said. \"Imagine what some of the games duels would be like\"<br>\r\n\"Duels?\" Tara asked.<br>\r\n\"Yea, you didn't know? This game lets us engage in duels. It's like a semi-safe way of fighting another player. The only difference to an ordinary fight is that rather than losing all your health and dying, you lose all your health and lose the match\" Simon said.<br>\r\n\"How'd you know that?\" You asked Simon with surprise.<br>\r\n\"Had a match with Frank... Something that I will not repeat again\" He said, shrugging his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm sure we can setup some sort of system to claim this place\" Esmeralda said. \"It'd be a shame to let it go to waste. Besides, I'm sure we can profit off it somehow!\" She laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a large number of lights blinked on above you.<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you like it!\" Called out an all too familiar voice from behind you. Perched on the edge of the arena wall, looking down at you was Hood. He must have followed you in here.<br>\r\nSuddenly, a large number of people appeared from hidden spots. You looked around with a blank look on your face. At least three hundred must have gathered here, waiting for you to arrive. Hood was counting on your curiosity. All of them were armed with a variety of weak weapons, but it was becoming clear that everyone, or at least Hood's guild, were learning how to survive, and craft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHood jumped down onto the arena floor and walked up to you. If he and his guild was about to challenge you, that wouldnt be good. Sure, you'd be fine, but there was minimal chance that anyone else in your group would survive. No, this would be a one on one match.<br>\r\n\"Welcome to my little pad\" Hood said with an evil grin on his face. \"I hope your ready to fight for your survival\"<br>\r\n\"A man of dishonour, fighting three hundred to seven? How about we even things up a bit\" You said flatly. \"One on one\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHood pouted.<br>\r\n\"Two on Two\" He said firmly. \"Can't have you cheating again, can we?\"<br>\r\n\"Alright\"<br>\r\n\"Hey! You can't decide for us!\" Sasha groaned.<br>\r\n\"Relax. Just join in the match and I'll take care of these clowns\" You said sweetly. Sasha folded her arms, annoyed and then pressed accept on her arm device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakiro! Time for a warm up!\" Hood yelled up into the crowd. Almost instantly, a figure jumped from the crowd and landed perfectly beside Hood. Whoever she was, she had very quickly become attuned to the game.<br>\r\n\"Hello Sweetie\" She said, licking her lips as she pushed back a lock of red hair. You reeled in disgust. So did Sasha.<br>\r\n\"Remember what I said\" You whispered to Sasha. She nodded and stood her ground. You stepped forward between her and your opposers\"<br>\r\n\"One at a time? We can do that\" Sakiro said.<br>\r\n\"You first\" You said calmly, curious as to her fighting style.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHood looked at her for a second and she suddenly started running towards you at an incredible speed. Yet she held no weapon, which you were initially surprised at. Although, at the last minute you managed to raise your sword to block two daggers which she produced from her side. They were black, perfectly masked against the dimly lit arena.<br>\r\nSakiro started hitting again and again with vicious haste. Fortunately though, your own natural ability meant that she couldnt land a single hit. Something that you observed must have annoyed her greatly as she increased her speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her own surprise, you brought up your shield now to assist in blocking, now able to use your sword to help push her back. Moreso, you surprised her by taking advantage of a split second gap in defenses by bashing your shield to her face.<br>\r\nSakiro staggered back, bewildered. Hood looked on in annoyance while Esmeralda suppressed a light laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakiro came back towards you, completely changing her strategy and trying to hit you from all sides. This time, Hood joined in, producing a large angular blade that you didn't know he had owned. Perhaps he had stolen it.<br>\r\nEither way, they were both constantly on opposite sides of you, making defense slightly difficult as you constantly switched the sides of your sword and shield.<br>\r\nAnother break in Sakiro's defense meant that you could hit her again, except this time you sent her flying with your sword. Hood tried to take advantage of your sword being busy and tried to stab you in the back. Unfortunately for him though, your shield had come around as well, making a clean hit on his face. This also sent him flying, almost as far as Sakiro.</span></div></div>",

She wiped a trace of blood away from her mouth and looked up at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game clearly identified you as the winner, your Arm Device lighting up green and displaying the word \"Victory!\", as well as the relevant exp that you had gained. You hadnt really noticed this before in previous battles, but then again, you weren't really looking for it either.<br>\r\nHood now stood up beside Sakiro, seething in defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, you looked through the map data of your arm device. Apparently this arena was open to player versus player combat, making it rather dangerous for your party. Hood must have known, as he then shouted an order to his guild.<br>\r\n\"She's weakened! Take her down!\" He yelled.<br>\r\nYou had no idea where Hood got the idea that you had been weakened. They had barely laid a scratch on you and your healthbar clearly indicated 99% health. Regardless, Hood was trying the same strategy as before, defeating you with numbers. Except, this time he actually had a chance, since all your foes now actually had reasonable weapons and armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Form a tight group!\" You told your friends. \"I'm going to try something new\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looked at you in dispair. Despite your power, could you really hold off all these people? Now was the time to find out.<br>\r\nYour foes began to drop down into the arena, charging at you with their swords, maces and spears held high. Just before they hit you, you raised your sword high and plunged it into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was surprised when they saw the blue light suddenly eminate from your blade, forming multiple cracks along the ground. Suddenly, the light from your sword glowed brighter and then exploded outward, hitting everyone charging towards you. The impact sent them all flying. When they hit the ground hard, they stayed down, stunned from the massive attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the drain on yourself as you lowered to your knee, suddenly overcome with exhaustion. That attack was extremely difficult and costly to you.<br>\r\n\"We need to leave\" You said, lifting your sword with one hand and clutching your chest with your other.<br>\r\n\"What the hell was that?\" Sasha asked.<br>\r\n\"I'll explain once we get somewhere safe\" You said. \"We need to ge-\"<br>\r\nHowever, before you could finish, you fainted and fell to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-blue light of sorts, just came out of her sword\"<br>\r\n\"Hit everyone and sent them flying\"<br>\r\n\"I don't believe it\"<br>\r\n\"I don't expect you to, but thats what she did and she saved us\"<br>\r\n\"Well, it's good that you are all okay\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly sat up, aware of the voices around you. Once your vision finally came into focus, you discovered that you were back at your own little fort in the forest.<br>\r\n\"Ah, your awake\" Sasha said, coming over to you with a damp rag. She pressed it against your forehead. \"You've been out for a number of hours. Esmeralda and Jennifer took turns carrying you back here\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks... What happened?\"<br>\r\n\"You knocked out everyone attacking us\"<br>\r\n\"Yea, I know that... I mean after\"<br>\r\n\"Well, they were still out cold when you stunned them. Must have not been ready for something like that... What the heck WAS that anyway?\" Simon said, leaning on a chair in the corner.<br>\r\n\"There's powers... or 'abilities' in this game. You all might want to check up on that later\" You said. \"Anyway, I found an interesting one that was actually only designed to eminate out a few meters\"<br>\r\n\"That wasnt a few\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, you can push abilities, but I think I now know why you shouldnt\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha rolled her eyes and took the rag away.<br>\r\n\"Well, at least your alright.\" She said.<br>\r\n\"What happened to Esmeralda and her girls?\" You asked.<br>\r\n\"Been and gone, out hunting some more. You've really made an impression on her\"<br>\r\n\"Good one?\"<br>\r\n\"Definately... I suspect a few people around here might be looking at you like a sort of leader\"</span></div></div>",

I'm Athena. Apparently you've been expecting me\"<br>\r\n\"Indeed\" A largish man said. Frank watched from the corner, almost distrustful of the newcomers. \"My name is Jacob and we've a fair bit about you over the last few days\"<br>\r\n\"From who?\" You asked.<br>\r\n\"Various people travelling throughout the region. Apparently you've really set off the spark with Hood\"<br>\r\n\"Sasha... How long was I out?\" You asked, turning to her.<br>\r\n\"Three days\"<br>\r\n\"THREE DAYS?\" You yelled. She stifled a laugh.<br>\r\n\"Relax... We've done a bit of trading, made a slight profit and overall, done alright\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned back to your guests, shaking your head. \"So, what can I do for you?\"<br>\r\n\"We've learned a bit about how this... 'game' works. And we want to form an alliance\"<br>\r\n\"Alliance?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes. Your guild is apparently called the Targe of the Light and we want to form an alliance with our haphazard guild: The plain walkers\"<br>\r\n\"I'm certainly interested. But whats in it for us?\" You asked.<br>\r\n\"Have you learned about the inventory system yet?\" Jacob asked.<br>\r\n\"A bit\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob pushed a few buttons on his arm device and then yours lit up, requesting a trade. You relucantly opened the trade menu. Apparently he was willing to trade fifty blocks of stone.<br>\r\n\"Stone? Whats the usefulness of that?\" You asked.<br>\r\n\"We're a divided people, but we're a large mass and we need a leader. They're looking to me at the moment, but thats only because I was in the army back on Earth. I'm not really a leader. There's more blocks where that came from... hundreds more. We're actually willing to help build a proper for rather than this small wooden hut you live in.\"<br>\r\nFrank snorted. He was proud of his creation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what would you have us do?\" You asked.<br>\r\n\"Protect us from Hood and his guild. I suspect this game will eventually turn into a bloody massacre between two guilds soon and we need help\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about it hard. Taking on the defense of a few hundred people with only you five would be extremely difficult, if not nigh on impossible. Hopefully, however, they could at least form their own guard defenses. After a brief discussion with your guild, you all eventually decided on a yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll do it\" You said, shaking the hand of Jacob. He beamed.<br>\r\n\"Great! We'll get more stone ready!\" He said. \"Come when your ready and with your help, we'll design this fort together!\"<br>\r\n\"We'll leave tomorrow\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaving goodbye, Jacob and his companion left the camp, happy with the trade.<br>\r\n\"So your just randomly carrying around fifty blocks of stone?\" Simon asked in confusion.<br>\r\n\"Thankgoodness for virtual reality\" You said, smiling<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the assistance of your guild, you managed to quickly pack up the campsite and douse the fire, taking everything you could within the individual inventories of the party. As you headed towards the plains through the forest, Sasha caught a few rabbits for dinner. Frank was unusually quiet.<br>\r\nEventually, you reached the barrier between the forest and the plains. You could see small plumes of smoke in the distance, where they had obviously formed their own campsites.<br>\r\nJacob was a short distance away with several men and woman, all of whom were quite dusty and had pickaxes on their belts.<br>\r\n\"Ah, you've arrived!\" Jacob said. \"These people have volunteered to help. They'll get the stone from the nearby quarry while we set about designing this thing.\"</span></div></div>",

Walking back to your cubicle, you were keen to see just how much work you could get done without the impending threat of her leaning over your shoulder, her hot breath right beside your face. Gosh, those were some chilling memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walked back to your cubicle, you noticed greater and greater changes to the office.

She had long brown hair, dark blue eyes and a fairly well shaped body. You really had no idea why she was here. She chuckled as she looked up at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should know...

Your bust getting in the way, of your scrawny arms, and keeping you too aware of that too, too sensitive bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly you find the controls, and dial down your bust, to a more manageable dimensions. The temptation to just keep those so sensitive, so joyous titties just a little longer a massive temptation.</span></div></div>",

The memories you now have of this world of females include more than a few sightings of women swollen with life. Seeing Alex in all her glory right there in front of you is the final straw.

Soon you have another decent block of text waiting on the page; you look it over again to make sure there are no mistakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe text before you spells out that throughout history there have been and are rare women that never bear their children once they are pregnant. The children remain within their mothers for the rest of both their lives. Those affected this way suffer no ill effects from the permanent pregnancies. In fact most are rather happy to have something so incredible happen to them. The unborn children are likewise untroubled, remaining safe and cared for within their mothers. You added that Alex is one of these women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a smile tugging at the corners of our mouth. The idea of this wish is\u2026delightful and exhilarating to you. Your heart beats a bit faster. Your finger trembles a hair above the enter key. You press it. There\u2019s no effect to you unlike the previous time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Little wonder</i> you muse as an idle hand reaches down to stroke your unfilled belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hop to your feet as the message about the several hours required for the changes to take hold shows up again. You hide the screen this time before wandering out to where you left Alex.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before turning the last corner, you wonder for a moment if you shouldn\u2019t have added something about the children stopping their growth after nine months or something. You dismiss that concern with a shrug, figuring that you would have some fun with how the site made things as it. You could always use it again if need be too. With that settled for the now, you take the last few steps and find Alex sitting down now. She\u2019s sticking a handful of fries into her mouth. Not the first of those judging from the empty fry boxes either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you are, \u2018bout to come after you if you didn\u2019t come back,\u201d she says after gulping the over-mouthful down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, heard about a sweet bash going on tonight. Got a live band, food, drinks, the whole shebang. Got a nice bonus too: happening on a beach so there might be some hot bikini action going on. And who knows, there could even be some skinny dipping maybe,\u201d she says with a lusty grin splitting her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle to yourself with a slight shake of your head. Glad to see those\u201d new\u201d memories weren\u2019t wrong, Alex is the same even with the whole female and knocked up thing happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWanna come with?\u201d she asks, unaware of your musing. \u201cI know you like showing everyone up with that hot bod of yours, and this is a perfect chance for it.\u201d Her eyes trail down across your curves before snapping back to your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh, I suppose so,\u201d playing it cool and not letting your excitement show through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCool, cool, glad to hear it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that decided, she picks up another handful of fries and chases it with a third before the second is even half chewed. She washes it down with a long, hard suck on an extra-large shake. The wrappers and boxes are added to the overflowing trash nearby and \u2013 after a little more prep \u2013 the two of you are off. You drive while Alex navigates. Or at least tries to navigate. There\u2019s plenty of backtracking and dead-ends along the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you know you\u2019re getting close. You can hear the music over this secluded area. The last lingering bits of sunlight pick out a big collection of cars above a sheltered cove. A huge bonfire in the middle illuminates the party goes along with the band on a mobile stage. You bite your lip at the site of all the women on the beach. Some are dressed in casual clothes, while most are taking advantage of the great weather and the setting and opted for various pieces of swimwear. Yu even spot more than a few baby bumps among the crowd. None are as large as Alex though, unsurprisingly. Speaking of Alex\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is already making her way across the sand, cheer of her name and various other greetings went up as people recognized her coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome more cries reach your ears soon after. \u201cNat, come on girl!\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re missing all the fun!\u201d among others as some of the women wave at you and beckon you forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitate for a moment before shrugging off your shirt exposing the teen bikini top you slipped on before leaving. More than a few whistles erupt at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you reach the sand, a drink is pressed into your hand. The pretty blonde doing so gives you a wide smile. You recognize her, Ashley from your English Lit class. She is going out with Michael, you remember. You also remember that she is single now. Michelle is tongue deep with a spicy Latina across the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlad you could make it, Nat. It\u2019s always nice to\u2026see you.\u201d Her eyes flick up and down. It\u2019s just a moment, and you almost miss it, <i>almost</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she\u2019s gone, her sarong wrap lifting somewhat in the breeze and giving you a teasing glimpse of her shapely rump. Your gaze remains there until she\u2019s out of view among the rest of the party goers. You see Alex, already the center of attention as she slams drink after drink with a circle of cheering spectators. You sip at the drink Ashley gave you, finding the fruity sweetness overwhelming, but not enough to cover up the bite of the spirit underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that is a whirlwind of sensations as you let yourself get drawn into the party. You drink, you eat, and you dance. Sometimes you dance with specific partners that come and go, and sometimes you dance on your own. You can feel eyes on you everywhere you go. There\u2019s lust and envy in those glances, sometimes one or the other, sometimes both from the same woman. The attention is exhilarating. It makes your heart beat even faster than all of this activity does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven still, you force yourself to break away and take some time for yourself. Wandering down away from the light of the fire and the stage, you come to the lapping water. Alex wasn\u2019t wrong; there are a number of girls out in the water, frolicking away from the rest. It\u2019s hard to tell through the churning water, but you\u2019re pretty sure that some of them aren\u2019t clothed either. The salty mist fills the air and your lungs, bringing a welcome coolness to offset the built up heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull your phone out, staring down at the screen as it lights up. After several seconds of indecision, you bring up the Reality Shift webpage. Cross referencing with the email, you log in. The page is simplified as expected on a mobile, but still looks as functional as the full version. A message pops up, saying that the last change had been made. Looking back at the crowd, nothing seems different, but you shrug it off. Everything else the site had done was true, so this wouldn\u2019t be any different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flick through the options. As impressive as these world changing edits have been, needing to wait several hours is getting a bit much. You decide to go with the personnel edit option, making a change to a specific person, and seeing what fun you could have there. The text box opens, requesting that you enter the name of a person you want to alter. You twist a lock of hair around a finger as you think about that, and then set to typing.</span></div></div>",

Not only have you became a girl, but you are a Tamerian one, and an actually knock-out one kind of girl, even with small breasts, which is nice since you rather not carry large weight on your chest. You can also tell that your hair color changed to a bright red and you have bright green beautiful alien like eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou seemed to be excited of this wonderous change that you forgot to noticed that you started floating a bit in front of the mirror.

Brian barely scratches his head and continues to yell at the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, you change his height and body proportions. His arms and legs become more feminine and petite with girlish nail polish on his hands and feet. His waist caves in as his hips and ass to form a nice, round bubble butt.

But as waves of pleasure run through her, she collapses to the ground crying softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer clothes began to change. The white shirt shades to a Navy blue and becomes a blouse. The jeans roll up and fluff out into a short black skirt. The tennis shoes gain height and become thigh high soft brown boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her face softens and her voice gains pitch, Brianna gasps a soft \"Please.. don't...\" and passes out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You got the little bugger as a kit from a friend, whose Jill had given birth, though they had to give away the offspring. The little angry sock given life quicky ended up becoming your best friend, all things considered. You doted at him every chance you got. He could be a nippy little bastard at times, and had enough energy to power a city, though he was often sweet and affectionate, and no matter how much stress you endured or whoever else you had, your favorite fluffball is always there, ready for cuddles, rubs, or to play with any of the toys you spoiled him rotten providing. Or... He was, at least. You coudnt take pets to the dorm, so he is currently in the care of your parents. You hated leaving him behind so much... Though as you think, you begin to realize that you might not ever need to again. You tire of your current life and wish to escape it all by becoming part of some creature... Why not him? you could just give it all up and simply become as close as possible to your little friend, and pay him back for all of the times he helped you. You wonder what it would be like to become his tight little pucker, tucked under his tail. Though you could also change your mind and become his cock instead, all snug and cozy within his sheath...

Tweaking the mental controls, she ensured that Michelle would remember her original life, and her goal of being Bond. However, she'd be stuck in giggling bimbo-mode.

The nice female chest, hips and ass are also making their way now and she now has nice C-cups! Mike\u2019s proud dick begins to shrink and as his hips push to change to a female form.<br>\r\nWith a quick sensation not only but mostly in the front side Mike officially becomes a woman.<br>\r\nHis casual male outfit is now hanging on the woman and looked stupid but the next moment it changes:<br>\r\nA white fashionable blouse is formed out and covered now Mike's already female upper body. Her briefs became panties and a bra appeared under the blouse to support her nice assets. His sneakers are replaced by some black high heels and black stockings as Michelle was now wearing a fashionable skirt.<br>\r\nGlaring at you, Mike, who now looked like a hot fashionable black haired girl exclaims, \"What have you done!\" His voice was sweet like all of his new appearance and for some reason attracting you\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She puts one hand on your ass and uses it to make you push in deeper with your now rythmic thrusts into her, and the other pulls your head down to hers, and she begins kissing you. It's the most passionate kiss anyone has ever given you, and you never want it, or the sex that Jen is giving you, to end. She seemed like an expert; maybe it came with her body, as you know Jen had only ever had one boyfriend before now, but either way, you were lucky it did.

My treat?\" <br>\r\n\"Awww, that's really sweet of you, but I really just want to stay in tonight; anyway, I've got nothing for the occasion,\" Molly says. <br>\r\n\"Oh, well do you want to stay in then?

On the right you see a selection of sliders and drop down menus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer confided in you that she's insecure about her nose. However, you feel that she's a little flat. Not an objection you've ever voiced in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe temptation proves too much, and you move one of the sliders. Instantly the model responds as her chest swells larger. You give a grunt, and smile a little, the program is quite fun. However, when you glance out the window, you see that Jennifer actually does have the bigger boobs that you gave the model.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help but wonder how you're being pranked. This seems rather elaborate, so you decide to push your luck. Without looking you randomly select another slider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSliding it slowly you watch Jennifer directly, as you do you see her hair shifting colour, her blonde hair losing it's golden colour and becoming more of a platinum. She appears entirely unaware of the changes, as she turns the page in her book. You slide the controller backwards, and as you do, her hair responds, regaining it's golden shimmer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning your attention back to the screen, you see that the slider is for controlling hair colour. It's getting harder to resist the idea that this program truly has powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou aren't sure how, but perhaps someone is doing some trickery with her co-operation. Angrily you stab the name box, and hit delete. Jennifer's avatar shoots off into the distance as the program awaits your next selection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's only one option you can be sure of. <i>Nate Summerfield</i>, your model appears. Despite being sure this is a trick, your fingers tremble as you look over the sliders, and other options. You laugh to yourself, when you make sure not to accidentally hit anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's time to test it properly, so you need to adjust something... something significant... something that can't be faked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want to do something different than you did with Jennifer. You look back out the window. She's still sitting there, and still reading, and still her enhanced busty self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the bottom of the screen you see some toggles. There's the one, you think. <i>Sex: </i>and beneath that a box marked <span class=\"cred\"><b>Male</b></span>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep breath, as the mouse hovers over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou click the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt shifts to <b><span class=\"cred\">Female</span></b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give a little yelp, as you fall a few inches back into the seat. Your view from the window is lower, and your feet no longer rest flat on the ground. There's also the undeniable jiggle from your chest, and the feeling of a bra cutting into your shoulders. The seat also feels more comfortable... more padded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kick the chair back from the computer, and leap out of the seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt can't be real... It just can't....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head over to Jennifer's mirror. A full-length mirror, and staring back at you, there's a beautiful woman. A little short, an inch or so shorter than Jennifer, and the look of confusion on her face is scary. You move one hand across your body, and the mirror image responds absolutely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give yourself a squeeze. You feel it with your hands.... and also in your chest... Your chest.... Hell, your <b>bust</b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you start to panic, and hyper-ventilate her bust starts to jiggle alarmingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dart back to the chair, tripping over the legs. Hopefully this is reversible.... Hopefully the program is still there...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost fainting with relief, it's still your image on the screen. Still your name at the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stab the button, once again. It's like a magic trick ends. Without warning you return to your own body. You confirm that you are once again a dude, in the traditional manner. One hand on your crotch, while the other checks you don't have tits. Tiny nipples and a flat chest are the happy answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want to punch the air in victory, and look back down at Jennifer. Tapping the window, she turns and smiles back at you. You silently beckon her inside.</span></div></div>",

You tip the valet a little extra to bring the gifts in 20 minutes from your arrival, and then head in with the twins. The three of you are escorted to a booth that is completely shut off from the rest of the restaurant by a surrounding curtain. It appears that this booth is likely to be the most expensive table in the place. After ordering the entrees and a bit of champagne, the three of you talk for a while. Mostly about when the three of you first met. \"I remember it like it was yesterday...\" Michelle begins, \"I was on the playground with Jen, making a sand castle. Suddenly, this boy runs, takes a flying leap, and then crashes down into the castle, demolishing it completely. Jen started to cry, while I tried to hit him. He knocked me right on my back, but when I looked up again, he was crying on the ground, holding his arm. There in front of him was a little boy with clenched fists yelling at him to leave us alone. That's when I met you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember seeing some girl sissy slapping a much bigger boy, and then getting knocked flat on her ass\" you laugh, \"but I wasn't going to let someone be a bully while I was around, so I ran up and tackled him. I think his arm must have hit the pavement or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our knight in shining armor.\" both twins say simultaneously. Then they lean in and give a kiss on either cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, two gifts appear through the curtain. You grab them and hand them to the intended recipients.

You try to fall back asleep, but your arms prevent that as they are intermittently numb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour later, Jen rolls out of bed and falls to the floor with a *thud*.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owwww,\" she said getting up off the floor, \"where am... ohh yeahh...\" Then she looks at you and says, \"Thanks for yesterday, and the presents.\" This last past she says rubbing her abdomen as she walks around the bed. \"Michelle, time to wake up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroggily, Michelle sits up and yawns. She turns around to you and says, \"Last night was great, thanks for everything.\" Then she gets up and walks out of the room, followed by Jen, leaving you alone in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that your arms are free and regaining feeling, you decide to...</span></div></div>",

They sent in a few pictures to the GlamOur Studios office and waited 4 months before they were told that they had each won one of the 10, 5 year contracts. This would mean that they would not only become famous models, but would would each get a yearly salary of $100,000, plus 30% bonuses that would be based on revenue that their modeling brought in. This was an exciting opportunity for both of them, but it meant that they would both be leaving here as of tomorrow to travel the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonight was their unofficial farewell party, as the official one would include reporters and the other girls who had won. They had only told you about the win a few days ago, which caught you by surprise entirely. You remember the emotions you felt at that moment as you were both happy for their success, and sad that they would no longer be in your life.

You had some troubles with some of the professors at times, but you somehow managed to pull through it. You also worked a brief stint at Hooters along with the Oniel twins, but that was extremely short lived as the modeling contest began shortly after. Apparently, you also managed to get a faster response time as their manager. Your internet and other utilities are being shut off today since you'll be moving out to travel with GlamOur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, uh...

Without even realizing it, you've reflexively gotten ready like you've done it your whole life. You look down to see that you've put on a strapless white dress for the party.

The idea of Michael being aware of his changes, confused by his changes, and powerless to understand them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy with how she looks, you swipe away the physical changes, and draw down the mental changes. After a little tweaking, you have her as more timid, more submissive than her sister. A dominant Jennifer controlling every aspect of Michelle's life, keeping her in her place. Making Jennifer more controlling, more of a game-player, you can picture her being more athletic, more adventurous in the bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a last look at the changes, you nod to yourself, and set up a timer for the change.

A spring in your step, and desire to whistle you walk to the park eager for your meeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you get nearer, you see Jennifer raise a hand to attract your attention. A broad smile on her face, as she sees you. Michael walks at her side, wrapped warmly against the chill air, his gaze darts between the various other park visitors. He scans for other runners, as he walks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelatedly, he raises his hand, \"Hey, Nate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick check of your watch, shows the last few seconds of the timer counting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn midstep, Michael flickers away, and Michelle steps into the redefined reality. She doesn't even stumble, opening your arms wide, you welcome her with a hug. Her soft chest pressing against yours, the warm knitted jumper masking her curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she pats you on the back, and you separate, you see Jennifer's been extending her authority, her dominance. Almost hidden in her scarf, and pulled-low hat, you see a gag in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://68.media.tumblr.com/df2b20e5eefcf8fee794ed7a37828862/tumblr_orsh9fHZ6A1w2lwkto1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://68.media.tumblr.com/df2b20e5eefc...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Wah whnnn</i>.\" she mumbles around the ring. A trickle of drool, slipping from her lips to vanish in the collar and scarf around her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes widen, as her hands dart up to her new face, a garbled squawk as they brush over her bust. Feverishly, trembling fingers, she reaches around her gag, scrabbling for the buckle to release the gag, to allow her to shriek her fear-fuelled shriek of terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chill air whorls from Jennifer's nostrils as she snorts her amusement.

The two of you do nearly everything together and share many personality traits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou type in his full name, and to your surprise, a perfect render of your best friend fills the screen. He's a tall, well built man of 26, his average sized genitals hang bare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enjoy girls who are boyish, and who have a proclivity towards some more masculine traits. The first option is labeled 'physical age'. You lower the slider by 10, giving him an outward age of 16.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the render responds to your changes, and Aaron loses several inches and a great deal of muscle mass. By the end, he looks exactly like some picture you had seen of him at that age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext you drop his height. You like petite girls, so you lower his height to 4'6\". Satisfied, you move onto his face. Even with his tiny waifish build his facial structure still maintains some masculinity. You work to change that, giving him a very attractive, yet somewhat boyish face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving to the next category, you move his body sliders around, testing various options. You finally settle on a sleek and toned, yet very feminine build. He is lithe, and has wide hips for his small frame. His hips spread his legs wide, giving him a small gap between his thin legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext you move onto his chest. While you don't want a completely flat girl, you find huge breasts to be a bit ridiculous. You select B-Cup, and his chest swells until two cute mounds form, each peaked with a perky pink nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rotate the render, pleased with the work you've done. With Aarons back turned, you notice his flat and disappointing ass. As a bit of an ass man, you move the butt slider midway, giving her a deliciously plump ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing left is his genitals.</span></div></div>",

The render's breasts morph, leaving Aarons breasts capped with heart shaped aereolas with perky nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise you find a section called multibreast. You try out several options and are thrilled with the outcome. Her torso now has 6 nipples standing proudly on her chest, each peaking a breast. Her largest B cup breasts are at the top, with the other two pairs decreasing in size down her torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe breast section is comprehensive, and includes a lactation section. Several options outline the behavior. You choose to have her lactate permanently, and her nipples swell accordingly. You opt for her breasts to produce at least a litre of milk a day, and for her to be physically unable to release it herself. She needs another person to relieve her, lest her breasts will continue to swell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is similar option for her balls. You choose to have her large testicle produce a half litre of semen a day, and like her breasts, they will swell unless relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you adjust her internal structure, modifying her body to be able to take hugely large cocks comfortably. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle to yourself. \"This is going to be awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You immediately go for the cock options and glance around the section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter selecting depilation, you watch as all the hair around your groin recedes into your flesh, leaving bare skin. You increase the length to 24 inches and 3 inches thick, and fidget as you watch your average cock swell enormously. You gradp your meaty girth in one hand and begin stroking as you skim through other options. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn option you didn't see before catches your eyes. The species submenu lists several different animals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting.\" You mutter to yourself as you select horse. Your massive cock responds almost immediately as the flesh darkens. The flesh at the base tightens and stretches, forming a sheath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stutter as the girth increases again and your cock head flares outward and flattens. Satisfied with your cock you move onto your balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nModeling them after Aaron's you make them cantaloupe sized with a production rate of three litres a day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now your almost lost in bliss as you sit in your chair stroking the full length of your cock. Another option catches your eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou select 'double' without a second thought as you continue to scan the list. As you stroke you are surprised to find something pressing against your hand.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou watch in awe as another horsecock forms below your first, and inflates up to the same size as its brother. Your testicles receive a similar change as two more cantaloupe sized balls form inside your sack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is amazing!\" You yelp as you press both cocks together and stroke them twohanded. Finally you lose control and feel the release of hot fluid shooting down your two foot shafts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStreams of semen shoot all over your desk and monitors. By the time you regain control you've created several pools of semen all over your desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue to run your cocks, which still are producing a slow and steady stream that drips down your cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find a convenient clean up option on the site, and before your very eyes, the semen evaporates and your desk is left clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour two cocks retract partway into your sheath, still leaving significant flesh exposed. You stand up, and are surprised to find your four testicles are rather heavy. They tug at your abdomen and sway as you move.</span></div></div>",

Her breasts have swollen greatly and are pressing up tightly against her tanktop. Her six nipples leave heart shaped impressions on the fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like it.\" You reply and watch Aaron remove her shirt.<br>\r\nShe squeezes desperately at her teats but it offeres no relief. \"Can you milk me please? They're so fucking sore.\" She pleads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk over to her tiny figure, your massive cocks resting at her chest-level. She blushes as you plant a firm kiss on her lips and heft her body up. She wriggles her pants off leaving her quivering sexes bare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if you do something for me.\" You reply as you position your two massive cocks beneath her. \"Sounds fair.\" She giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou press your two cocks together and lower her onto both. Her hungry cunt easily stretches to fit the girth of your two massive cocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron's engorged pussy continues to make way as the two flat tips enter her. She loses her breath as the shafts push her organs out of the way to impale her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer cock is rock hard now, and is rubbing up against your chest. Eventually you hit her limit, your two cocks nestled three quarters of the way in. Despite the massive size and her torso being distended, she seems comfortable enough, if not in calm bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grin suddenly and let go. \"Ahhh!\" She yelps as she falls backwards, away from you, still impaled. Your cocks manage to hold her up. \"Whoa.. this is new.\" She gasps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh at her helplessly held up by your massive cocks. You sit down on your bed, letting her fall forward onto you. She is at eye level with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now about your end of the deal.\" She teases. She begins stroking her own large member, letting a slow stream of precum bubble forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou oblige her and take one of her heavily swollen teats into your mouth. As you tease and suck her heart nipples, sweet milk flows into your mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stay like that for a while, extracting every bit of milk from her six breasts. By the end, she looks relieved. She tries to stand up but finds she can't quite lift her off your cocks, try as she might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa whoa, who said we're done?\" You say as you grab her waist. She looks at you funny, and you draw her in for another kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning you grab her ass and lift her up and down her shaft. Your watch your cock travel up and down her torso, distending her stomach. Each thrust is met by a small squeak from Aaron. She locks eyes with you as shes heavily penetrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour balls gurgle as the burst, shooting hot spunk inside her. \"Ahh it's so hot!\" She squealed. Her legs spasm as litres of semen enter her, filling her womb. She leans forward and hugs you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour embrace doesn't last long, as her small body is pushed away from yours by her ever-inflating stomach. The flow last for a good five minutes, and by the end, Aaron looks 6 months pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha. Holy shit.\" She giggles, feeling her huge stomach. She looks kind of ridiculous with such a heavily inflated stomach. Eventually, your cocks go flaccid and she slips off you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tries to get up off you and stand, but her new proportions causes her to stumble forward off your bed. You catch her by the leg, causing her to dangle limply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa there. I gotcha.\" You laugh as you pull her upright, and set her down. \"Thanks.\" She blushes. Her plump stomach protrudes outwards lewdly. A small stream of semen leaks from her tight cunny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta' go take care of this.\" She gestures to herself. You nod as she leaves the room. Without a second thought, you pick up your xbox controller and start playing a game, your cocks still half erect.</span></div></div>",

You're a whiz now, scrolling through menus searching for anything interesting. You stumble upon an option labled cocksleeve. You click it and do a double take atthe render's new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Several things disappeared. Her legs ceased to exist, leaving only smooth flesh that flows into her ass. Her cock was gone too, giving a clear view of her now huge pussy. As you rotate around and view her genitals, you realize that her anus is gone, replaced by a single cockhole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" You stammer. Without hesitation you save your changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud thump and a loud squeal echos down the halls of your dorm. You quickly get up and check on the source, which can only be Aaron. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open the door to find Aaron resting on the floor, rubbing her naked ass. \"You okay?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.. It's really weird. Somehow I dropped onto the floor. Almost like I was standing a second ago. Aaron was just like you selected, her huge cunt clearly displayed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pick her up and carry her back to your room under your arm. \"That was a lot of fun. I mean, earlier.\" She gushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree.\" You say as you enter and place her on your bed. \"Wanna play some COD? You ask, facing her. \"Sure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few games you get fed up with getting your ass handed to you. Right before she's about to kill you, you reach over and shove two fingers into her huge cunt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa that's cheating!\" She laughs. You flip her over onto her stomach roughly. \"You're just mad because you suuuahhh.\" She stops her sentence midway as you shove your cocks into her hole. This time you slip your full length into her with little trouble. Her cunny gobbles up your cock without a complaint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit back up, lifting her up with you. \"Whoaaa.\" She cries as she's shifted up. She is a literal cocksleeve now, her body held stiffly upright by your massively erect member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now it's a fair game.\" You laugh and pick up your controller. \"Fuck you.\" She giggles, then gasps and you buck your hips a little, bouncing her on your cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the night she acts as your cockwarmer, and eventually you both fall asleep.</span></div></div>",

You didn\u2019t even remember going to bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSleepily, you rose from your bed and mad your way to the bathroom half blind, not really registering anything. You did note due to a shiver that you were nude. Whatever happened last night you must have forgoed clothes. Not bothering to close the door behind you, you run the sink and splash some cold water on your face, finally waking yourself and seeing your reflection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost screamed. Your reflection was not you. Instead, you saw a cute girl staring back at you. She was rather cute though tomboy-ish with a short pixie cut. Looking down at your body, at her body, your memories of last night returned. Somehow, the website had goofed. Instead of turning Aaron into the woman you had created last night, you had somehow applied the changes to yourself! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran your hands door your body, noting the softness of your new feminine skin. You paused to grope your new breasts, noting that they were smaller than you expected. You did note the second and third pairs though. You teased your nips a bit, admiring the heart shaped areolas and softly moaning at their sensitivity. You ran your hands over your curvy hips and your plump ass, pleased with how that turned out. Finally, your hands found the main attraction. All the groping, caressing, and teasing had caused your new monster member to stand at attention. You gently moved your hands along the shaft of your new, bigger cock and briefly fondled your swollen balls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt good. You wanted to continue, to play with your new body even more. At the same time, however, you glanced at the computer; you should go fix this. Or at least find out why it happened to you instead of Aaron like you planned. What do you decide? </span></div></div>",

There were two things that stood out about her. Two things that were impossible to ignore, and that made her different from the other girls in the town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn short she was busty. She had few friends, with most people viewing her body as being un-Japanese, avoiding her as if afraid of sharing her shame. Almost as if, they feared some kind of contamination, to risk getting a 'Western' bust themselves.\"N<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, it was her turn to visit. Little Sakura Honda (<span class=\"clred\">\u672c\u7530\u685c</span>), was a guest in the bedroom next to his.

Even the dressing gown atop the nightie did nothing to disguise her gorgeous body. Worse, it gave it the illusion of discretion, the pretence of clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face flushing crimson, as you spot her stiffening nipples thrusting forward, even the crinkled flesh of her wide areola adding to your agitation. You scratch your itchy nose, and promise to remedy the situation. It doesn't feel like much, but you take away the bed itself, jamming it sideways into an already stuffed cupboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bare mattress is a lot lower, and looks more like a futon now. With your recent exertions, and the glimpse of soft flesh, you have to hide your growing excitement, as you leave her for the rest of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRetreating to your own bedroom, you relieve your stress, otherwise you'll never get to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut once more there's a fleshy thump, and you wake once more to the sounds of Japanese swearing. Even that sounds cute in her girlish tones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, when you hear a hiss of pain, and a gasp, fear overrules your brain, and you pop your head into the bedroom.

Even just staring at the picture reminded you of her lush lips, and the way her eyelashes fluttered. The semi-permanent coquettish look on her face. You watch the plane passengers pass in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's little doubt you could've forgotten what she looks like. Or that jiggling way her ass moves as she walks, and the synchronised bounce of her bust as a counterpoint. She's quite petite, so you strain to look over the heads of the other passengers, or between the thickly milling groups of families, and parties of company reps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you see it! A flash of red sequins! She's wearing the same dress from the photo. Perhaps as a teasing treat with fond memories of<i> 'that picture'</i>, or maybe she's afraid you won't recognise her without that as a memory aid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meu querido amigo.\" / \"My dearest friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe holds her arms wide ready for a sweeping embrace. You welcome it and her wholeheartedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crushes herself to you, and you to her. She's not grown up, any taller. But, she's definitely grown in other ways. The bustle of the airport isn't the place for that conversation, so you pick up her luggage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/da/43/ba/da43ba3eece0422bc955044128021af1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/da/43/ba/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat same hypnotic motion draws mens' eyes from every direction. Even if there's more of a bump and grind to it now. Her bust feels over-stuffed, and that ass... You feel bad thinking of it as too thicc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowing up in Rio, you're sure she's faced pressures to conform to the beach stereotype.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe keeps a constant babble of a running commentary going, but you struggle to pick out more than a word here or there. You make out: journey, family, discovery, opportunity, and a few others... But in the rapid-fire Portuguese you can't be sure of any of it. Unfortunately, at school you studied Spanish rather than Portuguese, and it all sounds a bit too nasal, just on the verge of comprehension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did impress her with your efforts, and it gave her an opportunity to practice her English, and coach you... in Spanish, and Portuguese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Voc\u00ea est\u00e1 quieto!\" / \"You''re quiet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, she stops moving. Your eyes are drawn to her bust, as she does. It's impossible to resist, your eyes just snap to the movement. Comprehension dawns in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll... stick... to... English, now.\" she says. Her pronunciation spot on, if a little stilted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting in the taxi, she starts to unwind, and the conversation flows more freely in English. You catch the driver's frequent use of the rear-view mirror, and it's not to check on the traffic. But, you can't grudge the man a view when you can't resist yourself.</span></div></div>",

The shortness of breath he'd put down to choice at the smell of the air, was truly down to the corset.

Every detail catching her attention, as she took in the sights, sounds, and smells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to constantly remind herself it was real. Stumbling up the steps to the front door. Nate belatedly realised she was home. Her shuffling feet scuffing their way up the stairs. The air inside the house, is dry and warm, the gas lights on the wall catching your attention as the reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door closes loudly behind you, \"Explain yourself, Emily. Explain that wanton display... in public...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis anger made Nate quiver, he was so much more intimidating when he was angry, and clearly towering over him. Still taller than her, as her wobbling ankles confirmed she was wearing heels. The lack of any witnesses also made her fear him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA squeak bursting from her lips, as his hand shot out. Stumbling backwards, his hand knotted into her blouse, half catching her fall... step backwards. The blouse ripped at the sudden strain, his eyes flashing with a secret delight, a fantasy triggered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn moments, he ripped the blouse to shreds. The tatters being tossed to the floor. His face was flushed, his eyes intense, as he turned his attention to her skirt. Seconds later, Nate was standing in only her underwear, in the hallway of her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind her, the noises of the street soaked through the door, muffled but still vibrant. There was no escape behind her, and no consolation in the discovery that her guesses were correct. The revelation of her corset was uncomfortable both physically with it's constriction, and emotionally, as she felt and saw her bust rise and fall with every breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fear spiked, as she saw her husband's eyes drawn to that same enticing movement. As Nate felt a modicum of power return, if she could master herself, and use her body to her advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/cee46d1ed15532e8bc3e76961fc01b1b/tumblr_pef3laAhAq1w2lwkto2_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://66.media.tumblr.com/cee46d1ed155...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn't reckoned on his speed, or her limited flexibility. He lifted her easily from her feet, twisting and planting himself in a chair, with Nate's breath huffing from her body, as she landed across his lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathless, and unable to protest, she dreaded, knew what was coming before, the first resounding slap landed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer feet kicked wildly, hitting nothing but empty air, as she futilely fought the rump tingling punishment. Sure that there were crimson hand prints on each of her sumptuous, rippling ass cheeks. Nate was finally helped from his lap to stand. Her hands shifting as if she wanted to cover her crotch, or protect her burning ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an excitement, a rush to her blood, as it raced through her veins. A fluttering in her stomach, a pleasure that she tried to dismiss as confusion, an eager hunger to her.... <i>her pussy</i>. She crossed her hands in front of her afraid of her reaction and how it might encourage him further. Afraid to show her face, and reveal she hid her smile. That meant that her vision was centred on the bulge in his trousers, and equally clear excitement at his behaviour and her response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer already flushed complexion darkened even further, as she spotted a maid hovering in the doorway. Nate wasn't sure what expression she had, or quite how to read it... <i>envy.... embarrassment... empathy...</i></span></div></div>",

A touch more sympathetic she drapes the coat around your shoulders. It's plush interior warm and comforting against your skin.

The copper-haired maid hails a taxi with a surprisingly loud whistle. In moments, taxi stops. Pulling back on the reins the horse slows and Mary hands him the payment, and his instructions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe carriage shifts, as she helps you into the hansom cab. Following behind, she guides your hips to sit down. A hiss of pain flares on contact with the seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Mistress.\" she attempts a bobbing curtsy in the tight confines of the cab before squeezing in beside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe carriage sets off, just as she sits driving her deeper into the seat. It feels like a theme park ride, as you speed through the London streets. The horses full round arse taking a significant part of your field of vision. Mary is just as distracted, as a maid she doesn't often ride in a cab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe part that doesn't feel like a ride is the bouncing from the rough cobbles, and the way your and Mary's hips constantly brush.

The width barely enough for a husband and wife, or a business man alone, the thought of two broad rumped women travelling together clearly not entering the designer's thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the hansom pulls into Harley street, you feel the pace slow, until the carriage stops with a whinny, and Mary frees herself from the seat. Taking your hand, you allow yourself to be lead into the Doctor's waiting room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankly, you're glad to be away from your husband, and his hands. The waiting room is empty, and so Mary pulls the cord to summon attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary sits beside you, part consort, part body-guard.

You didn't check the time, but knew your return had to be soon. As she guided you to the make-up table, with it's folding mirrors and aromatic scent, you felt the mental tug, as the recall pulse pulled you back to the lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you even open your eyes, you hear the voices, the questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cgrey\">\"Did it work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did you go?\"</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor all their enthusiasm, there's scepticism in their voices.

You don't resist John's insistent grip, or his groping, mauling fingers. The difference in strength is too great, your body isn't made for anything physical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as you walk, you see other things that make you squirm in your skin. The women.... the <i>other </i>women, are just as sexually dressed as yourself. Their clothes, such as they are, designed to display their bodies to maximum effect. The male appreciation, is just as blatant, the open leering of them... of you, makes you want to hunch your shoulders, to hide or at least minimise the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't stop, at looking, as you see the open brushing of them.

Susan looks at you quizzically from the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" she asks slightly concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back in sec.\" you say slightly panicked. You rush to the bathroom and check your reflection. Before you stands the image of what you would look like if you were an extremely pretty girl. Her face is made up perfectly and her body seems soft without muscles. You run your hands over yourself in disbelief alarmed at how the girl in the mirror follows you. You also notice that you are considerably smaller than you were probably loosing about 9 inches from your original 5 ft 10 if not more You reach under your dress and pantyhose and find your cock encased in a pretty pair of pink panties but at least its still there. You try to come to grips with the situation and calm down taking deep breathes. Eventually you succeeded and decided you best try to figure things out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go back in your room to find Susan lay on Michael's bed. \"Feeling better?\" she asks without looking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm fine\" you lie, \"I hope you don't mind but I have to do a bit of reading for my next essay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure go ahead\" she says flippantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou settle back in your desk chair and cross your legs instinctively to remain modest in your dress. You log back on and start browsing Wikipedia in search of answers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter around a half an hourof browsing, you discover that your well intentioned change to give women equal rights sooner has had dramatic repercussions on the time line. Apparently after the 14th century women's rights escalated hugely and spread like wild fire becoming a global movement. The quiet masses of wives, widows and wet nurses all banded together to bring about a brighter future for womankind. By the mid 1600's, women had achieved equal rights to men in all fields of life like inheritance, education and pay. By the 1800's because of their new found liberty, woman had become the most prominent figures in society. They were the richest, the smartest professors and inventors and held the majority of power in governments. Men were still present at the highest rungs of society but their place was diminishing quickly. By the 1950's women had complete power. Their success was not caused by keeping men down but by outshining them in every field. Women were now the breadwinners while men were either homemakers or had jobs like child carer, air stewardess, nurse or secretary. This marked a point of now return because by the 1970's women had decided that a change of apparel was in order since men were no longer required to be strong or dominant they should be pretty and pleasing to look at so as a result male fashion became increasingly feminine while women's clothes became more practical and masculine. Woman also became stronger than men too as they would work out to present themselves as the ideal protector to attract men while men were encouraged by the media and fashion to become more delicate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you reach the date today, gender roles have completely reversed, men have long hair and wear makeup while little boys play with dolls and day dream about marrying the perfect women who with take care of them. Equality still exists but women do have much more opportunity than men with there now collectively only being 9 men in high political positions and jobs such as police officer and fire fighter being considered to be too dangerous for men. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course many revolutionary breakthroughs in technology, science and medicine have occurred, many more than there had been in the old reality such as a way in which males can get pregnant during a form of intercourse, carry a baby and give birth which you note is now the most popular way of starting a family as the women would not have to leave work. What is striking however is that their doesn't seem to have been any wars since the 1700's. Peace has reigned and prosperity is only increasing. It is estimated that within 10 years starvation will be eliminated and in preparation for the increasing population, Africa has almost been totally irrigated so it may serve as the worlds breadbasket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slump back in your chair. \"How did women mange to accomplish so much on their own?\" you think. \"The world is almost perfect.... Yeah but not perfect for me\" you look down at your dress and grimace. You open the tab of reality shift to try and reverse the change back having had enough.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes it work      </span></div></div>",

Your trapped in this female dominated world looking like a teenager's cute dream girl. How could you have been so stupid as to not read the instructions on something as important as this. What are you going to do for six months? How will you cope? Your from a completely different world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInterrupting your thought process, the room door opens and Michael enters, as least you think its Michael. He is wearing paint on skinny jeans a capri top and 3 inch heels but his face is what surprises you. He is beautiful, perhaps not as much so as you but the way his long blonde hair frames his face is enchanting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Nate\" he says effeminately. Dropping his purse. \"Oh hey babe\" he says noticing Susan. Susan rises and wraps her arms around Michael, pulling him in for a long kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey yourself\" she says after parting lips. \"I booked us a table tonight at your favorite restaurant. Reservation is for 8, I'll pick you up at 7:30.\" At this she breaks the embrace walks past Michael, pinching his ass on the way past causing him to squeal with laughter and then leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't she great.\" He finally sighs after recovering from the kiss. \"I'm a lucky guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er yeah she sure is\" you say trying to adapt by matching his effeminate voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shame you don't have someone, your more than cute enough, I guess some of us just have a bit more flare for these sorts of things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize that Michael is showing off and are annoyed by his arrogance and then it comes to you.

A small flash of light follows and then nothing. You look around to see if anything has changed but all you see is Michael coming his hair in the mirror. You check the computer screen. \"You have selected perfect relationship, you should expect changes shortly. You sigh and lean back in the computer chair. \"Well that's something to look forward to \" you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand from your chair and stretch. \"I think I might walk through the campus park.\" you say to Michael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright hun, see you later.\" He says absent-mindedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab what you assume is your purse, exit your room and head down stairs to the entrance, and out through the front door. Bracing summer air fills your lungs as you emerge, the weather is warm and suits your dress perfectly. You walk down the driveway of your hall onto the scenic walkway that cuts through a beautiful 60 acre park with a lake at the centre and student dorms scattered here and there. Something about this world seems brighter, Its as if the whole world has been given a lick of fresh paint. The sky is bluer, grass is greener and the water of the distant lake glistens majestically. You were nervous about walking around looking the way you do but you are soon put at ease by your surroundings. You let out a contented sigh and head for the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk, you pass the occasional group of students. Groups of boys in skirts and short shorts chatter and giggle together while gangs of girls in sports jackets ogle you but not s much to make you feel uncomfortable, just enough to let you know what they see is appreciated. What you notice most is that people seem more happy, people smile more as if all contented. You ponder just how much better this world may be for everyone. As you reach the lake, you gasp at the waters clarity and watch fish lazily move across the bottom. Just as you peer in for a closer look, you lose footing and and start falling of the bank into the water below. Time stops as you come to terms with what is going on and accept your inevitable and damp fate but no splash comes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha\" comes a strong female voice you feel to strong arms around you. You open your eyes to see tanned skinned girl in her early twenties smiling down at you. Her blonde hair is cut very short and is gelled in a boyish fashion and there is not a spot of makeup on her face. Despite this, she is very attractive in an authoritative way thanks to her strong features. Your heart begins to flutter as her deep brown eyes stare into your cute baby blue ones.  \"That could have been nasty\" she says finally and sets you back on your feet properly. Its at this point you notice that she is probably just under a foot taller than you, standing around six foot, \"Im glad I caught you, I wouldn't want you to ruin your dress, especially since it makes you look that adorable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush red at this, emasculated at being rescued like a feeble maiden and also greatly flattered by the flirty compliment of this attractive woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm thanks, I guess I owe you one\" you say shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah don't mention it. I make a point of trying to rescue one damsel from peril a day, I'm Ricki by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Nate\" you say still blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleasure to meet you Nate. So if you weren't planning on falling in anymore bodies of water, would you like to get cup of coffee with me, my treat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are taken aback by the sudden nature of this development. This must be your perfect girl, you were expecting someone more feminine and pretty but you aren't complaining now. Already you feel yourself becoming smitten with Ricki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like that\" you say with a demure smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greet lets go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk together down the path to a small cafe near your dorm building. Ricki ensures that she walks at a speed you can keep up with with your new smaller body. You chat about how beautiful the campus is thanks to use the clean power generator which provides abundant energy to the entire campus without fumes of any kind. Eventually you reach the cafe and Ricki tells you to take a seat outside in the sun while she gets the drinks. As she walks away you notice how toned her body is. Not ripped in the strictest sense but very fit with strong muscles. Watching her makes you heart flutter again slightly but then you shake your head. \"This world must be getting to me\" you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute later, Ricki returns with two mugs. One is plain while the other is pink with a huge love heart on it with whipped cream rising from it. Predictably she hands this one to you. \"I know the guy behind the counter he says its the best hot chocolate you will ever find, I know won't be sweet as you but I hope you like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason a girlish giggle escapes your lips at this that you fail to stifle. You opt to fill your mouth with the hot chocolate to stop any further feminine outbursts. You aren't prepared for the incredible sweet and creamy taste that follows, it has to be one of the most delicious things you have ever tried. Your eyes widen and you take another sip to make sure. Your insides warm pleasantly and a smile of contentment crosses your face. Ricki grins at you, knowing she has chosen wisely. \"This is delicious\" you say after another sip. \"I've never tasted anything like it, you have to try some.\" you say to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you like it but no thanks, its way too sweet for me.\" You take another sip. \"So Nate, I'd love to know more about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next hour is filled with you two getting to know each other. It turns out that Ricki is studying air-space engineering and physics to become a commercial airline pilot and when asked what you do, upon a brief investigation of your student card in your purse, you are no longer studying history but travel and airline hospitality to become a stewardess. An odd coincidence but hey. You two really hit it off, laughing, joking and Ricki's flirtatious compliments never seem to cease, nor do you cute giggles. Sadly though, your hot chocolate does end and so it would seem your time together.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh look at the time\" Ricki says looking at her watch, \"I better get going, I've got a party to get ready for later. She pauses. \"I don't suppose that you would want to come with me?\" she asks, \"You could bring one of your friends too so it doesn't seem awkward about not knowing anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love to come\" you say happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brilliant\" She exclaims \"Could I get your number so I can give you the details?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that this was her plan all along, you fish your phone (which is now in a case covered with flowers and hearts) out of your purse and exchange numbers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool.\" She says and you both stand. You both turn different ways leaving the coffee shop and she bids you a cheery \"See ya.\"</span></div></div>",

What was she like?\" he sits up on his bed and pats the space next to him, indicating you sit. \"Tell me all about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recount the events of the afternoon with you and Ricki to Michael who giggles and gasps elaborately throughout your telling and just as you tell him about your invitation to the party later he speaks up. \"Well your in luck hun. Susan called just before you got back and apparently the reservation she made at the restaurant has been cancelled by accident because of overbooking or something so that means I'm free tonight and would be more than happy to be your plus one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just want to meet Ricki don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey what can I say I'm transparent but not as transparent as your dress is going to be for the party. You want to make Ricki drool. Go get a shower and leave picking an outfit to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can argue, you are ushered into the en-suit bathroom and with the door being closed behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'm going to have to get used to this\" you think with a sigh and then strip out of your clothes, hang them neatly on a rack and then step into the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter turning on the stream and acclimatizing to the temperature, you start to wash your self. You notice now naked that you are totally devoid of body hair from the shoulders down and to your surprise, you instinctively pick the right body washes and moisturizers from the legion of feminine product bottles in the shower that before you would have been clueless to. You wash, rinse, shampoo and condition your luxurious hair thoroughly and then turn off the water and start to dry yourself in a fluffy towel. When dry, you are astounded by the softness of your skin. It is smooth and silky, easily the softest thing you have ever touched and each time it rubs against itself it creates a very pleasurable sensation. \"Perhaps there have been advances in cosmetics too.\" you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then proceed to blow-dry and curl your hair. Your body seems to be on autopilot, knowing every technique to achieve a truly adorable look. When finished you gasp at your reflection as even without makeup, you could easily pass for one a very girl back in the old world. Wrapping a towel around your body for modesty, you gather up your clothes and exit the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find Michael in front of your bed which now has what looks like an outfit left on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look cute babe. I picked an outfit out of your wardrobe and left it here.\" He motions to the bed. \"Its extra sexy, I can't wait to see you in it. Anyway its my turn in the shower.\" He hurries past you into the bathroom carrying a small bundle of clothes and closes the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that not wearing the outfit he selected would definitely hurt his feelings, you decide Michael's choice would be fine. You hang up your summer dress, put your panties in the hamper and put your nude pantyhose back in your sock (now hosiery) drawer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning your attention to the outfit left, you walk over to your bed and realize that it is a sheer, sleeved black dress. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51%2B8X445C3L._UY606_.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51...</a><br>\r\nUnderneath it are a pair of lacy black panties and a pair of sheer nude luxury pantyhose still in the box. At the foot of the bed are a pair of intimidating black platform stilettos. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/98/3f/a9/983fa91750308f6912d206aff2277d7a.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping the towel, you quickly pull on the panties to cover you nakedness and then unbox the pantyhose. The material of them is a factor of 100 softer than the previous pair your had worn in the day and as you roll them up your smooth legs the sensation produced is indescribable and when on properly, running your hand delicately over your inner thigh causes you to shiver with arousal. You pick up the box and read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"New second skin, nerve interface pleasure enhancement material. One touch and your all her's.\" The price tag reads only $9.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This really is an advanced world if technology like this is readily available..\" you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter tearing yourself away from your legs. you hold up the dress to examine it. The tag on the inside says that the sheer material of the dress is made from the same material as the pantyhose so as you pull the dress on you brace yourself for the coming sensations. It takes you a few minutes to get a little used to your new hyper-sensitive self but after a some tentative touches and caresses, you figure it out. Being touched feels really good. The dress itself clings to you tightly with a small bandage of non-sheer material covering your nipples and the skirt ending at your mid-thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, you hear Michael's voice through the bathroom door. \"Hey Nate, you'll have to do your makeup at the vanity, I'm getting dressed in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay\" you call back and look to the vanity which previously was where Michael's xbox and playstation resided. It is now occupied by every variety of makeup imaginable. You shudder as you think how far you have come in dressing like a girl, but thoughts of Ricki then replace these thoughts and you sit down at the vanity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike with your hair, your body starts to apply makeup to your already feminine face. Its like you are trapped in your own body without having a say in what it does. After twenty minutes of pro makeup work, you stop and take in your reflection. Your jaw drops as you stair into the face of the most beautiful girl you have ever seen. You were pretty before but with makeup, you are breathtaking. You bite your now glossy red lips slightly. You don't know whether to be proud of your appearance or revolted. \"Why didn't I just read the instructions to that stupid site\" you think briefly but then you are overwhelmed by thoughts like \"Will Ricki think I look good, Have I used too much makeup, am I over dressed?\" The world seems to be altering your mind slightly, which would explain your ability to make yourself look good so expertly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door to the bathroom flies open revealing Michael in a red strapless mini dress with red heels that look lower then yours. His blonde hair is over one shoulder and his makeup, like yours, has made him look stunning. He squeaks joyfully when he sees you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look adorable hun, Ricki isn't going to know what hit her. Come on let me see you with the heels on.\"\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou oblige and slide them on your small feet. When standing you wobble uncertainly for a moment but then you get your balance. To your surprise however, your perspective hasn't changed. You expected to be higher but you are still at your same short height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why am I not taller?\" you say confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on silly you know they're holo heels. All the sexy benefits of wearing heels without the added height, you know that girls don't like a tall date. You would have thought they would have made them less hard to walk in though with all that fancy technology. Maybe they do it for posture\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe is indeed right as you take you first step in them you almost fall. \"Come on Nate, your acting like a teen trying on heels for the first time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, the part of your brain that controlled you with the makeup kicks in and you start walking like a pro in the heels, putting one foot in front of the other to sway your hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go.\" Michael says. \"We better get going, you don't want to keep Ricki waiting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

He counted over 5 different creams, and believe it or not he knew every cream function and purpose. Including the penis lubrificting cream for a deeper penetration. At the center of the desk was a pile of magazines. He couldn't believe there was a male version of Vogue, Cosmopolitan and O magazine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell\" he thought \"it must be a sort of prank done by a tv show or by the person who sent the site invitation\".

She was wearing a tight skinny jeans and a tank top which let her show her solid abs.Covering the tank top was one of the jackets reserved for the football team players. Her hair was shorter cut in a stylish way, but it seemed shorter and practical. And she had a mild tan, like she spent all the day outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClose to her was Jennifer, she is Michael's sister. She was a cute girl with her long blonde hair, perfect skin and a flawless manicure. She usually looked like she was trying to follow the latest trends and brands. But now she looked different. Her hair was kept long, but not as longer as she used to wear. It also didn't look that well kept and the shine which made it look so gorgeous is gone. her body was also different. She looked strong, her abs were solid and ripped, with a brief washboard being visible. She was wearing a tank top and tight jeans as well. But she wasn't wearing the jock jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking for something Summerfield?\" Susan asked in a voice tone which almost sounded like she was mocking her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just was testing a theory\" he said observing both girls<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A theory\" - Jennifer said - \"that is interesting.

If you can free your hands the rest of your body can't be far behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the weight of your entire body on them, any movement is difficult. Cursing your own short-sightedness, you wish you were 'smaller', knowing you have to roll onto your stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn opinion comes to mind, one you hadn't shared, but are coming to realise it's virtue. \"More than a handful is a waste.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou repeat the words inside your head, even your thoughts jar as you hear them in what must be your new voice. It's breathy, sensual, and begs for attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice from elsewhere in the room, your old voice. \"Bigger is better, but biggest is best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have barely a second to prepare yourself before you body is ripped from head to toe, with that rush of excitement, a tingle in your stomach, an ache in your loins, a twitching hunger from muscles you didn't want to consider. But, your words came true again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were now cursed with TITS. At this size, no other word was adequate. These damned things were each bigger than your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c3/77/b2/c377b232e664bc8ff56f8144e1c66eca.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c3/77/b2/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMewling and drooling through the gag, you fight your growing need to whimper.</span></div></div>",

You're certainly blessed. You could certainly do without the stockings and suspenders. You remind yourself with a calm you don't feel. This is meant to be a fantasy to be indulged and enjoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything feels more alive, even the air smells sweeter. You wonder if that's just you new senses, and if you'll discover things taste differently now... with different taste buds. From the periphery of your vision, you see other changes. Subtle changes to the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhirling around to your dresser, you feel the slosh of your bust, as it catches up, then keeps going. You'll have to get used to that, you tell yourself. Though not for long, the dresser now has a three-fold mirror atop it rather than your books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few, expensive perfumes and make-up things are there, along with a couple of hardback books. Well, you guess they're expensive from their ornate bottles, and so forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting at a stool, you aren't surprised to find it's at the perfect height for you. The perfect distance to see your face from every angle. It's oddly comforting, as you find various names swimming to the surface. Your fantasy woman knowing how to make her look her best. You squirm where you sit, wondering how superficial you were as a guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you squirm, you wonder how much of that is the stool's padding, and how much your own full rump. You scowl at your reflection, a woman for only a few seconds and already wondering if your bum is too big. Perhaps your fantasy is as superficial as your were... No! As you are... You will return to being Nate, once this experiment is over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlicking through the top hardback, you find the pages are thick and stiff. There aren't any photos in it, and riffling through you see only simple black and white sketches added to illustrate there instructions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slam it closed, when you realise it's a book about becoming a beautician, and applying make-up. Your college course on French, Japanese and international business. Well, it seems like you're majoring in becoming a beautician.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding yourself drawn to admire your make-up, the subtle colours, and the shade of your lipstick. You rise from the stool with a start wanting to escape those thoughts... that grow more interesting, more intriguing, as you admire your reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot caring if you make a display of yourself, you rush to the window. You need a breath of fresh air, this is one shock after another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smart, but not as smart as me.\" Your old voice seems to whisper from nowhere. Sticking your head out the window, you take as deep a breath as you can. Only the tight corset limiting your gulps. A zephyr slips over your exposed flesh, and you feel it goosebump in protest. Too much exposed flesh. Your sudden appearance also draws a few eyes, and it's the male ones that keep looking. Ducking down and retreating back inside, you both crack your head against the window frame, and your bust against the window sill. The impact setting the girls in motion, your hands rising to shield them, and heave them back in, if they escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSinking to the floor, your back to the wall. Your legs clutched against your chest. You can only take the shallowest of breaths. Allowing your legs to splay out in front of you. There were more changes out there, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour errant lewd curiosity had had wider consequences than you realised. Shutting your eyes, against all those changes, you try to bring them into some kind of coherent order. You dismiss the eyelashes, you feel fluttering aching to open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it hits you in waves. The tree in the yard wasn't so tall. The students dress was more staid. The buildings looked fresher... newer... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air truly was cleaner and clearer. With a start your eyes snap back open. You hadn't seen any cars... or any modern technology. Shaking your head, even as you knew it was true. You'd seen a buggy... a horse-drawn buggy... and the nearby road wasn't paved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realise, your desire to see your fantasy woman has taken you back in time to when she... when you existed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A woman knows her place.\" That same irritating voice from before... from your future taunted out of the empty air.</span></div></div>",

She was in a diaphanous red baby-doll. The high-waisted thong passed over the swell of her hip, before diving deep into the crevice of her gorgeous ass cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only the imagined reflection that stop Nate from tugging invasive thong back from it's hiding place. The soft bubble-gum pink nails added to her air of vulnerability. \"Hi... I'm Natalie.\" she practised her purring speech. Every word came as a sultry tease, an eager to please invitation. Still nervous, Natalie's tongue darted out licking already moist lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, Natalie was aware of how much bigger the room was now. With a shake of her she resaw it. Knowing she was shorter now.

Whether it was her new sex, height or clothes she felt incredibly vulnerable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't hide those...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate's voice seemed to come from the past, chastising Natalie for her attempts to look even smaller and less dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Embrace your sexuality.\" Nate advised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis words like a command, made her straighten up. Shoulders back and chest out. She had to obey and impress her man. If she didn't earn her champion she'd be vulnerable, timid and overwhelmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still squeaked a protest, a surprise, as she gawped at her reflection. Her bust swelling, over filling the cups of her outfit. Trembling she nodded her head, belatedly approving of the changes imposed on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/dd/ee/63/ddee63c16c54467ef03362c2eaad291b.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/dd/ee/63/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she had to be a damsel in distress, she'd be a prize worth winning.

Your husband, once the most desirable boy in highschool, has turned into an insufferable jerk. Yet as much as you want to, you can't leave him because you rely on his income to pay the bills. You don't have any qualifications for getting a job on your own, because you decided to stay home and have his kids instead of going to college. Your children, once the pride of your life, now seem to take pleasure in disappointing you at every opportunity. Your once beautiful body has melted down into the chubby form of the average middle American housewife.

Your family is just one major disappointment after another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour husband is horrible. Back when you first met him, Jack Williams was your dream boy. Captain of the football team, the most popular boy in school <b>and</b> top of his class, Jack seemed like the perfect boyfriend back when you were in high school. You got married right out of high school, and you thought you were happy. But as the years went on, you came to see the man behind that charming facade. Jack is a horrible man, ready to get angry at the drop of a hat. Though he's never hit you, it has come very close so many times. He's insufferable to be around, treating you as his property, and the problem is that you can't do anything to stop it. He convinced you back when you were just a young idiot that you didn't need to go to college because he would always be able to supply for you. He said you should just stay home and take care of the children you were going to have... and you swallowed it hook, line, and sinker. Now you are stuck with him, and he knows hit. He constantly holds it over your head that at any time he can take away your money, leaving you a prisoner of your own (admittedly nice) house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour first daughter, 31 year old Beth, is a beast. She stands about 6' 9\", and isn't afraid to throw her weight around. She's also extremely muscular, built like the proverbial Mack truck. Back when she was little,she was a kind girl, but after she got into highschool and a friend got her into weight lifting she seemed to enjoy becoming an alpha bitch. You suspect her of taking steroids, though haven't been able to prove it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour son, 26 year old Michael, is the biggest disappointment. He's a genius, probably able to do anything he wanted and make millions doing it. He's also a slacker. He <b>could</b> do anything, but he's so lazy he's taken a minimum wage job as a night guard in a broken down parking garage. As a child he was so bright, your expected him to become an astronaut or a doctor, but somewhere along the line, he just stopped caring. The last time you talked to him on the phone, he brushed your concerns off with a \"whatever, mom.\" before hanging up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour youngest, 17 year old Amy, is a brat. She was a beautiful child, born much later in your life, and you spoiled her a little when she was young. But as she started to grow up she came to expect to be spoiled... and of course, your husband sees nothing wrong with that. After all, nothing's too good for his little princess. She constantly badmouths you, belittling every thing you do and say. She also is a manipulative little bitch, good at playing one side against the other to get what she wants... usually at your expense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you think about who to change, you look down. Why not yourself? Back when you were in high school, you were very attractive. You could have had your pick of any one of the boys. Now you're a dumpy, chubby little middle aged lady. You were on the track team, one of the best in the district. Now you probably can't even run a hundred yards without getting out of breath. Your once striking black hair has started to become faded and grey. Yes, you could definitely use some changing yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when the text box comes up with <b>Who would you like to change?</b> You enter:</span></div></div>",

You can't imagine Beth, ever quietly settling into a domestic life, her strength and determination is mental as well as physical. The hope of a strong mother-daughter bond a distant faded memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also feel guilty about failing to inspire Michael to try harder, despite his clear intelligence, he's taken the path of least resistance, his grades were excellent, and if he'd wanted there were grants, loans and all kinds of assistance available for someone with his brilliance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy had her own brilliance, although it was harder to admire. As the youngest, she was perhaps spoiled as a child. Her constant barbs, draw a smile from Jack, as she twists him around her little finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look to the reality shift page, ready to remake yourself. Ready to put yourself beyond all those criticisms, insults and those nagging self-doubts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyping your name into the main page, a wire frame avatar appears dominating the screen. It spins slowly on the spot, with an array of data and menus available at the side. You recognise it as your own body, slightly disappointing, slightly too heavy and lacking that vital spark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo reignite Jack's passion, and for your own pleasure you retype your weight. You find the controls intuitive, and fun to watch the effect it has on the screen version of yourself. Tweaking also the waist and hips figures to something more flattering. Despite the visit it all still feels a little unreal, a playful curiosity has you wondering about a bigger bust. What's the attraction for men, your own bust a slightly flabby B-cup feels like holding to the past. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou select yourself as the only person aware of the changes, and make her...  you... an expert with cosmetics. Instantly, the avatar shifts to zoom in on the face, and you see a woman who could be fifty, but would certainly pass for younger. A sense of guilt surfaces as you can't imagine being that firm at fifty either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA snarl flashes across your face, as you hate that self-doubt, those negative feelings. Your damned family would have you deny yourself any pleasures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stab the button, 'Initiate Change', and you're taken by a moment of dizziness. Squeezing your eyes shut against a flare of pain, you see the outline of your new reflection vaguely in the black mirror of the computer screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" you purr.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could certainly pass as a sister to Beth, with ease. Although your bust, would certainly mark you as less athletic than her. You'd easily attract more attention than her. You rub your shoulders, already aware of the tension... the pain that comes with a bigger bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dismiss the idea of adjusting the girls, as cowardice. It's too soon to change your mind, and you don't want to surrender to the past you quite so soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to the bedroom dresser, and the mirror there, you get a proper look at yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://68.media.tumblr.com/089ecc2726abae65f8cacdae7873d2e7/tumblr_othmgrXiCF1w2lwkto4_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://68.media.tumblr.com/089ecc2726ab...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realise you've married beneath yourself, you're straight black mane of hair, gives you a deep gothic mystery.</span></div></div>",

YES or NO?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot sure what it meant you press yes and time stands still and you are frozen in your computer chair.

You look out of place still dressed in your comfortable home clothes, but nobody seems to notice or care.  You watch Beth as she stands in behind another young woman that is doing bicep curls.  Clearly she is supposed to be training with this girl, who is in pretty good shape herself, but instead Beth is looking over her and flexing her own gargantuan arms in the mirror.  Beth is wearing nothing but a skimpy sports bra and the shortest and tightest Lycra shorts you have ever seen, allowing as much of her massive and shredded body to show as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn Claire, look at that.  My guns are fuckin' sick!  I guess you've made some okay gains, but you or nobody in this gym will ever look as good as me.\"  Although you don't agree with her attitude, she's right.  She's been lifting seriously for 15 years and at 6'9\" and naturally large she had a body that easily added muscle.  She was without a doubt the biggest and most muscular person, not just woman, in the entire gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again your surroundings begin to shimmer and things start to change.  When your eyes clear a few changes are obvious.  First, Beth is dressed more modestly than before, though no less massive.  Her bra has turned into a tanktop, still displaying her impressive physique.  Instead of lording her superiority over Claire, she is politely and properly coaching her through the lifts.  Claire looks the better for it too, as she is curling heavier dumbbells with larger and more defined biceps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last change you don't even notice until your daughter looks up and sees you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom!\" She shouts as she hurries over and scoops you into a bear hug. \"I see I've finally talked you into joining.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down and see that you are dressed for exercise.  You're pretty fit for a woman your age, but had never before stepped foot in a weight room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So.  Are you ready for your first session?</span></div></div>",

However, she wore a genie costume -- a very fancy-looking one, no less; her hair was in a ponytail and she wore diaphanous baggy pants, a sequin-bedecked top that was little more than a push-up bra, a fair amount of gold jewels, and even a pair of slippers with long toes that curled up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff then realized she looked at least 20 years younger than she was \"supposed\" to look -- maybe only in her early 20s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Master?\" she responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, so it's okay if we have cake for dinner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled. \"Of course, Master.

Jeff turned to see a giant chocolate cake sitting in the middle of the rickety dining room table, with three place settings of only a small plate and dessert fork. Stunned, he just stared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, a car pulled into the driveway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, good timing -- Mistress is home,\" said Jeff's genie mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mistress,\" Jeff whispered to himself.

Mom, I wish I had a Lamborghini instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mistress,\" said their mother, and did the \"blinking\" thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie looked out the window and said, \"Nice!\"  She then turned away from the window and said, \"I wish I was in a 'date' outfit already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGenie Mom made the gesture, and Stephanie was suddenly clad in a blue minidress with a cleavage-revealing V-front that was so deep it also showed off her pierced navel. Matching blue platform-heeled shoes were on her feet; diamond jewelry sparkled from her neck, wrists, and ears; and her face was heavily made up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at the incredibly sexy outfit and again said, \"Nice. I just wish I could dress like this at school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff wondered how that would be granted, but instead their mother just said, \"Mistress, I'm sorry, but --\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie rolled her eyes and interrupted, \"I know, that wish would change things enough at our school that it would affect both me and Jeff, and I can't make wishes that affect both of us unless we both agree.\" She looked pointedly at her brother. \"It's not my fault he's a prude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff wasn't completely certain what was going on, but he did know enough to protest, \"I'm not a prude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I know,\" said this version of his sister. \"You've just always been worried about making huge changes to the world using Mom's powers. Or even little changes! God, why do we still live in this stupid house?\" She waved her arms in frustration and her bracelets clinked. She stopped, took a deep breath, and turned to her mother. \"Mom, what's for dinner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe replied, \"Chocolate cake, as Master wished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie turned back to Jeff, first looking surprised, then annoyed, then resigned. She pulled out a chair and sat down at the table. \"I wish we had glasses of cold milk,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff sat down as a glass appeared at each place setting, as Stephanie leaned over to him and muttered, \" Imagine if I actually had to watch what I eat. You're just lucky Dad wished we'd be in perfect health forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff almost dropped the slice of cake he was serving himself. So in this reality, his father had been the master of a genie, and had cared about his kids enough to make at least one wish to benefit both of them -- but why wasn't he still around?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta admit, I forgot how good this stuff is,\" said Stephanie. \"I wish the next guy I blow has cum that tastes like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff choked on the big swig of milk he'd just taken, and some of the fluid escaped his mouth and dribbled down the front of his shirt. His mother merely crossed her arms, fork still in one hand, and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told you you're a prude,\" said Stephanie, with a grin on her face revealing teeth that should have been chocolate-stained but were a brilliant white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me go clean up,\" Jeff said, getting up from the table and practically running to the hall bathroom he shared with Stephanie. He grabbed a washcloth, wet it in the sink and used it to dampen his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went over the situation in his mind. \"Okay, so if my sister could have anything she wanted, she'd turn herself into a a bitchy nymphomaniac who drives super-expensive sports cars? Meanwhile, I'm pretty much the same, but --\" He thought for a moment -- had the reality shift that had made his mother a genie tried to keep things as \"normal\" as possible, and therefore had made it that he hadn't done anything \"big\"?

Although it's a pretty big change when you just want a more compliant mother, but you end up with a genie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff admitted, \"I was wondering that myself.

He never told us exactly where.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are there more genies out there? Any other magical creatures?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If there are, they're well-hidden. Mom can't detect any. Well, I guess whatever's powering this website. Anyway, they soon fell in love, got married, had a daughter, then a son two years later. They tried to hide the fact that Mom was a genie from us, but I was smart enough to put the pieces together and figured it out by the time I was 5.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of pieces?\" asked Jeff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I learned to spell a lot sooner than they thought I did, and Dad sure liked to suggest things to Mom by saying 'W-I-S-H.' And I think Dad never realized how thin the walls are in this house, because I overheard a few things late at night. Oh, and the big one -- I realized Mom couldn't leave the house alone, or just with you or me -- she had to be with Dad, and she couldn't even be too many steps away from him. It's because she can't be too far from her bottle unless she's close to her Master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff nodded. He realized he'd seen the bottle, sitting innocuously on the bookshelf in the living room, as if it were just a random knick-knack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie smiled. \"And then I happened to see a rerun of 'I Dream of Jeannie.' Knowing what I know now -- I wonder if the creator of that show actually had a genie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or the website used 'I Dream of Jeannie' as a part of creating this reality,\" Jeff pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis sister rolled her eyes. \"Dad wasn't an astronaut, and we don't have a wacky neighbor who knows Mom is a genie. Mom's outfit shows her belly button, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like mother, like daughter,\" Jeff said, casually pointing a finger at Stephanie's skimpy outfit. \"So, uh... where <i>is</i> Dad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's not in the picture anymore, right?

So I guess Mom's not quite powerful enough to grant all of these wishes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we'll have to use this website,\" said Stephanie. She looked back at her computer. \"Guess my program hasn't cracked the site yet...\" She quit out of the program and went to the login screen of RealityShift.net, then moved aside for Jeff to take over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe typed in his username and password.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a lot of bells and whistles on the site, huh?\" Stephanie asked, seeing that it was little more than a text entry box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a beta, but how much would they need?\" Jeff replied with a shrug. He was already typing Stephanie's first wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>We live in a giant mansion, akin to the Playboy mansion.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walls of Stephanie's room shifted as it became much bigger, furniture altering as it moved into new positions, the one window stretching in all directions to become a giant set of double doors that appeared to lead out to the terrace. Stephanie took a moment to gape at the giant bed that was the centerpiece of this bedroom that seemed at least four times the size it had been previously, then turned her attention back to the larger desk upon which the computer now sat. \"Okay, number two,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff typed, <i>Women can mentally control whether or not they will become pregnant from sex. They know instinctively how to use this ability.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing obvious changed after he clicked the \"Submit\" button, so he went on to the third wish. \"I've got an idea for this one,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The philosophy of feminism is accepted in all societies, which means that women and men are as equal as possible given the differences in male and female physiology.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's okay,\" said Stephanie. \"Women ruling the world would probably cause way too many changes to reality. And I see you don't want to turn everyone into hermaphrodites or something like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff clicked \"Submit,\" and once again, there were no apparent changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, that's interesting.\" Stephanie looked down at her skimpy dress. \"I was thinking my clothes might be different after that. Oh, well, keep going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The billionaire one,\" Jeff said. \"Do you think I should say how we got all our money?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis sister thought for a second and then replied, \"No, whatever magical logic runs this website seems to be doing a good job so far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>We are billionaires.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA crystal chandelier emerged from the ceiling as the already-fancy furniture in Stephanie's bedroom shifted styles and materials, now seeming to be elaborate antiques. Jeff felt the desk chair alter beneath him, contouring itself to his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, nice,\" said Stephanie. The chair she was sitting in had changed, too, to what was probably a several-thousand-dollar desk chair, but she was more interested in the diamond necklace she now wore. Jeff noticed that large diamond earrings now dangled from her earlobes. \"Come on, three to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff shook his head once again at the fifth wish, but interpreted Stephanie's request anyway. <i>Green, magenta, and blue are among natural human hair colors.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie's blonde hair became a vivid, bright, almost fluorescent magenta color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this is <i>perfect!\"</i> she exclaimed, bringing her long hair in front of her eyes. \"You look great, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff turned his head to look in an antique full-length mirror. His hair was the same shade of shocking magenta as his sister's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing his dismay, Stephanie said, \"Come on, remember, it's perfectly natural. Just try living with it for a while until you change it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay,\" muttered Jeff, turning back to the computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Humans are, at most, 60% attracted to the same sex, so everyone is either straight or bisexual.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds great,\" Stephanie said, a bit eagerly, before he could even turn around. He clicked \"Submit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A process exists for physically changing the sex of transgendered people, relatively easily, which allows them to look as they wish and be fully functional after their change.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff clicked \"Submit\" and almost instantly felt his skin crawl. By the time he said \"What the --\", he realized that his body had bulged with muscle, his skin tan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my God!\" exclaimed Stephanie. \"That's great -- that's probably what you'd look like if you'd ever used Mom to wish you were more attractive. Your face is a little different, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why --\" Jeff realized this was the result of a transgender-themed wish and quickly put his hand to the crotch of his jeans, feeling definite relief when he felt obvious male genitalia inside -- more obvious than he remembered, even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duh, if there's technology for letting transgendered people look the way they want, it could work on anyone, right? And even if it's expensive, we can afford it, 'cause we're billionaires!\" Stephanie exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess,\" said Jeff, once again turning to look in the mirror, trying to ignore his brightly-colored hair and figure out what about his face had changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like everything turned out great,\" Stephanie said. \"Whoa, the website just refreshed itself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Jeff turned back. The input box was gone, and instead there was just black text on a white background. \"RealityShift.net is undergoing maintenance for the next 48-72 hours,\" it read. \"Uh-oh, it's gone for 2 or 3 days,\" he told Stephanie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugged. \"That's fine. Probably upgrading -- maybe the beta's even over. We'll have Mom for any magic we might need. Come on, we should look at the rest of the mansion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the siblings got up from the desk and walked out of Stephanie's room.</span></div></div>",

Sure, it appeared wider and more luxurious than a normal hotel hallway, with diffuse lighting and a deep pile carpet, but it was still just a long corridor with doors on either side, the two of them standing at one end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think we have a lot of guests staying over, or...\" Jeff walked to the first door on the right, which had the \"female\" symbol engraved just like his sister's room, but read \"MEGHAN/MISS JUNE 2013.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie had gone to the left, and the plaque on the first door on that side read \"JASMINE/MISS DECEMBER 2014.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff walked to the next door: \"SHANNON/MISS FEBRUARY 2015.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie asked, \"Uh, Jeff, do the doors on that side have plaques that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, they do,\" said Jeff. \"And, uh, the artwork between the doors...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie realized that she was looking at a framed charcoal sketch of a naked woman. She turned to see, opposite it, an oil painting of what looked like it was supposed to be several naked nymphs frolicking in a river.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked together in the middle of the hallway, passing door after door with a woman's name and a plaque on it, artwork after artwork featuring nude women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, at the end of the corridor, on the left was a door with a brass plaque engraved with the \"male\" symbol and the name \"JEFFREY.\" They didn't go in, though, because on the right, it opened up into a large game room/lounge -- there was a fully stocked bar and several seating areas, plus several pinball machines and video game cabinets, plus ping-pong and foosball tables, but the centerpiece was a pool table with purple felt, and a game in progress. Around it were two stunning women in lingerie and high heels holding cue sticks. Both wore identical necklaces from which a tasteful, jewel-encrusted \"female\" symbol dangled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey, Jeff and Steph,\" said the green-eyed redhead, who giggled at the rhyme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other one had deep blue eyes that matched the rich blue color of her hair. \"We wondered where you both were. Jeff, you wanna play winner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I don't...\" Jeff looked sideways at Stephanie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead pointed her cue stick in the direction of Jeff's crotch. \"You wanna <i>fuck</i> winner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn obviously startled Stephanie said, \"Uh, not right now. He's gotta help me with something.\" She grabbed Jeff's hand and led him away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know where we'll be!\" called the blue-haired woman after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I want to see my room,\" said Jeff to his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Later,\" she said. A set of stairs led up from the game room to a small landing and a set of double doors, but then a wide, gently curving staircase led down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess this is partly my fault,\" Stephanie muttered. \"I was the one who referred to Hefner, and you changed that to 'akin to the Playboy mansion,' so I guess we've got a bunch of Playmates or something living here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff wasn't particularly listening. The staircase descended into a giant atrium, which he could look down and see included a giant marble of, what else, a naked woman. More interesting, though, was the two-story-tall artwork on one wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie continued, \"But you'd think your thing about 'the philosophy of feminism' would have taken care of that -- with women and men being as equal as possible --\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe artwork, Jeff saw, was a photo-mosaic, thousands of images combined to create one giant image of a naked woman -- from her hairstyle and makeup, it looked to him like it was a photograph from the 1950s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie was still talking. \"And we've got to find out the details about the 'look as they wish' thing, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff realized that the small images in the photo-mosaic were all magazine covers, all from the same magazine, which appeared to have a woman on the cover of every issue. He could almost read the name of the magazine. It was --<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked into Stephanie, who'd been ahead of him, but had now stopped a few steps from the bottom.

When she restored Mark, she didn't want to be accused of making her into a sex toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want her to be happy with her body.\" he muttered in a low voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe device responded 'voice command accepted', and in a moment a different screen appeared without him touching it. The sliders shifted to new positions, and Jeff looked on in horror as the device seemed to be slipping beyond his control. Only the image of Maricella staying the same in the window assured him that things might still be all right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds, the sliders, toggles and other controls stopped moving, at the bottom of the screen, an icon appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\"><b>Initiate Change.</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked invitingly green, and ready to press. The changes were beyond his comprehension, too rapid, and too varied for him to follow. But it flashed slowly between shades of green inviting him to press it. His head shifted awkwardly, as he weighed up pressing it. Surely whatever the change was... it would be good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing his doubts aside, he stabbed the icon, and the world flickered.</span></div></div>",

Closing the laptop cover, he felt a lock of hair fall across his face. It was then all the other changes fell into place. Jeff noticed, his chest wasn't a chest anymore. He too was wearing a soccer strip. It wasn't baggy, as she more than filled it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sloshing of her chest as she rose to her feet, told her it was rather unrestrained. Jeff's whole centre of balance felt different. His ass heavier than before. With a weary defeat, Jeff found his hand running down his flank. Tugging at the top made it cling, her new breasts clearly giving it shape that was impossible before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand brushed softly, quickly and Jeff was in no doubt that she was abundantly a woman. No trace of bulge was present, the frisson racing up her spine confirming that she had a very sensitive pussy between her legs now. A scowl crossed her face, as she crossed her hands behind her back. Not eager to repeat that .... stimulating touch... she was startled by how large full, and round her new ass was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ae/fc/69/aefc69087d089dfa46829a76356b7985.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ae/fc/69/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soft, smooth thighs were another nail in the coffin of her hopes.

It's a joyous sight as her rump ripples and rolls as she runs. Closing the laptop, you trudge up the hill. Your thoughts on the more mundane problems now. The Sun feels just a touch too warm, and the fact you didn't bring any water with you on this glorious day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the sound of light girly laughter as you approach the peak of the hill, you increase your speed.

The idea of being down and dirty with the girls appeals a lot more than a dry conversation about the game. Coach Cachonda takes the rebuff well, and concentrates on watching the game, and you see her size up Maricella. Obviously she wants a new player for her team, and thinks you're her manager... or agent, or something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, your thoughts are focused on joining in, being a participant looks a lot more fun. But as you craft a new body for yourself to join the game, you feel a nervous fear as you look at the body you'll be giving yourself. The parameters of this new world have filled in many of the details, and you feel her ass is already too big, and you're not yet inside that body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ae/fc/69/aefc69087d089dfa46829a76356b7985.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ae/fc/69/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looks like you'd be the biggest, juiciest girl playing, and you don't want to stand out. Tweaking the controls as much as you can, you find some of them snap back, when you try and move them. Clearly the world won't allow some of the choices you'd like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks just as ripe and delicious as Maricella, and the name 'Jess Jefferson' tells you the new name to come with the new body. Double checking that you'll keep your memories, you ensure the toggle is marked as 'aware'. You doubt Maricella would be as carefree if she still recalled being Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTelling yourself, that like Maricella, once you're a woman you too won't be concerned that you're too big, you look at the refined body. Shrugging to yourself, you think 'faint heart never won fair lady', and stab the 'Initiate Change' button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn moments, you feel the chill air over your legs, shivers run up and down your spine. Putting the device aside, you look just like any of the other women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll look after your bags, if you want to join in.\" Furcia offers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a moment to consider her offer, you realise she doesn't recall Jeff at all. Only Jess exists. She nods towards the ground at her feet, and you drop it there. Certainly you can't play carrying the thing on your shoulder, and you don't want to make a scene about how important it is to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" you would have said more. But the purring kittenish, cock-teasing, cock-stiffening sound of your voice stops you from continuing. Your hair swishes from side to side as you run down to join the match. Certainly you can imagine Furcia's gaze lingering on your rump. A rump that feels like it's moving far too much, and too wildly and enticingly for your taste. The wider hips and pelvis just seem to force that swaying sashay onto your running form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/46/5e/96/465e96920a44b6e4a8639532a3f07ca0.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/46/5e/96/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to glance back to Furcia, and check on your bag. The Jeff part of you still feels uncomfortable, but your Jess instincts allow you to keep your run girly rather than too manly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gracias.\" spills from your lips, and you head into the m\u00eal\u00e9e of the match.</span></div></div>",

You went on the same side as Maricella since the guy turned girl was the only girl their you knew.  But that didn't even seem to matter to the other girls on the team.  After all it was just a friendly get together practice and the more the merrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran along side some of the girls doing your best to keep up with the pros.  And thanks to the athleticism you'd given yourself and Maricella you were actually able to run along side the girls.  Although usually you made sure to stay a few steps behind to get the full glorious view of the magically enlarged asses of the players.  After a few minutes of play one of the hispanic girls on your team lined up a shot and scored.  All the girls on your side all came together in group and started to jump for joy and you were more than happy to join in.  You even made sure to give the girl who scored a good old fashion friendly slap on the ass like you'd seen guys give to each other on tv.  You might have gone a little hard and grabbed a little too much cheek, but although she seemed surprised, the girl whose name you learned was Sofia, gave you a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game only got more intense from there.  All the girls were running back and forth across the field for the friendly.  You were doing a good job of staying out of the way and just watching the girls run, when suddenly Maricella passed you the ball.  Instinctivly you kicked the ball to the goal and you actually scored!  You were suddenly swamped by the girls, but then Sofia taking the lead gave you your own ass slap.  And the rest of the team with grins on their faces followed suit.  Soon your ass was actually feeling a little sore from all the hands.  You could even see a bright pink stinging handprints when you looked back at your ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally after a few more minutes the friendly game wrapped up.  The pro players went back to their coach, and you went back to your stuff you left on the ground.  You'd had a fun time being one of the girls, but you were feeling worked up and were ready to turn back into Jeff.  Maybe Maricella or Sofia could use a back, leg, or ass massage after all the hard playing.  But before you could turn back something drew your attention.</span></div></div>",

No, there would be no talking about this <i>to anyone</i> until he had a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reluctantly got out of bed, slowly progressing towards the phone, while also learning to deal with the body he accidentally had taken. Being a girl seemed great when he was in bed, but standing up it became a careful balancing act. Being unaccustomed to Chloe's physique, which with its delicate limbs were to hold the weight hanging from his chest, he could only awkwardly limp towards the desk on which the phone was charging. Bumping against the bed, the floor, the dresser, and anything else he met on his way, repeatedly surprised him with how soft his skin now was. Being a boy, his skin was naturally tougher, and being <i>raised</i> a boy, his old body was used to much more than just a few stubs against a chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got to the desk, his mind still racing, he immediately set himself in Chloe's chair. He took one second to weave his thoughts back together, and took the phone in his hand, hoping it was just some alarm Chloe had set the night before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't the case. It was one of Chloe's girlfriends, Katie evidently, checking whether Chloe was doing anything that day, and telling in a blunt way that she was coming over if not, because she had nothing to do and was bored. Jeff just answered \"Sure, it will be fun. Come over whenever.\" and immediately dialled his own number, hoping he could contact Chloe and resolve the situation in a couple of minutes.</span></div></div>",

This wasn't just himself as a girl, this was a complete person, with her own life, her own friends, her own ambitions. There was no way that he could go outside without people noticing something was off. Very off, because he still wasn't able to find his balance. Imagine going out like this, it would have been an outright disaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no option besides staying home, so he took the laptop, got back in bed, and started doing what all depressed teenagers do, wasting time watching pointless YouTube videos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while he got hungry. The first thing he did was look around the room for a bag of chips or something, he always had one laying around. Chloe wasn't like that, if she wanted to eat she went downstairs to get an apple or something. Disappointed, Jeff got back in bed, telling himself he was going to decide what to do, but instead logging into Facebook to pretend like nothing was out of the ordinary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he noticed the account of Chloe was still opened, and decided to have a look around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer page said she was single, but her chat logs told otherwise. She had been sending some really dirty things to a guy named Derrick, who Jeff remembered being in some sports team at school. A first glance got Jeff interested, and knowing that he was alone, he decided to read as much as he could. For research, of course, he had to start somewhere getting to know this girl, maybe the right place for this was her core, her most intimate fantasies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">Derrick:</span> \"hey girl\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">Chloe:</span> \"Hey, what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">Derrick:</span> \"saw the pics you posted, lookin good\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">Chloe:</span> \"Im feeling good, just a bit tense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">Derrick:</span> \"I could help with that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">Chloe:</span> \"What would you do to me if you could walk into my room right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">Derrick:</span> \"you know, stuff ;)\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">Chloe:</span> \"Tell me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">Derrick:</span> \"first, i would step real close to you\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">Derrick:</span> \"put my hands on your hips\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">Derrick:</span> \"feel your curves\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">Chloe:</span> \"How would you release the tension?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">Derrick:</span> \"not immediately, id actually let it build up a bit\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">Derrick:</span> \"id get real close to you until i can hear your heartbeat going faster and faster\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">Derrick:</span> \"until i can feel your breath on my face\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">Derrick:</span> \"then i would let us fall, together, on the bed\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">Chloe:</span> \"and our clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">Derrick:</span> \"i would first make sure yours were off\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">Derrick:</span> \"continuing feeling you up, i could go underneath your clothes\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">Derrick:</span> \"subtly remove them until you are in your underwear\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">Chloe:</span> \"And you?

Could he allow this from himself? No, never. He was just a normal, healthy, teenager. This meant that he had a healthy sex drive too, but still, he wasn't some pervert going through the private conversations of girls he hardly knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe logged out of Chloe's account, and back in as himself. Looking through the activity of his friends, he saw that nothing had changed. Still the same people, posting the same stuff. Although he never really was that interested, seeing the pictures of his friends at first distracted him from his worries, but when he got to pictures of himself, he started thinking. This guy, the person he saw in the pictures, now he was someone else. He wasn't able to trust him any longer, so much had already been proven. Exactly who Jeff was, he couldn't tell, but it became painfully obvious that he and himself now weren't the same person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt weaker than the person in the pictures, not because he had turned into a girl, but because that person had broken him. That person had given him this miserable existence, if anything close to a god existed, it had to be him. Now, because of a single act of power from this Jeff, he had to be someone he couldn't be, and he was even losing the last link with his old life that he had. The feeling that he was who he was, was gone. He couldn't be Chloe, and looking at the pictures, he quickly saw that he couldn't be Jeff either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what he did, was stand up, and first making sure he could keep his balance, he made his way to the huge mirror on the other end of the room. After a couple of hours of being in this body, walking wasn't that much of a problem. He still had to do it slowly, carefully placing one foot after the other, he knew however that after a little bit of practice, no one would notice anything strange in his movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wanted to take a look at Chloe, a real good look. Standing close to the mirror, while simultaneously making sure he wasn't falling over, he tried to introduce himself to the quite sad looking girl in the mirror. She was pretty, real pretty. With long brown hair that, although obviously unkempt, still laid gently over her shoulders. Her eyes large, with a look in them emanating real emotion in a way that boys only get to see when they are truly loved by someone, and then only at their most intimate moments together. You could see she had been crying, Jeff hadn't realised this before now. In a friendly gesture, he tried to cheer her up, and she smiled back to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Chloe,\" she said, still smiling at him \"what's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Chloe,\" she repeated, \"nice to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giggle emerged from her sweet mouth, an innocent, girly sound, coming from someone who had no trouble knowing who she was. Her eyes beamed up, as if all that she had been worrying about now seemed but a trifle.</span></div></div>",

Who the guy from a few moments ago was, now belonged to her most distant memories. His face but a blur, his personality entirely alien. There were no memories to look back to, she was entirely in the moment, ready to invent herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pyjamas were, though cute, not something she could wear all day. Besides, that evening a friend was coming over, and imagine the impression it might make when she opens the door looking as if she just got out of bed. There is no way to explain something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she pulled her t-shirt off she hesitated, but only for a moment, after which she realised that what she was doing was totally normal. Chloe never wore a bra to bed, nor did she wear panties. With the result that when she pulled her pyjama pants off, she was entirely naked.</span></div></div>",

Its meaning was clear to her, there was no was she could live like this. Looking at her face she saw the beauty of youth, but looking deeper, into her soul, everything was diseased, everything was awful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping her body on the bed, she started crying again. One day before she had been normal, her mind had had a body, and her body had had a mind. Now conflict in the present incompatible dualism had made her nauseous; crying herself sick, like a child throwing a tantrum, no restraint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA new person was being formed, a monster. Little of what she knew from her past life had any use. The only thing left to do was be afraid of what the coming hours might bring.

It all seemed so casual to her. The whole conversation, Katie coming over, it was as if she had done all this a million times before. If she could be Chloe after all, in what way was she still Jeff? Questions came up about what it meant to have an identity, which turned into questions about reality, all making her feel like she hadn't turned into Chloe, but into Ren\u00e9 Descartes.

I shouldn't use that much force next time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie quickly looked behind the door, \"The door doesn't seem hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain able to relax, Chloe realized her first instinct had been right.

Are you feeling ill?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sort of, but that's not the problem, it's just been a crazy day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that feel, bro. Whatever it is, you know you can talk to me about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a remote control laying on the floor next to the bed, which Chloe had knocked off the nightstand when she first got up.

He must have had been a child himself, or certainly in his very early teens, the last time he had watched them. It wasn't that he disliked it, cartoons are all right, it just seemed like something for kids. That's why he stopped when his friends stopped, as you grow up, different things seem appropriate. To avoid being left behind, you have to leave some things of yourself behind, you gotta evolve. It seemed like Katie never evolved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd why should she? She was hot, there was no way she was going to be left behind, not by the guys at least. Among girls she didn't seem to have any problems either, as she was able to casually visit Chloe, who was apparently the most popular girl in school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis dorky girl being popular pointed to Chloe's clique being incredibly open and accepting. Which was incredibly strange because it wasn't the impression Jeff got from the girls at his school in the slightest.

As he walked through the halls, he saw the same people. Chris, his friend, the jocks, nerds, the preps, all of them. When he turned the corner on the way to his locker, he finally found his handiwork; and by god, was he infatuated at first sight. He had been able to see a brief glimpse into what his creation would look like, but looks could not describe her sheer beauty at that particular moment. Her ass was popping out of her shorts, giving anyone who was looking quite the show. Her shirt was skin tight, giving her some of the largest cleavage he had ever seen on a girl. Slightly nervous, he slowly walked up to his locker, a few feet away from her, grabbed his things for what was her class, and, when he was ready, finally broke the relative silence. \"So, are you new to town?\" He asked innocently enough. He was rewarded for his tact with a ball of brown blubber forcing her way into his arms. She seemed to break down almost instantly, hot tears pouring from her face onto his shirt. \"Something is very wrong. I am not student. I was teacher! Please, what has happened?\" Slight english issues aside, Jeff did feel a slight pang of guilt for what he had dne, but he had to admit, it was quite arousing to feel her soft body squished against his. \"There there, I have no idea what any of what you said means, but you do not have to cry. Here..\" \"Asaka. Asaka Larsono Moto.\" \"Very well, Asaka. Let's get to class shall we?\" He pulled Asaka close, feeling her soft assets push against him.

Jeff fiddled around with the data and changed many things about Tony. Now he was only 5 feet tall, devoid of any traits of physical activity he once had. His body type was now more feminine than masculine. His new pale skin suggested that he was never leaving his house for things other than school, his brown hair was changed from short to shoulder length and made greasy on top of that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff also made sure that he's dressed like a true nerd. He changed his normal attire to buttoned shirts that Tony now loved to wear above anything else and had many of them in various colors, in his collection alongside some ridiculous looking bow ties and ties. He also loved to wear cheap jeans and khaki pants hiked up higher on his waist. Of course the nerdy look wouldn't be complete without some thick glasses. In his new life he got nearsighted after reading too much books and playing far more video games than an average kid his age. Jeff didn't want them to be too much dorky though, it was more like an accessory than complemented his face and the rest of his clothes quite nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly he went to his quirk info, deleted his destructive behaviors and left him with some new ones. He now loved most of the nerdy stuff including learning,fantasy books, video games, sci-fi movies, anime and manga. No longer violent, he was a very polite little gentleman at least that's what his proud mother was saying. Former bully was now a sweet, little nerdy boy that just wanted to have some friends that he could help with everything he had. Of course he was shy and timid, due to his appearance and lack of confidence, but he would overcome it and talk with people he respected. He also liked to be called by his full name - Anthony to emphasis that professional nature of his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff clicked \"confirm changes\" button and let the magic happen. He checked for former bully's facebook page to see if anything had changed and it did. Tony's profile picture now matched the look that Jeff created on the web-side. Now he got rid off the one problem and could move to the next one, could he? Soon after he finished his mom called him:<br>\r\n\"Jeff honey you have a guest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWondering who could have visited his house Jeff ran downstairs to find a new friend smiling across the doors:<br>\r\n\"H-hi Jeff.

It appears that in this new reality that he created, Anthony considers him one of his few friends, today happens to be the day he comes to Jeff's house to play multiplayer games with him. Former memories of his seemed like a distant dream so he had to accept this new reality as fact. <i>Another friend won\u2019t hurt</i> \u2013 though Jeff \u2013 <i>besides he can\u2019t have bad intentions now.

Anthony unpacked his gaming laptop on the spare table in the corner. He was excited to be in the same room as the person he liked so much. He was sweating a little from the excitement, but thankfully his hankerchief was in his shirt pocket, so he used it to clean himself up. After he calmed himself Anthony carefully pulled every part from the bag. He knew that he wasn\u2019t so nimble so he needed extra care with his expensive gaming equipment to be placed without any problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time Jeff looked at his new buddy with curiosity. It whole situation should\u2019ve felt unreal, but now he knew that they played together every week for a long time. Relieved that nothing will go wrong he spoke to Anthony:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201eAlright you set yourself up, I will take a piss and we will start in about 5 minutes\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201eO-ok\u201d - answered Anthony shyly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

He always wanted to have a close friend, but thanks to a mysterious web-site he finally got what he wanted. After he finished his thing he pulled his khaki pants up his waist and tucked his green shirt into them. When he finished washing his hands he looked at his image in the mirror. He was the same nerdy boy he's always been. His long sleeved green shirt with a black tie was as neat as always thanks to the efforts of his mom, his long, greasy, black hair tucked into the neat ponytail as usual. The only thing that was misplaced was his glasses. He giggled to himself as he adjusted them with his pale hand and smiled to his reflection. He was ready to spend some quality time with Anthony. He entered his room and announced:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201eO-ok I'm done s-so we can finally p-play together!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony made a happy squeak much to Jeffrey\u2019s surprise. He didn\u2019t know why his friend was so happy all of the sudden. Maybe his body still adapts to this new reality and this sound was some kind of side effect. Jeffrey went to sit in front of his PC screen. He couldn\u2019t remember closing the site that made his life better, but it didn\u2019t boggled him too much. The most important thing was the effects this site had so far on his life. He didn't need anything else at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe usual gaming session was about to begin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

In one corner of the screen, an image of Tony appeared, beneath that an identical image. The lower picture was labelled target, and filling the other half of the screen was a variety of sliders, toggles and other controllers. At the very base of the screen, was an icon 'Initiate Change'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScanning the various options, Jeff felt overwhelmed by the possibilities. But he knew Tony's reign of terror had to be ended. Realising, his strength was the ultimate recourse for Tony, he quickly set that to a more modest level. Also with a few swift taps, dropped him from 6' 2\", down to a more manageable 5' 2\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could now see, subtle changes in the target image. A slighter face, was the clearest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost looks androgynous.\" Even as he muttered the observation to himself, a clearer course of action became obvious. With a swipe of the toggle, Jeff changed his tormentor from Male <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/male.png\" alt=\"*Male*\" title=\"Male\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> to Female <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/female.png\" alt=\"*Female*\" title=\"Female\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">. The effect was immediate, as Tony's short cropped hair was erased by a flowing mane of chestnut brown locks. The face was still recognisably his.... well, hers, but also blessed with full lips, and high cheekbones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching sight of another thing, he spotted she was now Toni, short for Antonia. The control options also shifted, when he swapped her gender. Tweaking the new controls, he played with Toni, as if she were his dolly. Toni became proficient with her make-up, accentuating her natural beauty with skilled hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe allowed her to keep her healthy athletic edge, (with a little refinement). Toni was the head-cheerleader, rather the a Jock.... more a Jill. Feeling a hint of anger, he balanced out her gains with something for himself. Toni was also the bustiest cheerleader, a firm, but mobile bust that interfered with her ability to do her cheers. In fact, it would lead to her being dismissed as eye-candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded to himself, admiring the differences between Tony as he still was, and Toni as she'd soon be.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jeff wanted to prolong his revenge.  This might mean that he would be bullied a little more until he found the proper settings, but it would be worth it.  Only he could know anything had changed and he could revel in what only he knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down the selections on the page and found a button for more options.  There were several pages to look at.  Each selection had their own refinements.   For example, when it came to hair, he could change length, style, curliness, color, the options were seemingly infinite.  As he looked through them, he found Tony's family.  He saw his mother, father and siblings.  You could actually change his parents or any family relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff focused on Tony's little sister Janine.  Jeff knew Janine, she was the sweetest little girl, only three years old and cute as a bug in a rug.  For a moment, Jeff wondered how a guy like Tony could be related to a sweet little girl like Janine.  Jeff clicked on Janine, to Tony's right on the screen Janine and her facts appeared.  Jeff could compare Janine's facts with her brothers.  Then He thought, what is he gave Jeff some of Janine's traits.  He could make him an exact copy of her, but he didn't want to do that.  As before that would be too quick.  To see if his idea was possible, Jeff copied one of Janine's traits to Tony.  As a test, he chose to swap hair.  Immediately the picture of Tony changed.  He no long had short cropped hair, but his hair was longer, down to his shoulder blade.  It was now parted in the middle with two pig tails on either side of his head.  Pink ribbons held the hair in place.  It looked ridiculous on any male, but especially on a man as big and strong as Tony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff assumed that it worked when he  pressed the submit button, but couldn't be sure until he saw it in person.  Jeff decided that this was enough to do.  He didn't want to make any more changes until he saw this one in action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day when Jeff went to school he crept around to find Tony.  Jeff crept around Tony many times, but usually so that Tony wouldn't see him.  It didn't take long before he found Tony.  Tony was easy to find if you were looking for him.  He wasn't hiding from anyone.  When Jeff saw him, Tony ad the hair style as Jeff expected and it was even more hilarious to see it in person.  There was a slight change in that the ribbons that held Jeff's hair in place was a different color than on the screen, but Jeff just assumed that was because Janine was also wearing a different ribbon today.  Her mom just had changed it to match her outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite looking like a fool, Tony was still the school bully.  He picked upon whoever he wanted and no one would say anything about his hair.  Tony even liked that he could wear his hair as he wanted and no one would say a word.  It was a sign of his strength he thought.  He didn't know why he wanted his hair this way, but that was how he wanted it and no one had better say a word or they would get it worse than he would usually give it to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff, loved the scene and decided when he went home he would make more changes.</span></div></div>",

The first rule was only one change a day.  He wanted to see how each change could effect Tony.  Besides prolonging this would be a lot of fun.  The second rule was no 'big' physical changes.  What he meant was, he didn't want Tony to drop to his sister's height.  He liked Tony looking tall and strong, even though other things would change about him.  Things like hair was alright, because hair can grow back or be restyled.  This gave Jeff an idea.  He set it so that all the changes would be redone during the night.  If Tony decides to cut his hair (for any reason) the next morning it would reset to the pig tails he has now.  That would be for any other change that Jeff would think of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he has his rules, he determined to make another change to Tony using his little sister's traits as inspiration.  Jeff opening up the options and saw Tony's information (including his new hair style with only looks right on toddlers) with his sister's right next to it.  He looked over the choices for something to stand out.  Most of the things were just too big a choice for the second time using it.  He would save those for later.  But then he found it, \"VOICE.\"  How would it be for big tough Tony to speak with the high pitched squeak of a little girl.  Jeff made sure not to change Tony's vocabulary or intelligence, just his speaking voice.  Jeff wondered how anyone would not crack up when Tony told them he would 'Fuck them up,\" a phrase his victims heard a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff selection the option and submitted the changes.  Tony's picture on the screen didn't change,  Jeff knew it had worked though.  He would have to wait to hear it for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, when Jeff found Tony, he wasn't tormenting the students.  He was with his girlfriend, Brittani.  Brittani was a pretty girl who had been with Tony for over a year now.  Jeff didn't know what she saw him him, but she apparently liked him.  Jeff was too far away to hear what they were saying.  Jeff purposefully tried to walk by them.  When Brittani was around, Tony usually wouldn't provoke anyone, but that didn't mean you didn't have to be careful.  You certainly couldn't stare at Brittani.  But if you minded your own business that was one of the few times you were safe around Tony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittani was doing most of the talking, but Tony in his little girl voice was cutely saying, \"Yeah,\" \"Right,\" and \"I don't think so,\" as appropriate.  Jeff suppressed a laugh at how the little girl voice was coming out of Tony's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff thought he had an idea for the next trait change for Tony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Jeff looked through the options to find the right place.  He thought that was he was looking for would be in the interest or hobbies categories.  First he found Tony's interest in \"girls\" in general and in Brittani in particular.  That wasn't too hard to find, but then he looked through Janine's preferences.  It took some doing but he found what he wanted.  As a three year old, Jeff assumed that Janine like dolls and had a special one she particularly liked.  He found that was true.  Janine loved dolls and stuffed animals and had a very special cloth doll that she loved.  The doll's name was Katie.  Jeff swapped Tony's interest in girls with Janine's interest in dolls.  Then he swapped Jeff's love for Britanni with Janine's love for her favorite doll Katie.  Jeff didn't know what would happen exactly.  But he was sure that Tony and Brittani wouldn't be boyfriend/girlfriend anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, when Jeff found Tony he was clutching a rag doll in his right hand and had his hand over the throat of one of the students.  This boy had been a 'friend' of Tony or at least in his gang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should we do to him?\" Tony asked (with the voice of a little girl) the doll in his arm.  His voice was every more hilarious now that he was speaking in full sentences.  To make matters worse he was actually asking the doll like it would talk back to him.  The boy he was attacking was smaller than Tony and couldn't get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oh you think so?\" Tony said to the doll as if the doll and said something and Tony was responding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen to the trapped boy, \"Katie says I should go easy on you.  But I don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy tried to say something, but Tony cut him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't interrupt Katie when she is speaking.\"  You felt for the boy, but it was so funny watching Tony 'speaking' to his doll.  It didn't take long before whatever slight the boy had done was resolved and the crisis passed.  Jeff thought the whole thing was hilarious.  It was getting funnier and funnier every day.  But Tony was still dangerous so Jeff egressed from the scene.  When Jeff saw Tony in class, he was still carrying Katie.  No one had a problem with that, not even the teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

What could he do to help Tony deal with his temper?  He wasn't ready to make a big change to his personality.  Not yet anyway.  But what could he do?  \"What do little kids do when they get all upset,\" he thought.  Well the cry, but that didn't mean they didn't hit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff thought about it for a while and came up with something.  He looked though Janine's options and found it.  Everything that Janine knew or felt about sucking her thumb was copied into Tony's personality.  Maybe now he won't hit anyone, he'll suck his thumb instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jeff caught up with Tony he was as mean as every even though he still had his doll and occasionally popped his thumb into his mouth.  It might have calmed him down a bit, but when the thumb came out then you had better be careful.  The thumb in his mouth was like the rattle of a rattlesnake.  When you heard the loud sucking sounds you had better run.  This time as it happened, it was Jeff who drifted to close to Tony when the sucking became loud.  Jeff thought he was safe, but he wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony's little girl voice didn't sound so cute while he was pummeling you for some imagined slight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

It would have been worse if Tony had used both hands instead of holding onto his dolly throughout.  But even though he was essentially one handed, that was still plenty to take care of Jeff.  That little girl voice that seemed so cute was no laughing matter anymore as Tony yelled at him either. When Jeff pulled one of the ribbons that made up Tony's pigtails in self defense, Tony became even more enraged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff was about to make a drastic change to Tony, maybe violating his own rule and give the big brute the strength of his little sister.  But calmer heads prevailed.  Things were going along so nicely and it was his fault he had gotten beaten up.  Recently he had been avoiding Tony, but ever since changing him Jeff sought him out.  Tony probably noticed and that's why he got beaten up.  Tony might have also intuited that Jeff was laughing at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt probably would be easier if Tony didn't notice so much.  Then Jeff had a Eureka moment.  Toddlers have a very sort attention span.   Jeff found the option and gave Tony the attention span equivalent to that of his little three year old sister.  Jeff didn't know how this would effect Tony but what's the difference.  If this 'didn't work' then there was always another thing to try tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jeff saw Tony the next day, he seemed the same.  He was still carrying his dolly and his thumb was firmly stuck in his mouth.  He was with one of his friends they were talking.  Jeff didn't want to get close enough to find out, he had 'bullied' Jeff the day before and Jeff was still a bit sore.  Jeff watched for a few minutes nothing seem to change.  When all of a sudden, Tony just started to run.  Jeff didn't know why.  It seemed some birds were tweeting in a near by tree and Tony ran to see them.  The brightly colored birds flew away as Tony watched.  His friend caught up with him.  For the friend and everyone else, Tony's tiny attention span was normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

With his cute voice and pigtails, not to mention his dolly, it was probably time to give him a wardrobe with was more in line with his new traits.  This was going to be a huge change .  He was going to replace Tony's entire wardrobe with exact copies of a three year old, except these clothes would for him.  Jeff was proud of himself that it took a week before he cot to the most obvious trait swap there was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking through the options, Jeff swapped every one of Tony's traits that had to do with clothing with his little sister Janine.  There was many options, tops, bottoms, shoes and socks and Jeff wanted each option to be exactly the same.  Jeff didn't know if this was what Janine (the toddler) liked or just what her mom selected for her.  How much of a choice did toddler's have when it came to dressing?  Jeff didn't know.  But he was eager to see how Tony would be dressed the next day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he saw him, Jeff wasn't disappointed.  Tony was wearing a white short sleeves t-shirt with the pink panther on the front.  The panther had his usual rye smile and was wearing glasses in the shape of hearts.  He wore a matching pink leggings with a darker pink footprint pattern throughout.  The leggings were made for a toddler in such a way that the area around crotch was extended to allow for a diaper.  It was clear that there was indeed a diaper (or at least training pants.)   On his feet he wore anklet socks although his sneakers did light up in the back as he took a step.  His outfit fit better with his haircut how.  In fact the ribbons used to tie his pigtails matched his shirt and leggings.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff watched Tony for a while.  Except for the clothes he was the same as before.  He was still menacing, even though he was dressed like a small girl, but easily distracted,  Jeff had learned his lesson and kept his distance while observing Tony.  The question that kept occurring to Jeff was did he use those diapers that he was obviously wearing.  Jeff didn't give (or is it take away) the potty control of a toddler.  Jeff wasn't going to stalk the bathroom or follow Tony to find out, but he thought to everyone else everything is quite normal, maybe someone already knows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff found his friend Mark and casual brought it up in conversation, \"You know Tony wear's diapers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone knows that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes he need them.  I mean does he you know in his pants?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I have seen him in the mensroom.  he pulls down his pants and then his diapers and stands in front of the toilet and pees.  It's disgusting.  His bear ass is always showing, he doesn't close the door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder why he wearing a diaper then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He just likes it.  As far as I know he has always worn diapers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strange.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well like you are going to argue with him.  He's big enough to wear what he wants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jeff hadn't thought about that Janine was wearing diapers when he gave Tony all her clothes, But she was toddlers and that is what toddlers wear.  No one at school seemed to mind, but there isn't any reason to wear diapers without using them.  Jeff didn't make a distinction between diapers and pull-ups since he didn't have any younger siblings of his own.  To him diapers were diapers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff looked through the options again and found what he was looking for.  he had been through these options many times by now and didn't have much trouble finding anything.  Jeff found everything Janine knew about potty training and swapped that knowledge with Tony's.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jeff saw Tony the next day, he was again wearing a t-shirt.  This one had a tri-colored back ground of light pink, light peach and a bit of white.  Over that was printed in script \"this girl can\" surrounded by two butterflies.  He wore black, red and yellow striped leggings.  It was clear that he was wearing a diaper underneath from the bulge.  His pigtails had a peach colored bow to tie them off which matched his shirt.  On his feet were the same sneakers that lit up when he ran although the socks were probably different.  In his arm, he carried his dolly.  Jeff had never seen Tony without it since he made the swap.  Tony took his dolly everywhere and it was usually in his arms, even in class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony was as mean as ever, still tormenting the students as he wanted.  Jeff didn't know it, but Tony felt better today than yesterday, he felt superior.  He could run the school and he still wasn't fully potty trained.  He wondered why the other students bothered.  Diapers felt so comfortable and people could use the potty without having any accidents, but they still feared him.  Tony pottied when he remembered, but not always.  At night he wore nighttime diapers.  His mom tried to encourage him to wear 'big girl panties' but that didn't work on him.  If Tony had his choice, he wouldn't learn to potty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one good thing about pottying Tony thought, if he said he had to potty he could leave the room during class.  He would be sent to the nurse, who had a special potty chair for him and she would supervise his pottying.  If he had soaked his diaper, she would give him a new one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Tony was now dressed like a toddler including the pullups, he could dress himself.  Jeff hadn't changed Tony's ability to get dressed.  Janine could put on anything that didn't have a snap.  But buttons and other fasteners confused her.  She also had no clue when it come to tying her own shoes.  Tony didn't have any of these difficulties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony was only in one of Jeff's classes.  Jeff watched carefully, but couldn't see anything.  Tony didn't seem to be paying much attention to the teacher, but Jeff didn't know if that was because of his tiny attention span or he didn't care.  Tony hadn't spent much time learning the class lessons even before Jeff changed his reality.  Jeff watched Tony for a while, but didn't see anything.  Jeff realized, that unless the diaper leaked as long as Tony wore pants, there was no way of knowing if he wet himself.  That was the point of the diaper.  Jeff just assumed that it worked as everything else had worked up unto this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't anything for Jeff to see anyway.  The class before, Tony had raised his hand and in his cute little girl voice said, \"I have to potty.\"  Tony spent almost fifteen minutes on the potty before he let loose.  The nurse told him he was a good boy and sent him back to class.  She gave the teacher a note saying that he had indeed pottied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next?</span></div></div>",

He assumed he did, but it wasn't like he could see a yellow wet spot when Tony was wearing pants over the diaper.  But what concerned him was that Tony was as mean as ever.  Tony seemed soft and kind when it came to his dolly, Katie, but when it came to other people he was still a bully.  Jeff wanted to help out the bullied students but he agreed in his rules not to make Tony three feet tall or have the strength of a toddler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff racked his brains looking through the options when he found on.  What if Tony had the coordination of a toddler.  That might take the strength out of him.  Jeff wasn't sure, but it was worth a shot.  He then found the appropriate selector from the scream and gave Tony the exact same coordination of his little toddler sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jeff caught up with Tony he was still tormenting one of the students.  The student, Jeff didn't know his name, had pushed Tony away in self defense.  Tony almost fell on his butt.  The student then started to run.  Tony took up the chase but he wasn't running right.  He didn't take his long strides as he had been.  His gait now was more side to side, with his legs farther apart.  He also held his hands up and a bit out to keep his balance.  The result was that Tony was running much slower.  The student almost got away, if not for Tony's gang who wrangled the boy back into Tony's clutches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Tony had caught up, instead of punching the boy, Tony flailed his arms up and down in slapping motions.  But Tony was still very strong and even though the student could block most of the slaps they did hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff mused that if it wasn't for Tony's friend, the student would have gotten away.  Jeff decided to fix that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn class, Tony would have had a hard time writing his assignments if he had done so.  He spent most of his time daydreaming while sucking his thumb and clutching his dolly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Toddlers always have someone watching them.  Toddlers are never left alone.  They have no independence at all.  That was it, he could give Tony the independence of a toddler.  Then how could he do anything, someone would be watching him.  Jeff looked for the option.  Once discovered Jeff changed Tony's independence to be the same as his little sister.  Jeff wondered how that would work out since Tony was still a student in high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff got to class early eager to see the outcome.  He waited and waited, but Tony hadn't arrived yet.  Jeff wondered if somehow Tony wasn't in his school anymore because of the change.  That wasn't what he intended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut soon Jeff caught sight of Tony, he was toddling down the street with his little sister and his mother.  His mother was holding Tony's hand and Janine held Tony's mother's other hand.  When they arrived at the school, a para-professional greeted them.  She was assigned as Tony's minder and she never let Tony out of her sight.  This frustrated Tony to no end.  He couldn't threaten the other students while being watched.  Even his friends didn't like the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn class, the minder, kept Tony focused on the work and even helped him with his penmanship which was awful do to his lack of coordination.  She also accompanied Tony when he needed to potty.  Jeff had finally gotten what he wanted, Tony was no longer a threat to anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the school day, Tony's mother came to school to fetch him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs this the end?</span></div></div>",

The kids kept their distance from him, he was dangerous, but as long as you didn't get into his immediate grasp you were safe.  If he ran after you, his minder would be in tow and the way he ran he couldn't catch other students anyway.  He might even fall down while chasing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff had become used to making changes to Tony and didn't want to quit.  Even though he was no longer really a threat to anyone.  he looked over the options.  His picture had changed as he was no always in some sort of cutsie toddler outfit.  His hair was always in pigtails tied with ribbons that matched his outfit.  Next to the picture was his name Tony.  Jeff didn't think Tony suited him anymore and decided to change his name to something that fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally he would give him Janine's name, but that didn't seem fair to Janine.  There was no reason she should share her name with her brother.  So Jeff decided to change Tony's name to Jennifer.  Anthony, aka Tony was now Jennifer aka Jenni.  Then he found a special option and changed that too.  He was Jenni to everyone, except his mom who now liked to call him Jenni-bear.  Jeff thought that was cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Jeff could stalk Tony (not Jenni) more easily.  He was in no danger of being bullied.  Before school, Jenni was mostly alone as his friends didn't want to be with him anymore.  He spend most of his time with his minder, talking to his dolly, Katie and sucking his thumb.  In class, despite his lack of attention span, he was learning something as his minder kept him on track.  During lunch, Jenni could eat by himself, but he was a messy eater.  His minder didn't see a need to help him, but she did wipe his face after it was done.  She also made sure that for the last ten minutes of recess, Jenni spent on the potty whether he needed to go or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenni spent most of the day without talking to any friends.

Jeff knew he couldn't just walk into daycare to see what was going on.  In this day and age the staff was wary of strangers around children.  It would be worse if he looked through the window to spy on them.  But Jeff did see Kate Aspen who was a senior at the school, enter the premises.  Since she didn't have any siblings (and certainly not any children of her own) who would attend the daycare, she must be on the staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Kate enter the daycare gave Jeff and idea.  Jeff wanted to know what Jenni was doing in daycare.  Jenni wasn't fitting in in high school, maybe he was doing better in daycare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff returned home and looked up Kate's profile.  He saw Kate on the screen.  Then he put his own profile up next to Kate's.  The plan was to copy Kate's employment to Jeff so he would work at the daycare.  That way he could spy on Jenni and no one would care at all.  Then Jeff realized that he didn't know anything about daycare.  He didn't particularly have any repoire with little kids. To make his job easier he decided to give himself the skills that would make him a good daycare associate.  One by one, he transferred the skills needed to work at a daycare.  This included a love of children and certain parenting skills among other traits.  He was not looking forward to working at the daycare center, not just to spy on Jenni but always because he would enjoy the work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Jeff wasn't looking specifically for Jenni since Jeff hadn't made any new changes to him.  He was more interested in what happened when Jenni was at daycare.  Jeff found himself looking forward to the end of the day so he could 'start his new job.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter school, Jeff hurried, his shift started at 3:15.  He got there before Jenni who didn't have to be there at an exact time.  Whenever he showed up was fine with the daycare.  Janine, Jenni's three year old sister had already been in daycare all day.  She arrived in the morning when her mom dropped her off on the way to work.  Janine was wearing a crew neck top with flutter cap sleeves, that flared on the bottom like a skirt with a pair of jeans and sneakers that light up in back when she walked.  Jeff had seen those sneakers many times on Jenni's feet, but he couldn't remember if he was wearing the same outfit.  The bows in her pigtails matched the color scheme of her top.  When Janine said something, Jeff turned around assuming Jenni had arrived.  Only then did Jeff remember that Jenni had the exact voice of Janine now.  That was one of the first trait swaps Jeff had given Tony back when his name was still Tony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff received his assignment for the day and started his shift.  The daycare was well run and designed for particularly younger children.  There was a five to two ratio of participant (as the children were called) to staff with a maximum of twenty participants at the daycare at any one time.  That meant that where ever there was five participants in a room, there was also two people watching them at all times.  Thus Jeff was one of eight staff working at the daycare in this shift (not including those who were in charge of the junior staff i.e. Jeff)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jenni arrived he was treated like any of the participants.  Almost all the participants were in diapers like Jenni.  Some were in regular diapers not the pullups that Jenni wore.  For the first time, Jeff recognized the difference between the two.  Jenni was dressed identically to his sister Janine right down the the bows in his pigtails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenni was encouraged to join in in the games and activities, but he wouldn't do it.  he mostly kept to himself and didn't do anything.  When the entire group was sent outside (where there were slides, swings, rocking animals and other playground toys) for free play, Jenni wouldn't do that either.  Not even with his little sister Janine.  Concerned, Jeff went to talk to Jenni, \"How come you aren't playing?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to.  All this stuff is dumb,\" the six foot one boy said with his cutsie little girl voice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, it all looks like fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you play on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter what Jeff said, he couldn't make Jenni play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff resolved to fix that when he got home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff looked thought the list of options and realized that Jenni was just too stubborn.  What he needed was for him do what adults told him to do.  The option he had that signified resistance to authority was high.  Jeff could lower it to Janine's levels or even lower than that if he wanted.  But Jeff had changed, he didn't want to force Jenni to do things.  It would be best if he enjoyed it.  It might be better to simply give Janni all the likes (and dislikes) of his sister Janine.  Janine seemed happy to play with the other toddlers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Every person who had been a friend of Janine, Jenni's three year old sister is now a friend of sixteen year old Jenni.  Then Jeff thought better of it, he removed any of Janine's male friends regardless of age so all of Jenni's friends are girls.  Then as a final step, Jeff made all of the girls in daycare Jenni's friends, not just those who had been Janine's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next step would be Jenni's friends going forward.  Jeff made sure that all of Jenni's friends would be girls about three years old.  There wouldn't be any boys, nor girls who are older than three.

He wasn't any trouble to anyone (with Tony bullying ways gone, there was a new bully Eric) , but Jenni didn't look happy.  But at daycare he was clearly enjoying himself.  All his friends were there and he liked the activities.  The daycare began with play outside.  he joined a group of girls at the swing.  There were three of them and they tried to keep swinging back and forth at the same rate.  It was fun for them.  They bored quickly and moved onto other games, There was a lot of laughing and playing.  No boys were allowed.  He liked the song singing once they returned inside.  Then they moved to arts and crafts.  Jenni had the most fun he had in a long time.  Bullying was never this much fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff noticed Jenni laughing.

Life was beautiful, he was going to classes without worrying about having to do Tony's homework for him, and as a bonus he even got to have a seat next to Toni in geography and got to have a good look at her mountains barely contained in the cheerleading uniform top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff practically had a spring in his step as he decided to take his lunch outside where his day got a little worse.  Outside he saw Toni and the other cheerleaders surrounding a classmate.  A nerdy and slightly overweight girl named Cassidy.  Jeff had known her a while, but he'd never really talked to her that much.  But here she was being berated by Toni and her friends for no good reason other than that she could.  The cheerleaders left to go back inside while laughing and Cassidy just ran away.  Jeff chased after her and asked, \"What's going on?  What was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassidy tried to hide her tears as she said, \"It's nothing.  No big deal.  Toni's always treated me like trash for years, I'm used to it.  I'm okay.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jeff knew he couldn't just keep blindly changing Tony around hoping to make Tony a nice person, no Jeff thought he'd have to get to the root of the problem.  He'd have to figure out what made Tony really tick, and figure out what made Tony seem to have power over everyone around him no matter what Jeff did to him.  So Jeff figured the only way to figure out how best to teach Tony a lesson would be to get close to Toni and right now there was one obvious way to get to know the current head cheerleader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff fired up the website and pulled up his own profile, he slid the gender slider from M to F and saw as his fingernails suddenly grew and were suddenly a shade of lime green.  Jeff, was now Jess but he still needed to adjust a few settings.  He added cheerleading to his hobbies list to go along with tv and video games.  He was expecting a cheerleader outfit to suddenly materialize on himself but that didn't happen.  He looked at the cheerleaders on the field and looked at his profile and wondered what went wrong, but soon realized what he had to do.  He then adjusted his bust size and made it go from A cup to D and the second he did that his clothes shifted to the cheerleader uniform to match Toni and the others.  \"Of course.\"  Jeff said as he put his phone in sleep mode and made his way to his new comrades.  \"All right Toni, let's see what makes you tick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he was in eyesight of his now fellow cheerleaders he heard Toni greet him, \"Hey bitch, you're late.\"  Jeff shuddered, even though he had power, real power, over Tony, he couldn't help but feel like Toni was still in charge of him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Toni,\" the new Jess said meekly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not good enough, I want to see how sorry you really are.  Now give me your stuff and give me 100 jumping jacks.  Make sure to give the boys in the back row get a show.  DO IT!\"  It wasn't a request but a command.  Jess instinctively gave Toni his things and began to do as he was told.  Jeff had done jumping jacks before of course, but this was the first time with so much movement on his whole body.  With each jump his chest seemed to jerk up and down causing a lot of discomfort, but giving anyone watching a nice show.  The few of the other cheerleaders offered words of encouragement at first but Toni gave a look and all that shut down quickly.  All the noise Jess heard came from either the sound of the his own flesh slapping against itself or came from boys stopping what they were doing to hoot and holler at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow with sweat dripping down his newly enlarged chest, Jeff finished and made his way back to Toni feeling nothing but disgust towards his long time tormentor.  The face of Jess did not hide the discus well at all as Toni sneared and said, \"I don't like the look on your face, you'd better watch yourself or else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or else what?\"  Jeff said before he could stop himself.</span></div></div>",

If Toni messed with the website, or worse, destroyed the phone, he'd be Jess forever, another spineless member of Toni's little mean girl squad. Trapped in a web of his own doing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe phone returned to life with a small bing and Jeff watched as Toni sneered in at him, a perfect nail tapping away at the screen. Jeff's breath was caught in his substantial chest, his blood running cold as Toni's glare removed themselves from his eyes and focused on the screen, the nails tapping away like the hammer of a gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, now <i>that's</i> interesting...\" Toni purred, her eyes lighting up with sadistic glee as she spun the phone around. Jeff braced for the worst but was overcome with relief when he saw that Toni had simply dug into the photo gallery and pulled up slideshow of 'Jess\" lip locked with several much older men, most likely college age, and drinking large amounts of beer. There was even one photo of her with her top completely off!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you better fall back in line, you little bitch, or else I'll post these all over Facebook and show the whole world what precious little Jess gets up to on the weekends when she's supposed to be studying!\" Toni's voice was sing-songy but there was no joy or mirth in it, only a cruel knife edge that JEff could feel working under his currently flawless skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'That has to be how she controls all these girls, pure blackmail!'</i> Jeff thought as his eyes scanned the pictures, <i>'Just play it cool. Just be her lacky and you can get out of this!'</i> Jeff thought to himself, and as Toni's eyes narrowed and the shark like smile on those perfect lips began to droop into a sneer, he quickly forced himself into action. Widening his eyes and sending a very well manicured hand to his lips, Jeff let out a girly cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! Please! I'm sorry, Toni. You're right! I'm sorry, I'm a stupid dumb bitch. I should have paid better attention to the time.\" Jeff hoped his act was convincing, there was no telling what Toni might do if she didn't buy the act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToni looked over the quivering girl in front of her, and with a snort of derision she...</span></div></div>",

I want to see you run 5 laps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands planted firmly on her hips, she doesn't need to repeat herself, as you march off the grass towards the track, the laps already intimidating you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not you, Miss Tettona.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning, Jess saw Toni trudge back towards the teacher. \"You get to come with me.\" Her tone suggesting that Toni is in trouble, but it was the retreating phone, with the juicy blackmail material, and her way back to masculinity that was at the front of Jess's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a dismissive wave, Miss Jenkins waved her off towards the other girls. A pace barely faster than a fast walk, as the girls started jogging around the track. As Jess rounded the first corner, Toni, the phone and Miss Jenkins were nowhere to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA secondary concern, but rising in immediate priority for Jess, was the realisation that as a girl, she needed an appropriate bra for exercising. Her shoulders already ached from the jumping jacks, and her nipples felt raw from their own rubbing against the cups of her bra. Every jarring pace sending another reminder that she was female, her constantly shifting bust, and the ripples as her feet planted on the track with each racing step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wished the ground would swallow her up, as she spotted so many of the other athletes now observing the running girls, and also the leering approval from the bleachers. Her face contorted as she thought about how much easier things felt from there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer level of empathy, and sympathy was growing as she ran. A renewed respect for bustier girls, and an heart-felt desire for a smaller bust, in particular her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she raced, she felt more memories seep into her consciousness. The background Jess personality becoming firmer, and more real. The blackmail felt worse, as she recalled more pictures on her phone, more sexual, more revealing.... more humiliating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the laps were run, and with the other sweaty girls, they returned to the changing rooms.</span></div></div>",

The shorts, leaving her legs bare, and her top cut to show off her toned tummy, and cling to her ample bust. Enjoying the sight of the others as they changed, was somewhat less thrilling, as she changed her own bra for one that wasn't clammy with her own sweat. The little bolero jacket on top, did little more than draw attention to her bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she did find some car keys, and a driving licence in her purse. There was also the camaraderie, at your treatment. The girls sharing their stories. Impatient for the recovery of your phone, you quiz them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, after that, she found herself parking  your powder blue, open top in the Mall car park. Her friends pile out of the car, assuring and reassuring her that this is where Toni will be now. In a boisterous, giggling huddle they enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tension was clear amongst the girls now. With no-one wishing to be accused of anything that Toni might consider an excuse to release her blackmail material. Insufficient enthusiasm, or some other slight, real or imagined. She thought the girls were quieter, listening for comments that could be used in defence. To throw someone else under the bus, if Toni turned her attention to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess, feeling like Bambi entering the forest. Unsteady on her feet, and as if the world were filled with predators.

First of all he flipped himself to female and started working on the other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was going to be a Cheerleader Captain he thought it could always be fun being hot, he thought back at how D size breasts could be some nice eyecandy for the boys and decided to give those to himself, he could always change it later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then went on to adjusting her height making him taller than Toni but around the same height as the other Cheerleaders, making himself thin and then as strength and musclemass could be modified independently he made himself strong and athletic while keeping his very feminine look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving on to skills he gave himself extremely skilled at Cheerleading while also giving him some skills in different school subjects to make classes a little easier. He also gave himself girl skills such as makeup and clothing while also giving himself some skills when it comes to interacting with people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally it was time for relations and lifestyle.

He then made it so that everyone on school found herself friendly while respecting her authority.

There, on the opposite side of his bleachers, was Cassidy. But something was wrong. She was too far up, way too far up. And then it snapped into focus what she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassidy was standing on the bleacher railing, looking down the backside. Her backpack was laying on the bleacher below, a mess of books and papers, clearly homework, catching the wind and blowing away. A phone was outstretched in front of her and while Jeff could see her face at this distance, her could tell she was recording something. His blood ran cold as he realized what the girl was about to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god\" Was all he had time to mutter before Cassidy clutched her phone to her chest and pushed herself off the railing. And then she was gone, the only evidence she had been there was her backpack and her papers fluttering away in the wind. Jeff's heart started beating in his ears, and he launched himself up, racing down the bleachers in a blind rush, shoving his way past the cheerleading squad and right in front of the track team, before racing around the side of the far bleachers. The sight that greeted him on the far side caused him to fall to his knees as all strength left his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, in a growing pool of dark red blood, was Cassidy. The back of her head was caved in, her tear and blood stained eyes staring blankly up into the sky, her hands still clasped tightly around her cellphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god...\" Jeff whispered to himself, \"I...I caused this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeakly he crawled over to Cassidy's body and pulled the cellphone out of her still warm hands, his breathing heavy and his blood rushing in his ears as his heart threatened to leave his body. With a couple of shaky taps, he tapped back into the phone's photo gallery and found the last entry. He tried to take a breath and failed, a choked cry coming out of his mouth as he tapped the screen to play the video.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Her face is stained with tears, her eyes still watery as she looks into the camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy, daddy, I-I just want you to know that I love you. I-I love you so much! I just can't take it anymore, I'm sorry. Please don't be mad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassidy sobs one more time as the wind peaks the phone's microphone, and with a small gasp, everything turns into a chaotic swirl of sound and motion for a brief moment before ending with a sickening crunch and a single frame of the sky before the video ends</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff let Cassidy's phone slide out of his fingers and clatter to the ground as emotion began to overwhelm him. He had caused this. His stupid, stupid plan to eliminate a bully had only caused the bully to become so much more awful that it had driven this poor girl to suicide. Grief, guilt and regret wracked his body and Jeff felt tears beginning to flow. What was worse is that absolutely no one else noticed that a life had just ended. The athletes were all still practicing, the cheerleaders and that bitch Toni still gossiping and flirting every few minutes. Life continued on, just as normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept it wasn't normal. Any of it. Nothing had been normal since he got access to that goddamn website!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff felt a burning hot rage fill his chest and he stood, his pants stained by Cassidy's blood as it expanded outward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. This isn't going to happen. You didn't deserve this! I won't let you suffer for my mistakes!\" Jeff yelled, his fury finally attracting the attention of several other students, who began to rush over. Jeff didn't care, this was all meaningless, this reality was nothing and he was a god with the power of the website. Cassidy would live, and Toni would suffer. This Jeff was sure of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff pulled his phone out once more and tapped on the website, his keystrokes so hard that they threatened to crack the screen.</span></div></div>",

In his furious state he was only half aware of what he was doing, his animal-brain taking over in a mix of hatred and desire to punish Toni for all the pain she had caused in both of her lives. He flicked past the physical changes, there was no need, everything wrong with Toni was in her head. There!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPERSONALITY: CONTROLLING, DOMINANT, CRUEL, FEARFUL, VAIN, ENERGETIC, ATHLETIC-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff's mind only processed the first few.

To him, these select few were the problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see how you handle being on the blunt end, bitch!\" He snarled as the crowd that had formed around him starting snapping photos, screaming at him, accusing him. The collected group of students, now encompassing the track team and the cheerleading team, were all giving him a wide berth. Jeff glanced up for only a second to see Toni's pretty face staring wide eyed at him, almost as if she could tell he was talking to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no leaving things to chance. He made Tony into Toni, thinking everything would work out when all it had done was mess things up worse. <i>'No</i>', he reasoned as the sound of a siren echoed in the distance and he saw several teachers running towards the crowd from the gym, \"If you want something done right, you do it yourself'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Jeff changed Toni's relationship status from SINGLE to 'JEFF' and pressed apply changes. Everything warped around him for a moment as reality shifted, as the reality where Cassidy killed herself from the bullying to something entirely new.</span></div></div>",

He felt light-headed for a moment as his mind adjusted to the new world that formed around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff was watching a basketball game at his house, the living room empty save for the girl beside him. He blinked for a moment before realizing it was Toni, though she looked so different from when he last saw her. Instead of a cheerleading outfit, instead she was in a light hoodie and jeans, her hair blonde as ever but falling somewhat limply past her shoulders. Her make-up was subdued, still pretty but not the va va voom that it had been before. Her blue eyes were locked on the TV in front of her as her chin rested on one of her hands, which was now completely free of the expensive manicure and nail polish it had moments before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I'm sorry, I was just thinking about how I wish you'd let me go back to cheerleading\" Her voice was high and full of fear, \"But I know you like to have me to yourself.

No, I just saw her with her friends during study hall today but I didn't say anything! And then when school got out!\" There was something Jeff found...delicious in her voice.

He wasn't about to pass up the opportunity to, in his mind, get revenge for what Toni had done, though in reality (or what it was currently defined as) it was simply a victim getting the ultimate revenge on someone who had made his life hell for years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Jeff, it was only fair that he return the favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he pretended not to be interested as Toni slowly walked back from the kitchen, his eyes fixed on the TV screen as she slowly rounded the couch and held a plate with a admittingly delicious looking deli sandwich out to him, both of her smaller hands trembling as they held the plate. Jeff played dumb for a moment, forcing Toni to stand there until there was a break in the sports action on TV before turning his head towards her. Her eyes were full and wide, the emotions within ranging somewhere between fear and a desperate search for approval, and she smiled ever so slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, babe, just how you like it.\" Her voice was full of false happiness, strained and layered with a nervousness that Jeff forced Jeff to resist openly smiling about. Instead he forced his eyes from her face and to the sandwich once more; white bread, several layers of smoked turkey, mustard, ketchup and several bread and butter pickle slices. It was actually a very decent looking piece of food, and Toni had clearly put effort into it, Jeff had honestly just been expecting a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, but this was actually pretty good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Not that I'll let her know what' Jeff said and he forced himself not to grin once more. Instead of reached out and took the plate, looking up at Toni as he slid it into his lap. Her face seemed to relax in relief as she gave another small smile and turned to sit next to him, when Jeff sprung the trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's my drink?\" Jeff's voice was as flat and emotionless as he could force it to be. A simple question that made Toni freeze in mid motion, her head snapping up to face him as a delicious look of pure terror washed across her pretty face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Her voice was quiet, full of shocked disbelief, \"B-but you just said make you a sandwich...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh so now you're backtalking? I can't eat a fucking sandwich without a goddamn drink, Toni, unless you want me to fucking choke!\" Jeff launched himself up away from the couch, the plate sliding to the floor and shattering into several large pieces as the sandwich itself was upended. \"Is that what you want, for me to choke? Then who would take you? No man wants a spineless, stupid little pile of shit like you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToni was silent as pure terror overpowered her ability to talk. All she could do as Jeff loomed over her was slowly stumble backwards away from him with every step he took forward until she was suddenly against the wall, sliding to the cornerand freezing as Jeff stalked towards her. It felt incredible to Jeff, seeing his enemy reduced to a quivering little nothing trying to shrink into the corner, and he placed a hand against the wall next to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? I'm fucking waiting? Or do I need to open that pretty mouth of yours for you?\" He snarled, raising his other hand backwards . It was then that Toni cried out, a cascade of sobs pouring from the former bully as her slender arms shot up to cover her face, the over-sized sleeves of the hoodie sliding down almost to her shoulders, revealing a small road map of bruises both faded and fresh along her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff paused, suddenly taken aback by the sight. He pulled back from Toni's face and lowered his other arm as the reality of the situation seemed to quell to thirst for revenge, at least for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How...How did you get those?\" Jeff asked as he stepped back slightly, and he could see Toni's staring at him through one of the gaps in her arms, her hair hiding most of her face as she sobbed once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"I-I f-fell. I slipped on t-he kitchen flo-floor and fell on a ch-chair\" she whispered in between sobs. \"That's...T-that's what I-I told everyone! I p-promise!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear that it was a lie, but she wasn't willing to admit to it. Clearly in this reality, this twisted version that Jeff had created, Toni was clearly an abused girlfriend, and Jeff, it seemed, was the abuser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I want the truth. How did you get those bruises?\" His voice was quiet as he stumbled backwards. \"I want to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToni's patchwork arms lowered, pushing the long strands of hair out of her face as she remained in the corner. With a sharp inhale and her tear streaked eyes still watery, she pointed to a fresh one on her left arm. \"This one is from the other day when I talked to my old friends without asking you first...\" And-and this one\" she said, pointing to another fresh bruise, though clearly somewhat older, is when I looked at Bryan Highman in study hall last week...But I that's why I wear long sleeved shirts, to make sure no one ever finds out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another sharp inhale, Toni's voice broke again as her knees buckled, fresh tears flowing as her body was wracked with sobbing once more, \"I-I was b-being a bad g-girl! I'm s-sorry! I pro-promise I-I'll be a guh-good girl from n-now on!\". She attempted to say something else but it was consumed by tears. Instead she just slowly slid down the wall and sat hunched in the corner of the room as Jeff stumbled backwards into the arm of the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is insane\" Jeff said, \"I never meant for this to happen!\" And Jeff believed he fully meant it, but a little voice in the back of his mind, one tinted by anger, rage, years of hate and suffering flooding his thoughts once more in a seductive whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'But is it really all that bad? They deserve to be the victim...\"<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just as Jeff began to question his actions, desperately searching his conscience to answer the question of whether his revenge was justified. Just as he asked himself whether this was fair, whether the quivering, frightened trainwreck of a girl he saw before him was remotely the same brutish monster that Tony had been or the awful hag that had bullied Cassidy into committing suicide, and as he came to the conclusion that no, she wasn't, this Toni was an innocent victim just as he and Cassidy had once been in alternate timelines, the option for Jeff to edit this horrible reality into something more palatable was taken away from him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see, Jeff was not the only beta tester for RealityShift.net, and due to sheer coincidence, another beta tester for the website just happened to live a few blocks away from Jeff. Her name was Anna Clarke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being in the same grade and having attended the same middle school and high school as Jeff, the two had never quite crossed paths. They had of course seen each other in passing, and recognized each other's faces in the hallways, but neither Jeff nor Anna could ever claim to friends or even acquaintances. They were like two ships passing each other in the night, acknowledging the other's existence without ever having a meaningful interacting in six years of daily contact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the original reality, Anna herself had been sexually harassed by Tony, being the recipient of much unwanted attention from him in the form of gropings and ass grabs. She had reported it to her home room teacher, where her words went nowhere. Then she reported it to the principal, where it also went nowhere. When she finally told her parents, her father almost jumped the gun. Literally. Mr. Clarke had wanted to shoot Tony dead, but his daughter convinced him to be more rational. Anna had accepted a long time ago that complaints went nowhere. She convinced herself that she just had to accept it. Society was changing, and harassment becoming more unacceptable by the day, but it wasn't changing fast enough for her to be terrified of Tony's reactions if he ever discovered that he had been ratted out. Anna was legitimately concerned for her safety around Tony. She didn't know what he was capable of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna forced herself to accept this line of reasoning with mild mannered cynicism, until one glorious day when she received the link in her e-mail. A link to a website that was too good to be true. A website that could change reality. A website that could make people gods. Anna didn't even believe it at first. She made some joking changes, like changing her dog Buff into a tabby cat named Blue, and once she realized the power she held in her hands, Anna immediately knew what she wanted to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuriously, she began typing in names of male students and teachers that had caught her ire in one way or another. Most changes weren't too severe. She mostly altered their personalities to make them less misogynist, more open to feminism and social justice, and more fluid with their sexuality...basically to make them more like herself. Anna realized that she truly was acting like a god now, re-creating the men in her life in her own image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIronically, Jeff hadn't been one of her targets. As stated above, she barely knew Jeff and never interacted with him, and therefore she had nothing against the teenage boy. It was Jeff's own actions which put him in Anna's crosshairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment when Jeff altered reality by flipping around Toni's personality traits, reducing her to the submissive punching bag cowering against the wall of Jeff's living room, Anna's memories had been altered as well. She was now aware of Jeff. Rumors that he had a temper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all began when Toni had quit the cheerleading team two months ago, which was big news around the school. She had suddenly started going out with Jeff, who despite being average in every way and not up to Toni's usual standards in boyfriends had somehow wooed the teenage girl into compliance. Toni's cheerleading teammates were devastated. This version of Toni was not the terror she had been in the previous reality. If anything, this Toni was needy and desperate for approval, desperate to be liked by everyone, and went of her way to be kind and generous to others, if only so they would behave the same way towards her. It was completely chance that she just happened to be naturally good at cheerleading as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next two months, Toni became more and more withdrawn and reclusive. She began dressing more modestly, but she wasn't able to hide the fear in her eyes. Everyone suspected what Jeff was doing, they just didn't have the proof to confirm it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna in this new reality was angry at Jeff, who had replaced Tony as the high school's bad boy. Anna wanted to punish him and give Toni a new shot at her salad days in the process. Just as Jeff had begun to reach an epiphany about his desire for revenge, Anna's own bloodlust was causing her type rapidly, inducing a massive change to his life.   </span></div></div>",

The soft dressing gown secured around her slender waist. The delight drains instantly from your body a wave of shame washing over you, as you her swallow a sob. \"Sorry, sweetheart. I'm sorry, it won't happen again.\" you call sincerely to her from the couch. The siren call of control turned you into a bully instantly, your own failure to rise above your emotions painfully clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith recent events still acid-etched in his mind, Jeff decided to be cautious with the web-page, a lot more cautious.

Toni sets the plate aside, and edging her way forward on her knees, she rests one hand on each of your knees, before easing them apart. Her gaze fixed on her goal, her hunger driving your response, as you feel yourself stiffen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smile widens, pleased by your reaction. Teasingly slowly, she works your zipper lower, each tauntingly slow click, as the metal teeth unlock. You wonder if this is right, but as she meets your gaze, that concern evaporates. Certainly, you didn't cause this, you didn't intend this... so you might as well... Well, not resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer slender fingers ease you free, and you feel your pulse quicken, your resolve stiffen.

She felt much more comfortable in the brown skin, however, and, giving a prod between her legs, she was sure that there was nothing between her legs; nothing that would make her feel sick to think about. \"I could get used to this,\" she said to herself in the mirror, putting her hand of her hip and shaking her head, getting the long black hair all loose. \"I should think of a name for myself,\" she thought. \"Adam doesn't quite fit brown skin and boobs!\" she laughed to herself quietly so no one would hear her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before she could think of a name at all, it was apparently chosen for her. \"Fatima!\" a voice called from downstairs. \"That must be me,\" the girl who was called Adam thought.  \"Louis is here to pick you up!\" \"But I don't know a Louis?\" she thought to herself again. \"And I'm going on a date?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she dashed out of the room to find out who Louis was, she didn't notice the room's changes finalising.

He looked down, and realised: his hips and ass had ballooned out to the same size as Lucy's were, and looking further down, his entire bottom half had changed. He fell down onto his bed, not caring for what his mother was running off to say to whomever, and felt the cushioning on his new, fatter rear press into the bedding. Slowly unzipping his jeans, fearing the worst, he discovered frilly underwear similar in style to the ones that had appeared on his bed minutes earlier. Pulling them up, he saw the biggest change: his vagina. And yet, this all seemed normal to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam looked back to the computer. \"It is normal for me to have these pants.\" Of course it is! He had the same proportions (and equipment) as Lucy had, so there was no reason for them to not have shared with each other while they were in a relationship. Maybe he should make some other changes that weren't already what <i>was</i> normal. Maybe an actual change to himself would make Lucy be interested in him again?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sarah stared in silence at the crowded webpage that filled her laptop\u2019s display. Menus within menus within windows within sections made it a difficult read, all crowded with a clearly function-over-form mentality. The only thing that caught Sarah\u2019s eyes with the slight blue shade to one of the page\u2019s many empty forms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Please enter the subject\u2019s first and last name (if applicable).</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Sarah just stared, trying to figure out what sort of sick joke the website would end up being. Or maybe it was something more sinister. Identity theft, building a list of gullible email addresses for later phishing attempts? She wasn\u2019t putting her name in there, that was for sure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPausing to glance down at her cat Thomas, who brushed against her leg with a self-satisfied purr, Sarah noticed yet again the scratch running down her right arm. Face shifting from a smile at her cat to a frown at the mark, she found herself once again mentally going over the events that had led to the minor injury. Her crush, Jacob Miller, and an extra ticket to the local university cinema\u2019s anniversary Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind showing. She thought it was a perfect combination, and after a few hours practicing the night before had built up the courage to ask him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn\u2019t help but tear up at the thought of how he had snapped at her. The look of disgust, the hate that dripped from his voice. It wasn\u2019t like she was having a good day to begin with. She was used to suffering through the usual bullies, but Jacob? She had ran away crying so hard that she may as well have taken off her glasses. She still wouldn't have seen the open locker door that she ran into. The resulting fall had left scrapes and cuts, but as usual the worst injury of the day had nothing to do with her body. Unlike the dull numbness of her arm, the humiliation and regret still stung as clearly and painfully as in the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSickened self-disgust now turning into cold anger, Sarah entered Jacob Miller into the empty form. To her immense surprise, an unmistakable portrait of her classmate immediately appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared at the picture in silence for several moments before drawing her attention to the several new text windows that now even further crowded her screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Please select the desired change(s)</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long list of options, phrased as intentions such as \u201cChange subject\u2019s x\u201d or \u201cRemove subject\u2019s x\u201d appeared as she opened the drop-down menu below. Head spinning, she clicked one at random simply to see what would happen.<br>\r\n<b><br>\r\nChange subject\u2019s\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease describe modification.<br>\r\n</b><br>\r\nInstead of another drop-down menu, there was now another form for her to apparently describe a\u2026 modification? Sarah wasn\u2019t sure what that meant, but the thought of changing anything about Jacob filled her with a wicked burst of glee. The first thing would be his precious hair: Jacob cared about his swooped stylish semi-pompadour look more than most girls cared about their own hairstyle.<br>\r\n<b><br>\r\nChange subject\u2019s hair to a buzzcut.<br>\r\n</b><br>\r\nThe form turned a pale green. The portrait flashed white and then reappeared, now showing Jacob looking like he had just started bootcamp.<br>\r\n<b><br>\r\nModification understood. Would you like to make an additional change?<br>\r\n</b><br>\r\nSarah couldn\u2019t help herself. Despite her surprise at the portrait\u2019s change, she wasn\u2019t reacting in concern but in sheer glee. A grin played at her lips as she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Add to the subject\u2026</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah stared at her hands as she thought of something to add to this ridiculous little power fantasy. Immediately her attention was brought to her hello-kitty themed nail art. Jacob had torn into her for her self-described lolita look, calling her immature and even disgusting for her interest in the less-than-typical \u201cpedobait\u201d fashion. With a new burst of fury, Sarah went to work.<br>\r\n<b><br>\r\nGive subject fake nails. The fake nails are long and pink and are glued on. Decorate nails with nail art; bows, hearts, glitter, lace designs, all shades of pink and white.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new image of Jacob\u2019s undeniably male hands now sporting nail art to make hers seem butch had Sarah laughing hard enough to scare away Thomas. As the form flashed green and the previous question returned, she glanced at the computer clock and sighed. Selecting no at the option for additional changes, she thought about just closing the browser and going to bed when a new section appeared.<br>\r\n<b><br>\r\nPlease describe how this changes function:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is aware of these changes?</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah stared at the text form. What did this even mean? Interested but still tired, she typed in \u201cme\u201d. A new question immediately appeared below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The subject and all others besides yourself will not notice these changes. Confirm?</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah clicked the confirm button, still confused but interested in seeing what would happen next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Are these changes permanent and impervious to subject\u2019s attempts at self-modification? If not, how long will they be in effect or how may they be removed?</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah snickered at the thought of Jacob being stuck with nail art for the rest of his life. \u201cYes\u201d filled the green-flashing text form.<br>\r\n<b><br>\r\nFor additional change function options, select More. If you wish to make this an EZ-Change, select Finish. </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah glanced again at the clock. Despite her curiosity, she selected Finish. She would have come back to this after school. Another flash of green.<b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you wish to make these changes irrevocable? WARNING, change and its functions cannot be edited after confirmation.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was taken aback by the oversized warning that flashed onto the screen. Out of an almost involuntary instinct, she selected No.<b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese changes have been added to your [MILLER, Jacobs] change library. Thank you for using RealityShift.Net! And now a message from our sponsors. </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tacky fast food ad played as Sarah blinked in surprise. What was this website? And who put all the time and energy into these bizarre systems? It was all so surreal. Sarah closed her laptop and crawled into bed, trying to forget Jacob and everything about him even as she struggled to find some explanation for RealityShift\u2019s apparently nonsensical existence.</span></div></div>",

So full, but not flabby, and the bikini bottom vanishing into a crevasse of ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA soft purr comes from your own throat. A satisfied tone....

His ass expands outward giving Tyler feminine curves. With a tug, his penis disappears inside himself and becomes a vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking from his initial shock, Tyler recognizes the changes. As his face begins to tingle, Tyler can feels the womanly differences all over his body. Even as his face becomes the shocked face of a high school senior girl, Tyler fights the unwelcome changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, pressure builds on his chest as two breasts begin forming. Pushing against the advancing mounds, Tyler is consumed by the alien feelings of pleasure coming forth. Stopping at a C-cup, the shredded clothes of his past become a form-fitting gray tank top and rugged skinny jeans that show off every curve. A red plaid button up appears tied around his waist completing the transformation.

That definately wasn't true. At least not as she remembered it. The whole reason she typed into RealityShift that she didn't need a babysitter anymore, was because she couldn't stand Alexis. Sure she wasn't exactly mean to her when she was Tyler, but she ignored her almost all the time, and the only time she ever said anything to her was when she was telling her to be quiet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't possibly love her. Taylor froze for a second in realization. That was it! The shift she did. It must've had unforeseen consequences. Tyler's older self must've found the website and fell in love with Alexis at some point, either before or after receiving the email that lead him to the website. Then he shared it with Alexis, they started changing people with it, and at some point Tyler changed into a girl so he could date Alexis, all before today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay? You kinda spaced out for a minute there.\" Alexis brought Taylor out of her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah.\" Taylor responded, before a thought occured to her. \"But why didn't we just change your sexuality instead of uprooting my life completely.?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis stared at Taylor as if she just sprouted a second head. \"Uprooting? You said you were willing to sacrifice your manhood if it meant we could be together. And besides, it was your idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My idea?\" Taylor stared at Alexis in shock, again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you feeling okay?\" Alexis placed a hand on Taylor's forehead, trying to see if her girlfriend had a fever. \"I would think you changed something without me, and accidentally turned your awareness off or something, but that's obviously impossible since you don't have an account for RealityShift. You can only change things with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm alright, I just...wait.\" Taylor looked closely at Alexis. \"So YOU were the one that got the email that lead to RealityShift?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. How could you forget that?\" Alexis replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow things are getting confusing, as if they weren't already. Taylor guessed that Tyler's older self must've fallen in love with her, but instead of him finding the website and showing her, it was apparently the other way around. Which might mean that she had access to the site even before 7th grade Tyler did, and his change affected her memory because he didn't turn on awareness for anyone but himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you're really feeling alright, then how about we get to changing people already.\" Alexis turned back toward the laptop, but then looked back at Taylor with a sexy smile. \"Unless you wanna have sex instead? Your parents aren't here after all.\"  Taylor began feeling alien sensations she never felt before. Alexis's smile made Taylor's nipples hard, and her new vagina felt wet. She realized that she really was attracted to Alexis now, which scared her a little. She had never once felt attracted to Alexis, mainly because of her attitude toward her when she was Tyler, but she did think that Alexis was one of the better looking girls she knew. \"Well? What's it gonna be? Shift? Or sex?\" She straddled Taylor and kissed the former boy's neck. \"Better choose fast Tay, or I'll choose for you.\" She continued kissing Taylor's neck in various places while one of her hands snaked it's way into the new girl's pants and the other grabbed Taylor's left breast. Taylor was torn. Her body was telling her that she desperately wanted to indulge the beuatiful woman sitting on her lap. But ber mind was telling her that this was wrong, and she should tell Alexis to just log in to RealityShift. That would be her beat chance to return to normal. Which did Taylor choose?\"</span></div></div>",

Reading it through it seemed too detailed to be spam and the link didn't look suspicious. He clicked it and started reading through the website in disbelief. The site had a menu of different categories of changes he could make. There were people, history, global, and objects, among many other things. The description said that he could enter practically anything and make changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As a test, Adam clicked on objects and a text box appeared, asking what object he wanted to change.

At the top was a switch reading off. Adam clicked it to on and pressed confirm changes. As he did so the tv turned on. A dial with the current channel appeared on the site.

A disclaimer popped up on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You have made a noticeable change to reality.

He looked over and saw his roommate Griffin walking in, shirtless and sweaty. It was how he usually returned from the gym and it was one of the few things that Adam enjoyed about him as a roommate. Truthfully, he found all his roommates attractive, but he didn't think they would appreciate him ogling them all the time. Griffin gave Adam a quick \"Hey\", and went back to his room to shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A jarring cut to commercial on the tv caught Adam's attention, and his mind returned to his newfound reality warping abilities. He opened up Reality Shift and went to the people menu. His own profile was already pinned to the top of the page under the favorites bar. He decided to search up his roommates and add them as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Griffin's profile came with a live feed of him stripping off in his bathroom. He was a little bit shorter than Adam at 5'8\" but he made up for it with his muscled torso. He had some nicely placed tattoos across his chest and on his right arm. Adam wanted to add all his roommates quickly, but he saw on Griffin's profile that there was a simple text box on the side that was labeled \"Commands.\" He would have to check that out later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Noah was Adam's other roommate. He and Griffin were neighbors and had come to college and rushed their frat together. Noah had a bit more of a dad bod than Griffin, but he had an incredible ass. Of all his roommates, Noah did the most to actually help out around the apartment and keep it clean. Adam could see that Noah was currently in his last class of the day, not paying attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Adam's last roommate was Matt. He was 6'4\", and was slender, but still had a decent bit of muscle on him. His good looks and height gave him a rather cocky attitude, but it only made him more attractive. He was currently playing basketball with friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Adam favorited all their profiles and added them to a group he labeled, \"Roommates\". He then decided to have some fun. Under Griffin's profile, he typed into the command block, \"Do the dishes\" and hit enter. He watched onscreen as Griffin dropped his bar of soap and came out of his bathroom, wet and fully nude. He walked into the kitchen and began washing a pan he'd left out from the night before. He saw Adam sitting there staring and turned bright red. \"Uh, sorry man, I just realized I left this pan out. I... I don't know why I didn't just finish my shower.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Don't worry about it\" Adam both said and typed. The embarrassment and confusion disappeared from Griffin's face. Adam too had thought that Griffin would have finished his shower first. He saw a settings button and clicked it. The current settings were for commands to be followed immediately. Adam changed the settings so that his commands would be a strong suggestion. They would be followed, but people would get to them more naturally. Griffin finished washing the dishes and went back to finish his shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Realizing that he now had 3 gorgeous men under his control, the possibilities were endless.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The series of instructions that Adam gave Matt, Noah, and Griffin, ensured that while they were not going to initiate anything, they would be open to any advances Adam would make. In their minds now, any attention from their gay roommate was simply a compliment. Whatever he asked of them was no more an inconvenience than being asked to pass the remote. Adam decided that he'd messed with Griffin enough for now, so he decided to wait until his other roommates got home. When Noah arrived he came and sat down on the opposite end of the couch from Adam. Adam looked at him, starting a conversation just like he would normally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how was your class?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boring as shit. I just need to finish this one English class and then I'm done for the rest of college.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Adam moved closer to Noah, but he showed no signs of pulling away. He kept his gaze on the tv.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sucks, I know I can never pay attention in classes I hate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, there's a bunch of hot girls in that class though, so at least I can stay awake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Adam reached out and started to stroke Noah's arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any cute guys in the class?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? For you, you mean? I don't really pay attention to that man, you know I'm straight.\", Noah said, not reacting to Adam tracing his finger along his bicep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, of course you are\", Adam smirked, \"But do you mind if I feel your ass?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, man.\" Noah leaned to the side as he lifted his ass up off the couch. Adam reached down and put his palm on the muscular cheek. He gave it a good squeeze. \"You can sit back down now.\" Adam said, and Noah sat, pinning Adam's hand between his ass and the couch. After a few seconds he pulled it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did that feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me playing with your ass. Did it feel good? Did you like it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Noah looked confused, as if asked whether he'd enjoyed a handshake. \"It was fine I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're really hot. How do you feel about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, thanks man, it's nice to have someone think I'm attractive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you ever kiss a guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiss me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Noah reached out his hands and grabbed Adam's face as he moved in, planting a soft kiss on his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why'd you do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, you're gay, you think I'm hot, we're friends. It feels good to make you happy, even if I'm not getting anything out of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Adam stopped his questioning for the moment, happy with the effect it had had on Noah. Noah had turned back to the TV, unphased by the conversation he'd just had. At that moment, the door opened again. Matt walked in, his shirt drenched in sweat from his basketball game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Matt, you want to come over and watch with us?\", Adam asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, let me just shower first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, just come over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Matt sniffed his pit and shrugged, coming over to sit on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I give you a foot rub?\", Adam asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Matt swung his feet up onto Adam's lap. \"Yeah, sure, but they probably smell pretty bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Adam didn't mind at all, and eagerly untied Matt's basketball shoes. The concentrated smell of sweat hit Adam's nose and he inhaled deeply. Noah covered his nose. \"Damn dude, your feet stink.\" He got up and moved to the other couch. Obviously while Noah found Matt's feet gross, neither of the men thought it was weird that Adam didn't care. He started rubbing the feet through the soggy socks, but eventually removed them as well. He dug his fingers into Matt's tanned soles. He never thought he'd be sitting here watching his cocky, hot roommate lean back watching TV while he got to rub his sweaty feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Adam turned to Noah and asked if he and Griffin could make dinner tonight. As the two men got to work, he sent Matt off to shower, though he asked for his sweaty shirt, which he wore himself. The shirt was truly sopping wet from his sweat and filled the air around him with Matt's musky aura. When Matt finished showering the four all ate dinner together. While Adam didn't use his powers during dinner, he found that he was able to have much better conversations with his roommates now that he had no anxiety about his sexuality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After dinner he deposited Matt's shirt in his laundry basket and walked into Griffin's room, stripping down to his underwear. Griffin was already in bed on his phone. Adam crawled in with him and moved his hands down his chiseled abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gonna sleep in here with me tonight, Adam?\", Griffin asked nonchalantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Can you cuddle with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Griffin put his phone on his bedside table and wrapped his muscular arms around Adam. Adam ran his hands down Griffin's back muscles, and rested them on the firm glutes. He rested his head against his pecs and listened to Griffin's heartbeat as he fell asleep. In the morning he awoke from a very restful sleep. He knew now that he could do anything that he wanted. But he wasn't sure what that was. He could keep going as he had, leaving his roommates open to his advances. But he also wanted them to initiate contact with him. But with that, did he want his roommates to invite them into their rooms at night, and ask him for massages, or did he want them to order him to? The idea of Matt making him lick his feet, or Noah pinning him down and sitting on his face was also very appealing. All of these things were possibilities, but Adam decided to go with...</span></div></div>",

Two days ago he was nervous about looking in his roommate's direction if he had a shirt off, and now here he was after a night of cuddling. He put his finger at the top of Griffin's pecs and slowly moved downward, his hand disappearing beneath the covers. He groped Griffin's package and began to massage it, feeling the cock respond. As Griffin began to stir, Adam stopped and got out of bed, leaving his roommate to his dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Going into the living room, he saw that Matt was already awake, lounging on the couch in basketball shorts and a t-shirt with a bowl of cereal in his lap. He let out a small fart, which Adam found very attractive. Matt was so casually masculine. He was always farting, although they were small enough that they didn't smell. It just solidified that he viewed this as his space, where he could be comfortable and let loose. Until now, Adam had never felt the same way. But it turned him on, being around straight boys who'd never had to worry about hiding themselves. The confidence that came from that, the comfort with being masculine, was incredibly sexy. He stared at Matt's size 14 feet longingly. As much as he enjoyed Matt allowing him to rub his sweaty feet the night before, he much preferred a scenario where Matt commanded him to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Adam had experienced homophobia, but in some perverse way, he wanted his straight roommates to look down on him and force him to service them, but only in ways that he found sexy. He grabbed his laptop and opened Reality Shift, prepared to change his roommates yet again. He began drafting what he wanted from them. They would view his attraction to them as amusing. They would enjoy the marks of their masculinity. The smell of their sweat and farts, the bulge of their muscles were all sources of pride. They would feel good to be worshiped. And who would be more convenient to do it than their gay roommate. Turning him on would be good fun, especially knowing it was unrequited. For safety Adam included a safe word, which would bring his roommates back to their passive state. As he hit enter he noticed Matt shift in his seat. His tall roommate stretched his arms high, and wiggled his toes, giving Adam a knowing look as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Suddenly...</span></div></div>",
