He has brown hair, and hazel eyes, and today he's visiting his best friend in the world. She know him better than anybody else. As he reaches her front door, he prepares himself to knock, to let her know of his arrival. Just as he finishes knocking though, he feels something strange hit him. In an instant, his world expanded. Before his very eyes, everything that was once of a normal proportion, was now gigantic in comparison. Panicking, unsure of what exactly happened, James hears booming earthquakes in the distance, and he knows that she's on the way to the door. Hoping he can find a way to make contact, James braces himself for what he's sure is going to be quite the adventure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the door opens, his best friend pokes her head out. Who is she though?</span></div></div>",

She looks around for James, but not seeing him, she simply shakes her head. \"Silly kids, don't they know it's rude to knock on somebody's door, and run.\" She then pulls her head back inside, shutting the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, James finds himself running towards his best friend. She was clueless, and he expected nothing less. While they were so close, James knew she wasn't the sharpest tool in the shed. His best bet right now, was to try and catch up to her, before she disappeared. And it seemed time was running out, as the door was closing behind him. Putting in an extra dash, James made it inside her house, with just enough time to continue the chase. Looking up, while he was still running, he realized just how tall Amelia really was. She was impressive at 5'10\" alone, but now that he was shrunken, she looked taller than the Empire State building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching his breath, James takes a break, before running towards her temporarily stationary, size 11 feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does he do from here?</span></div></div>",

She was expecting James, but not seeing him, she assumed it was just some kids, playing a prank, who ran off. \"Yeah, you better run!\" Ariana shouts out, not knowing that James was actually the one who rang the door. Ariana was short, standing at a mere 5'1\", she also had jet black hair, and hazel eyes. However, whenever she got angry, those eyes have been known to turn into fireballs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, on the ground below, James was left petrified. Ariana was wearing a tank top, her jean shorts, and her pair of Timberland boots. While it'd be a mighty climb, James couldn't help but think that he might have to try and scale those boots. It was a terrifying thought, but right now, James didn't have many options. And he knew he needed to move quick, because Ariana was turning around and closing the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning, and barely getting inside, James decides to catch his breath, and figure out his next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does he do now?</span></div></div>",

Sweeping their gaze around, she doesn't see James, who she was expecting to see. Speaking to herself, \"That weird. I expected to see James, but the nobody was at door.\" Michelle, being foreign, wasn't the best at English, so some (or most) things she said, sounded like broken English. Standing there for another couple minutes, James shook himself out of his shock, and began running into her house, knowing that would be his best chance of getting her attention. However, just as he made it across the barrier of the door, Michelle finally decided to turn, her foot causing a lot of wind and dust to be kicked up. In turn, James began flying across the floor, landing by the shoe rack she kept near the door. Shaking himself off, surprised that he wasn't injured, James began hatching a plot. Looking at the shoes, he noticed four pairs he could easily climb. Standing on her shoe would certainly cause her to notice him. The only question was, which shoe did he pick.</span></div></div>",
