John, Brent, Brody, Andrew, Joel, and I were working on the bus we had stolen from the scrap yard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe had retrofitted the bus to make it zombie proof. We had put in a new engine, enlarged the gas tank, and equipped it with a small roof turret we had managed to pick up at the army surplus store. The bus was loaded with some food, several maps, plenty of water, and ammunition for multiple types of weapons. We were about to start welding on the armour we had made for the bus when we spotted the first zombie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tImmediately recognizing the threat we all sprang into action. I jumped into the bus and started the engine as Andrew sat himself in the navigator\u2019s seat while Brody climbed into the turret. Then a giant horde of zombies appeared at the end of the street. John, Brent, and Joel came flying out of the house and into the bus as the zombies reached the house two doors down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI gave the engine some gas as I shifted it into reverse, running over that first zombie as the bus backed onto the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI shifted the bus into drive and floored it, the wheels squealed slightly as we took off. John picked up a shotgun and kicked out a left side window while Joel took over the turret from Brody, leaving him free to grab a machinegun and knock out the centre rear window. Meanwhile Brent picked up a pair of handguns and opened a right side window while Andrew pored over the maps, looking for the fastest and safest route out of the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIn no time at all we were on the highway and feeling extremely nervous, we hadn\u2019t come across a single zombie since we had left the house. Then it hit us, literally, a zombie driving a car had rammed the side of the bus. John aimed and squeezed off two shots, the first shattering the windshield, the second blasting the zombie to bits. As the car peeled off toward median I saw a battalion of cars coming up behind us in the side mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJoel fired a quick burst from the turret and managed to take out a large sedan at the edge of the pack. Then we saw them, two large 18 wheelers rolling up the highway, cars pulling aside as they raced toward us. With that Brent called out over the roar of the bus\u2019 strained engine \u201cHow should we take them out?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I immediately realized that I should have used Alchemy to fuse the armour to the bus before we left, \u201cBut,\u201d I thought to myself, \u201cif I had I\u2019d probably be a zombie by now.\u201d John pushed Brody aside and clapped his hands together. Placing them on the back door and seats he transformed them into a fully automatic, turret mounted, Mini gun. \u201cHe\u2019ll need ammo!\u201d I called back, \u201cAnd I could use a higher Octane content in the gas tank!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrent immediately transmuted one quarter of our ammo into belt-fed incendiaries while Brody upped the Octane to 95. The result was almost instantaneous, the speedometer, which had been holding steady at 120km/h, rolled farther right to 150km/h. The rapidly approaching 18 wheelers appeared to stop dead, when, in reality, we had just matched speed with them. John seized the opportunity and riddled the first truck with incendiaries, setting the truck\u2019s cab on fire. The truck swayed for a moment and proceeded to drift into its partner dragging both of them off of the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we raced further down the highway Andrew called over to me, \u201cWe have two options; take the next exit and try to lose them in the country, or stay on the highway and try to outrun them.\u201d I knew instantly what we should do.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The following zombies all tried to take the exit at the same time and wound up blocking their own way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe sped into the country and quickly came across a farm. I pulled in and we used the opportunity to further upgrade the bus. We used the old metal barn for armour, ammo, and improvements to the roof turret. We also ransaked the house and grabbed as much food as we could. Before we left we pulled over to the tractor sitting in the driveway and used it to improve the bus' engine and increase the tire's  durability, just in case we had to go off roading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner had we gotten back on the road then we saw zombies again. As I sped the bus up I wondered how long the fuel would last, but I was distracted when I heard the unmistakeable sound of propeller blades slicing through the air. Joel confirmed my fears when he said, \"It's a helicopter!\" None too comfortable with the answer I asked him, \"What kind?\" John replied, \"It's...</span></div></div>",

Suddenly I saw an old dirt road covered with a canopy of trees. I floored the gas pedal and raced for the cover of the leafy branches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the helicopter fired a missile, it streaked toward us at an alarming rate. We were almost to the road when I realized that it was too late, we wouldn't make it. We all watched resignedly as the missile crashed through the rear of the bus and exploded. The bus was ripped to shreds from the inside out as the flaming gases rapidly expanded. There was nothing left of the bus except a smouldering pile of charred and twisted metal.</span></div></div>",

It crashed into the first few cars and exploded, buying us time to get a head start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe raced onward past farms and small towns, working our way ever westward. It soon became dark as night settled in and we were forced to stop at an old, abandoned gas station named the \"White Rose\". I pulled the bus in behind the station and saw that there was an old steam engine, lying in the dirt. Fortunately the rest of the night passed uneventfully and just before we left in the morning I transmuted the cow-catcher and cattle guards onto the bus as added protection from the zombies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day we came across a fork in the road, the left-hand road led down into a flood plain and the other road led into the mountains. I asked Andrew which was the better path but he replied, \"It really doesn't matter, they both get us to the same little town at the same time.\" While I wondered which way to go Brent piped up and said, \"We should take...</span></div></div>",

We pulled in and immediately went to work on armouring and refueling the bus. Within 5 minutes we had upped the engine's power, enlarged the gas tank again, and generally turned the bus into a rolling fortress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe had just finished a brief lunch when we heard a low, loud rumble. We all climbed back onto the bus and started it up. That's when the zombie driven tank rolled into view. The turret rotated toward us and just as it came into range, it fired.</span></div></div>",

The round raced past the right-hand side of the bus and smashed into the median further up the road, shattering it and sending pieces of concrete and rebar flying in every direction. Fortunately we weren't hit by any of the shrapnel and were abe to get out of the tank's range before it was able to fire again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sun set in the sky I pulled into the parking lot of a small fast-food restaurant. It was an easily defendable size and would suit our needs for the night, we would ship out first thing in the morning. We fortified the building and set in for the night, everyone taking turns standing guard. I was allowed to hand my shift off to someone else because we all agreed that the driver is the one who needs the most sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was awakened at midnight by sound of...</span></div></div>",

I saw that Brody, who was on watch, was messing around with the deep fryers but I dismissed that as the source of the noise. Suddenly I realized where I had heard the noise before, it was the tank!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got up immediately and told Brody to wake the others. I deconstructed one of the barricades and raced out side. I clapped my hands and placed them on the ground, creating a twenty foot tall wall of solid rock around the bus and restaurant. I then created steps in both sides of the wall and climbed over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce on the other side I clapped my hands again placing them on the ground to create my signature axe. The tank crawled closer, clearly damaged from our previous encounter. I crouched low and ran toward it making it into the moon-shadows on the right-hand side of the tank. I sliced the tank's tread rendering it nearly immobile before jamming my axe into the space between the turret and the tank body, effectively rendering it a pile of scrap metal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI clapped my hands together for a third time and placed them on the tank, fusing it with the asphalt of the highway. Turning around I saw Brody running toward me and suddenly I knew what he was planning. I put my hands together and Brody used them as a springboard, landing on the tank's hatch. He then used Alchemy to fuse the hatch shut and seal the end of the tank's barrel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody and I ran back to the wall and I transmuted a large garage door into it so we could get back in and get the bus out. It was barely 1:00am when we were back on the road. By 2:00 the highway had narrowed to only two lanes and we had come to a stop at \"T\" corner.

Where there had once been a tire there was now a shower of sparks but this zombie was persistent, the truck slowed to where it matched our speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow one truck was just behind and to the left, the other with its cab alongside us.

As we raced along I saw that a train, at least 50 cars long, was sitting on the tracks, blocking the road. I slamed on the brakes and pulled the bus off the road and into a field. We sped through the wheat while Joel watched for the end of the train from his vantage point in the turret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we rode through the field I spotted a road that ran parallel to us and curved to where it crossed the railroad. I pulled up onto the road and increased our speed, mainly because the train had started moving. The train picked up speed as we raced to the crossing.

We pulled off the road for a little while, while I constructed a Somebody Else's Problem machine or SEP for short. Basically an SEP renders an object invisible but people avoid it like they would an object they can see. When the SEP was up and running we got back into the bus and finished the drive to the city. I figured it was the best thing to do becuase we didn't know if the zombieism had traveled this far and if it hadn't our bus would surely have drawn attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately the city was completely zombie free and we were able to stop at an A&amp;Ws for supper.

Brody immediately swung one of his machetes through the roof of the car he was standing on and managed to cut the zombie in two in the process. Brent, however, was a little more precise, he stabbed his katana through the car's roof and embedded it in the zombie's head. With one swift jerk Brent snapped the head off the zombie and cleft the steering wheel in two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrent and Brody both jumped onto the hood of the bus as the cars they had taken out swung out and smashed into the following cars, stopping them in their tracks. I opened the front doors and they climbed in while we waited with baited breath hoping that our little tactic worked.</span></div></div>",

The resulting explosion shook the bus and threw it into the crash barrier. Sparks flew as I tried to bring the bus back onto the pavement. Racing onto the highway I saw that the zombies were taking the off-ramp in the wrong direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI floored the gas pedal and the bus's engine roared as we gained speed in an attempt to outrun the zombies. We sped past the first few cars as they drove onto the highway. The highway was soon filled with zombie driven cars. My friends obiterated many of them and caused the others to slow down. Soon we were out in the country and the road narrowed to only two lanes. We raced past numerous side roads and a few small towns. One of the many small towns had a large weapons shop. We would have loved to pull over and pick up more ammo but the zombies were hot on our tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that's where things got weird. The zombies all suddenly pulled over for no mapparent reason. We used the oppourtunity to put much more distance between us and them. Almost an hour later we were getting worried, there had been no zombies since they pulled off the road. As we began to confrence about what they were planning the zombies reappeared. \"Oh shit,\" I said, \"This reminds me of...\"</span></div></div>",

If these zombies are smart enough to rig 18-wheelers to explode then they're smart enough to figure out every one of our moves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Brent sighed, \"If that's really what it's come down to then there's nothing better to do than go out in a blaze of glory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's settled then,\" I called from the driver's seat, \"We drive head first into the horde and obiterate as manny as we can before the bus is destroyed.\" They all looked at each other for a moment before letting out an earsplitting warcry and climbing onto the bus. I put the bus into drive and spun it around before gunning it toward the mass of zombies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly I spotted another rigged, big-rig. Steering toward the explosive tanker I was deafened by all the gunfire my friends were dishing out. Time seemed to slow as impact neared. Just before the bus and 18-wheeler collided I saw the rotting face on the zombie and gave him the customary middle-finger. The resulting explosion shook the landscape and obliterated half of the car-driving zombies, leaving fewer for someone esle to clean up.</span></div></div>",

Suddenly the wind began to pick up and zombie driven cars began to sway in the onslaught as we raced along side a small lake. A moment later the water in the lake rose and washed over the highway, creating a two foot deep torrent that began to pull cars off the road and choke the engines of the lower riding vehicles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brody, NOW!\" I yelled. Just a moment later a giant fireball exploded from the back of the bus and engulfed many of the closest cars. My turn I thought and immediately steel panels tore free from the zombie driven cars and huge sections of the road lifted into the air, effectively creating a wall of scrap metal and stone. I smiled as the zombie driven cars crashed into the newly formed barrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI guess I should have mentioned that me and my best friends are able to control the elements. I can control the earth and metal, reshaping it to best suit my needs. John can control the air, creating huge gusts of wind and manipulating the content of the air. Brody is capable of manipulating fire and creating flames from his fingertips, usually teaming up with John to create massive explosions. Brent can control the waters, able to make the tides ebb and flow in many strange ways as well as control anything that contains water. And Andrew is unique among even us because he can control both Light and Dark and, due to the clash inherent in those two elements, he has control over lightning too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon we were well ahead of the remaning zombies when the highway narrowed to only two lanes and we found ourselves at large roundabout.

I called Joel down from the turret and told him to take the wheel. In the moment where no one was in control the bus slowed and the zombies caught up. I walked back to where John was standing and he handed me my sword and scabbard. I strapped the belt around my waist and pulled it tight.
