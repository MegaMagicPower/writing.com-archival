Almost certainly not!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGround rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.Weight gain and related fetishes only; Light slob is allowed but nothing beyond sweating/burping<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.No character death, gore, underage characters, or anything else similarly extreme<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.Make sure that new entries are at least a paragraph or two in length unless simply supplying an option. People are here to read stories, so make sure you're adding substantial content<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4.On a related note, keep your grammar clean and try to limit the amount of dirty language<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5.Nothing explicitly pornographic. Romance is fine, but nothing excessively erotic</td>",
