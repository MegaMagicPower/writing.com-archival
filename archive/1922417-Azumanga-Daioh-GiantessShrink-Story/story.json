The sleeping girl begins to stir... She's waking up! Her sudden movements startle you and send you into panic. The thought began racing through your head: \"I gotta hide! Where do I hide?!\" You remember the open drawer and think it's your best bet. You jump in the drawer and pray you wouldn't be found. You tried to ignore the tons of underwear around you and keep calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen after listening for a few seconds, you heard her giant footsteps... coming towards you! You had no choice. You hide into the nearest sock so that you wouldn't be seen. Luck was not on your side. You had only just thought about the risk of your plan when your hiding place is lifted into the air. You pause and think she stopped. She did, but it was because she was putting her foot into the sock. Time seemed to slow as you watched her beautiful foot come down on you. Her toes came over your head until her smooth sole rested gently upon your tiny form. You couldn't believe your predicament. You just became a giant girl's insole!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakaki was completely unaware the whole time. To her it was just another morning. Nothing unusual at all. You were just too tiny to be felt as she slipped her feet into the sock. She went through her entire morning routine and prepared for school. Her soft foot barely harmed you as she walked around. Each step was just made slightly uncomfortable as you were forced into her sole. It felt kind of nice. The slight stink was not bad. Actually, it was rather intoxicating. As she sat down to eat, you began to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know what was happening. You were afraid and thought death or torture was imminent a few minutes ago. Now, you felt strangely relaxed by your situation. A part of you was trying to get you to snap out of it. The other slowly pulled you into a state of deep relaxation. You thought maybe the smell was getting to your head or something, yet you embraced it. You took in deep sniffs of the aroma. Then the urge came as you stared at her sole to kiss it, passionately. To feel all over her foot with your lips and tongue. Like she was a goddess and you her servant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't resist. You kissed her sole. You kissed again and again trying to get every spot you could. Sakaki had started walking to school. The heat outside was intense. So her feet began to sweat. You didn't stop your worship when you tasted her sweat. Infact, it encouraged you. The taste was addictive. You licked the sweat as it came. You let it wash over you. You were losing the fight to keep out of her foot's control. You couldn't fight back your perverted desires. You hoped, somewhere in you, that this would end. So you could break from your trance.</span></div></div>",

You just know that you've somehow become extremely small inside one of the hallways in school. It's the end of the day and just when you think you finally get to go home this happens! The halls seemed to be clearing up and you started to go on the move thinking you would be safe from someone stepping on you. However there was one girl who came around the corner and started coming your way. She was just about to pass when she turned and stared right at you. She approached you and looked straight down at you. This gave you a view up her skirt but she didn't seem to notice. You were to scared to move as she reaches down and grabs you. She holds you up to her face as you found the will to speak up. \"Um... Hi.\" You greet her and she becomes shocked. \"Oh my god! A real shrunken person!\" She walks into the school library which was right next to you. No one appeared to be there right now. \"So what is your name, tiny?\" Again you found the courage to speak up. You tell her your name. \"I'm Ayumu Kasuga, but everyone calls me Osaka. Nice to meet you!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She lays you down on a chair as she searches the nearby shelf for a book. \"So what are you doing here, Osaka?\" She pauses for a bit before responding. \"There was a book I was supposed to get before I left today. What was it again?\" You start to feel more comfortable around this gentle giant and try to offer help. \"Is there a certain class you need this book for?\" She doesn't respond and just stands there lost in thought. \"Um... Osaka?\" Still no reply. \"Hmm...\" Osaka finally says and begins to sit down. The problem is she was about to sit on the chair your on! \"No wait! Osak-\" You were cut off as her giant butt came down on you and pinned you under her crack. She feels you and shifts around rubbing her butt on you. Then she remembered the situation. \"Oh no!\" She got up and picked you up again. \"Sorry about that. Hehe...\" You get on your feet again. \"It's alright...\" She layed you on the table this time. \"At least I remember that book I needed now. People often say I'm a bit spacey. I kinda see what they were talking about at times like this.\" she picks you up again. \"Come on, little guy. I got to look after you until we find a way to change you back.\" as you walked along you listened to Osaka's crazy ideas of how you could fix this until...</span></div></div>",

I know she's my friend but I'm not sure I can trust her with this yet. She may be a prodigy but she's still just a little kid, how do I know she won't just use this little guy as a plaything?...Or what if I want to first??</i><br>\r\nUltimately, Osaka decides she is not ready to share you with the rest of the world just yet; she'll keep you for a few days and then her first priority will be to save you. But for now, as Chiyo draws near...<br>\r\n\"Sorry about this, little guy, but I don't know if Chiyo can be trusted with you!\" the transfer student whispers down to you.<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? Why are you apol-?\" But you are cut short from asking your question as it is already answered. Putting you in the quickest and most convenient place she can, Osaka subtly drops you into the back of her panties. You scream on the journey in as you are reacquainted with her ass again only minutes after the first encounter. Only this time, it was on a much more intimate level. <br>\r\nAllowing her panties to snap back, Osaka gets a slight chill feeling you in her ass. She is unsure of it but she finds she may..enjoy it? There's no time for her to dwell on it as Chiyo makes her last steps to her older friend. <br>\r\n\"There you are, I was looking all over for you!\" the brunette excitedly exclaimed. \"Y-You have?\" Osaka, already feeling guilty about keep a secret from her best friend, instinctively clenches her butt cheeks. You are in total agony as you are pulverized in the soft fleshy mounds, and are disgusted to learn that in doing so, Osaka's working up a huge sweat. The salty liquid reeks of B.O. and you are splattered up against her inner left ass cheek. You turn your head ever so slightly. Out of the corner of your eye you see Osaka's asshole, glinting with sweat and pulsating ever so slightly, as if to reach out and give its intruder a kiss of death. You scream out, trying to get help. \"HEY, OSAKA!!!!! GET ME OUT OF YOUR BUTT!! CAN ANYONE HEAR ME?!?!?\"<br>\r\nMeanwhile, outside of your hell, Chiyo giggles light heartedly. \"Of course, silly! I have the book you needed to get back at home. I had forgotten to tell you, but you can come over and we'll have a little studying get together. Like a girl's night in!\"<br>\r\nRelieved, Osaka allows herself to relax, causing her ass cheeks to fall back into their natural position. Unfortunately for you, still glued to the interior by her guilt sweat, you are dragged along with them and end up in the one place you've been dreading: Osaka's \"flower\". You scream and struggle more and more as your face slowly makes contact and sinks into the greasy butt hole in front of you. \"OSAKA PLEASE STOP!!!! CHIYO!! ANYONE!!! FOR THE LOVE OF ALL, HELP ME PLEASE!!!\" However, all the screaming into her asshole only vibrates it, causing it to loosen and....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPHHHHHHHFHRHRHRHRHTSSHHTHTTHTH!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA horrid torrent of warm musky gas that smells like peaches and spoiled egg releases itself from Osaka's asshole, getting plugged by you and forcing its way through whatever openings remained in the seal of your head and the sphincter devouring it. That meant that the majority of it was forcibly inhaled and ingested by you. You get immediately lightheaded and nauseous, unable to continue your struggle. <br>\r\nFrom above, Osaka and Chiyo are walking towards the exit when the former feels a fart coming on...but doesn't hear it?? And she hardly smells anything. If she doesn't mention, she doubts Chiyo would even notice! \"Uh, Chiyo, I have to use the bathroom quick. Excuse me!\" <br>\r\nInside the restroom, Osaka pulls you out of her butt, with a small *pop* as your face is finally released from the vice it was kept in. She looks down at your delirious form and says...<br>\r\n1.\"Aww, you must really love my butt and my smelly little farts!!\" (Happy/Smitten)<br>\r\n2.\"Haha, if you thought THAT was fun, wait until girl's night little guy!!\" (Playful)<br>\r\n3. \"Why would you do that?? Maybe I should sneak you a turn with Chiyo, obviously you'll enjoy that!\" (Angry/Vengeful)</span></div></div>",

It seemed like a big one. What was that little guy doing down there?</i> As she finally discovered your limp form, she was surprised that she had to yank so hard to get you out - until with a pop she realized what you had done. \"Why would ya do that, mister? What's wrong with you, sticking your head up my-my cornhole like that! Are you some kind of perv or somethin'?\" <br>\r\nYou deliriously look up at her, head still spinning. Why was she so mad at YOU? Shouldn't she be apologizing? As soon as you're called a perv, you snap back to your senses. <i>Wait - she, she actually thinks I ENJOYED that? Being forced head first into her disgusting, greasy anus and being forced to suck down her disgusting fart?</i> \"Excuse me? I didn't want that to happen, I-\"<br>\r\nBefore you can explain, she continues on. She's so mad that not even her easy-going ways will slow her down. \"Oh no, I felt you squirming until you got to mah back door, and then suddenly stop when you got to smell mah 'lovely' fart, you sick freak. No wonder ya got beneath me before. I'm gonna have to punish you for this, but I'm too sick to even luck at ya.\"<br>\r\nAt this moment, Chiyo knocks on the door. \"I-is everything okay in there, Osaka? It sounds like you're saying something but I can't quite hear you!\"<br>\r\nOsaka turns to the door. \"U-uh, yeah, everything's okay Chiyo! Ah'll be out in a sec.\" Turning back to you, she has an idea. \"You know what, maybe I don't have to deal with you after all... I'll sneak you in a turn with Chiyo. I'm sure a perv like you would enjoy that.\" With that, she squeezes you tightly in her hand as she begins storming out of the bathroom.

There's some kind of floating... ghost cat there!\" Chiyo quickly turns and looks around, but sees nothing. \"It went down the staircase. See if you can see it.\"<br>\r\nChiyo's very confused at this point, but doesn't stop to ask questions, rushing to the railing. But she's too short to look over it, so she grabs hold and raises herself as high as she can, bending over the railing to look down. \"I... don't see anything Osaka?\" While Chiyo's distracted, Osaka quickly walks over to her. Seeing her chance as Chiyo bends over, Osaka takes her clenched fist from behind her back and releases it over the gap in Chiyo's panties from bending over. \"W-what was that, Osaka?\" <br>\r\nAs Chiyo starts to turn around, Osaka breaks out of her focused trance, and grabs Chiyo by the skirt, pulling her back from the railing. \"Oh! Sorry, I thought you were going to fall, I kinda spaced out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you had been clenched in Osaka's vengeful, clammy fist as she conversed with Chiyo. You felt some movement, but you weren't completely sure what was going on, until... Suddenly you were released from your prison, tumbling down from one sweaty hell to another. You landed between two cheeks, easily recognizing them as an ass after your recent encounters, though far less meaty than your previous residence. What in the hell happened to make Osaka's ass so much lighter, you wondered.<br>\r\nLooking around a bit more, however, you realized that the panties holding your prison together had a design on them - cute bunny faces. This certainly wasn't Osaka's ass you were in, so...this must be 'Chiyo's' ass, right? Thinking back, you remember hearing the name somewhere before... That was that young 'genius' girl you and your friends were making fun of the other day, right? The one that looks twelve and is flat as a washboard in front and in back? Well, it'd certainly make sense that it would look like this from the inside, but... If she's young and impulsive, she'd probably see you as nothing but a doll - if she sees you at all! Even spacey Osaka would be better, if she wasn't mad at you! You have to scramble out of here.<br>\r\nWhile all this runs through your head in a few seconds, Osaka has grabbed Chiyo's waist band, her massive fingers shoving you deep between Chiyo's tiny ass cheeks. Then things get even worse. As Osaka pulls back on Chiyo's skirt to cover her dumping of you, she also pulls back on Chiyo's poor bunny panties, launching them and you deeper and deeper. Chiyo's wedgie wedges you far up this ass, until you get close to having a familiar look at an unpleasant hole she hides from the rest of the world. You can tell you're getting close, because while on the outside her butt was cool and dry, the moist sweat that has collected in her crack over the course of the day is far from gone. With this disgusting smelling liquid expediting your movement upwards, and only Chiyo's small assets to keep you away, it was only a matter of time before you had a face to face audience. <br>\r\nFinally, the stench of her ass sweat gave way to the stench of her asshole, as you were slid right up to where the sun don't shine. This young girl's anus showed itself to you finally, a pink, puckered button. It was nearly the opposite of Osaka's hungry, devouring monster of a black hole, being a much lighter color and smaller in size. You found yourself involuntarily wondering what on earth could cause such a difference. Maybe it was mainly the difference in age. You were horrified to think of how many dumps Osaka would have had to take to transform an innocent flower like Chiyo's sphincter into the near brown hole you had encountered. Maybe it was hygiene, and Chiyo merely took much greater care in wiping than Osaka did - it's certainly believable that the airhead would forget once in a while. Or maybe it was a difference in diet. Osaka was certainly larger, so maybe she ate far more and that was the cause? Your stomach pitted at what your great amount of thoughts on these facts meant. Unintentional and thoughtless acts of these normal girls had driven you this far, to merely hoping they eat less and take better care of their assholes for you.<br>\r\nStill, the bright side was that Chiyo's anus looked fairly innocent, and if the situation were any different you would never think that this small hole is what this schoolgirl uses to dispose of her disgusting daily waste. But while it didn't look so bad currently, you could almost see the smell coming off this massive pink pucker starfish, which apparently did little to keep in the stink. And it was only getting closer...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar above, Chiyo and Osaka had continued their conversation after both apologizing for the awkward turn of events. They started to wander towards the school entrance, and while they change shoes...</span></div></div>",

The sleep finally no longer fogging your eyes, you realize these are all normal objects... Except, they are now massive. Hundreds of times bigger than you, in fact. You can only be a few inches tall!

You suddenly realize she's been moving towards you this whole time, and start jumping and waving your arms again to get her attention before she sits - you don't want to have to listen to and watch her do all that while fearing for your life, after all.<br>\r\nIt's working! She reaches down for you, and you close your eyes to brace for impact... And... It doesn't come? WHAM! Instead of her gigantic hand grabbing you or even slamming onto you from above, you're shocked by a massive force from behind. Flailing, you quickly grab what's behind you so that you don't fall off the toilet to certain death below. Turning to see just what the hell slammed into you, you see nothing but white... Wait, had she really just torn of a small square of toilet paper and taken you for a ride with it? Indeed, it was just a small, single square, and as it fluttered within her grasp as she walked back to her sink, you were blown about with it. Barely holding on till the sink, you get a brief look at the jar she had pulled out. You barely read 'Anu-' before you were lifted up, and Tomo got a better grip on the toilet paper. A great force held you tightly as the toilet paper was balled up around you, leaving only your head sticking out. Looking down, it seemed you were suspended directly above that container filled with some kind of clear, wax-y ointment solution... and it's getting closer. Well, at least it doesn't smell, you expected it to smell a lot worse.<br>\r\n...Wait. You're rolled up in toilet paper and held by a gigantic girl that's nearly crushing you by simply holding onto you. Suddenly overcoming your shock, you start yelling at her and wiggling with all your strength to free yourself, but it's far too late, and gigantic Tomo is merely musing to herself as she mindlessly goes about her regular routine. \"Yeah yeah, apply it yourself. Ha, I'll show 'em! Why should I use my finger when I can just use toilet paper, huh? You're a genius, Tomo!\" With that, she unceremoniously shoves you head-first into the ointment, saturating you and the surrounding toilet paper with it. After wiping as much off your face as possible with the surrounding tissue, you can hear her continue.<br>\r\n\"Geez, I mention just one time how my butt feels kinda sore, and they insist I try this stuff. What a pain!\" What in the hell is she dragging on about? You continue yelling at her for attention, but she just keeps jabbering on. Damn, she's self-obsessed. Well, once she starts applying the ointment to her face, you'll be so close you can't possibly be ignored. With that, she brings you up, and uses her other hand to... Lower her skirt... and blue striped panties? Is she going to pee while applying the ointment, or-<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I'll keep using this stuff anyway, at least it does do its one job of keeping my butthole from getting sore after I take a big dump pretty well. All in all, I guess it's worth it.

There's no way you're getting your face rubbed all over this self-obsessed hyperactive wackball's asshole just to help her anus not be sore because she overdid it on food. Eugh, no way.

In no way could this be considered your lucky day. Nevertheless, it seems there is hope that your fate might get less shitty, quite literally, as your bite ends up causing a mildly unpleasant itch on Tomo's finger.<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh, damn, don't tell me I got it on my damn hand... I don't want the stuff that goes on my butt stuck to my hand!\" (And she thought she had it bad...)

Now I won't have to wash my hands when I'm done.\" Tomo gazed at her hand, and you and the gunk, closely with one eye closed. The massive eyeball dominated your horizons, a chestnut brown pupil sky. This was your only chance, better make it count! With all your strength, you wiggled against the ooze, creating a slight twitch. <br>\r\n\"W-what in the hell? It looks like there's something in here! Is that a bug in my butt stuff? Gross!\" She stuck her tongue out, disgusted. \"What are you doing in my butt stuff, anyway, Mr. Bug? I don't think it's very tasty. Well, maybe I was wrong...\" She look mystified for a second, before sticking her tongue out again, and licking terrifyingly close to your tiny form. Immediately she spits it out into the toilet. \"Blech! Nope! I was right the first time...\" Just how stupid is this girl? First she doesn't want to even touch it, and now she's licking it because she found a 'bug' in it? You feel all hope leaving your body... \"Well, you don't look like any bug I've seen, that's for sure... Aren't they supposed to have six or eight legs, right? I think that's what Chiyo said... But you only have four. Maybe you're like some kind of rare new species, huh?!\" She looks even closer at you... \"WAIT A MINUTE! YOU'RE LIKE A TINY HUMAN!\" She shouts loudly and proudly into your tiny ears, making them ring. You're too happy for the pain to register, though. If you weren't bogged down in ointment, you'd be dancing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs she so happy that she found a 'new rare species' that she forgets where she found you like the ditz she is... or is she angry at your 'suspicious placement'?  </span></div></div>",

This would give you your chance. You were able to get him to develop a shrink ray for you. And now you were at the fence around the pool. You saw the team begin to enter and quickly used the ray on you. You were successfully shrunk to about an inch, maybe less. You were able to get past the fence. You moved quickly and found a place to hide and watch near a bench. Some of the girls came and sat on the bench near you, but are too distracted to find you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the ray began to get super hot! You yell and throw it on the ground.

Her bare sole blocked you from the entire world. You saw darkness while getting covered in her sweat. You couldn't move, you were pinned down too tight. You couldn't cry for help. Your cry would be lost in her sole and sweat would drop into your opened mouth. She lifts her foot back up. You yell to her for mercy but her foot slams down again causing you to get a mouth full of her foot. The sweat from her stinky sole poured into your mouth. Finally you are released and no longer have to drink her foot sweat. She then clenched her toes around your head and lifted you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was laughing at you. \"Oh my god, that's hilarious!\" She noticed you looked like you had just been thrown in the pool. \"Sorry, I gotta work up a good sweat you know?\" You knew all too well about that now. \"I got to get ready, little guy. Where am I gonna keep you?\" She thought about it for a second. \"Aha! You probably aren't gonna like this. It doesn't matter though cause I will.\" She bring you over and shows off her butt to you. \"I hope you like it, because your going to be spending the whole practice in there!\" She tosses you in the back of her swimsuit and you end up wedged in her crack. \"Sorry but I gotta keep you close to me. Your not used to me yet and your gonna escape if I leave you alone. Hey if you smelled my foot and didn't die you'll be fine!\" You didn't quite trust her on that. Because after one whiff of her ass you felt like passing out. Plus if you weren't drenched in sweat before, you certainly are now. You tried your best to stay away from her anus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly started running alot which shifted you around violently. You then heard water splashes and that's when it got really bad. You couldn't hold yourself still and got pulverized by her soft cheeks. Then the worst case scenario became reality. You dove straight towards her anus. You tried to hold yourself up but slipped on her sweat. You dove head first in her hole. You guessed Kagura felt it because her anus closed tightly around you. The smell was as bad as ever. It was hours of this. At least, it felt like it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you felt freedom as a hand extracted you. It was Kagura in the locker room, alone. \"Wow, you even love my smelly butt? Your the best, little guy.\" You didn't even bother and got right to the point. \"Please let me go!\" She giggles. \"Nope! Your mine now, little guy. Your my little pet. You'll learn to accept me. Aren't I just so lovable?\" She sets you down next to her to put on her socks. \"Your putrid feet and ass certainly aren't...\" You mumble. She suddenly picks you up. \"We got quite a way to walk. My feet get tired too. Show them some love to keep me going, please.\" You got dropped in her other sock and get covered by one of the feet you would get to know all too well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you arrived at her home. She went up to her room and released you. You looked around her room. \"You like it?\" She asks. It was a pretty typical bedroom with a tv and Playstation 3 next to the bed. \"Now that you've seen your new home...\"</span></div></div>",

Just like I always do.\" You curse under your breath. \"Of course you will...\" You say just dying of anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sets you down on the sink and begins to take her clothes off. You try to look away and she notices. She giggles. \"Aww how cute. The little guy is a gentleman. You can look. It's ok!\" After a few seconds of contemplating it you reluctantly turn around. What you beheld at that moment was beautiful. Her entire naked body presented in front of you was just perfect. Your mouth hung open slightly from the perfect goddess in front of you. \"Haha! I see you really like me now! You'll be seeing me naked a lot from now on. So get used to it, my tiny gentleman.\" She turns around, giving you a nice view of her giant ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe starts the water and you return to your senses. \"It's hard to like someone who just kidnapped you and just uses you as a means of entertainment!\" You yell at her.   Kagura just smiles and turns around as if nothing was wrong with what she did. \"That's not true, little guy! Your all mine now. With a big girl like me you'll survive in this world. I imagine life is pretty hard being small. I just like to play around from time to time!\" You offer no response. You hadn't thought about it that way. It was a tad comforting to know she had to care about you at least a little. You cross your arms. \"I don't care what you see me as. I'm not happy with this situation.\" She then playfully pushed you over. \"Like I said, you just need time!\" She then helped you up. \"I got great idea! How about a little bet? If you can clean my toes faster than it takes me to wash every part of my body you get out of the games for the night.\" You raised an eyebrow. \"If I lose?\" Kagura laughed. You gotta wash my butt!\" You breathed a heavy sigh. \"Fine...\" She grabbed you and sat in her shower while she presented her feet to you outside it. \"Ready... set... GO!\" You worked right as her signal went off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho won?</span></div></div>",

They actually smell good! They are so clean!\" She picks you up and hugs you, squeezing you between her two huge, naked, breasts. \"Your so amazing little guy! I love you!\" She put you back down. \"Well you earned that break, as part of our bet. You deserve it!\" You feel very relieved now that you are free, even just for this night. \"Don't get used to this now.\" She laughed.

She laid in her bed and set you down at the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's your story?\" You explained the events that led up to Kagura finding you shrunken. You decided it was best to leave out the part about you sneaking in and said you were just looking for help. \"So that's your story huh?

You and me are gonna be together forever. A big, strong girl like me with a tiny fella like you as my pet!\" You sighed. There was no hope of going back to your normal life. Kagura pets your tiny head with her finger gently. She giggles. \"A little time and you'll accept this change.

Sweet dreams, little guy.\" You were surprised that one shower did so much good for a butt that was so foul. She wasn't sweaty as hell, and the smell wasn't horrible. In fact, there was a rather fresh, sweet smelling aroma. Except near her anus. So you just laid down away from it and cuddled against one of her huge, soft cheeks. You weren't happy about it, but you didn't really have a choice and you had to sleep eventually. You drifted off to sleep rather fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes to find you are no longer in the safety of Kagura's butt. You were on a circular platform in some kind of space-looking dimension. Was this a dream? Suddenly, Kagura rose up above you from the edge of the platform She was even bigger and had an unsettling, evil look on her face. \"Oh look, a small man. So pathetic... you're going to die here!\" She suddenly slammed her foot down onto you which was stinky and sweaty and took over the entire platform. The pain was intense and you just weren't dying. It felt like you had just been crushed into a pulp but you weren't at the same time. You were disgusted by the smell and sweat. You felt like you had been saturated with the toxic smell and no amount of showers would undo it. She laughs at you. \"Time to finish it!\" She turns around and slowly brings her huge butt down onto you. She just looked at the cruel giantess and cried as her cheeks enveloped your world and crushed you. It was just as sweaty and smelly as her foot. You found yourself facing her anus. It pulsed rapidly as if trying to devour you. Then it slowly opened and a huge fart was released and you were quickly sucked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up screaming with your face in Kagura's anus. You quickly stood up and saw you were safe in her  butt. You sat down against one of her cheeks and relaxed. She was still sleeping. You could smell that fart still. She must have actually farted on you in her sleep. Right in your face too. She also got a little sweaty through the night. You were too afraid to go back to sleep. You didn't want a continuation of that. Kagura suddenly shifted and her hand reached into her butt and extracted you. \"Good morning!\" She caught a whiff of you. \"What happened? Why do you smell bad?\" \"You farted in your sleep... right on me too.\" Kagura became embarrassed. Her cheeks became instantly red. \"I-I'm so sorry little guy! I'll have you smelling better in no time!\" You decided to tell her about your dream as you did so. \"That's so horrible! You don't have to worry little guy. I would never do something like that to you. I love you!\" She gave you one of her breast smothering hugs. That dream had ended up instilling some fear into you. Just a little, but it was there. \"Are you sure?\" You said feeling uneasy. \"I play around a lot, but I would never stomp you into a pulp or fart on you... At least, not on purpose\" She said and laughed. \"So what's happening for today?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Despite her size and weight, her steps bear little to no sound. Sora dropped to his knees as Chiyo stamped her foot mere meters from his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, dear senpai I simply cannot <i>imagine</i> how you must feel right now.

He just..<i>can't</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'But how do you fight a monster\u2026</i> Kaya ran down the hallway like a madman as the thought agonize his mind.

Leaving you behind like that\u2026\" Chiyo commented in an odd tone. The revelation of what she just mention made kaya 's face became deathly pale and violently shudder in a crawling despair. For a split second, her eyes flashed genuine sympathy and kindness. But with a quick shake of her head, her face returned back to it's new \"normal\". He of all people doesn't deserve it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiyo raised her over the boy, causing his eyes to go wide at the sight of her sole. It looks so strong looking and thick. Yet the same time looks soft and mushy. The foot instantly dropped down, intentionally missing him by mere crosshairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Senpai I had a really rough day today. All I always wanted someone to tending my poor overworked feet.\" Chiyo childishly sighed as her foot stomped next to him. Her long toes try to grip him, but he luckily ran out of their path. Only to collide face first into the ball of her left sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA red blush appeared on his face m as he smells her smell. It was strong yet complex odor of sour cheesy vinegar, fragrant cherries, and natural goodness and earthiness Taroma send chills down to his pelvis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My how eager we are!\" Chiyo childishly mocked as she looked at. Luckily, she didn't figure his amusement, due to fact that she is still pretty naive despite her extreme make all. A fact he is extremely gratefully for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Dark Chiyo was quickly gaining the upper hand in their battle in Chiyo's subconscious.

Weird sense of humor.\" Tomo's hand waved dismissively, and she shut her eyes as if she were an expert on this subject. \"Don't worry, Yukes doesn't take anything seriously! I should know, I chat with her aaaall the time. She probably just became a teacher so she could have summer vacation off. Just act polite and charming with her, like I do, and she's a tow-tal pushover!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hyperactive girl let out a high-pitched roar of laughter at this. Said laughter was soon joined by another laugh - it rang clear, but somewhat worn, like a rusty bell. The teacher of the hour had appeared right behind Tomo; a warm sweater coated her torso, her brown hair hung loosely, and she held a chair in hand, hovering it right above her unsuspecting student's head...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swear you can see a weird flying cat-thing waving to you from out the window.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking up, the air seems a touch thicker than usual. A low rumble rings through your ears as you lift your head; the sensation shifts down to your spine. When faced with the sunlight, the dreams and memories dart away. Still, there's a lethargic feeling taking hold of your limbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething occurs to you: had you been sleeping in class? Miss Yukari might be there to deliver judgement. You could feel the force of her book already... Or she might understand? But anyway, this didn't seem like your classroom. You couldn't hear any of Osaka's rambling or Kaorin's excited whispering. No students in sight. The ceilings were too high. In fact, EVERYTHING was hundreds of sizes too tall, shapes becoming unfamiliar as they twisted high out of reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe low-pitched purring knocked you on your back again, stronger than last time. Lying down, you can make out the surrounding area around much clearer. You'd shrunk! Plenty small enough for anyone around to scoop you up - or a wayward foot to squash you! And to add to the panic, you could hear a brief hum in a voice perfectly matching Yukari's - if many times louder, and with an overpowering echo. The teacher, now multiple times your size, was nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the source of the mysterious rumble...</span></div></div>",

But everything added up in one split second. The surface you lay on was leather, with an indent perfectly matching a pair of firm buttocks. Noticeable moisture and feminine musk floated through the air. In the distance, another seat. That wall in front of you, shooting up like a skyscraper? A backrest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd right above you, a backside that was about to take its place in the indent. Yukari's bright red skirt brushed intricately against the car's features and twisted around the young woman's own features. The tufts of messy brown hair swept down her back - she slid one hand through them, getting an itch out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to afford any more time staring, you darted forward. In the distance, her soft legs - they served as something of a destination for you as they folded downwards, trapping you in the teacher's ominous shadow. You can hear the end of a conversation above:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yeah, I'll get around to marking soon. But we both deserve this break!\" There was a long pause here - a voice not unlike Miss Kurosawa's murmured from outside. She answered quickly, slamming her hand on the radio: \"Of course, I'm always safe on the road! You worry too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those words, her hands fell on the wheel, and her comparatively massive butt completed its descent. One last dive forward, and you got as far as you could manage: head area in the clear, but legs and torso compressed harshly by the Miss Yukari's right buttocks. The pressure was almost unbearable; you can't imagine you'd last long if your cranium were under that weight. Any screaming you let out is lost in the folding materials making up her skirt and undergarments, or perishes in the skin they hides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could clearly feel the threads of her underwear slipping over your limbs. The glimmering sun caught in your eye; you swore the moisture was getting harsher. Yukari wiggled in the seat to get comfortable. It was probably a very brief act for her, but underneath, it seemed like her backside took a good minute to nuzzle against you. The massive muscles relaxed as the flesh collapsed lazily over your back. Her legs shifted forward, giving your shoulders a relieving taste of freedom. By then, her butt had kneaded thoroughly enough that you felt somewhat numbed to the pain; and the sense of panic subsided. It was far from comfortable, but at least you were safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she stepped on the gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour neck was jerked this way and that from the velocity. The car wobbled unevenly, tumbling through what you can only assume to be a parking lot. If there was one positive thing about this scenario, it's that the wind in your hair gave some relief from the heat emanating off the teacher's body. Is this how a bug caught in a moving vehicle feels?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the force subsided; it seems like Yukari's foot left the pedal. After taking time to catch your breath, you tried to squirm around to gain her attention, or leave this mobile prison. The answer to your prayers echoed above:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right, you start out in THIS gear. Okay! No accidents this time. Nooo accidents. You got this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't tell if the sun was making her sweat harder, or if that was just you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another careless movement, the young woman's thigh descended from the heavens, forcing your neck down and setting the roller coaster in motion once more. Every time she made a sharp turn, her leg pressed against your head. It seems like she totally ignores speed bumps; you can sense her flying off the seat with each of them, giving you a second of freedom before gravity's cruel hand sends you up to join her. And as suddenly as she went up, she falls back down, squashing your minuscule form firmly into her seat once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery attempt to struggle loose just lathered your body in more of the dampness residing on Yukari. It was probably unnoticeable to her, but you could distinctly make out a few droplets against your neck. Thankfully, the teacher's cheek wasn't too rough, providing some cushioning for the blows; and the increasing heat reduced the friction against your body. It felt like you could get out if you wiggled just a bit more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I'll bring the ol' Playstation out tonight. It's been a hard day... BWAGH!\" The shout above would have annihilated your ears if it weren't for her leg muffling the noise  \"That's a RED light, dummy! RED!... Wait, that MY light! Dammitdammitdammitdammiiiiit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you were ready to escape the seat of doom, she assaulted the breaks, bringing the whole vehicle to a grinding halt. It was apparently near a bump in the road, too - letting you loose. The force catapulted you out of the seat, towards...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Yukarimobile's swift halt sent you flailing. You tried to grab on to something - anything that would keep you from becoming a red dot on the floor mat - but the grey and black surfaces just blurred tauntingly around you. A blunt THUD resounded as your jaw hit something hard. The pain prevented your eyes from opening immediately, so you simply rested on this new, hard surface. Not as soft as the seat, sure; but just being able to stay still and have nothing pushing your back was a welcome change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe relief was short-lived, however, as you heard a grumble from further up - followed by a hard, flat surface slamming your entire body down. The platform you held actually trembled under the weight, receding to the awe-inspiring strength. Your eyes jerked open, and you made out the details immediately: this was a gas pedal. You were underfoot on Yukari's joyride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe now-familiar voice clanked out behind you: \"Alright, that... Happened. Who designed these streets, anyways?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried pressing back, but that just seemed to make her sole force down with greater might. The immense strain pushed all the air from your lungs; and attempting to breathe it back in only brought tiny dust sediments from previous trips into your mouth and nose. It begged the question: was Yukari taking out some anger on the pedal? What would that mean if she found you? Or was this the same amount of energy a normal person would use on the pedal - and this slight pressure was enough to feel like a ton of bricks at your pathetic height?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother stop made you feel weightless for one second, before gravity grasped you once more. Unwilling to take another facefull of the pedal's dirty coating, you took the opportunity to twist around. Your eyes fell on the teacher's partly-exposed legs first; they looked as wide and firm as tree trunks, but still smooth. Far above that, you could make out her face for the first time in this wild ride; bearing all the signs of fatigue and frustration that would come from a day of warm work. It seemed impossibly distant, out-of-reach, and most of all, uncaring; a sense of smallness sunk over you as this dull gaze cemented how unnoticeable you were. But what brought the most pain was below the leg, stretching widely over your body; the unending earthy-coloured base of her right sandal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandals. Cork, slightly-raised-at-the-heel, blue-straps-with-no-toe-strap sandals. Did this leviathan-sized lecturer have a mission to violate every safe driving precaution?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith only a slight flex of her ankle, she squeezed your form between pedal and sole once more, tightly compressed on either end. You could feel your torso and limbs sinking into the footwear, its corners contorting against you - but much more hesitantly than with her backside. It wouldn't take much more force for you to join the dirt that was sliding into your face. For every bit that you spit out, more comes to assault your taste buds. Every time you tried to blink some of the dust out of your eyes, more came in to sting. You can only slowly wiggle your arms with every pause, bringing them a few millimeters upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA horn blared in your ear. You felt the center of gravity shift once more as the Yukarimobile made a sharp swerve, nearly undoing the upward progress your arms made. Your fingers instinctively grasped into the cork, even as you felt your left arm creaking and aching under the changed pressure. When the car finally stopped turning, it was comforting just to have a normal amount of strength on your torso. Even the car's brisk hop from a disregarded speed bump and the following groan from the car's suspension felt almost familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick glimpse of the world above revealed that Yukari's shoulders and back were no longer slumped, tired in the seat like before. She was leaning forward, face closer than ever before; you could clearly make out the shape of her pupils and brown irises. Yet, the woman's eyes were still not focused on you; they peeked alternatively between the windshield and the car radio. Her hand fiddled around with the knob, moving through stations quickly. This was your chance! After enduring another rough squash from the sandal's sole, you continued your movement upwards with increased vigor. She could probably make you out now, if you could only slide out of the tight space between the cork and the pedal before she landed on a station...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour arms forced upwards again. You tried to focus on the radio's sounds to distract yourself from the pain. A few bits of static. The nasally voice of a pop singer. A chance to win tickets to Okinawa. As your left hand finally grasped the edge, the ending of a news report played out: \"...Leaving the victim with severe injuries.\" Your driver giggled briefly at this before continuing her hunt for the perfect station. Only a few more nudges forward, and you finally had your torso free from the overwhelming sandal. It lifts slightly, giving you the opportunity for a nice, long breath before you complete your journey. Above, Yukari's head abruptly twists to the side, her eyebrows falling down in anger. Was something happening outside?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so THAT'S how it's gonna be? Think you own the road?\" She hollered out the window, both hands instantly slamming with an enormous THUMP on the steering wheel. Her fingers each flexed individually over it. You suddenly felt all the tension lift from your body; only for the entirety of the sandal's worn base to dangle above, slamming towards you at breakneck speed! She was ready to unleash fury on the pedal - and her unseen passenger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking quickly, you dive forward, out of the way. Just in time, too; the tremor behind you, if it were fully sized, would easily measure in the top half of the Richter magnitude scale, if not permanently mold Tokyo's topography. The sheer energy makes you leave the pedal, becoming a victim of gravity's cruel whims once more; and the intense burst of speed from the vehicle pushes you backwards, like a fly tossed to the rear window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, something blocks your way to the back. More specifically, five somethings, resting at the top of the cork sandal. Trying to catch your breath instills your nostrils with the slight odor these somethings have acquired from a full day of teaching. They scrunch up in reaction to Yukari's angry driving, inadvertently pulling you underneath, brushing you against the front of her sandal, and slamming you into the ball of her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the bright side, you overcame the sandal's sole. But you now faced your next obstacle: the teacher's toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey slammed flat onto the cork before you could react. You lay underneath her middle and ring digits, face pointed directly at the joints where they met the rest of her foot. It gave you a clear view of the otherwise-imperceptible sock lint and sweatdrops that accumulated between them. She was still speeding forward, apparently racing someone else. A raging wind assaulted your body simply from the car's movement, and it feels like you might be blown away - perhaps to your death. There was nothing solid to grab for support except for the fleshy towers around; so your arms grip around it, the titan's warmth washing over them both. Until she's slowed down, you have no other option than to keep clinging it, torso and cheek pressed tightly to the skin as you're forced to expose yourself to the stench and moisture. To think, she could be able to notice and save you if she could just cool her head and look down for a moment... Or send you to your doom with a misplaced twitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, nothing. The acceleration felt like it slowed to Osaka's pace. From between the appendages you rest under, you could clearly spot Yukari smiling widely. The road rage was over! To make things even better, she was leaning over to the radio again! If that sight were any more relieving, you'd be hard-pressed not to hug her toe <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">if that weren't super-weird.</font> With the stress she was putting on the pedal reduced, you could slide a little further from her foot, even stand up on your own feet (even if the floor was a bit slanted). Walking had never felt so special.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to call up, but Yomi's words echo in your head again. If Yukari had weird ways of punishing students at normal-size - and if she found some reason to disapprove of this stowaway...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can decide what to do, a voice on the radio drowns your thoughts. The driver, apparently quite fond of this tune, began singing along, her brightened eyes darting back to the road. Her toes tapped to the rhythm, pushing you down; the middle one rubs against your chest repeatedly, almost ticklishly. You try grabbing it, even punching it to get her attention; but it just rolls all over you once more. Her powerful voice soon joins the radio in song:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Kaihou teki ni yarou, ogori nara ton to nomu yo! Oishii mono tanonde, tabetsukushichae!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the trembling under your feet, this wasn't TOO bad. Unless Yukari decided to launch another attack on the gas pedal, you could probably stay here until she reaches her destination; that would give you plenty of time to judge how dangerous asking her for help would be. Sure, the thought of snuggling with her toes again to avoid death was just a <i>little</i> gross, especially considering the effect the beating sun had on her. But it was better than joining the insects splattered on the back window. All you had to do was trust her driving skills...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Leaving your fate to Yukari Tanizaki's driving was the SAFE option; that alone is testament to how dire your situation was. The only other path in sight was climbing up. A more immediate way to grab her attention. An opportunity to avoid further inadvertent torture at her hands - or feet. A possible route to shelter. A death-defying ascent up a clean-shaven, sweat-covered leg, with few footholds, even fewer resting places, and strong winds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>WHELP.</b></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The intense winds roaring from greatly-sized windows above were a strong enough deterrent on their own. When you added Miss Yukari's bursts of temper to the mix, the idea of climbing her leg became even more unappealing. And if this driver had another distraction? You didn't even want to think about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs ugly as the situation was, the safest place in this steel landscape of blinding speed was underneath the soft cushioning of Yukari's foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing your pride (and a large drop of sweat), you kept your hands wrapped around her middle toe, trying to focus on other things. Like Mr. Kimura's lecture on - SLAM. Your driver applied a quick burst of pressure to the pedal, tightly compressing your torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it would help if you thought about that exhibit with the plush animals - THWOOM. Another relatively gentle movement from this woman forced you back into reality. With the pressure coming from the skies, and the motor rumbling below, it was hard to tell whether you should push back against the pad or keep gripping it for support. Either action was difficult with the thin layer of moisture coating her skin - though not very noticeable to a normal person, it was a definite obstacle. You aching arms had a harder and harder time holding on with each - SLAM.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to dodge another face-full of her fluids by twisting your head to the side. It gave you a clear, scenic view of the barren landscape leading to the break pedal. The ankle above it flexed slightly - before the smooth skyscraper of her lower leg lifted up and came crashing down. The forces of gravity took a quick snack break as her car screeched to a sudden halt; if it hasn't been for her sole scrunching slightly, you would've gone flying again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill-muffled, Yukari commented from above: \"Sheesh. They really need to trim around that stop sign.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the bright side, you weren't near the break pedal. Otherwise, your spinal cord might've lost its classification as a solid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more, the vehicle launched forward. There was a long, sharp curve in the road; your left arm was unable to keep in place, leaving you clutching to her toe by a single, sore hand. The feeling of dampness built under each of your digits, trembling to stay within the holds that her skin's criss-crossing pattern provided. Her sandal's position forced you to twist your minuscule body around...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, it ended. You braced for the pressure of her digits again - but it was far softer than before. Your back was no longer stationed in her toe's indent; it spread horizontally across the sandal. Like not too long earlier. You could relax your limbs once again; your left arm cushioned by the tips of her toes, with the right nudged by the ball of her foot. Above, the middle segments of the pillars pressed you gently, like a protective dome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with the pressure absent, the smell was far stronger here. As was the heat; in every direction, there was some surface of Yukari's sandal or skin letting its warmth waft over you. The liquid built up more intensely, too. But, at last, you weren't being totally squashed. She ran over another speed bump, flexing her toes idly - once again lathering you in another layer of toasty moisture. You could barely manage to see her tired face from between the digits, contracting and stretching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe relative security from crushing gave you time to collect your thoughts. Was this really the safest space? There might have been some compartment or space you could squeeze into instead, if you wanted to secure yourself from the speed. And even if you couldn't - would it really be strong enough to hurt you? At the same time, this place felt safe. Getting out there was dangerous. It felt like you'd be fine, as long as you could stay here long enough. The gross forces around you might remedy themselves eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...If someone told you this morning that you'd be developing Stockholm Syndrome towards Miss Yukari, you would probably have looked at them weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the crevices between two walls of skin, you can make out her eyes peeking down. Right at your spot on her footwear. All of a sudden, you feel as if the entire mass of her body's crashing down on you again. Her hand descends from the skies, index and thumb stretched out - like someone about to pull out a tree-sized splinter. A honk outside stops her hand - she immediately brings it back to the wheel, swerving quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was close. But it wasn't time to catch your breath just yet - the teacher seemed to have noticed you. Or, at the very least, noticed something chaffing against her sole. The flesh above fidgeted and twitched in annoyance, lathering you harshly. The ball of the foot took hold of you, reeling you in like a minnow. And pushing back. You're being rolled back and forth against the sandal's smelly indent and the mountainous Yukari Tanizaki above...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the car motor below came to a halt, time wasn't the only thing you've lost track of. The smell of fresh air as the door opens seemed like a completely novel experience. Being able to hold still without feeling the world rushing around - it made you feel heavy and exhausted. A now too-familiar voice booms out from the skies:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, could've sworn I put my seatbelt on. Oh, well - it was pretty gentle ride.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo THAT's why Chiyo's eyes always got all cold and lifeless when someone brought Yukari's driving up in class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother boom sounded out from the side. You found your environment lifting up again, and tried your best to prepare for impact. It didn't do much help; pain shot through your sweat-soaked body as Tanizaki's sole landed again. And then, her toes moved again; the harsh fidgeting kneeding you back and forth into the platform below. Your head rested under the middle one,  which brushed your face painfully into the smelly indent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urgh, what IS that, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe motion stopped. The pressure lifted. You were lying flat, very nearly broken, drenched, dizzy, and warm from the insane ride. Yukari's foot no longer rested on you. Now, her eyes took charge of the sky above - dark, intense, and... Hard to read. They narrowed. Was she angry? Just trying for a closer look? Her mouth below rested open in a small shape, denoting a hint of hesitation. And it all came closer as she kneels down to take a look at you, her chest swaying slightly in reaction to the descent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do you react?</span></div></div>",

Some sweat still residing over you stung your tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Yukari mouthed out silently, staring with greater intent. Her pupils grew wider - or was that just her face getting far too close? Instinctively, your hands gripped her sandal for support, fingers squeezing the spongy landscape. Its owner, a landmass in her own right, bent down and reached for it, too. Her palm formed a roof over you. A faint bit of moisture falling from the lines made you reel back slightly - but trying to escape now would prove fatal. She lifted the sandal up, lifting you from the ground like an elevator. An unsteady, confused elevator that required you to keep holding, lest you fall to the asphalt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wobbling didn't stop when you reached your destination; if anything, getting a close-up of her uninvited passenger only made her shake more. A distinct shiver went down your own spine, too. Seeing every little detail on her face as she examined you was nothing relieving, and neither was the warmth of her slow breaths on your minuscule face. But the only other directions you could gaze showed how dizzyingly far down the ground was - or gave a view of the teacher's bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo - you had to keep eye contact, stay on her good side. You tried speaking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GYAH!\" She flung her hand back in surprise - and flung you in the air. As if your body was lighter than helium, you ascended with alarming speed. Your fall was anything but balloon-like, though. It was like you were moving downwards at hundreds of kilometers per hour, getting exponentially faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a second for Yukari's reflexes to kick in; she ran towards you, trying to catch you. You hit the side of her right hand, bouncing off it. She made a grab with her left hand. With your speed, and its slight angle, you rolled off the side of it. Despite her desperate, hurried clutching, she could do nothing but watch as you landed squarely into her chest. In fact, your speed was enough to tuck you pretty tightly inside the cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour experiences with her backside and sole showed you how much warmth Yukari had accumulated. Her chest was no different, the sweat and heat reducing friction even more as you slid in. You could faintly feel the lacy touch of a bra behind you. With much more freedom of motion here than you'd had in some time, you tried to climb out, sinking your fingers firmly into the skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the soft, dewy surface was too smooth to get a good hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly felt her jerk her arm to the right, reacting to your climbing attempt. Her chest - and you - swung with it. \"Hey, what's the big idea?\" Her shout was an intimidating roar that made your ears ring... At normal size. Now, it was unthinkably powerful. You could almost feel her vocal chords' movement against your skin as the words exited, rumbling across your body. \"Look, can you just stop squirming? I can handle this.\" Her breaths sounded deeper, longer. \"This is unreal...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thin ray of light broke through from the sky, shining on you like a dramatic shot from a movie. Yukari's fingers blocked it out quickly, reaching for you. They clumsily brushed your hair; then tugged your left hand with horrific strength, leading you to scream; then slid away before the index finger tappped your face uselessly. With every motion, her wrist pressed against one pale mound or the other, making you wobble slightly. She drew the hand out with a low mumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I do it out here, it'll look like I'm groping myself...\" You could hear her click her tongue in frustration, before feeling her march forward. \"Hold on, you're coming into my apartment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompared to the bumps in the car ride, the up-and-down motion here was far gentler. Almost soothing. The remaining heat was making you feel rather lethargic, come to think of it. But the situation's sheer absurdity prevents you from getting TOO comfortable. You didn't think you'll ever look at your teacher's shirt the same way again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, it stopped. You felt her right arm move down, then forwards, then twist. It came as a bit of a shock that you could tell her exact motions, even when stuck in darkness - this was far closer than you'd ever imagined being to Yukari. She took a few steps forward. Then, like a curtain rising, she peeled off her shirt. Your senses nearly shut off from the sudden flood of experiences. Light, light all around. It was the shape of a standard living space, but the walls, ceiling, and floor extended unbelievable distances. The smell of salty instant meals took over your nose. A blast of cool air from the conditioner gave much-needed relief. When you opened your mouth, you could taste the freshness in the air. And finally, you felt the resident's slender index and thumb resting on either side of your ribs, pulling you out and placing you down on a table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't preparing for visitors today,\" she said after a pause. And for once, it didn't sound distant and uncaring, or close and overpowering. Loud, yes, but not alarmingly so. \"In fact, I was kinda hoping to have the weekend to myself, since my mom's out for a few days.\" She gazed tiredly around the messy entrance for a second, before blushing. \"Whoops, did I say that out loud? Well, I guess it's only fair if you...\" Suddenly, she jumped forward, grabbing your tiny shoulders with both hands. \"...Tell me your dirty secrets! What were you doing in my shoe? How did you get so small? Hey, did I borrow your bike a while back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden motion dazed you - not just because of her scale, and your unfamiliar surroundings. Yukari was all but topless, only a bit of frilly underwear hiding her torso. You struggled to keep contact with her burning eyes. Was she that scatterbrained - or that shameless?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started to explain your experiences. The sense of coolness - and your newly regained ability to walk - both put you at ease. It's undone slightly, however, by the teacher's looming face. She'd put on the same expression she does when Tomo gets in trouble, or Osaka asks for more time. Only this time, your size magnified her gaze multiple times. It feels like a spotlight looming above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few times, she nodded and placed a finger on her cheek, as if to say \"so THAT'S what that itch was.\" At about the halfway point, she interrupts you with a tap to the face. \"Wait a minute. You were AFRAID of me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd never seen her so confused since she took that test with your class. Trying to stay on her good side without lying, you say she might've mistook you for an insect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What are you implying about my eyesight, shortstuff?\" She pounded a hand on the table, shaking it under your feet. \"But... When you shiver like that, you kinda do look like a nasty little pest... Alright, carry on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard to tell if you dodged a bullet, or just opened up a new package of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you reach the last bit of the explanation, the aching in your joints had quieted down some. Yukari was looking more disoriented and confused than when she started, tapping the top of her forehead. \"Why would this happen to someone like you? You don't stand out as the kind of person who'd have a family curse or an ex with a shrink ray or anything.\" She leaned in closer, tapping your shoulder. \"In fact, you don't stand out, period.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that blunt remark, she took a step away, leaving you facing her backside - like before. \"I could drive you home...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou froze, able only to shake your head in refusal. She turned to you and blinked, confused, before shrugging. \"Okay, then, I'll call your parents. Don't go sneaking around anywhere I mark papers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe steps into the distance, her bare foot effortlessly compressing a discarded box. The teacher sat next to a few mountainous piles of papers and books. She scanned its valleys and canyons for a moment, pulled one sheet out, and brought the rest crashing to the ground. She glared towards you as if you were to blame for the great mountain range's fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped into another room. You can hear the sound of phone dials being pressed, followed by a trace of the teacher's voice with a layer of sweetness on top. A long, disquieting pause followed, which made you wonder if your teacher would just leave it at that. You vaguely remembered your parents saying something about going out. There was another beeping sequence, before silence reigned over the room again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Miss Tanizaki finally came back into view, she'd changed into casual wear: a tank top, simple shorts, and a tired frown. \"Nope. I tried them by cell, home phone, but... Nnnope.\" She let out a sigh, as if she were the one who'd just been suffering under extreme pressure for the past several kilometers. \"I don't know about you, but I had nothing planned this weekend. And I was really looking forward to it, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paced around behind you slowly, rubbing her temples, and examining you as if you were some sort of experiment. \"I can't really keep a pet around, either.\" You stared back to her, almost used to these comments by now.  \"Do you think you could survive outside?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe totally ignored your answer, gently squeezing your arm in her hand. \"No, you really couldn't.\" Shaking her head, she puffed her chest up and said: \"Well, out of the kindness of my heart, I suppose I COULD keep you inside. For the evening, maybe. In exchange for goods or services. I'm sure things won't seem so crazy in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou agreed. It wasn't the most pleasant situation, but at the very least, the immense woman knew you were human, and wasn't angry. Lazy, yes, almost to the point of indifference - but not actively trying to murder you. Yet. It might be an okay night.<br>\r\nYukari suddenly let out a faint smile, letting her hand out for you to climb in. \"Now, with that out of the way - time for the first thing I had planned tonight...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Beeeer.\" Yukari's voice reached that careful halfway between a joyful cheer and an exhausted moan. Her bare arms stretched behind her dark hair. Even on the tabletop, you had to step away twice to fully see the titanic fist stretched into the air. Her hefty chest raised slightly in a great breath, and fell in a long sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stumbled over your words. Did your teacher, who'd promised care of you, just suggest drinking?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squinted, hands on her hips. After vying so long for her attention, it was jarring to see the huge brown pools directly pointing at you. \"You know, I can see that cheeky look down there. If you touch my booze, I'll flick you out the window. For you, kid - strictly dealcoholized wine! Even kindergarten brats can't get a buzz from this stuff.\" Her finger pointed in warning as she backed towards her fridge, crushing a paper marked \"Mihama Chiyo - 100\". Those looming eyes never left as she took out a bottle and a can, having memorized their spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari slammed both immense pillars on either end of you. With two loud *snap*s, she opened them both at once. Her distant pupils briefly escaped to the window. \"I've been trying to get fridge room since New Years, so you better drink up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas this really an offer? With her tone, and the wine's intimidating volume, it came across as an order. This wasn't right; she couldn't look after you drunk. Maybe you should say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, a glass...\" She rummaged in the drawer below you. The rapid, chaotic movement wobbled through your soles on the tabletop. With no luck, Yukari's titanic torso leaned in closer to reach a cabinet. Her mountainous chest slammed on her counter. You backed up - but the twin shadows had already ensnared you, their sources coming a split second after. The soft, clothed surface choked you of the already-thin air, fibres drilling into your chest and smothering your face. While it'd never register to the distracted teacher, the fall of her tits shook everything ferociously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few quick nudges brought those ponds of eyes downwards, eyebrows furrowed. She shut them and smiled weakly, rubbing her brown hair. \"Ahah, whoops!\" Your temporary guardian - for given value of \"guarding\", and you HOPED it was VERY temporary - went on tiptoes, lifting the crushing pressure off you. With every ounce of your might, you pushed yourself out from under the tits. Despite her soft look of pity, the vibrations in her massive bust told you she was stifling giggles. \"I was thinking about Nyamo. Last week, she told me I shouldn't be drinking alone. Or was that 'unsupervised'? Well, congratulations: I declare you my supervisor! Oh, here's one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sputter of the wine dripped into a thimble between Yukari's fingers. The container landed near you, wobbling liquid letting off a faint aroma. Using both arms, you lifted the makeshift cup \u2013 or bucket. It wasn't until now that you realized it, but you WERE thirsty. And The Dreaded Yukarimobile left you with plenty of brain cells you wanted to kill. You tapped the thimble it against the large can, offering her your most earnest \"kanpai!\". You gazed at your weary face's reflection in the drink, before dunking it in. Coolness rushed through your cheeks and forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's the spirit!\" She smiled, and instantly got to chugging her own beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour beverage had no strong taste. But after so much time warmed by your teacher's body heat, it was amazingly refreshing. You dove in for a second mouthful, letting the clear water drip over your chin. And a third, splashing the wine against your face. Your shoulder muscles relaxed as drops flew on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour legs lost balance, wobbling. Was the temperature change dizzying you, or the stuffy apartment air? No - your drinking partner had slammed her can to the table, crushing it. Her titanic teeth shut in a cringe, sputtering - before she shouted, strong-smelling spittle flying upon you. \"KkhhhyyAAAH~! Life is good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat vast sea of alcohol - she simply knocked it back? How vast was this woman's stomach, and how mighty was her liver? What might have once been fear-inspiring now only made you laugh. And keep laughing. Finally, no more enduring crushing pain. No more shouting for attention. You could spare a moment to relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I wanna know: what's going on with the girls? They're too quiet.\" She asked while grabbing another can. Once you spoke up, she leaned in, her breath ruffling your wet hair. \"Louder! Nyamo won't share gossip, and Kimura won't talk about anyone but his 'darling little Kaorin'. Is there something they're hiding?\" She gasped. \"Did class 1-5 nab a transfer student? Are they gonna beat us next sports fair?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eagerness moved you to answer. You shared every bit of news that crossed your mind, stealing small sips whenever Yukari responded. She took long gulps; you practically heard floods crashing within her gullet. A few times, Yomi's warning flashed through your head; but while the rumours you might've made Nyamo scold you, the sprawled-out titan kept asking for dirt. How could you say no?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, you're kidding! Sakaki and Kaori, you think? Things've changed since my time, you know. Wait, did I say 'my time'? Eeeh, I'm not that old, am I?\" Yukari's cheeks went red, as she sipped again. \"*hic* But still, all my friends keep marrying. Why rush it?\" She lifted a finger up, as if she was teaching an English lesson - only wobblier. Or was your diminished perspective throwing you off? \"Don't rush into things! That leads to things breaking! Remember that time Tomo rushed into that wall, and broke her arm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomo... Maybe Tomo had a point. \"Yukes\" was trustworthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you dove into the thimble for another sip, you found it empty. What? You had so much a second ago! Or... ten seconds ago? Couldn't have been THAT long. The wall clock's fingers were distant, inconstant blurs. But if it were really late, you'd be craving dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you felt was thirst. Somehow, you needed more of that sake. Your instructor had given you a mission, to drink; who were you to deny it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to the vast bottle beside you. Thin perspiration dripped down its mass. Traces of the teacher's fingerprints spread before your eyes. The label read \"TOSO \u2013 Low Alcohol Rice Sake\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd. She said it had NO alcohol. Oh well. Even kids couldn't get drunk off that, right? Your smaller body mass probably wouldn't change anything. That buzzing in your head was probably a fan or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou called to your teacher for help - to find her chin pointed up, downing a new alcoholic ocean. It'd take no effort for her to tilt this great tower. You tried to ask again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, tasty! See, you, you... Whatever your name is... Enjoy your youth! If you grow up too fast, you'll \u2013 you won't grow up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou called up: \"Miss Yukari...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Education!\" She shouted. Her current can hit the tabletop, compressed by her unbelievable drunken strength. \"I call for a revolution in Japan's education system! Our children can't be ignored! Let us hear their voices!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shouted, tapping on the can: \"Yukari!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't interrupt me!\" She flicked you, the gigantic finger's impact sending you to the ground. Her skyscraper-rivalling limbs wobbled haphazardly, lazily flopping around - and amazing you with their speed and swiftness. Your attempts to prop yourself up were difficult with intoxicated screams above, booming into your bones. \"This is important! This is your life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breath reeked of booze. Merely inhaling it made you feel lighter-headed... But stronger. Bolder. You could wrestle this bottle over, and take the liquid from it in your thimble. Eyeing it, your teacher's words echoing in your head, you accepted the challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEar-splitting rumbles kept ringing out beside you: \"Seize it in your hands! You can do it!... Oh, God...\" Her mouth fluctuated between a too-wide smile and a pained, sickened frown. Her whole torso swayed as if it were gelatin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou held the minuscule scratches, only barely squeezing your fingers inside one, and pushed. With a shout, you crawled up, thinking it'd give you better leverage. Gasoline burned through your veins. You pushed as hard as possible, ramming your shoulder into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tiny nudge. A wobble. It was a huge drop below, but your desire for beer overrode your fear. You moved your weight, doing your best to tip the tower... As Yukari, groaning, collapsed onto the table. The whole structure leaned back, and went into free fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wind in your hair was exhilarating... until it was terrifying. The container's falling speed built up, and sake spilled from the mouth, streaming down your limbs. You couldn't hold on, and landed directly in Yukari's thigh. It was soft, fleshy, and  Thankfully, the glass itself didn't drop; but the precious, refreshing contents from it leaked in a waterfall, landing atop you, and spreading in rivers across your gigantic teacher's bare skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer neck snapped up, as if woken from a trance. \"Wh-wha? *hic* That's \u2013 that's cold!\" She rested, lifting a leg up \u2013 and rolling you closer to her stomach. Her eyes were still shut in pain, and wobbled, as if simply speaking hurt her. \"You jeeerk... I'm *hic* not gonna clean that up! Take responsibility!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat same rush blared in your head, casting a murky, alcoholic fog. Without thinking, you planted your face in Yukari's wet lap and licked. The salt of her expansive skin mixed with the wine, making you crave more to wash it down. Your tongue rushed against the moist, spongy surface. For a straight minute, you kept slurping, sucking, burying your face into the soft cushion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grasped the bottle, and tossed a bit into her mouth. The muscles below you trembled with mocking, drunken laughter. \"Hahaha! All that over this weak stuff?\" She turned it upside-down on herself, emptying a raging river of sake on her body. It cascaded off her curving bosom, steamed around her midriff, to her feet below, leaving a glimmer coating every inch of skin. \"Here, have it all!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Have it all,\" Yukari said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou needed no instruction or convincing; that uplifting rush through your face and the lingering wetness of Toso Sake gave all the direction you needed. Drunk out of her mind, Miss Yukari had just emptied the bottle onto herself. You had watched it flow from her lumbering, unsteady hand to her legs, spreading out further than any structure across Tokyo. And thanks to her uncontrolled impulses, you landed onto those jaw-dropping limbs, their hefty mass bore shamelessly to the world. And with no hesitation, you kept consuming from the heavenly waters - sucking on the clean surface, its marble-smooth texture spotted only with skin pores.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just now, in the landscape of a lap, that something hit you. Standard clothes - like that cozy sweater she wore in colder weather, or the skirt she had on not long ago - would have greedily absorbed your liquid. Without that to fetter them back, the beautiful rivers streaming through the intricate folds of her skin spread all over. You had to act quick, or it would all flow away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bahahaha!... Hah...\" The reverberating laugh made you jolt from your seat. She grinned widely, head trembling - while the very last drops of wine escaped her iron clutches. \"Hurry up, it's getting away... Are you gonna let it? *hic* Are you the type of man who wastes good sake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust for a moment - you forgot that you'd been hurdling through danger. You forgot that she was, in fact, the one wasting her own alcohol over a bad joke. This absolute quaking mountain with a pulse; this maelstrom of apathy and unmarried frustrations with the power to grind you into a pulp or give you a failing mark on the final exam; this thing that you had prayed to in strange and disturbing whispers, desperate for a peek of her tired brown eyes on your shameful, worn body that belonged among worms eating dirt; the teacher who led you into school fairs with the bravado of a warmongering general... For the first time you could remember, she called you a MAN.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your heart of hearts, you knew you had to prove her right. You lay your tongue across the majestic pillar of her thigh once more, throwing your whole back into it as you lapped up flowing juices. Gallons upon gallons of this wonderful low-alcohol beverage slid down the acres of her limb, through your lips, and into your boiling gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crawled unsteadily up the pale expanse. The warmth from your teacher's body, which was overpowering before, now felt soft against your chest. Your eager tongue lapped away at the flesh, pleased with the ease at which it receded against your tongue. Each single taste buds massaged the wine-soaked skin cells, penetrating inside ridges and imperfections.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA booming, jovial laugh erupted from the tank-top-clad instructor. \"Hee~eey, that tickles!\" Yukari lapped liquid running of her right hand, slamming her left hand around the table for another can. \"Pfft, l-look at you, little squirt! You're totally wasted!\" Her head flopped over the back of the chair, letting out a sigh at the pale ceiling, before she knocked another can down. Her vast leg kicked out in glee, hitting the table, and letting you roll back towards her shorts; the sloshing from within her gut filled your brain. \"Wasted, wasted! *hic*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukari showed no concerns of modesty towards her \"supervisor\", even as you lapped around her inner thigh. You didn't expect any less from the teacher who'd bragged about her measurements in front of the other class, and asked about her bikini in gym class. But you hadn't seen her this open before, laughing and cheering as you traversed and sucked the invigorating juice from her massive, curvy figure. Her careless air wafted off on you, too. It couldn't be the lingering smells of beer in the air, mixing with sweat, deodorant, stale prepackaged ramen, and takeaway stir fry. The buzz in your head in your head couldn't be from the low-alcohol Toso Sake... even though it seemed to grow stronger as you took in great gulps, its flavor giving you a relief from the warm atmosphere. This was just an atmosphere of celebration. A reward for your hard work in studies. A chance to get closer to Miss Yukari than you ever could before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven calling her \"Miss\" seemed weird now; within this apartment, the lines of \"teacher\" and \"pupil\" sunk away, like the blurry, swerving scenery of scattered papers and messy sheets. All that was real was the beautiful, open thighs, and the fermented beverage that crawled through it, into your eager lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe surrounding landscape of skin and muscle squirmed around you, a mountain shifting lazily. Despite her sloth, both in the classroom and personal affairs, Yukari appeared to keep her legs clean-shaved; the plain was silky-smooth against your hands. Earlier, this made your climb a challenge. Now, it facilitated your vigorous slurping, letting your minuscule maw traverse it with slick slides. Before a drop escaped off the fleshy cliff's side, you cupped it in your hand and guzzled it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething else hit your head. Yukari was drooling in cascading waterfalls. Her immense head pressed against the table - as she pushed yet another beer can to her lips. \"Oh, God... So good...\" Her whole face imploded in tension, before blurting out with wobbly lips. \"I'm okay... *hic*... <b>I can still hold it</b>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unsteadiness of her body, and the quaking roar of her inebriated but authorial voice, made you grip for support. You felt the swampy skin fill the spaces between your fingers with a snug squeeze. It was as if every casual inhale and inebriated groan not only shook you, but actively reshaped the room, the world - it all mixed into a blur of bouncing curves, sauna-like air, and disorganized papers to mark. Every aspect of it overflew with life and movement; you could barely even keep yourself still on the wet plane of flesh. Her heel swayed to and fro below, like Chiyo's pigtails when she was trying to handstand. Dribbling bits of water cascaded down the wriggling monoliths of her toes. A sudden fidget hurdled you across the immense leg, finishing with a face-first fumble into the other side of her lap - filling all your senses with more of the hypnotic sake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA ripple of sanity struck you when Yukari kept moaning above. Taking a moment to fit your head back on - focusing on the glazed-over dark eyes in the sky, floating like clouds - you asked, with a wavering voice, if just maybe she'd had enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whuddya mean?\" The voice was like a bullet train rushing forward. You felt like burying yourself back into the leg - but it wouldn't help, her booming was omnipresent. \"What do you think I am? I'm a - I'm still full of piss and vinegar! *hic* An' I'm not gonna stop while you're, you're jus' knockin' 'em back! I can - *hic* - hold my liquor better than anyone!\" She slammed the can on the table, crushing it beneath the earth-shattering weight of her fist. \"Especially a pipsqueak like you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe overwhelming force from that outburst sent you sliding down the slick precipice of her knee, cleaned thoroughly by your valiant efforts. You now descended after the last little escaping drops of the low-alcohol rice wine, splashing over your teacher's lower leg through salty sweat and sweet wine. Eventually, you landed right on her ankle - stomach against the curve where it moved into Yukari's gigantic foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slammed it down, shaking you again. \"Ohhhh... ow... my head...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you kept licking, regardless - when you'd regained your balance. Your teacher had given you an instruction, a challenge, and you had to follow it. The feeling of the liquid rushing down your throat was unlike anything you'd ever felt before. You allowed your tongue to run over the warm, soaking mass, tracing around the joints that slumped around lazily. It didn't matter how dull your senses were becoming; from heat, or exhaustion. It didn't matter that your own clothes were wet and filthy. It didn't matter that the juices, as you neared the outstretched toes, was drifting further from the taste of refreshing New Year's sake, and closer to the musk of the girls' changing room after that time Yukari jumped in on a basketball game uninvited. It didn't matter that this gigantic woman's sweat was burning your throat, as it traveled into your sloshing stomach. It didn't matter that these wiggling toes were the same ones that pinned you down as they assaulted the infernal Yukarimobile's pedal. You were thirsty, and you needed even more of it, more of the thin drops of sake, more proof that you could hold your mind in place better than this slobbering Christmas Cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaving her foot around, she reveled in watching you chase the drops of alcohol around. \"Ah-ah - *hic* - not there!... Urgh... Come on, little squirt, keep moving...\" You held on tight to the space between her salt-soaked toes, mouth open for any drops of the sweat flying in; out of hopes that somewhere in these strong, odorous pores, there rested a little bit of beer left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha! *hic* ...It's too funny...\" From great distances above, like a shapeless sky of stormclouds about to burst, Miss Yukari wobbled, the chair's legs following her off the ground as she swung around, a looming pendulum. You lapped in the crevices between her toes, taking it all in as the phalanges curled and uncurled. Your face filled with the final remnants of sake, as everything drifted into a hazy mist...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And mighty mount Yukari, with a salute to the distant ceiling, fell limp to the floor. \"...Oh, God, I'm gonna puke...\" The avalanche sent you crashing with it; every inch of the great form falling down. You flew into the sky from the force, and landed with a soft THUD onto her bare stomach. All at once, the intoxicating odor, the hard buzz of the low-alcohol wine on your puny form, the blistering heat drifting off from your drunken teacher's body, and the exhaustion from the day's events swept over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blacked out, your body lifted up and down by Yukari's snores.</span></div></div>",
