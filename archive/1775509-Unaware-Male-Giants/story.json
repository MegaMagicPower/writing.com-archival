Well, his dad had just finished a new invention, but Josh didn't know what it was. He was interested in Science, unlike most boys his age. Other 17 year olds were out chasing girls or playing sports, but Josh was content with studying, or researching scientific things. Said invention (a machine) was sitting on a table, out in the open for all to see. It was so inviting... The big red button was attracting Josh like a bee to honey. Tentatively reaching out a finger, Josh hesitated. \"What if it kills me or something? Or it breaks? Dad'll be furious if I break it...\" he muttered. In the end, curiousty got the better of him and he pushed the button. The machine began to whirr, and Josh winced, thinking it would explode or something. But all that happened was a sudden flash of blue, and Josh blacked out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh... What?\" Josh mumbled. He came to and felt like something was very different. First of all, he realised he was in someone else's house. Then, looking next to him, he saw a giant shoe. \"What? How the hell...\" he gasped, \"Compared to that shoe, I must be smaller than an ant!\" It seemed he had shrunk - his dad's invention was obviously a shrinking machine! Suddenly, two huge feet pounded the floor, causing an earthquake that sent Josh flying up each step. It was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Two absolutely colossal bare feet stomped into view. Looking up, Josh could see they belonged to a strapping young man wearing nothing but extremely tight white boxers. Obviously, at such a tiny size he couldn't really judge the man's true height, but right now he was a true monolith. He was a very handsome guy, with short brown hair, sizeable pecs, a toned stomach, a big bulge, a tight muscular butt and big tree trunk legs, finished off by two size 13 feet. When Josh caught the giant's face, he saw it was Liam, who lived a few doors down from him. ''Liam! Down here! Help, I shrunk and need some help!'' Josh screamed desperately. The god did look down and...</span></div></div>",

''Shit, he's gonna squash me! I gotta get out of here, fast!'' Josh panicked. He ran as fast as his miniscule body would carry him, but it was nowhere near fast enough. Liam's foot slammed down into front of him, blocking his way entirely. ''DON'T WORRY LITTLE GUY, MY FEET DON'T SMELL THAT BAD!'' he laughed, lifting it again, ready to crush.

Please don't kill me!\" Josh screams, but Liam didn't hear anything about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to die, insect!\" says Liam and Josh can only see Liam's dirty sole sunk down on him. In an instant Josh's life ended under Liam's foot. <br>\r\nLiam loved how it felt when the little beetle exploded under his foot. He turns his foot back and forth until there is only a dirty, bloody mass left from Josh's body, which hardly differs from the remaining dirt on Liam's sole.</span></div></div>",

Josh screwed up his eyes, terrified of the oncoming death. In an instant, Liam slammed his big foot down, and laughed racously. ''GOT THE LITTLE FUCKER!'' he laughed. Josh blacked out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Josh came to and found himself on a foamy surface. Two hot and slightly wet walls were either side of him and there was a horrible smell. Had he died? No, he realised he was still alive. Looking round, he found he was wedged in between giant Liam's huge smelly toes, though it wasn't as bad as it could be as Liam had flip flops on. There was little space and he could barely breathe with the smell, so he made his way out from between the toes. It was quite hard but eventually he stood in front of the giant's big toe, which was of astonishing size. That alone was several times bigger than Josh. What to do next?</span></div></div>",

Josh would simply have to climb Liam, there'd be no point in getting off now as at his tiny size he'd surely be squashed in minutes if he ran round all tiny on the floor.So, taking a deep breath and preparing for a very long climb, Jack hoisted himself up onto Liam's toenail...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was easy enough to climb Liam's leg - he had shorts on so half of the way was easy to climb. Ropy hairs made it a doddle to get up to his thighs. Josh looked up to see what formed the rest of his climb. Liam had on a tight vest, showing off his biceps and pecs. Running across Liam's thigh, Josh took a deep breath as prepared for the next stage of the climb...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was relatively easy to grab folds of fabric and make his way up, but halfway up, Josh was getting really tired. Eventually, he had to give in, and blacked out (yet again)...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he woke, he was in a sticky substance of medium thickness. Suddenly from up above came a massive potato chip - he had fallen into a bowl of dip on the table in front of Liam! Josh tried to get away from the incoming chariot of death but it scooped him up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chip rose up, and Josh found himself staring into the huge, wet mouth of...</span></div></div>",

He came closer to Liam's mouth. His field of vision was almost completely occupied by it. <br>\r\nHe saw Liam's teeth, the threads of saliva that hung there, and Liam's throat, in which he will soon disappear if he cannot free himself. <br>\r\nHe was running out of time, if he doesn't get free now, Liam will eat and digest him, all that would be left of him would be a piece of fat on Liam's ass.

There's something in the dip on your chip.\"<br>\r\nLiam stops and pulls the chip out of his mouth and takes a closer look at the dip.<br>\r\n\"Oh, there really is something.\" Liam said, \"It looks like the beetle I crushed under my foot earlier, but maybe I missed it after all.\"<br>\r\nJosh actually wanted to call for Liam and his buddy, but the dip that was everywhere stuck his mouth.<br>\r\n\"If this is really the same bug, then you should probably correct your failure.\" said Sean.<br>\r\n\"You are right, Sean.\" Liam said. \"You could avoid my foot, little bug, but you won't escape my mouth. I always wanted to know what it feels like to have a small, living being in my stomach, with the knowledge that it digests there alive Thank you for volunteering. \"<br>\r\nThen Liam opens his mouth and pushes the potato chip in half. Then he closes his lips around it and licks the dip and Josh and swallows it. Josh falls down Liam's esophagus until he lands in the stomach. After Josh wakes up, it rains chewed potato chips on him. He runs to the nearest stomach wall, hits it and shouts \"LIAM! PLEASE, LET ME OUT! I AM IT, JOSH! PLEASE, I DON'T WANT TO BE DIGESTED BY YOU!\" but his screams were interrupted by the voices of Sean and Liam.<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you really did it. How does it fill up with a live beetle in your stomach?\" Sean asked.<br>\r\n\"Well, knowing about it makes me feel really powerful, but otherwise it doesn't really feel any different.\" says Liam.<br>\r\n\"What do you think? How does the little thing feel in there?\" Sean asks.<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I don't really care either. But tomorrow morning he'll feel like a piece of shit.\" says Liam and they both start laughing.<br>\r\n\"Crap, crap, crap! You're right! If I don't get out of here, I'll soon be nothing more than a piece of shit and tomorrow morning I'll be squeezed out of Liam's asshole as part of a shit.\" Josh realized.<br>\r\nBut no matter what Josh tried, he couldn't find a way out of that stomach. He soon passed out and drifted around in Liam's stomach until it passed into the small intestine. There Liam's digestive body took everything from Josh's body that he could use and stored it as fat on Liam's ass. The rest of Josh's body, which is no more than a few bones and scraps of clothing, moved on through Liam's intestine until it was combined at the end of the colon with Liam's other meals into a solid, brown mass.<br>\r\nThe next morning Josh's remains are squeezed out of Liam's asshole and flushed into the sewers.</span></div></div>",
