He quickly ran away as Grace started walking right towards him. Jason was fast but no track runner, he had brown hair, blue-green eyes with a good enough looking face not good enough to have 100\u2019s of fan girls but good enough that girls were still shy about asking him out. When it came to smarts he had was average at best, in any one class (except P,E in which he had an A) mostly because he never studies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was running as fast as he could but for ever 16 steps he took Grace only had to take 1 to go the same distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace took an other 5 steps toward Jason before stopping to look in her backpack as if to check something.

She looked down on the ground to see a squirming worm, but no Jason. She tried to see if there was someplace he had hidden. It would be just like Jason to jump out and scare her. Then it dawned on Grace. \"I just turned that dweeb into a worm,\" she said to herself with a chuckle. Grace had no idea how it happened, but she was eager to test it out more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to walk away from the worm that used to be Jason. He deserved his fate, hopefully a bird would come and have him for breakfast. Suddenly a mischievous thought came into Grace's mind, and she ran back. With her thumb and forefinger she picked up the worm. It squirmed between her fingers. \"Jason, if you are in there, this is for all the times you bullied me.\" Grace threw back her head and dropped the worm onto her tongue. With a gulp she swallowed it down. Grace smiled at herself, enjoying the thought that she just ate the neighborhood bully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly ran towards the bus stop, not wanting to miss it again. A teenage boy already stood there waiting for the bus. Grace could not help but notice that he was attractive.  The boy was skinny with creamy tan skin and brown hair. Before the bus arrived, Grace decided to test her newly found powers out. <br>\r\nShe wished that the boy would\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The kind you see at the dollar store, or in bargain bins after halloween. As the bus is nowhere in sight, and Grace has nothing else to do, she reaches down to pick up the gun, sitting at the bench by the stop. Turning it over in her hands, she notices a small switch, on the toy gun's barrel, just above the trigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shrink\"<br>\r\n\"Grow\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing to herself, thinking of how silly it would be for one of her friends to see her now, she moves the switch to the \"Grow\" position, and jokingly fires it at the bench beneath her. The end of the gun glows, and makes a cartoony lazer noise, but nothing happens. Grace switches the gun to shrink, but before she can fire, the city bus turns the corner, coming to her stop. Standing, tucking her binder under her left arm, tossing away the toy gun, and digging in to her pocket for bus fare all at once, Grace doesn't notice as the toy gun fires, the bus before her shrinking in less than half a second, out of sight. Stepping towards where the bus was, a dollar bill in her hand, Grace stops, looking up and down the street. The bus had left, that quickly? Stepping off of the sidewalk, unaware of the city bus, now less than half an inch in size, Grace tries to see if she can spot the bus driving away.</span></div></div>",

She feels something crunch under her shoe like a bug. Annoyed she lifts her foot to see that it must have been a hershy's kiss foil wrapper because whatever it was looked metallic.

He runs for his life as a shapely ass the size of a planet comes right toward him. He screams and dives just as the jean clad posterior bows the very place he had just come from. He began screaming for help anew as she tried to understand the gun. To his delight she thumbed it to grow and began to point it at the bench. \"OMIGOD! SHE SAW ME!\" he yells and runs furiously toward the end of the size changing gun. But before he can get anywhere near the growth beam she lets go of the trigger. \"NOOOO!\" his whole life flashes before his eyes as her bus arrives and she stands up tossing the gun aside. Then his fear becomes complete as he watches his device shrink the bus. And the oblivious giant girl doesn't even realize it! He is standing in awe as she looks around and finally steps on the bus. \"It's hopeless,\" he mumbles through a shocked brain. And suddenly she is coming toward him again in a huff. Too fast, impossibly fast, she turns and aims her ass right at him... As if she knew he were there and within the blink of an eye Greg's life is turned to nothing but a tiny speck of a stain on a curvy girl's butt.\u00a0<br>\r\n*********************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Grace looks up and down the street again.

She should be resting on the cheap seats while conversations happened all around her. Yet she was still at the bus stop waiting. Well at least she had this toy gun to fiddle around with. Spinning it by the trigger reminded her of all the old westerns she would watch with her parents when she was younger. The heroic sheriffs and gruff outlaws would always pull this trick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed easy enough to pull off. In fact she'd seen her own dad do it when they went out hunting one summer. So it stood to reason she could do it too. But Grace failed to take into account that when it came to pistol-like weaponry, she was a rookie. So while in the midst of spinning the gun she had accidentally pulled the trigger while the barrel was trained on her. Grace didn't have time to react before a strange beam filled her vison and almost made her drop the gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!\" she cried as she frantically rubbed her eyes. She wasn't blinded but her eyes definitely hurt now. So it had some kind of laser effect. Toy like these were expensive. She should know considering she bough her friend Ashley's little brother something similar. \"Geeze. I should count myself lucky this isn't a real gun otherwise...  Actually I rather not entertain the thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace looked back down at the gun with watery and continued to fiddle with it before an odd feeling washed over her. She felt hot, sweaty. Then it happened. She noticed the gun in her hand was... shrinking!? \"What the...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all Grace could say as she watched the gun shrinking right before her very eyes. She then looked around to see the bust stop she was sitting at was also getting smaller. Heck, the ground itself was moving further and further away. Grace was beyond scared and confused until it hit her. Gun plus ray beam equals growth. The gun was for real... And the world around her wasn't shrinking. She was growing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis apparently didn't go unnoticed either as onlookers were staring at her with equal parts awe and terror. She just kept on expanding and expanding and casting a larger and larger shadow over the street. People were actually starting to scream and run away. Cars put the petal to the metal as they sped off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace was freaking out, she tried to use the gun again only to realized she was too big for it. It fact she was so big at this point she couldn't even see it on her hand anymore. She just kept on ascending until finally her rapid expansion seemed to stop. Grace quickly looked around to see she could actually see over a few skyscrapers. Not only that, she looked down to see she was crushing a few cars. She prayed no one was in them. She was also grateful her clothes grew with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had no earthly idea how big she was, the people all around her looked like ants. Oh why was this happening to her? All she wanted was to catch a bus. She didn't even have much time to dwell as she saw her face appear on one of the giant flat-screens in the middle of the city. What!? How was she already on TV? She looked around for a few seconds before she found the reasons. A news helicopter was looker dead at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was bad. She didn't like being the center of attention. Now she was a giant eyesore and on worldwide television no less. She didn't meant to do it. But her situation combined with the anxiety she was feeling... she reacted poorly. \"Stop staring!\" she cried as she swatted the news copter. It took her about a second to realize what she'd just done before the news copter crashed into a nearby park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was pandemonium.</span></div></div>",

How would she ever get back to her normal size? What would she do now? Her mind was being flooded with hundreds of questions, each one more depressing than the last.

When it's passed, the car has left Grace's one chance and restoration in five seperate pieces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace screams out in frustration, punching at the bench and kicking, throwing herself to the ground and sobbing. It was hopeless, now. She'd spend the rest of her life at this size, however long or short it would be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle, standing at the bus stop, sighed heavily. She'd been here over a minute, and still, the city bus hadn't come by. It came by this stop every hour, and was the easiest way to get to school, by bus at least, for Michelle and Grace. Looking up and down the street again, she wonders where her best friend is today. Since both of her parents worked early, Michelle knew that Grace couldn't have gotten a ride with them. And Grace didn't have anyone else to bring her, except for when Michelle's mom was feeling generous enough to give the girls a ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Michelle brushed a brown curl out of her eye, a car drove by and completely destroyed some kid's toy gun, without even stopping. The importance of this was naturally lost on Michelle, who knew nothing of Grace's plight. Her only concern right now was that she may have missed the bus, and Grace. That was the only logical explanation. She HAD gotten up a little late. With a groan, Michelle sits down on the bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~ <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace, sitting with her knees pulled up to her chest, glances up at her enormous friend, sniffling. Suddenly, with a sigh, Michelle begins to sit, right on top of Grace!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption A: Michelle parks her butt right on top of Grace, who only manages to survive because she has relocated to the metal support between the bench's planks. Grace is safe, but trapped under her friend's bottom with no way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption B: Michelle sits only on the edge of the bench, leaving Grace right behind her friend, free to climb back up on to the planks and reach her.</span></div></div>",

Looking up, she could just make out the denim of Michelle's jeans, her butt sinking down slightly between the planks, forming a low roof over Grace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing to herself, Grace reaches up, smacking her best friend's ass, already knowing that she'd never feel her, but still thankful for being alive. Her relief is replaced by further frustration, however, as Grace realizes the only ways out from underneath her best friend would mean plummeting to her death. Yelling was useless, Grace knew, especially since there's no way her voice would carry from under Michelle's massive rear. As Grace is standing underneath her friend, and her eyes adjust somewhat more to the light, she see's that there's a tiny hole in Michelle's jeans, giving Grace a glimpse of her friend's bare asscrack. Grimacing a little, the sheer size of it, and fact that it's her best friend, Grace sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would need to get Michelle's attention somehow, but she needed to act fast. Michelle would either wait for the bus and leave with it, Grace stranded and alone, or she'd get tired of waiting and just skip school and head home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption A: Grace, with no other real options left to her, swallows her pride and pulls herself up through the hole in Michelle's pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption B: Grace is too slow to act!

Sighing to herself, she wrinkles her nose. The smell of Michelle's panty-clad rear was by no means unpleasant, but the mere thought of being so close to her friend's rear, especially when she was so tiny and it was so large, was humiliating, and gross. Squinting around in the dark, Grace is able to find a small worn spot in the panties, near Michelle's crack. Not an ideal location, but it had to suffice. Pushing and clawing at it, Grace is able to work her hand and arm through the hole to secure herself for when Michelle moves. Sighing to herself, the warmth emanating from her friend's crack on the other side of the panties making her a bit more comfortable, Grace leans against her friend's butt, and waits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle, completely unaware of her miniscule friend, waits patiently for the bus for almost another ten minutes. If she missed the first, the next wouldn't be by for a little while, and that would make her late. Being the somewhat lacking student she was, Michelle would much prefer calling in sick and missing the day entirely to go have fun than to go late, sit through school, and face detention after. Grumbling to herself, she stands and heads for home, only a few short blocks away. Her mom would have left for work by now, and she'd have the entire house to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace had just been getting ready to extract her tiring arm and slip the othr in to the hole when her entire world rocketed upwards, and Grace was pulled, along with the fabric all around her, much closer to Michelle, between the cheeks. Grace squirmed and fidgeted for all she was worth, surrounded on all sides by the light smell of perfume and sweat, squeezed by Michelle's two enormous ass cheeks. The mere motion of Michelle's buttcheeks pressing against each other while she walks is far, far, far more powerful than Grace's entire body, however, and she can do nothing but roll in Michelle's wedgie like a ball of lint.</span></div></div>",

Tearing slightly, Grace is forced through as Michelle picks and prods at her ass. Sliding down her gargantuan friend's panties like a hammock, her now bare, massive crack less than a foot away, Grace tries clawing at the panties to head back the way she came, out the hole. The warmth in here was unbarable, and in her bff's crotch, or butt, was the last place Grace wanted to be. Even if it meant risking plummeting to her death. Michelle, however, is on the move again already, and the titanic buttcheeks begin grinding against each other again, though Grace must now also contend with her friends thighs. Grace thanks god at least for the darkness, so that she doesn't have to see her friends enormous, gross vagina, which Grace assumes is either right above her, or  down and a little in front of her.

It bit me! Stupid bug!!\" Sarah was getting mad at it now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's tough for sure. Oh, I know! Bounce on it! That'll crush it for sure!\" Michelle suggested. \"I'll even help, let me sit on your lap. I doubt it can handle that much weight.\" Grace was horrified now! She could only hope that Sarah wouldn't agree or that the bus will come soon! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a great idea! The bus probably wont be here for a while, so lets crush this bug!\" Sarah exclaimed! Michelle sat on her lap, adding even more weight onto Grace. Only thing saving her was the gap between the planks and the softness of the rear. \"1, 2, 3!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah with Michelle, started bouncing up and down on the bench and grace! Several times, up and down they went on Grace, each landing was more horrible than the first on her. She was in pain and suffering, while the two girls were having a fun time bouncing, trying to crush a bug. They had finally stopped bouncing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, I think it's finally gone now! I can't even feel it! Thanks for the help.\" Sarah told Michelle. \"Sure thing, It was my pleasure.\" Michelle said, getting off her lap. The bus had finally arrived to pick them up now.

Satisfied with her run, the athletic jogger began to return home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace was now plastered against the soft expanse of Sarah's yoga pants. While she was happy just to be alive after that crushing ordeal, she couldn't have been more terrified. She was suspended hundreds of feet above ground and forced to cling for her life to this humongous, jiggling rear. Below her, endless thighs and calves pistoned away, propelling her unaware transporter forward with powerful booms. Every stride made Grace's world quake violently. Just as Grace felt herself slipping, the shaking began to slow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah exhaled in relief as she entered the cool air of the gas station. She shivered as she felt her sweat chill in the crisp air-conditioned store. Feeling extremely parched, she'd decided to stop in for a bottle of water. It was so hot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace rested a bit as things slowed down. The gigantic woman she was stuck to had slowed from a violent jog to relaxed stroll in the store. This slow moment allowed her to observe her surroundings. She was less fearful, more annoyed and a little disgusted. Grace wrinkled her nose at the smell of sweat emanating from the massive cheek. She was a little nauseous from the shifting ride and the fact that she stuck to the titanic butt of some random jogger. \"It could be worse,\" Grace thought half-sarcastically as she was forced to press her face against the firm wall. \"Her butt could be all doughy and bouncy. That would be a nightmare...well, more of a nightmare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExiting the store, Sarah chugged most of the water before she got to the side walk. \"Aaahh!\" She tossed the mostly empty bottle into the recycling bin and continued running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She seems a bit angered until she spots someone just walking some steps ahead of her. Her best friend Ashley. Quietly she sneaks up behind her to give her a little fright. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace jumps up to land breast first on Ashley while shouting like a madman. Ashley nearly drops her phone as she gets scared by her friend. Shortly after Grace couldn't hold back her tears while laughing. \"You know that isn't funny!\" Ashley says angered by her bestie. \"But you look so funny every time you are getting scared by something.\" Grace says between her laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey now walk side by side on their way to school, talking about stuff going on in their school. Suddenly Ashley spots the toy gun in Grace's bag and asks \"What's that thing?\" \"A toy. I found it at my bus stop. It has an little Grow-Shrink switch on it's side. Some obviously played mad professor.\" Grace explains. \"What if it does work tho?\" \"Don't be silly. A size changing gun doesn't exist.\" \"Yeah you are right but why don't we just try it?\" Ashley always was a rather creative and curious kind of person, which Grace thinks a bit childish about. She insists in Grace to just try the gun out at something around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace spots a woman on the side of the street texting on her phone before she gets into her car. \"You see that woman over there?\" Grace asks while pointing at her. \"Yes.\" Ashley just answers. \"If she shrinks the gun works. If not it's just a kids toy. Okay?\" Ashley nobs as Grace starts aiming at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Grace fired the woman remains untouched. \"See. Nothing happens.\" Grace says bit proud because she was right. \"No... look!\" Ashley says while starring at the woman. Now Grace also stares in surprise as the woman begins loosing some height. Her phone keeps it's size while she slowly dwindles down by some inches. Suddenly she shrinks half her size in an instance. In fright she drops her phone. The shrink spurt repeats until she isn't big enough for the girls to be seen at that distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth walk over to the place where the woman stood just a few seconds ago. As they kneel down to the phone they notice a really tiny thing waving an jumping around. It's the woman from a second ago at just the size of 1 millimetre. Carefully Ashley tries to pick her up with just the edge of her fingernails. She moves her closer to her eyes to check if it's really her. \"Holy... It worked.\" she comments as she realizes it's definitely her. She drops the tiny woman onto her hand because she isn't save on her nails. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpressed and shocked at the same moment Ashley looks into Grace's eyes. \"It really worked! Look there is a tiny woman on my hand! That's awesome!\" Grace doesn't know how to react to this. Now knowing that it works she worries that she has accidentally shrunken the school bus. She starts believing that the tiny foil she step on was actually the bus. \"Hello? Earth to Grace are you there?\" Ashley asks while Grace looks into the void. Grace looks back at the shrunken woman who seems to be begging to be grown back. \"Hold on let me fix this!\" Grace say switching back to growth. Ashley closes her hand carefully and says \"No! Don't do that! Let's keep her!\" \"Ashley. She isn't an bug you can throw in a terrarium when you are home. I have to grow her back!\" \"So you have to grow me with her!\" Ashley says closing her hand with the other. \"Ashley come on. You can't do that.\" \"But why? Look what we have done already. Imagine what we could do now. We could make a human zoo or a living playground with a bunch of tiny people. Let me keep her at least as an trophy of our first experiment.\" From other scenarios throughout their school years, Grace knows that nothing can change Ashley's mind. She always gets what she wants. And so she does this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Keep her... But I get to control the device. Okay?\" Grace states with some struggle. She feels empathy for the tiny woman in Ashley's hand. She just wanted to text someone and then drive off to work. Now Ashley looks at her and shakes her with joy before finally dropping her in between her D-cup breasts. Grace looks concerned as the woman falls down the gap between her boobs but Ashley tries to calm her down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what? Should we go to school and mess around there or just go somewhere else where we can do other funny stuff?\" Ashley asks with an constant desire to just use the gun randomly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo... where are the heading to? If they even do...</span></div></div>",

Though the impact seemed epic, just as quick as the foot landed, it would soon vanish back up into the air. Everyone on board sighing with relief thinking that they are now safe. The next split second would show them how wrong that they were as soon a black wall that was Grace's Vans Sneaker crashed down not even  5 feet infront of the bus in their perspective, sending another shockwave throughout the bus.

However many launch launched over their seats and even a few flew through the front windshield only to crash into the rough and worn side of Grace's sneaker, dying upon impact. The bus Driver still attached to his seat via the only seatbelt onboard, merely looks back at his passengers strung out all over the bus.

Normally a gust like that wouldn't phase Grace whatsoever, today however was a different day. Today Grace was wearing a skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the breeze blew Grace's skirt was lifted up high, any onlookers would have seen her bright pink panties, with a little pink bow tied on the front. If any dirty old men had been looking, they surely would have whistled, had they caught a glimpse of that shapely bum, which the pink panties hugged so tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a gasp, Grace immediately tried to grab her skirt which was caught in the wind like a upturned umbrella. In her haste she lost her footing, and she fell backward, onto her panty-clad-ass. She groaned, leant foward and rubbed her ass in pain, and as her skirt floated downwards somewhat more gracefully than its owner, she clutched it and quite forcefully pressed it against her previously exposed front. In embarrasement. She was thankfull the bus hadn't been there, and that her best friend Claire, boyfriend Jason and all the other people on her bus hadn't been there to see it happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Claire, Jason and the rest of the students on the bus that morning, they had been there to see it happen; up close and personal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason thought he was lucky when he narrowly caught the bus that morning. Most drivers would have left without him, but he was given a lucky break, or so he thought. He didn't know what to think when the shrinking first happened, it was all so quick. One minute he was sitting there looking out the window, watching as his beautiful girlfriend come into view, the bus approaching her stop, then bam, they we driving on a giagantically large runway streching for miles into the distance. The truth finally sunk in when the bus came to a stop right beside a towering Nike sneaker. He knew that sneaker. He gazed upward, his jaw sinking into his chest at his girlfriends mammoth body. She dominated his view, her legs streching upwards like twin towers. He looked even higher, past her lusciously curved body, her breasts jutting out like twin hills. He starred even higher still, too her gorgeous face. Her beautiful blue eyes, looking around in surprise for the bus that should have been there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she bent over, her body moving at an alarming speed. As she stood there, so gargantuan yet so sexually overwhelming, Jason felt a glimmer of hope; she had seen them, everything would be alright. But it was not too be. A queasy sensation rose in the pit of his stomach as her eyes scanned past them, not even recgonising his existence, and fell upon a giant quarter, more than 3 times the length of the bus. Grace, his girlfriend for 2 years, with whom he shared such a deep emotional connection with, who loved him with all her heart and he the same way, couldn't even see him. He was living in a new world, a world in which he was as relevant to her as the dust beneath her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer impossibly large, hand reached down and retrieved the quarter, she flipped it over, examining it. Anger swelled within him, he was rather jealous of the coin. He wished she'd look at him, even if it was with that cold bored expression on her face. Even the quarter had more significence to her than him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned around to Claire whom he was sharing a seat with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're doomed Claire, we're doomed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if in response to his remark, a gust of wind with incredible power struck the bus and it was thrown underneath the giantess, right below her incredible ass. Jason looked up again at the monstrous sight that was his girlfriends panties. He recognised them. Just last week she had shown them off to him, he had thought the tiny little bow was cute, now it sat there mocking him. It was a bow that he'd never undo, it held a present he would never unwrap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeew!\" Claire screamed as she too saw the view. \"She's got a massive camel toe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason noticed she was right. He could quite clearly make out the lips of a truly god-sized vagina. Just the thought of it sprang his penis into erection. Yes the sight of Grace's panty covered pussy filled Jason's heads with fanatasies he'd never imagined before, but before he could daydream too long, reality came crashing down once more.</span></div></div>",

Such a view it was, all the males on the bus were immediately turned on, had they not been before hand. However the sight was short-lived. The monster ass above them suddenly descended with such force that it split the bus in two. One end flew fowards and upwards and the passengers within it, Jason and Claire included, fell out and landed on crevice created by Grace's inner thighs and the elastic of her panties. The other end was forced backwards, half of it flatened completely. As Grace leant fowards to rub her rear, she unknowingly smushed the rear of the bus against her massive ass cheek. The bus was pushed into the yielding flesh of her ass, and the combined pressure and friction created by her rubbing ground it into oblivion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe passengers at the front of bus endured a different treatment. When Grace leant foward, the elastic along the side of her panties was pushed outwards creating a gap, through which the passengers, Jason and Claire included fell into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason screamed as he fell into the darkness. His body was momentarily tangled in a forest of pubic hair, before Grace caught her skirt and pushed it against herself, causing him to fall some more before he came to a stop resting against Grace's enormous vaginal lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jason's eyes adjusted to the light, he gasped in amazement at the sight before him. The lips were truly massive, the slit may have been hundreds of metres in length. The heat radiating from it was substantial and the scent was heavy, an overwhelming musky odour that screamt of femininty. Those lips could crush him without even feeling it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like a great big cave, the cave of his goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~</span></div></div>",

Three people had been entangled in Grace's pubic hair, one of which was just hanging there, a strand of hair, tied around his neck. One girl had somehow managed to get herself from the waist, up, trapped in Grace's urinebius, her legs, kicking with muffled yells being heard. The last four people were all trapped within Grace's massive vagina. Her vaginal walls were wet and sticky with a white slime that was coating it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Grace got up quickly, the momentum from the lift had thrown the three people, hanging from her pubes, all over the place, pulling her hairs any direction they went. Grace could feel the short, sharp pains as her pubes were pulled. Looking around to make sure no one was around, she casually scratched herself. To Grace, it was just a harmless scratch, but to the ten students below...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason and Claire didn't even see it coming. One second, their watching as everyone is in peril, the next, they are thrown from their spot on Grace's panties and into her moist vagina. All Jason or Claire had managed to see before touching down on the moist ground was the panties, quickly rise up. Grace's finger, pushed the her panty up and into her pubes where she began to scratch. The six people stuck in her vagina could hear their screams as Grace smeared the three hanging bodies into her pubes and pushed the girl that was trapped in her urinebius, deeper in. When Grace had finished, the three people who had been hanging, although one was already dead, had been smeared into the thick, black forest. The girl was pushed to far in to be heard or seen and the six people inside Grace's vagina were stuck to its walls, unable to break free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving waited for nearly an hour, Grace decides to go home.

She was looking out the window of the bus to see her friend Grace, waiting for her at the stop. She had saved a seat for her, just as she had done every other day, but today something went horribly wrong. She didn't see what happened but suddenly there was a jolt and she looked out the bus window in horror to see that the world had grown to enormous portions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach horrifying moment passed slowly and was filled with screams from the bus's occupants. The next thing she new, the bus was rolling around and people were crashing into one another as metal twisted, glass shattered, and wheels exploded. Then  her stomach lurched as she was propeled hundreds, or maybe thousands of feet into the sky. There was more shaking and tumbling, and the next thing she knew she was laying on a strange uneven surface. Reluctantly, she raised her head and was shocked to see her friend Grace's face, which was now as large as a mountain!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grace! Help us, we've shrunk somehow!\", shouted Janice. Her shouting was answered by Grace's loud feminine voice saying something incomprehensible and then giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grace!\", Janice screamed much louder this time. Something about her friend's giggling sent a shiver down her spine. Suddenly, Grace's expression began to change and the hand began to move rapidly up to her face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanice thought she was going to be eaten, and began to scream for all she was worth. The other 3 people in her hand did the same, and all of them held out their hands in a vain attempt to ward off the approaching face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing they knew, there was an extremely loud explosion and powerful gust of wind that threatened to blow their tiny bodies apart. When the hand withdrew from the face and light returned, they all found themselves embedded in large globs of a gelatin-like substance, and it only took them a few seconds to figure out what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanice struggled to free herself, but couldn't even budge and inch in the thick snot of her friend. To make matters worse, Grace was looking at all of them and laughing uncontrollably at their predicament...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace began to settle down from her uncontrollably laughing to think about what to do next. She looked down at her friend and decided she would help her. Carefully, she held on to the bus with her other hand as she lowered her long index finger to her palm and gently scooped the tiny girl out of her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the blob of snot came with her. She didn't know how to separate her friend without killing her, so she sat down and thought for a moment. Next, she carefully, so as not to kill anyone, reaching into her pocket and pulled out a wadded up tissue which she'd already used earlier in the morning to blow her nose. It was already covered in gooey blobs of green and yellow from her nose, so she didn't see any harm in adding more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery carefully, she wiped Janice off onto the tissue as well as the other three passengers still in her palm. Then she looked down at the three living boogers and began to ponder what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decides that she will....</span></div></div>",

She held the lives of several different people, adults, some of them, in her young hands. She could do anything to them, anything with them, on a whim. They were powerless to stop her.

Rub her feet when she's tired...entertain her, do her homework, or give her the answers at least...was this too good to pass up? And Janice...this was one of her friends, not just some stranger...some nobody, that Grace didn't even know.

Any of you. Not all the way. Maybe just by a little bit...to try some stuff out, later on, but...this is your new life now. You have to except it...\" Janice was in a state of shock. Of denial. The most horrible thing she could've possibly heard...the most tear-jerking, heart-wrenching words, from her best friend's enormous lips. Reaching down, Grace ripped the tissue from Janice as best she could, then held her in her titanic palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't get it all of.

All of it.\" As she left Janice to comply with her commands, Grace unzipped her backpack with one hand, lifting the bus's remains, and those who had still managed to stay within, in to a small side pocket, dropping the gun in the main pouch with her binder, and zipping it up. Hoisting her bag over her shoulder, she started walking in the direction of home, glancing down at Janice.</span></div></div>",

Socks that were originally white and pink.<br>\r\nThe smell worsened ten fold as she pryed her sock off, finally allowing her toes to wiggle freely.

A windy noise came from above, and Jacob looked up in horror. A purple mist fell from above, trapping Jacob within the perfume's mist, the very same mist that had shrunken him to merely 2 inches before! Jacob cried out, the perfume had dripped into his eyes as he rubbed them furiously to rid himself of the vile scent. A burning feeling rushed over his body and he watched as the blades of grass passed his head, his already feeble screams now insignificant. Jacob fought furiously and after a few moments, found the building sized object that was Grace's shoes. using the strings from the bottom of her pants, Jacob began his climb up Grace, in search of help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace looked down the street in curiosity.

No bus yet..\" groaned Grace, a smile on her face. \"yet! Maybe there is no school!\" Claire returned the smile, her words covered with hope of a 'no school but fun elsewhere' day. \"Hey look what I found\" Grace smiled, showing her friend the bottle of perfume. \"Wow...that's beautiful!

Claire watched as the box near her grew as she reached a mere 3 inches tall, the box now the size of about 5 of her. Claire sat down against said box as she pulled her knees to her chest, tears falling rapidly from her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cwhat did I do to deserve this?!\u201d she sobbed as she rested her head on her knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a rumbling grew from under her, catching her attention as a blinding light flooded the entire room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow where did I put that box?\u201d asked a thunderous voice from above her. The identity was left unknown as Claire shielded her eyes, and soon her  ears as well as a mountain seemed to crash only inches in front of her.  The ground shook, so much Claire actually left the ground at one point, as a shinning blue wall slammed in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI must have shrunk again\u2026..\u201d she said to herself as she screamed in surprise. Towering above her was her best friends mother, Diana. Claire was mesmerized with Diana\u2019s movements as she picked up the spilled box, ready to pick up it\u2019s contents resting amongst the dust and crud covered floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSTUPID BOX!\u201d she growled angrily, throwing the box on the floor as she dropped onto her knees. The shadow increase and earthquake of Diana snapped Claire into reality and she stood up, starting to run away. It was too late by then though, Diana had already begun to sweep the junk back into the box with her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! It\u2018s me! Stop!\u201d\u201d cried Claire but it was too late, she was pressed against Diana\u2019s hand with a vast amount of pressure as she and the rest of the junk were pushed into the box. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2026now I have the box\u2026back to the kitchen for me\u2026\u201d Diana sighed and stood up, the box pressed against her chest.  Claire could only watch as the mountainous head above her walked down the stairs, back down to the kitchen. The box shook rapidly, Claire bouncing and flying with each stair case Diana took downward.  Finally reaching her destination, the kitchen, Diana slid the box onto the counter and sighed, leaning against the counter for a rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Grace skipped into the kitchen, overjoyed with a day off from school. \u201cWell I see someone\u2019s in a good mood..\u201d her mother smiled and Grace nodded vigorously. \u201cOf course! No school and a whole day to hang out with my best friend. Speaking of her, where did Claire go?\u201d Her mother shrugged \u201cI have no idea\u2026maybe she went home to get some stuff for tonight?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace nodded and looked at the box. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d Diana smiled \u201cJust something from the attic\u2026I needed some kitchen crap-ola\u2026\u201d her mother chuckled from the use of the word. \u201cYa\u2026you have fun with that..\u201d Grace laughed and leaned against the box. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGRACE!\u201d Claire called as her colossal friend shadowed her part of the box. \u201chey mom\u2026can we have pizza tonight?\u201d Grace gave her mother the puppy dog pout.

Grace dropped the can onto the counter, Claire falling on top the counter behind it. \"mmmm...Grace that scent smeels delicious! Can I have a spray?\" her mother asked, helping her unload the box. \"Sure..hold on a sec...\" Grace smiled and ran out of the room, returning shoritly with the perfume.

Stepping out into the vast counter, Claire could simply stare in awe at the view before her: The fridge seemed thousands of miles away, yet it was only on the other wall, and the smallest crumb was about the size of her abdomen.  Her head spun and she fell to her knees, teeth clenched in pain <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Not again...!\" she whimpered as she stood up. The crumb that was the size of her abdomen, was now big enough she could sit atop of it. This was a fair sized crumb, mind you, probably the size of one's thumb nail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES, I WOULD LIKE TO PLACE AN ORDER....\" a thunderous sound echoed all around Claire, and she sighed, knowing it was Grace's mom. 'Maybe I should have gone with Grace....\" she sighed in defeat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WE NEED 3 PIZZAS....ONE WITH EXTRA CHEESE AND PINEAPPLE.....PEPPERONI AND OLIVES IN ANOTHER...AND ONE WITH ONIONS, EXTRA CHEESE, AND PEPPERONI...DELIVER PLEASE....ALRIGHT....182 COLLINSONS AVENUE...\" she finished and hung the phone up, and returning over to the box. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire watched in awe as Grace's mother (Whom we shall name Diana), walked over and began to set things on the counter. Claire was pushed off the crumb by the sudden gust of wind Diana created by setting a blender  next to her. Claire was shoved back a good 10 feet, hitting her head on the sinks edge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW!\" she cry out, her head connecting to the metal bar. 'Well...better head over and try to get her attention..\" Clair stood up and began her walk to the box once more. Once there, a loud and slightly annoying sound made Claire\u2019s ear ring as Diana picked up the phone, it was one of her friends, as far as Claire could tell. Diana set her hand on the counter, her fingers tapping away subconsciously. Claire gulped softly, fear causing her body to shake as she could feel the tremors caused by the gigantic fingers. Claire ran over, a sharp breath taken before doing so, and jumped, quickly grabbing a hold of Diana's skin. She slowly shimmied her way up and grabbed a hold on Diana's charm bracelet, sitting on one of the bear charms for a rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's been nice talking to you, Christine, but I have to go....yes talk to you later...bye-bye\" Diana hung up the phone. Claire grabbed a hold of the bear's neck for dear life as she walked over and did so. Diana sighed and ran her hand through her curly brown hair. Claire watched as she passed by Diana's chest, pass her nose and soon her eye where the hand ran through the giants hair, leaving Claire to dangle helplessly in front of her friends, mother's giant Jade eye. Diana paused momentarily:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Claire was whipped around and slowly slipping before finally falling from the strands of hair and landing on her best friends mothers nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDiana! Diana please help me!\u201d Screamed the tiny Claire as she stood up on the slanted fleshy surface. She jumped and waved and continued to call out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Diana\u2019s eyes that were once surveying the room behind Claire now crossed and looked right at her.. she was saved!.... or was she..?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the..? I thought I got rid of the gnats in this house last week.\u201d Said Diana to herself, the movement of her faint speaking ever so slightly moved her face around causing Claire to scream and lose her balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! No Diana it\u2019s me! It\u2019s Claire! You have to help mEEE!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of nowhere a giant familiar column fell from the sky and struck the platform Claire was on.. it was Diana\u2019s finger attempting to get rid of the pest on her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire was flung to the side. She bounced off Diana\u2019s left nostril and then found herself rolling towards the upper lip. Claire reaches out and tried grabbing the micro peach fuzz hairs that Diana had accumulated above her mouth until Claire finally stopped and came to the realization that she was in the groove below the nose and above the mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe landscape was just deep enough for Claire to sit in like a massive chair.. a chair that overlooked a giant new world of Grace\u2019s house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire could barely find rest even in that moment before Diana bent over to grab some discarded paper on the floor. The movement caused tiny Claire to suddenly fall from her upper lip perch and down towards the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhhhhh! Help me!\u201d Screamed Claire before coming face to face with a rising landscape.. Diana\u2019s midriff coming to meet her in the midst of standing back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire reached out and grabbed hold of Diana\u2019s belt buckle that held up her jeans. It was massive and Claire found it easy to pull herself into a compartment within the buckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need to get someone\u2019s attention now\u201d Claire said through tears and shudders.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Will you please come get the money and get the pizza from the front door?!\"</b> Diana smiled and yelled up to her eldest son, Michael. A pair of thunderous footsteps slammed down the stairs and into the kitchen. A tall man walked into the kitchen; he was Grace's eldest brother, Michael. His brown hair was kind of long for a boy, he had to brush it back a lot. His eyes were a piercing green behind his glasses and he had a piercing on his lip. He held out his hand for the money from his mother with an extremely bored look on his face. Diana happily handed him the money. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n           <b>\"While you get the pizza, I am going to get the plates and cups ready.\" </b>Michael flipped his hair in response as his mother leaned down, kissing his head gently as she smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n              Claire screamed as Diana leaned forward towards Michael, her tiny hands beginning to slip from Diana's hair. With a final scream, Claire's fingers untangled from Diana's hair as she began to plummet down and away from the mother's head. The only option she had if she didn\u2019t want to fall onto her doom, grab onto Michael somehow. She looked at the giant in front her, trying to find anything she could grab. She noticed he was wearing a hoodie; she could grab the hoodie strings!<br>\r\nLiterally paddling through the air towards Michael, Claire swung and swam with all her might towards her BFF's big brother. As luck would have it, she grabbed onto one of the various threads of the right string. Wrapping her legs around the string, she clings to it with all her might. She wouldn\u2019t be found down here though; she would have to climb upward to get his attention. He was a mature boy, he would help her for sure!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n              With a deep breath, Claire began to wiggle her way up towards Michael\u2019s face. The hoodie in front of her was so warm from his body heat; there seemed to be a natural smell coming from him, almost like musk. It was intoxicating to Claire. She leaned into that hoodie and breathed deeply, exhaling with a happy sigh. She had to continue on, and sadly made her way up the rope like ladder. <br>\r\n```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` <br>\r\n              Michael opened the door and greeted the pizza guy, who in turn greeted him. Handing the money over, Michael held onto the pizzas in his arms, hitting the door with his hip as he went back into the kitchen so it\u2019d close.  He unceremoniously dropped the boxes onto the table, flipping open the boxes and taking in their amazing scent.<br>\r\nDiana brought in the plates and cups, 2 liters of pops now on the table from her. Grace skipped into the room and hugged her brother, who shoved her off and reached for 2 pieces of cheese, onion, and pepperoni pizza, flopping them onto his plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n           \u201cGeez, Michael. No love.\u201d Grace sighed and reached for the pops.<br>\r\n```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` ``<br>\r\n\tClaire began to sweat from the heats of the pizza next to her, even though they smelled delicious. When Michael dropped the boxes onto the table, Claire slipping down the rope due to her sweaty hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n           \u201cNot again!\u201d Claire wailed as she began to slip<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does Claire land?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Any other day Grace would have simply ignored it and kept going but something about this day made her want to examine it. She knelt down on her knees and began to examine the small bug, for some strange reason Grace was fascinated by it. The bug was fairly big roughly the same size as a criquet maybe bigger. The main things that seemed unusual about this bug were two things. 1. was that it stood on two legs, and 2. It had a very unusual color to it, It was Blue on its legs, red around the torso and tan on its head and arms/legs. The small bug vaguely resembled a person to Graces surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace couldnt help but stare at it and before she knew it her mind began to race with random thoughts about the bug (Is it a shrunken person? Some rare bug? Maybe even a tiny humanoid species!) Graces mind raced with possibilities of the bug but she was snapped out of this when she heard something, the sound of a bus leaving. Grace ran to her bus stop praying she was on time  just to see it driving away. She attempted to chase it but after about half a block she realized it was pointless, She was an unathletic girl and it was a city bus she had no chance. Grace sighed a sigh of defeat and began walking home \"man mom is gonna kill me for missing school\" grace muttered aloud She arrived back home and wondered what she should do now. Her parents would be gone for a few hours at work. Grace could try to ride her bike to school but she might not make it on time, or she could try to find that bug again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a few moments Grace decided to search for the bug, I suppose you could say her curiosity got the better of her. She looked around her lawn and eventually found the bug again. Shortly afterward she picked it up and brought it to her room. Se searched around her messy room for a magnifying glass and when she finally found it she looked at the bug and saw that it was a tiny man! Grace about fainted right there but, somehow she didnt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes she finally regained her composure and began attempting to question the little man. It took a little while before they could get anywhere though. Eventually they managed to properly communicate when Grace placed him next to a microphone connected to her stereo. The little man spoke into it and Grace was able to hear him through the speakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace then began questioning him properly. She learned a variety of things like his name was Robert, yes he was human, he was 19 along with a bunch of other useless facts. Eventually she got to the big question, Why was he small? Robert himself didnt know, he had woken up a week ago on a sidewalk and was really tiny. At his miniature size Robert began wandering around in search of help. During his wandering Robert got stepped on multiplr times and found out he was able to survive great amounts of pain, the kind that would kill regular people. Grace listened intently with a solemn expression on her face as Robert went over his harsh journey in search of help. After the whole story was finished Robert asked Grace for her help and Grace<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The bus rounds the corner as Grace stands, stupified, taking in the situation. Stopping, the bus driver waits a moment, before leaning off his seat slightly, and calling to Grace. \"You getting on?\" Grace, looking over, just shakes her head. The bus driver, unconcerned, presses onward to finish his route. Crouching down slowly, Grace watches her shrunken friend, still as stunned as Grace, the ring, now a massive, metal circle beside her, fully-sized. Unsure of what to do to grow, or even help Michelle, Grace scoops her up in to her hand, with the ring, and looks around, almost expecting a bystander to stop her. There were none. Turning, Grace races home, her heart pounding. She'd been away for a short time, but her family had busy mornings...mom and dad worked..no siblings..she'd be home alone. With Michelle. Arriving home and letting herself in with her key, Grace hurried to her bedroom, tossed her backpack aside, kicked her sneakers off, and dropped to her knees on her hardwood floor, Michelle, dazed in her giant friend's palm, staring up at her blankly, as if in a dream. Staring back down at her sensitive, frail, powerless friend, Grace can't help but blush as a feeling of strength and control take hold of her.</span></div></div>",

The fact that this was her best friend and closest pal escaped Grace temporarily, along with the morals and ethics that would have screamed in objection. Grace was absorbed by the power she now had. What to do, oh what to do first? She couldn't help but salivate as she eyes the now terrified half-inch being. A few ideas rose to mind first, shoving passed all others and crying out. Humiliation...true examples and demonstrations of power and authority. She could slip the tiny girl down the back of her pants...her panties, force her against her puckered, sensitive hole. Maybe, if she was careful, she couldn't even force the little girl's entire BODY in to her rear! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs tempting as the thought of feeling another living thing forced up her rear was, there was some risks, her mind took a moment to realize. She could suffocate, easily....be pulverized in to nothing, compressed in to an unrecognizable mush by Grace's powerful, sensitive rectal walls. One flex, twitch, or instinctive pinch, and her miniscule 'friend' would be snubbed out of existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could force her friend to rub her feet...paint her toe-nails...lick her, and worship her...or tie her to a toe with a string, maybe even dump her in to a dirty gym sock, and go for a jog? She relished the thought of having her friend's writhing body trapped beneath her toes, at the mercy of Grace, totally beneath her, the simple decision of where to apply each step's pressure meaning life, or death, for another organism. Enough thought! Grace needed to feel her...now, in some way.</span></div></div>",

You'll kill me if you eat me! I thought we were friends?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are friends, and we always will be,\" Grace replied. \"But you are just too cute for me to resist. I don't want to kill you, but I do want you all to myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm not a toy! I am a human being, just like you!\" Michelle shouted in her high pitched voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace smiled warmly to her tiny friend. \"Look at it this way, me and you have always been close and shared our most personal secrets with one another. Its time we took our friendship a step further. I'm going to introduce you to the most secret and personal part of my body, a part of my body no one else has ever been to before. Soon this place will be your home. I'm referring, of course, to my ass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle's eyes grew wide in terror. \"WHAT?! You can't force another person to go up your nasty ass! Especially someone whom you consider your best friend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Grace had already made up her mind and wasn't going to take no for an answer. \"You're going to go up my butt whether you like it or not, so get used to the idea.

Just think, you'll have a warm cozy place to sleep and your landlord also happens to be your best friend.

She could feel the amazingly tiny form of her best friend against one of the most sensitive, private, and personal areas of her entire teenage body, the small, puckered hole not even visible between Grace's cheeks, when she stood nude, unless she parted them or bent over. Yet the muscles behind it were stronger than her best friend's entire body now, and from one wrinkled rim to the next, the orifice easily outmatched her in size. Giggling as she heads out her bedroom door, almost expecting someone to jump out at her, knowing what she had done, Grace can't help but let out a small snicker with each step, her cheeks rubbing together and alternating between pressing Michelle's frail body against her sensitive anus, and pulling her back away from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, Michelle was crying to herself, her miniscule, overstressed mind trying to rationalize what had occured, what she had been suddenly dropped in to, literally and metaphorically. The smell coming from her best friend, or former best friend's, anus wasn't pleasant. The vague aroma of whatever lay on the other side of the pinkened, sticky wall of wrinkled flesh surrounded Michelle, and Grace's sweat was mingled with it. As her enormous girlfriend stepped, her cheeks constricted, slamming Michelle against the larger's girl's butthole, Michelle groaning in disgust as the next step drags her away, a thin layer of what felt like watered down glue coating her face and abdomen. Each step repeated the torture, until Michelle's hair was drenched, matted to her head, and the taste of Grace's anus was in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut the front door, down the road, and on her way to the bus stop, Grace couldn't help but put a little extra bounce in her step, each movement, each stride bringing her close friend even closer, only to force her away, and then back in again. It was actually beginning to get a little irritating, like a piece of balled up lint in her panties, tickling her sporadically. Arriving at the stop, Grace bit her lip, spying the bench...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she sat, would her weight completely obliterate Michelle, making her a gory smear in Grace's crack? Or would she be protected by Grace's pillowy butt? She giggled at the thought of it, deciding she wouldn't risk it. This WAS her best friend. She could experiment later.</span></div></div>",

The girl's name was Amanda, and she motioned for Grace to sit next to her. Grace was hesitant to sit down and risk squashing her best friend to death, but she had no choice. As she sat down she did her best to keep her cheeks as open as possible, but this was hard to do in her tight jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly she began to apply weight to her butt until she was completely in her seat. Then she relaxed, but was still worried about her friend. Amanda noticed Grace's odd behavior, but didn't bother to ask. She figured Grace probably was suffering from hemorhhoids and didn't really want to hear about that. Instead, she chatted on about guys she liked and so on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace did her best to seem like she was listening to all this, but she was busy thinking about the inside of her ass. It had been some time since she had felt any movement down there and was getting concerned. It would be some time before she could get to a restroom and check on her friend, so she needed some way to prod Michelle into moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace couldn't help but giggle out loud when she thought of what she would do. Amanda just gave her a weird look for giggling over nothing. \"Sorry, it's a personal joke,\" Grace told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as delicately and quietly as she could, Grace let a puff of foul smelling air escape from her anus. Then she quickly crossed her legs to prevent any of the noxious gas from getting out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer effort was soon rewarded by the frantic struggles of Michelle to escape. Grace gave a sigh of relief. Michelle was still alive and well down there. Amanda still kept chatting away, unaware of what had just happened. \"Good,\" Grace thought to herself. Like all girls, Grace was an expert at keeping her farts a secret. This one proved to be no exception. It was a very soft and silent toot that no one in the world would ever know about except herself, and of course the girl trapped in her crack. It felt wonderful to have such a close friend as Michelle, and she didn't feel embarassed at all to fart next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Michelle was screaming and fighting for all she was worth to escape her best friend's foul smelling ass. Eventually, the terribly gas would subside, but for a few agonizing moments Grace's silent toot became Michelle's entire world...</span></div></div>",

Grace couldn't stop herself from smiling widely as she exited the vehicle. She'd never get tired of this feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda leaves the bus, right behind Grace, sighing slightly to herself. She'd spoken to Grace a few times before...they didn't know each other all that well, but she could tell something about today was different. Grace was usually a little bit more responsive when they spoke...As the bus pulls away, Amanda watches Grace head off to the school's entrance, no other students in sight. She hadn't thought to ask Grace why it was that she was late, but she could find out in class. Before even taking her first step, Amanda spots a glinting on the sidewalk...a little ring...was it Grace's? Amanda crouched down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace, lost in the teasing, ticklish suffering of her butt buddy climbed the steps to the school's doors, then pulled one open, turning with it to hold it for Amanda. She may have been too preoccupied with more...personal business to pay much attention to Amanda, but Grace was still a fairly polite girl. Frowning, she saw Amanda still at the sidewalk, bent down, tying her shoes. Grace blinked, and let the door close as her hand slapped down to her jeans pocket, where a small hole was.

Then she wiggled it in just a bit to both tease and torment her friend. She giggled quietly to herself and then began to open her textbook and prepare herself for the boring hour that would follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hour plodded along as slowly as it always did, but Grace got through it a little better than other days by focusing on her ass and wondering what it was like for her friend to be in such a warm cozy place.

Then with deadly precision, she let another soft toot escape her anus and then went back to her school work, savoring the struggle which followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, unexpectedly, the struggling stopped. Even worse, Grace could no longer feel her friend at all! Her eyes went wide with fear. Had Michelle just passed away? How could she live with herself if she had killed her best friend? She needed to think of something and fast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer heart beat loudly as she tried to get her friend to move with another fart. She had to push hard, but this time it was far from silent. This time it was loud and sounded kinda wet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace blushed with embarrassment and looked around to see if anyone else had heard what she had just done. She was dismayed to see that the 2 students closest to her were staring at her with a disgusted look on their faces. With her own face now red with shame, she got out of her seat and then excused herself to the ladies room.

Farting, that loud, in class! Great. The last thing in the world she needed right now. Sighing she let her jeans fall to the floor as she wriggled out of her panties, pulling them down to her knees and sitting on the toilet, to look at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing. No Michelle, nothing. Her face paled. Michelle, somehow, had shrunken again. Gulping, she stood, reaching down to her butt and trying to feel for her best friend, though she stopped before her finger actually touched her hole. If her best friend had shrunken again, it was possibl that she had become stuck to Grace's anus, adhered to the moist flesh. Touching it would mean smearing Michelle in to it. In fact, Michelle could be anywhere at the moment...she could have fallen to the toilet seat, IN to the toilet bowl...or she could be in Grace's panties, too small to be seen...Grace almost cried, having no clue what to do. Listening to the bathroom outside, she bit her lip, holding back tears. She'd been having fun...too much fun, obviously...she hadn't meant for this. Pushing the stall door open, she carefully stepped, her pants and panties around her ankles, to the sink, where a large mirror rested on the wall. Kicking out of her sneakers, the only thing she was wearing below her waist being her socks now, Grace got on her knees on the bathroom counter, turning around and pulling her cheeks apart, so that she could look at her asshole in the mirror.

Her body was bruised up from being squished inside her friend's cheeks, and her clothing and hair were all full of Grace's sweat and fecal matter.

It didn't make any sense...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace pulled up the friendship locket that she always wore, and opened it up. Inside was a picture of Michelle, who was her best friend. \"I would love to let you live up in my ass forever, but I think you are too small now and it has become too dangerous, so until I find a way to grow you bigger, you'll have to live in here,\" Grace said, ironically placing her best friend against her own picture inside the locket.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ugh, Grace looked over her shoulder, it was Eve. There was no love lost between the two; or perhaps there was too much love lost. Until last year, Grace and Eve were best friends, perhaps even closer than Grace and Michelle. There had a been tensions for some months though, as Eve felt Grace had changed since they were kids: Grace took and took and never seemed to give anything back. It was like they were in an abusive relationship or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all came to a head one day when Eve told Grace that she thought she was selfish and manipulative to an almost psychopathic extent. She seemed to treat her friends like she wanted slaves more than companions. Eve was right of course, but Grace was indeed too self-involved to see the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome bitter thoughts crossed through Grace's head as she leaned towards Eve and opened the gas tap with a silent, warm fart. Considering how far she'd already gone with her current supposed best friend Michelle, she certainly wouldn't care if her 'worst enemy'  was the one shrunken to the size of a dust mite within the folds of her anus, perhaps to be reduced to a miniscule smear of guts if she let a particularly powerful fart loose. The thought was quite cathartic in fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lesson proceeded quite steadily with a couple of more small farts from Grace. She was feeling quite bloated today and had left home in a rush so hadn't taken a morning shit, though she quite needed to. As the bell rung she discreetly observed Eve from the corner of her eye. She had actually shrunken quite a bit. Normally the tallest girl in the class, and 4 inches taller than Grace, she looked like she might be even shorter already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve had noticed something wrong too. Her body felt heavy and her head light; she held a hand to her forehead to sense if she had a fever, but couldn't feel much. Still unaware of her height change, she thought she was just a bit disoriented. Uneasily, and somewhat queasily she left the room and made her way to the nearest girl's bathroom. It was a small, rarely used, two-cubicle bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Eve's unwellness went unnoticed by most, Grace was well aware - far more so than Eve - of what was happening.

She'd been dislodged from her position on her now gigantic best friend's tongue, and slammed against her wet, quivering throat. Whether it had been reflexive, or (she could never believe it) Grace's intent, Michelle was swallowed, pulled in to the cramped, mucusy tunnel of Grace's esophagus, the fleshy, moist walls squeezing her as the muscles forced her down in to the pit of the humongous girl's stomach, to be digested as if she were nothing more than a bite of food. A nibble. Squeezed through the tight, muscular ring, Michelle's body was bombarded by intense heat and her nostrils filled with the horrible scent of Grace's gastric juices and digestive acids. Landing on her stomach in a mound of chewed, half-digested food, soaking in acid and Grace's saliva, Michelle nearly pukes, trying to get to her feet and failing, slipping in the wet pile of mush that was her best friend's breakfast. Scrambled eggs? A bowl of cereal? Michelle couldn't even tell what the warm, moist, substance she was half embedded in was, her clothes matted with saliva, and digesting food, bits of it in her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Grace jerked the overhead cord to stop the bus, holding her stomach with one hand, the other over her mouth to keep herself from throwing up then and there, as she rushes off of the bus. Though the bus driver gives her an odd look, and the other passengers watch, perplexed, they continue on anyway, Grace falling to her knees in the grass of some stranger's yard. She had swallowed her best friend...a human being...the girl she'd known since first grade. Played dress up and dollies with...the girl she'd gone on double dates with, introduced to boys, and been introduced to boys by. The companion and closest girlfriend that Grace had spent countless weekend nights with, painting each other's nails, doing each other's hair....tears welled up in her eyes. She didn't know anything about the digestive process. Was Michelle already gone? Burned and eaten up by her stomach, an organ with a simple objective, indifferent to the shrunken soul's suffering? Was she agonizing inside of Grace's tummy, just on the other side of her little belly button, flesh peeling from her bones? Or was she alright? Safe and sound, the acids not yet reaching her? Grace had to try...had to try something.</span></div></div>",

There was no way she was going to abandon a good friend to such a terrible - and unusual - fate.  Heroically, she managed to pass even the school bus due to a string of red lights, and it had just arrived at the school when she opened the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFunny thing about doors.<br>\r\nThe act of opening a door has been studied in numerous scientific reports, and the data suggest that opening a door has a detrimental effect on short-term memory.  The second Grace opened that door, she forgot about her friend's crisis.  She eventually remembered, of course, but by then it was already noon.  Even the most optimistic person would have given up by then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turns out she was right - by then, puking would be ineffectual - but for the wrong reason.  The stomach acid wasn't a problem; Michelle was immune and actually would have been able to swim in it if the desire overtook her.  Puking would have been ineffective because, around nine fifteen, Michelle had taken the customary route.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that the force of gravity would be of no help trying to exit the way she came, Michelle opted to follow her friend's digestive track to its logical conclusion.  As she moved, she realized that, although the smell was horrible and the fumes were making her woozy, the acids themselves weren't affecting her at all.  The reasons eluded her, but she wasn't about to look a gift horse in the mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she reached her destination, the smell only got worse.  Just ahead was the final chamber - her friend's anus.  Bracing herself, she crawled down, and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...wait a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle noticed a carving on the inside of Grace's rectum.  She was no expert, but she was pretty sure most people didn't have carved recta.  It was a symbol that seemed vaguely familiar.  Of course - it was also on the ring!  What this meant - and the implications - were beyond her scope.  Suffice it to say there was more to this mystery than met the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am now going to ask three questions - questions which anyone in this situation (which is to say, no one) should have already asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Who created the ring?<br>\r\n-Why was it left there?<br>\r\n-What does the symbol mean?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are of course more questions, but, sadly, they must remain unanswered for now.  The reason is that Michelle has also noticed a small slip of paper next to the symbol which answers one of those questions.  Which question does it answer?</span></div></div>",

This doesn't mean I'll be running around going, \"SORRY, NEEDS MORE BEWBS.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>What I Like</b><br>\r\nAss<br>\r\nFeet<br>\r\nPussy<br>\r\nVore<br>\r\nGirl/guy<br>\r\nGirl/girl<br>\r\nCoherent writing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>What I Dislike</b><br>\r\nGuy/guy<br>\r\nGuy/girl<br>\r\nPoor writing<br>\r\nSudden inexplicable changes<br>\r\nCharacters acting unrealistically<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, just because I dislike something doesn't mean I will automatically take action against it. If the story eventually progresses to a point where interaction with a giant male occurs, I will allow it. Something I won't tolerate is horrid, sobering posts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'th grl picsk you up &amp; eats you whole THE EDN'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI will get mad. It's not a pretty picture, I DON'T LIKE DOING IT.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thing. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE read and remember the chapters leading up to your addition, should you choose to contribute. It's a hassle for me to have to go through and double check everything to make sure Grace, or any other character, is wearing what they were two chapters ago, has the same amount of money, carrying their cell phone, and so on....it's a pain in the ass to baby-sit fictional people, and the last thing you want is for your work to be tampered with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace is a somewhat popular eighth grade girl. Average height for her age, sandy blonde hair that comes down just to her shoulder blades, and a pair of beautiful green eyes. She's not chubby, but not scrawny, just right. She likes some sports, manages to get decent grades in school, and loves hanging out with her friends. She isn't actively pursuing any guys, though that isn't to say there aren't a few she wouldn't mind being held by. One morning, shortly before the school bus arrives, Grace experiences an interesting change.<br>\r\n</td>",
