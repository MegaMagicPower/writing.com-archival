The last thing she remembered was being hit by a spell from a Magikoopa and blacking out. She looked around at her surroundings and let out a sigh. \"Captured again...\" She took a look around and saw that the cell she was being kept in was fully furnished, with various flowers and gifts scattered about. \"Same old dungeon... I'm so tired of this.\" Peach got up off of the bed and walked over to the bars and set her head on the side. \"I wish I could jus-eeeeaaaahhh!\" The Mushroom Kingdom Princess cried out as she felt herself being squeezed through the bars of the prison cell! But they were much too close together for her to fit through. She gasped as she looked at her midsection. While the rest of her body seemed normal, her chest was squeezed tight by the bars! \"W-what's going on?\" Peach maneuvered herself through the prison bars further until she had squeezed all the way out. Her body collapsed as she tried to stand on her now noodle-like legs, but they soon reformed and she was able to stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to me?\", Peach asked herself as she stared at her hands. The princess pulled on her fingers and found that they stretched out, and snapped back as she let go, as if she were made of some sort of putty material. \"It must have been that magikoopa's spell...\" She looked back and forth to see if there were any guards. If there were any, it seemed that they weren't anywhere nearby. \"Whatever's happened to me, I'll have to figure it out later. I've got to use this chance to escape!\" Peach ran as fast and as quietly as she could, trying her best to avoid detection. Bowser's minions were swarming the castle, and she considered herself to be extremely lucky to have remained unseen for so long. Finally, she reached a warp pipe. She wasn't sure where it led, but with the alternative being tossed back into the dungeon, she didn't have much of a choice. The princess picked up her dress and dashed as fast as she could toward the warp pipe...</span></div></div>",

It's always Peach. I dunno why the Drybones got ahold of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, are you planning on letting me go?\", Daisy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah. I mean, Lord Bowser hasn't seemed really interested in Sarasaland, but knowing we have you might change his mind. And one princess is better than no princesses.\" The goomba waddled away while Daisy fumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great\", Daisy grumbled. \"And I was just bragging to Peach how I never get kidnapped. What am I supposed to do now?\" The Sarasaland Princess looked down at her cot and got an idea. She soon folded up the cot and wedged it in between two of the bars and tried to pry them open... and found that they broke quite easily. She should have been glad to be freed so soon, but she was more annoyed as she looked at the bars. \"Wow. They really picked the worst cell to keep me in, huh?\" Daisy lifted her dress and ran down the hall. \"I remember seeing a warp pipe somewhere...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You! Stop right there, Princess!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy looked behind her and yelped as she saw a Magikoopa right on her tail. \"Give me a break...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm warning you! Return to your cell now, or I'll be forced to use my newest spell!\", the Magikoopa screeched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not happening!\", the Sarasaland Princess called back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine! Since you're not the Princess we're after anyway, there's no reason to hold back!\" The Magikoopa raised his wand, gathering energy before unleashing a powerful burst of magic!<br>\r\nDaisy didn't even make it to the warp pipe before she was hit full-force by the spell! She screamed as she was flung forward, slamming straight into the wall... and being squashed completely flat upon impact! She let out a muffled groan before she slowly peeled off. The Sarasaland Princess then fluttered to the ground, looking like a comical print out of Daisy, her tongue stuck out cartoonishly as she landed.<br>\r\n\"Now stay there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Magikoopa began to slowly walk forward, Daisy quickly regained her senses and looked over. Panicking, she quickly managed to regain her form and ran over to the pipe and jumped inside! As she went deeper into the warp pipe, her mind was racing. \"What did that Magikoopa do to me?\", she thought to herself. \"Whatever it was, I'll have to figure it out later. My first priority should be getting back home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo quick was Daisy's decision to jump in the pipe, that she didn't stop and think of where it would take her.<br>\r\nWhere does the princess of the oft-forgotten kingdom end up?</span></div></div>",

Her pupils narrowed as she saw several go-karts, bikes, and ATVs speeding toward her! She didn't even manage a scream before she was run over! In her newly malleable state, she was instantly pancaked, and crushed even further as the one kart was followed by another, and another still! The Sarasaland Princess was repeatedly flattened until practically every racer had run over her, leaving her as a splatter on the ground, multiple tire tracks running across her form. \"Ughhhhhh...\" Daisy groaned as she lied there, unable to get up on her own power. Just as she managed to regain her senses, she was pulled out of her daze once she heard the racers approaching once again. \"Th-they're coming back?!\", she whimpered. \"I gotta get out of here! ...somehow...\" Daisy tried as best as she could to move her splattered body, but found it was quite difficult. Just as one of the racers neared her, she managed to peel a corner of herself off... just in time to get run over again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, though, she was peeled off the ground and wrapped around the racer's wheel. Daisy screamed as she was repeatedly run over until the Princess' form was flung off of the tire and into the air. In her flattened state, she floated in the air for a bit, being carried by the wind as it blew. As she regained her bearings, she was finally able to see where she was...</span></div></div>",

She had been kidnapped by some of Bowser's less intelligent minions, having mistaken her for Peach. Unwilling to release her, but not sure of what to do with her, they simply tossed her into one of the lower dungeon levels and took away her wand. \"If I could just reach it...\", the cosmic princess grunted, \"I'd be out of here in no time!\" Her star wand was sat on a shelf along with several vials and magical items. She stretched her hand out as much as she could, finally reaching her wand... only for her to fall forward, out of her cell with a THUD!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof...\" Rosalina rubbed her chin as she slowly stood up from the stone floor. She smiled and held up her star wand. \"At least I'm out of that cell... and I got my wand ba-\" The space princess was cut off as a vial fell over and broke over her head, the contents splashing down over her. \"Eyuck! What is this stuff?\", she retched as she tried to wipe the liquid and broken glass out of her hair. As she tried to get the fluid out, she found that it quickly soaked into her body. She found that the glass dug into her fingers as she tried to brush it out. \"Oh no... No worries, I'll just patch myself up when I get to the observatory.\" As she tried to pluck it out, however, Rosalina would find that her skin stretched along with it like chewed up bubblegum! \"Wh-what is this?\", the cosmic princess asked herself. She began to stretch other parts of her body, quickly discovering that her entire body was now squishy and malleable! \"What did this stuff do to me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard a crash come from over here!\", a gruff voice called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no\", the maternal space princess exclaimed. \"I don't have time to dwell on this. I have to get out of here now!\" Rosalina closed her eyes and waved her wand... however, nothing happened this time. \"H-huh?!\" The princess looked down and saw that the star on her wand was dim. Her eyes widened as she began to uncharacteristically panic as Rosalina rapidly began to tap her wand on her hand as Bowser's minions drew closer. \"Why is it not working?!\", she cried before the star on the end began to glow once again. \"Thank the stars... Now get me out of here!\" She closed her eyes again and waved her wand once more, the cosmic princess disappearing in a ball of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for her, the vial that splashed onto her also affected her wand, and she wouldn't be returning to the observatory... at least not yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does the space princess end up first?</span></div></div>",
