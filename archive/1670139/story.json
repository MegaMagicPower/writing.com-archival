He turned around and smiled with a devilish smirk. \"You are in deep shit Mr. Jackson.\" His teacher seemed to have finally stopped growing at about a pitiful inch. \"You better watch out bitch! I feel like crushing you like a miserable bug asshole.\" He was getting excited with this new found power over his teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Jackson yelled up at him, \"Return me to normal, you horrible little boy.

You'd better try and hide fucker!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Jackson continued berating Stephan. That is, until Stephan lifted his leg up high and then crashed his foot onto the tiled ground so loudly that it hurt the tiny man's ears. Mr. Jackson held his hands over his ears.

Stephan stopped and banged his hands on his chest, Grooooowwwwwllllll, \"Watch out - the deadly Stephanzilla is going to fuck you up!\" The teacher ran to try and hide under the desk. Unfortunately for him, Stephan easily caught up to him. </span></div></div>",

The teacher had given up on his attempts to give out at Stephan after the realisation of the situation hit him. Stephan at his massive heigh could crush a buildings as the shrunken teacher gazed to the heavens between Stephans \u00a0legs as they rose high into the air like skyscrapers. *BOOM!* Stephen stomped his foot extremely close to Mr Jackson that resulting in the teacher on his back in fear as a devious smile rose across Stephan's. Face of Mr. Jackson was white with shear and utter fear as the building sized shoe landed only metres to him. It reacted of sweat and other foot odours but that was the least of the shrunk teachers worries. \"I could crush you like a little bug under my shoe\" Stephan explained, \"But that will be no fun killing you...just yet\" Stephan then slipped his sweat socked foot and pinned the teacher under his big toe. He wasn't applying any real pressure but the shear size and strength of toe trapped the shrunken teacher underneath. \"Please stop! Your going to kill me! Aaaaaahhhhhhhh!!!!! Help!!!\" Mr Jackson gasped as the thick cotton covered his view and was fighting agains an enormous enemy. \"Your my slave now!\" Stephan started to put slight pressure under Mr Jackson start gaged under the weight. \"Isn't that right?\" Stephan said, he was enjoying himself so much the feeling of the his 'slave' \u00a0under his toes felt so good! All this power was Stephan's and nobody else's! \"You are Stephan\" A faith shout from below. Stephen then released his foot as once more looked fully up to his masters face. \" Yes SLAVE!\" Stephan gloated. He knelt down making himself look bigger and more intimating.

He gazed out the hole as he could hear Stephen evil menacing laughter of dread boom and echo in the vast cavern that was this 13 year old boys well worn runner. The light suddenly eclipse as he huge set of ties rolled into the shoe causing a sudden panic as Mr.Jackson raced to the end of the shoe but was rapidly caught up with the toes thus throwing him the the tip of the shoe compressed between the thick leather and the damp salty cotton that layered his toes and foot. \u00a0A wiggle of Stephen toes caused more pain to the teacher as he was shifted up then down in the shoe. Then the worst part, Stephen started to walk to his next class with the miniature teacher incased in a sweaty prison of salty and rank odours and complete darkness and fear. He could have used his powers todo Much more but enjoyed the squirming and futile struggling his tiny teacher had to over as he screamed for attention and tried to escaped his leathery prison. The thick cotton fibres before him recked of serious sweat as they where drenched with it, he doubted Stephen had changed his these socks for a few days! He was in pain but the whole fear of dying under giant brats toes produced vast amounts of adrenaline as his eyes tried to gain clarity. He violently coughed and gagged as the shoe was beginning to heat up as Stephen took off in a quick walk to his next class tossing the poor teacher violent up and down like dining mixing a bowl of salad. He screamed in pain and fear despritly for help, to get noticed but his small little voice didn't even reach out side of Stephen massive runner as he took his seat for another boring class the earthquake like movements stopped as another class begins..\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0 Meanwhile back in reality of normal had take Math next. \"What a drag\" he said. He entered the room to stop the class that had already begun as his teacher paused on his entrance but did nothing about him as he had givin up with Stephen years ago. As he as he took the furthest seat from the top of the class room. Lying casually at the back mess with a pencil and wiggling his toes causing a sweaty hell for Mr. Jackson he looked up to see the board filled with numbers as Mr.Lucy droned on and on.

Stephan climbed down and strolled lazily across the exposed soil. His keen eyes picked out a small object sitting exactly at the center of the rectangle. He reached the little thing and stood over it, positioning himself so that he had one foot on either side of it.

The school faculty and teachers also discussed the same topic as there still was no sign of the principle. The students where delighted with the lateness of there principle as 20mins had surely arose as the teachers started to grow inpatient with there boss after all they had classes to teach!\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a sudden rumble and the concert wall of the entire school shock like it had been hit by an earthquake.

They opened the emergency doors as the escaped the large complex until to be be greeted with a black leather school shoe that towered high above anything they had ever seen and it's sheer dimensions making the school the mere size of a gain of sand. High above the sight aren't everyones spines chilling as the glee filled face of Stephen miles above titanically gazed over the teeny school that lay between the two gigantic shoes of the \"boy-god\".

Tears \u00a0rolled down many peoples eyes as various people prayed to various gods as the sky went black. Stephens shoe could flatten large cities with ease and this mere grain of cement, steel and human was no exception as he dangled his foot for a few seconds,imagining the happening underneath \u00a0it. He shifted his pressure as the shoe hit the brown soils underneath as he rubbed the shoe back and forth like stepping on a cigarette butt.

All the people who bored or annoyed him, anybody who caught his eye, all completely in his power!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen an idea suddenly popped into his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All the people...\" he murmured with a sly grin on his face. \"I wonder exactly how many people I could shrink down and capture, just by thinking about it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen? A hundred? A thousand? More!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he continued to daydream his thoughts returned to one of his earlier classes: a particularly boring one on geography and economics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect! I know exactly how to liven things up!\" he smirked. Then he concentrated and snapped his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly Stephan was back in that earlier class, sitting on his own at a desk at the back of the room. He looked around, but nobody seemed to have noticed anything unusual. His new god-like powers had brought him back without any disruption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just as boring as the first time he sat through it. The teacher was droning on about New York and its role as a economic and tourist center, how many people lived and worked there, and blah, blah, blah...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo instead of listening to the man's useless speech Stephen held his hand out in front of him and concentrated...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * * * * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inhabitants of New York were going about their lives as usual when there was a sudden rumbling sound and the ground began to shake. Before they could react properly there was a flash of light. As it faded they realised that the sun and sky had disappeared, to be replaced by a featureless grey expanse countless miles above them. The light now seemed to be coming from long glowing strips stretching along this strange expanse, but they were simply too far away to be seen clearly. Before they could speculate further another impossibly huge shape rose above the skyline, blocking everything from view. As the shadow fell over the city millions of people started screaming....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * * * * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephan smiled as he looked down at his hand. It was no longer empty. There, in the middle of his palm was a teeny grey and silver shape, no more than an inch across. He brought the little thing up to his face for a closer inspection. It was incredibly tiny, but he could make out intricate little patterns running across its surface like grids. There were even a couple of minute strands of blue to be seen. Stephan glanced up and compared those patterns with the map of the city that was on display at the front of the class. It was a perfect match. His plan had worked. He now had the city of New York and its millions of inhabitants cupped in the palm of his hand!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to meet your new God,\" he whispered. His clear blue eyes glittered with excitement.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The teacher has a larger audience than he could possibly imagine!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I've got you all to myself,\" the boy sneered down at the terrified inhabitants. \"I could crush you...\" - he starts to close his hand around the micro-city, causing huge chunks of land and entire neighbourhoods around the edges to break apart and crumble, falling down into the deep canyons that are the lines running across his palm - \"...or I can keep you as slaves. Or maybe snacks.\" The boy licked his lips dramatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut instead the boy-god contented himself with merely picking up a pencil and using it to start poking at the tiny city. Everything he touched with the pencil tip was obliterated: houses, office blocks, roads and bridges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, you microbes sure don't know how to build properly. Look how fragile all your stuff is\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephan held the teeny tiny city up to his lips and blew gently on it. A stream of barely visible particles of dust drifted over the edge of his hand to fall down onto the desk or onto his crotch. They were crowds of microscopic people, thousands of them, along with their vehicles and homes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, I guess you can't handle high winds either. Hope you know how to deal with floods\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy started gathering a ball of saliva ready to drop down onto the miniaturized city, but before he could do so - <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STEPHAN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the teacher. He'd finally noticed that Stephan had other things on his mind. The other kids all turned round in their chairs to look at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher smirked arrogantly at him, always ready to humiliate any student who tried to fool around in class, and spoke to him with exaggerated politeness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Stephan, perhaps you'd like to share with the rest of the class exactly what you think is more deserving of your attention than today's lesson?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn previous occasions Stephan might have given a surly and reluctant response, but not today!

He'd been expecting a more insolent reply from the teenage troublemaker, but his response suggested he was actually showing some kind of interest in the lesson for once. Still, he couldn't let Stephan get the better of him in front of the other kids, <i>and what was he holding in his hand anyway?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeliberately making his tone sound as patronising as possible the teacher answered:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Stephan, I'm sure we'd all love to take a trip out to the city to see the sights and enjoy ourselves, but you know full well that the school doesn't have the money or resources to send a whole class to New York just because one kid thinks it might be a good idea.\" He chuckled and the rest of the class laughed obediently along with him. \"Now, what is that you've got in your hand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of blushing with embarrassment as the teacher had intended Stephan grinned broadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, this little thing? Oh, it's nothing much. I just thought that if it was too difficult for us to go to New York, then maybe I should bring the city here instead.\" The thirteen-year-old looked down at the terrified little metropolis with a look of amusement. \"I thought you said it was supposed to be a really big city. It looks pretty teeny to me. I could probably squash the whole thing under my thumb.\" Still smiling, Stephan looked back up at the teacher, waiting to see his reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, it was the teacher's face that started to flush, first from confusion, then with anger. Just what was this dumb kid playing at? He peered more closely at the tiny object that Stephan was holding out for him to see. It was irregularly-shaped, ragged around the edges like it had been ripped out of something larger, but there was something about it.... It was almost too small to notice but was one shape that looked almost like Manhattan.... and that minute speck of green - it was in just the right place to be Central Park! It couldn't be... the boy had to be playing some kind of joke on him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephan smiled again. \"Maybe you should take a closer look. Hey, why don't you show the rest of the class around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the teacher had a chance to respond the boy had snapped his fingers. There was a brief flash and he found himself standing somewhere completely different. Completely disorientated, he looked around and saw the rest of the class nearby looking similarly dazed. Stephan, however, was nowhere to be found. Then the teacher looked up and gasped in surprise: they were standing on Liberty Island, at the base of the Statue of Liberty! However, something was badly wrong: the statue appeared to be damaged, with chunks missing and cracks running across its surface. The water around the island was unsually turbulent, almost as though it was draining away somewhere. He could even see a large cargo vessel being pulled along helplessly by the current. All around the city he could see damage. The skyline had been reshaped, and there was a huge groove running through the middle off into the distance, as though some colossal object had touched down and scraped a line through the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden rumble of thunder and a blast of hot wind caught his attention and sent the students into a panic. The teacher looked up to see Stephan's face smiling down on him! He was simply <i>colossal</i>! The teacher couldn't even begin to guess how big he must be, but from a comparison of the tallest skyscrapers with the size of the boy's lips he had the uncomfortable feeling that the entire city could be casually placed inside the teenager's mouth like a small piece of candy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another rumble of thunder: it was Stephan laughing. Then the boy spoke, his voice almost deafening in its volume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, I told you I'd bring New York to you! Guess it's too bad I had to shrink you down to fit you inside it, but I have to say it's pretty awesome being able to hold an entire city in my hand like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher didn't reply. Instead he felt his legs turning to jelly with utter fear. He thought about just how tiny that \"thing\" in Stephan's hand had been. Definitely no bigger than an inch across, maybe even smaller... And that little trinket had been New York!? His throat tightened up as he tried to imagine all the people who lived in that city, how tiny they must now be. How tiny <i>he</i> must be! Millions of humans, reduced in an instant to microscopic scale! And this boy, Stephan the troublemaker, was now like a god to them! He could do anything...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy-god spoke again: \"I think we should continue the lesson now. Maybe things will be a bit more interesting! What was it you were talking about? Tourism and economy? Which one shall we choose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Gods are capricious - especially ones that are 13-year-old kids - and Stephan had already changed his mind about what he was going to do with what was now the tiniest city on Earth. Perhaps he would invite his friends round later, but for now the teenage megalomaniac planned to give his captives a special guided tour of their new home - his bedroom!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn theory Stephan could have used his new powers to transport himself home with a mere snap of his fingers, but he wanted to take the opportunity to humiliate his pets further so he strolled along the corridor to where his locker was situated.

A couple of seconds later the bullies found themselves standing in the vast expanse of the corridor floor, staring up at a pair of towering sneakers. Stephan scooped up the two terrified half-inch tall boys and handed them to the dork, telling him: \"Here, do whatever you want with them. Crush them; eat them; feed them to your goldfish; anything you like. But if you tell anybody else what happened then you'll find yourself ending up the same way...\" The dork didn't need to be told twice. He flashed Stephan a shy smile of gratitude and wonder, then scampered off down the corridor, dropping the two tiny jocks into his pocket as he went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally alone, the boy-god opened his locker and took out his sports bag. He'd had a gym class earlier and his kit was inside. It was a particularly warm day and the exercise had taken its inevitable toll: as Stephan unzipped the bag the smell of perspiration and stale running shoes rose like a cloud of pollution from a poorly-maintained power station. Taking the teeny city of New York between his thumb and forefinger he carefully placed it deep inside one of the sneakers. \"That should keep you safe - at least for now\" he muttered with satisfaction. Then it occurred to him to stuff something into the opening of the sneaker, just for extra \"protection\". He picked up a sock - and then had a better idea. Apart from the shoes the main source of the aroma was his white sports shirt with its two dark, telltale stains of moisture under the armpits. Stephan folded the shirt so that one of the stains was outermost and then pushed it into the opening of the sneaker contained the city. Already cowering in the near-darkness of the footwear, the surviving population could only watch in terror and disgust as the sweat-drenched fabric, covering an area far larger than the entire city, descended and came to rest almost touching the tops of the skyscrapers. As the temperature and humidity quickly rose to unbearable levels the bag was zipped shut; the metropolis was rocked by earthquakes as the sports bag was lifted up and casually slung over the boy's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPausing briefly to crush underfoot a teacher who challenged him for leaving without a pass, Stephan walked out of the school and slowly made his way home. Much to his satisfaction he soon noticed the people around him talking in shocked tones about the sudden mysterious disappearance of New York. Passing by an electrical store he noticed the television sets in the window were all displaying the breaking news, with aerial images of the barren landscape where an entire city had once stood. Stephan could hardly keep from laughing at the thought of how the missing city was closer than anybody could imagine: he had <i>millions </i>of people inside his sports bag, now his own personal playthings, just inches away from the rest of the world. He could hardly wait to get home to toy with them all...</span></div></div>",

Inside the sneakers and socks he was wearing, his feet felt like he had walked through a puddle and the water had soaked through his shoes and into his socks. This was not the case however, he was simply dripping wet with perspiration, worse than he was in gym. But through the soaking wet bangs of his hair that were over his eyes, Stephan could see his house, his mom and dad weren't home this early of course, plus it was Friday, so he had all day, and the entire weekend to experience his new status as Stephan: God of NYC.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he entered through the door with his house key, Stephan sighed and entered the cool air conditioned house. Stephan stood in front of the AC, holding his arms above his head and allowing the cold air to blow his hot pits off. Though by doing this he made himself aware of the pungent odor he was now giving off after his long walk. \"Meh, oh well....I'll take a shower later.\" The young god said to himself as he picked up his bag and bounded upstairs to his messy room, locking his bedroom door behind him and making sure to close the blinds on the window after turning on the light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now...lets get down to business.\" Stephan chuckled as he unzipped the bag, pulling out the sneaker with the moist shirt hanging out of it. He pulled the garment out and peered inside with his enormous eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people inside were coughing from the mixed reek of armpit smell and built up foot odor, and when the shirt was removed and replaced with Stephan's eye they all screamed in terror and some began pleading. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephan looked in upon the pleading New York and chuckled darkly, \"Yeah...I like being begged, keep doing that! And maybe I won't put the shoe on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll together, a chorus of voices began pleading in different ways, many of them falling to their knees as if in prayer to the giant thirteen year old. This made the boy's ego swell, he actually had an entire city in his shoe and at his mercy, they were begging him to let them out of his smelly shoe! Stephan finally decided to take them out, and put them to work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephan reached inside the shoe with his thumb and index finger, plucking out the tiny city and placing it on the carpet as he sat high above on his bed. \"Now you puny insects, I've got a job for you!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Stephan paused for a moment, allowing the suspense to build. He knew the entire population must be wondering just what a 13-year old boy could possibly want with a city the size of a single M&amp;M candy. He loved how puny and helpless the tiny metropolis appeared, resting on the giant carpet fibers; it occurred to him that by his captives' scale his room would seem like an entire new world, mysterious and filled with danger. Not just New York, but the entire U.S. could easily fit on the floor of his bedroom like some kind of bizarre model set. \"Maybe later.\" he snickered to himself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled off one sneaker and carelessly let it drop down perilously close to the city. New York was shaken by the titanic impacts as it bounced slightly and came to rest, all too close. Another couple of centimeters and it might have rolled over them.... A few seconds later the other sneaker plunged from the heavens, landing even closer than the first. So close, in fact, that one of the dirt-smeared laces was flung outwards, almost hitting the city and finally settling down almost against its edge. The microscopic population was once more reminded of how truly minute they had become by the sight of the miles-wide lace towering above the skyline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe terror wasn't over. Now Stephan began to remove his socks, one by one. They were so drenched in sweat that he had to <i>peel</i> each one slowly away from his foot. Then they two were casually tossed away, these impossibly huge objects landing in a messy pile that rose higher than any mountain next to the teeny metropolis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... that's so much better,\" exclaimed Stephan, flexing his toes with delight. His feet felt able to breathe now. However, there were some annoying little patches of lint and fluff left stuck to his skin and the boy knew exactly how to deal with them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again New York was filled with the sound of screams as the thirteen-year old's hand descended from above to grab them. The world's most famous city was just a toy, pinched between his thumb and forefinger, as he effortlessly picked it up and held it next to his big toe. Thunder rumbled above them as the city's newest deity spoke his commands:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen up microbes: it's hot and my feet need attention. I guess I could just take a shower, but somehow I don't think you'd survive very long if I took you in there with me!\" Cruel laughter echoed through the heavens, and millions of people cringed. New York was not much bigger than a drop of water on its own; nobody wanted to imagine just how colossal and powerful a shower might be...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Stephan continued: \"So what you're going to do is remove all of the crud from on my feet and under my nails. If you succeed then I may reward you. If not.... I may have to reconsider whether you are worthy of a god such as me.\" To demonstrate his point Stephan increased the pressure of his fingertips very, very slightly, making the city shake and groan. It was clear to everybody that all he had to do was rub his finger and thumb together gently and the centuries-old city would be ground into dust in a fraction of a second - just a little smudge of dirt on his skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephan set the tiny city down on the nail of his big toe: New York was now resting on what seemed to be a huge flat plateau. The edges of the city were heavily damaged from where the metropolis had been torn away from the landscape; countless cars, homes, and people had already fallen off to become lost on Stephan's desk at school; in the grooves running across the palm of his hand; under his fingernails; on his clothing. Like grains of sand (though infinitely smaller), microscopic people were now scattered all over his body. As he absently ran his hand through his hair, another ten or twenty thousand were transferred onto his scalp... Nevertheless, those remaining in the city worked to form impromptu ramps down on the surface of Stephan's toenail; nobody had yet come up with any idea how to move any of the mountain-sized piece of lint, assuming they could even reach them. The miasma of Stephan's feet was almost unbearable, and his skin, glistening with sweat, presented a treacherous, sticky trap...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephan, settled himself down in his chair, took out his DS, and began playing. He knew the New Yorkers had no chance of fulfilling his commands, but he wanted some time to relax and think up some suitable punishments for them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Stephan finished the game he was playing and snapped shut the DS. It was time to turn his attention to even more pleasant matters. Roughly half an hour had passed and he wanted to check up on the progress of his new, microscopic slaves. He glanced down at his bare foot and smiled at the small grey smudge resting in the middle of the nail of his big toe. Anyone else would have mistaken it for a smear of dirt, but of course it was actually one of the world\u2019s largest and most important cities\u2014reduced to an utterly minute scale, along with the many millions of people who lived in it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking care not to dislodge the helpless little thing, Stephan leaned back in his chair and eased his foot up onto the desk in front of him so he could get a better look. He didn\u2019t really need one, but for effect he clicked his fingers and a magnifying glass appeared on the desk. The boy picked it up and held it over his nail. Millions of people looked up to see an immense glass shape appear above them, and through it a single eye loomed terrifyingly large, magnified to an overwhelming scale. New York was just a mote by comparison...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephan inspected his toenail. The metropolis still appeared so tiny, even when magnified, but he could see now the incredible detail of its layout: countless streets and roads; neighbourhoods and city blocks; skyscrapers and homes. A populated area miles across\u2014compressed into a tiny little patch, smaller than a boy's nail. Next to it was something even tinier: an incredibly faint line, even thinner than a human hair, stretching from the edge of the city to the back of his nail, where a teeny little speck of coloured fluff was stuck. The line was a whole convoy of trucks and construction vehicles. They were so minuscule that they could scarcely be seen, even with the magnifying glass, but there were so many of them that they appeared as a tiny dark thread, stretching out over a distance of at least five miles. Clearly they were heading out to move the speck of lint, but it was simply too immense for them. Stephan chuckled at their futile struggles and decided to help them out. He pursed his lips and blew softly on the lint. It immediately flew off and disappeared somewhere down on the floor. Unfortunately the sudden gust of wind, more powerful than any hurricane, also blew away most of the convoy. Hundreds of trucks and cranes, most of them weighing well over 10 tons at least, were simply carried off like particles of dust. As for the rest... Stephan licked his fingertip and touched it to the patch of nail next to the city. The remaining vehicles and people were instantly snatched up in the powerful adhesive and carried miles into the air. The 13-year old studied his fingertip with the magnifying glass, taking note of the minute dots that had now appeared\u2014and then he lazily stuck his finger into his mouth and sucked it clean...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSO!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe accusation echoed through the world-sized region. It hardly seemed conceivable that this colossal space was nothing more than a teenager\u2019s messy bedroom, carefully locked so its occupant could have some privacy while playing with his toys...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt seems even that modest task was beyond you. I guess I\u2019ll have to punish you after all. Now what would be most appropriate?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephan made a show of pondering the question, even though he already knew exactly what he intended. He wanted to make things as humiliating as possible for the city and its populace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen my dog was a puppy and left a mess we had to train him to stop by rubbing his nose in it. I guess I\u2019ll have to do something similar with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again the Hand of the Boy-God descended and picked the tiny city as if it was just a little trinket. He placed it carefully in the palm of his left hand: an even larger expanse than the toenail, but covered in large hills and deep valleys. Then with his right hand he reached down and wiped a particularly juicy piece of crud from between his big toe and the next. He compared the piece of toe-jam with the shrunken city of New York: it was actually bigger! Snickering with satisfaction the boy slowly and deliberately lowered his finger towards the helpless city...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people of New York could only look up in terror as the finger descended towards them. In a matter of seconds, the piece of toe-jam filled the entire sky above. They could smell its scent washing over them; they could feel its moist humidity enveloping them like a clammy hand. Closer and closer it came, until it finally reached the tops of the highest skyscrapers. The tall buildings began to sway and crumble under the immense pressure...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephan casually began to rub the little piece of crud into the city. He could feel the slight sensation of the city being crushed beneath his fingertip. He was hardly even exerting any pressure, but New York was just so tiny and fragile! He gently stirred the toe-jam some more, mixing it in with the remains of the once-mighty city. The remains of skyscrapers, city blocks and parkland became deeply embedded in the smelly, sticky mass. Millions of microscopic people were now mixed in with it, scarcely more than germs or bacteria. The tiny city had been completely crushed and absorbed by an ordinary piece of toe-jam on the end of a 13-year old boy\u2019s finger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven now, Stephan\u2019s punishment was incomplete. He was still hot and sweaty from the heat of the day, and his t-shirt was clinging uncomfortably to his skin. Wiping the speck of crud onto his knee for a moment, he pulled off the drenched t-shirt and tossed it aside. Stephan snickered: the best part was yet to come. He collected the now-populated toe-jam once more and lifted up his arm, exposing one armpit. He took a careful sniff: it was ripe with body-odor and glistening with sweat. The boy lifted up the piece of crud and wiped it slowly across the surface of his armpit, using it almost like a sponge to soak up every droplet of sweat. Soon the piece of toe-jam had been reduced to an even more soggy, saturated mass; many of the tiny people were drowned, but there were still millions left in the drenched wreckage of New York, trying desperately to survive in the horrific conditions of the boy\u2019s armpit, terrified at what might happen to them next...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Any remaining people in his armpit were left unnoticed or uncared for by Stephan as he put his arm down and they were either crushed or smothered. Stephan stared at the miniscule blob stuck to the tip of his finger, knowing he had no more use for NYC now that it was rendered down to a soggy microscopic ball of crud and sweat, this thirteen year old god of size found himself bored with it. Regardless of whether he had the godly powers to undo what he'd done by turning back time for the city, or even snap his fingers and cause the city and all its inhabitants to be placed back where the landmass had been before. Stephan then got a devious, although it would be considered disgusting to anyone other than a young mischievous boy, idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a word, the young god of size opened his mouth and popped the tip of his finger into his mouth, there was so much crud and sweat coating the tiny city, that that was most of what he got as he sloshed the microbes and remaining buildings around his mouth. Still, the satisfaction of what he was doing made the taste not as bad as it would have been normally. Tilting his head back, Stephan swallowed mightily, sighing as he felt a few specks of crud and maybe some people get washed down his throat, he burped proudly and laughed evilly. \"That settles that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephan turned on the news, people were still flustered over how New York had just vanished. Feeling in the mood to tease the mere mortals a bit, Stephan snapped his fingers just as the reporter was in the gap left by the missing NYC. Without a sound, the city reappeared, seemingly right on top of the reporter! Stephan laughed so hard tears streamed down his face, the look on the news anchors faces were priceless! What was best was that he'd made sure that the people had no memory of where they'd been! As Stephan wiped a few tears away from his cheek, he got another idea, he put on his shoes, socks and shirt and stepped outside into the fading daylight. </span></div></div>",

As he expanded parked cars crumpled against his sneakers and passers-by fled in panic. The teenage titan kept a check on his progress by comparing the size of his foot with the main school building, and once he had reached the point where the school could fit completely beneath the sole of one shoe Stephan brought his growth to a halt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe peered down into the little wrecked classroom far below. He could just make out the figures of his teacher and former classmates gazing up in fear and disbelief. Slowly and deliberately, like a parody of a cheesy monster horror movie, Stephan raised one mighty foot and and brought it over the tiny school, casting it into deep shadow. Then, equally ponderously, the foot descended...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the fragile concrete and brickwork began to collapse under the immense pressure the main door was flung open and his former classmates\u2014the only ones with sufficient warning to escape in time\u2014began to spill out into the road. Stephan laughed at the sight and put his full weight down on the school. He heard a slight *crack* as the hated institution was obliterated, followed by a faint cunching sound as he pivoted his foot back and forth, grinding the debris deep into the treads of his sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile the group of survivors had begun running down the street, desperate to get as far from the giant as possible. Stephan\u2019s other foot abruptly slammed down in front of them, halting their progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot so fast, guys! I haven\u2019t finished with you yet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy-god inspected the group with an expression of scorn. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to do, I suppose. You were the only ones to get out in time so I guess you must be the strongest and fastest. Survival of the fittest, after all!\u201d Stephan paused for a moment to let his words sink in and then continued. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not going to squish you\u2014yet\u2014provided you do what I tell you. I have something special in mind!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant troublemaker held out one hand and a small glass vial appeared in his palm. He placed it open on the ground and commanded the tiny class to step inside. However, when the teacher moved to follow his students into the gigantic container Stephan quickly pinched him between his fingers and lifted him high into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>You</i>, on the other hand, are pretty worthless.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephan watched the tiny man squirm helplessly between his thumb and forefinger. He'd hated his Engish teacher ever since the man had humiliated him in front of the rest of the class for reading the wrong chapter for homework by mistake. The young giant\u2019s eyes glittered with malice and the teacher began to shrink, tinier and tinier, until he was nothing more than a minute speck trying not to fall into the canyon-deep whorls on Stephan\u2019s index finger. It was entirely fitting, considering the man had once tried to belittle him, that <i>he</i> should be made to feel as small as possible in front of the others. Stephan watched him struggle for a moment\u2014and then casually dropped him inside the vial along with the students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titan screwed the lid on the vial, then brought it up to his face to look inside. A couple of his former classmates were yelling and beating their fists against the thick transparent plastic; however, most of the others were now fighting over who got to play with the minuscule, terrified teacher.

If crushing one building could be so awesome, what would it be like to crush hundreds of similar buildings at the same time? In order to do that, Stephen would have to get bigger. Much bigger. But before he grew any further, he needed to decide which city he should target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe city of New York (or what was left of it) was slowly dissolving in his stomach acid, so crushing that under foot wasn't an option. Fortunately, there was no shortage of other cities all over the world, but because Stephen was a god, he wouldn't settle for just any city. It had to be the biggest and the best. \"Tokyo!\" Stephen exclaimed as he vanished, much to the bewilderment of onlookers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same moment, thousands of miles away, thousands of Japanese found the sun had suddenly been blocked out by an enormous object. As they turned their heads up to see what this was, they began to scream in terror at the sight of a 1000ft American boy grinning down at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephen was still the same height as he was before he had teleported, but even so he had teleported on top of several apartment buildings and had instantly snuffed out the lives of hundreds of Japanese men, women, and children beneath the soles of his sneakers. Even this many deaths was a great tragedy, but unfortunately for the people of Japan things were about to get much, much worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephen began wriggling his sweaty toes within his musty old sneakers in delight as he felt the souls of the Japanese people he had crushed become imprisoned for eternity within the sweaty stench of his soles. This was a horrible after life that was worse than any hell that anyone could possibly imagine, but Stephen was a god and he loved to imprison souls within his soles. He was about to send millions more to this horrible smelly fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTokyo was Stephen's target because he was familiar with the Godzilla movies and would often fantasize about what it would be like to be a giant monster attacking Japan. Now he was living this dream, and it felt wonderful. Stephen also learned in school that Tokyo was the world's largest city with over 34 million people. So when it came to cities there was no greater prize in the entire world than Tokyo Japan. If Stephen could grow large enough to crush Tokyo under his foot, then he could do the same with any other city without breaking a sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the Greater Tokyo Area covers a really massive area, so in order to be able to do this, Stephan will have to get big. REALLY BIG.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Stephan knew what he wanted to do. However, he was already starting to wonder about the potential problems of getting too big on the surface of the planet - or at least until he finally outgrew it completely and could hold the entire globe comfortably in his hands. Fortunately, he was now a god and didn't have to worry about annoying things such as the laws of physics. All that mattered was visualising in his mind precisely what he wanted to happen and the Universe would somehow adapt to satisfy his needs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephan's school lessons hadn't been entirely wasted upon him. He remembered being told how, centuries ago, people had once believed that the world was flat. \"But what if it really was?\" Stephan wondered. And with that thought he exerted his power and the world immediately began to change. A great fissure appeared in the middle of the Pacific Ocean and the lithosphere slowly began to unwrap itself from the rest of the planet, like an orange slowly being unpeeled. The Boy-God's mind kept the surface more or less stable and intact until the process had been completed; when he was done, what had once been the surface of the planet had been transformed into a flat multi-coloured mat or carpet that stretched out all around him. To keep the oceans, atmosphere, or anything else, from spilling out into space mighty barriers around the edges now held everything in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then Stephan began to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched in delight as the world diminished beneath him. Making himself large enough to crush the Greater Tokyo Area was almost pitifully easy and he soon realised this wasn't enough. Stephan moved his feet slightly, first positioning himself so that his feet were either side of the metropolis and the population was forced to look up at the towering pillars of his legs rising up into the heavens, and then shifting his feet out into the shallow pool of water that surrounded Japan as he began to dwarf the nation itself. He used the now-tiny islands to measure his rate of growth, stopping when his feet had reached the same length as Japan. Stephan grinned as he imagined how Godzilla might appear to him now. Japan's favourite monster would be nothing more than an infinitesimally small tick or mite, a micro-organism that could only be examined with the aid of a microscope. And as for the even tinier human race...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelighting in his total power, Stephan slowly raised his right foot and held it suspended above the Japanese islands, allowing them to see and understand what was about to happen. The nation that had so often fantasized about being devastated by gigantic monsters would now have those fantasies fulfilled by a colossal teenage boy. Stephan lowered his foot, pressing down very gently, enjoying the sensation of the tiny nation being compressed beneath his sole, turned into mud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as he looked down at what he had just done he noticed a number of minute sparkles around his ankles, and felt a very faint momentary sensation almost like pins and needles. For a moment he couldn't work out what it might be... but then he squatted down for a closer look and realised: he'd just been nuked! The rest of the world had finally stirred itself to take action against him, combining their forces in an all-out nuclear assault! Stephan almost laughed out loud at the futility of their attempt, but it meant he now had an excuse to punish somebody. Titanic beyond belief, he strode across the now-flat surface of the Earth in the direction of the most likely culprit, the United States of America.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe journey didn't take very long. Stepping gingerly over Africa he crossed the Atlantic in a couple of footsteps and positioned himself next to the narrow isthmus that joined North and South America. Once again the boy contemptuously raised his foot and scuffed it across Panama, separating the North and South forever. Not caring that his punishment would affect Canada and Mexico, as well as a few Central American nations, Stephan prepared to exert his power once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time he decided to play a very old game, the kind of trick that he'd often used when fooling around with friends, and had seen employed in countless holiday photographs. He brought his thumb and forefinger up close to his eye and positioned them so that it seemed from his perspective that all of North America was being held, pinched, between them. He closed his finger and thumb a fraction and the landmass appeared to shrink slightly to fit within the smaller gap. Then he re-focused his gaze and shifted his hand... and suddenly it was no longer just a trick of perspective: <i>he was actually holding North America itself, tiny and helpless, between his thumb and forefinger</i>. Where the mighty continent had once been there was now just a roiling mass of water as the ocean rushed in to fill the space, lowering sea levels everywhere else. But Stephan didn't care: he had his new plaything and it was time to decide what to do with it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His titanic index finger had easy a half a dozen once huge American states like Kansas flatten to dust under it. It was hundreds of miles thick and thousands in length as it was attached to the godly figure of there new God. The few hundred million that the finger had not instantly crushed gazed up to the sky to see the titanic face of stephen glimming with joy at all the havoc he was causing. \"I'M AM YOUR GOD! Stephen boomed once again shacking one of the worlds most powerful nation to its core. How can one 'boy' have so much power! Stephen also thought the same as the puny citizens of the massive country but unlike them he wanted more! \"NUKING PEOPLE ISN'T VERY NICE AMERICA... IM YOUR GOD! AND IT'S TIME RO FACE THE CONSEQUENCES...\" With that Stephen stared hard at the contingent between his grasp and all off a sudden it began to shrink in between his fingers. The rest of the world looked up in awe as the continent hundreds of thousand miles above them shrank away as Stephen showed what was left of humanity who really was in charge here.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmaller and smaller the continent in shrank to the pleasure of Stephen. His towering finger wiping out all of central America as it became less and less to him. He soon was able to balance the once powerful continent on his index finger as he smiled at the power he bestowed. Meanwhile in America there was utter panic as Stephen had become titanic to plain ridiculously Godly! His face now to the still shrinking continent was hundreds of times larger the earth and once major cities like New York had to be measured on sub-atomic levels compared to Stephan now, people where even smaller... \"HAVE YE \u00a0LEARNED YOUR LEASON PUNY AMERICANS THIS WORLD IS MY! YOU ARE MINE! HAHAHAHA! Stephen boomed this time his voice was almost earthquake like as glass broke and alarms went off, people loss balance and old building crumbled.

For the people they looked up into the deep blue eyes that gazed at them. These titanic eye balls where planets within there own right.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Stephan relaxed and played his video game for the next hour or so, occasionally wriggling his feet just to mess with the millions of slaves resting on his toenail. He knew there was no chance they could clean the crud off his feet, but he just loved having them there and knowing they would still try their best to do what he demanded because their lives depended on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Stephan snapped his DS shut and lifted his foot up to his face to inspect the job his slaves had done. Stephan frowned to see that nothing had really happened at all, which was pretty much what he expected. It had taken the city of New York many months to clear the wreckage of the WTC, and that was only just a few buildings. If it took so many months just to clear out a few buildings how could the city possibly clear away gigantic balls of lint and crude which were even larger than the entire city itself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually it could be done, but it might take hundreds or even thousands of years, and Stephan didn't feel like waiting that long even though with his God like powers he probably would be alive that long. Stephan pondered this dilemma for a moment, and then realized he could solve the problem by just speeding up time for the tiny people by a huge amount, so that their entire lifetime would fly by in less than the blink of an eye, and even though they would die of old age, they would give birth to newer generations and these would carry on their parents work and so on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you little microbes.\" roared the continent sized face of Stephan as he loomed over the shrunken city on his toenail. \"I realize an hour is no where near enough time for you to complete the task I have assigned to you, so I have decided to be lenient and give you the next 10,000 years or so to finish the job. The sole purpose for your entire lives is to serve and clean and worship my feet! This will also be the sole purpose of your children, and your children's children, and so on for the rest of eternity, or until I get tired of you. When I wake up for school tomorrow I expect my feet to be fresh and clean, or else!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Stephan turned off the light and hopped into bed. It was still fairly early, but it had been a long and interesting day, and he couldn't wait to see what the millions of people on his toenail had managed to accomplish now that he gave them about 10,000 years of their time to clean off all his foot crud. Stephan then jerked himself off into one of his sweaty socks as he thought about his tiny slaves and servicing his feet, and then fell asleep with a smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the city of New York breaks out into chaos and there is mass suicides as people realize that they will never be returned to normal and must spend the rest of their lives cleaning crude off the smelly foot of a teenage boy. However, many millions decide that even life as a foot slave is better than no life at all and they do not commit suicide. Eventually the chaos settles down, and a new government comes about which brings order and stability to the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first order of business is what to do about food. Before NYC had been shrunken, food had to be shipped in from elsewhere, but now this was no longer possible. Eventually it is decided that they will live by eating the grim, crud, and dead skin cells of their new master. Most people find this idea revolting, but eventually the city's food supply would be exhausted and this is the only way they will survive. It is also decided that Stephan's sweat would have to make due as the city's water supply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually after a few hundred years NYC manages to cope with its new situation, and by now all old religions have been abandoned and forgotten and in their place new religions were founded which worshiped their sleeping god, Stephan. These religions might differ from each other on details and dogma, but they all agree with Stephan being their one and only god. Now, whenever a New Yorker ate his or her meal of crud or fungus they gave thanks to this bountiful feast which their god has so graciously provided to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people of New York also did not forget Stephan's instructions to them that their sole purpose was to clean his feet, and they knew this monumental task could never be finished within their lifetime, so they made it a high priority for every citizen to not only have children, but to have as many children as possible. Every child was born into a life of slavery to serve Stephan's feet. They were baptized in his sweat and indoctrinated in the new religions which taught that they were nothing more than a slave to him. Each of them grew up, labored their entire lives, and eventually died of old age all within the blink of an eye from Stephan's perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new religions taught that it was every man and woman's duty to produce more children, and the government enforced this rule by law. Food was never scarce, so the population exploded. New skyscrapers began to be constructed using Stephan's dead skin cells, and whatever other materials they could find. Eventually the city regained all of the population that had been lost due to Stephan's playing with it earlier in the day, and all of the damaged buildings also were eventually repaired and even expanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the first 1,000 years the city had now quadrupled in size and now covered his entire big toenail. Powerful machines were improvised out of Stephan's skin cells and whatever they could find, and these machines began to clear away the first huge ball of lint. These balls of lint and crude proved to be very valuable in providing materials for the city to grow and expand. This sweat soaked lint which had been part of Stephan's sock was full of dirt and dust and various other debris which were refined and used to create skyscrapers and vehicles to carry out the task Stephan had ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany hours later Stephan wakes up and rubs his eyes. He then remembers the city of New York which had been on his toe and he became excited to see what they had managed to achieve while he had slept. As he raised his foot up to his face his eyes went wide in amazement how the tiny city which was once smaller than a piece of lint was now...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Stephan sat on his bed looking down at the impossibly small city on the floor and smirked. He wanted to think of something extra special for his first worshipers. Sitting watching the barely visible movements in the city, he was getting a raging hard on. In his daydreaming of scenarios he reached down and casually scratched a tiny itch in his boxers when it came to him. Could he do it? How limitless were his powers? He wanted to find out and he had the most devilish plan. Reaching down he carefully picked the entire city up in his fingers and held it in front of his face. He leaned back on his bed and with his free hand pulled down his clothes until he was naked from the waist down. He slowly lowered the city till it was directly above his crotch and he concentrated. A flash and the city was gone from his hand. In a moment Stephan began to panic that he messed up and lost the tiny city all together. That is....until he felt a tickle down in his crotch. With a shaky hand he reached down and gently rustled his pubic hairs apart until he saw something that made his heart jump. Down below he saw the tops of tiny little skyscrapers poking out from between the spread hairs in his fingers. He shot his hand into the night stand drawer and noisily searched for his magnifying glass. Finding it he gently spread his hairs and with a slightly shaky hand focused his view through the glass. There, among his patch of hair was New York City! The tiny landscape went from the shrunken land mass to the buildings, sidewalks, cars and people now grounded to his flesh. The occasional tickle he felt was the flea sized cars driving around his sensitive skin where the streets used to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Frustrated with the looking glass he looked at the big screen TV across the room and concentrated. The TV made a buzz and came on. As the screen adjusted it was a much closer look at the city that was now engulfed in his pubic hair. With a much clearer view he could see the little cars speeding around on the expanse of pink flesh as tiny little people panicked in the streets. All while dodging the mighty stalks of his pubes that shot upwards like giant redwoods. There were a few car accidents that had slammed into the base of some of the pubes with little billows of smoke wafting up from them. So small that the smoke didn't even go high enough to leave the forest of hair. As he consciously moved his view around the tiny city, marveling at the bustling goings on of the flea inhabitants, a dark shadow fell across the area like nightfall. Stephan realized it was his celestial cock that was looming overhead like a god's dick would. Angling his view skyward, he could make out the silhouette of the massive organ obscured by the twisting and tangles hair canopy. Stephan looked down at his cock from his point of view and it was slowly throbbing above his patch of hair with the tip with the beginnings of precum leakage. He was loving this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Back down in the city, people were running everywhere. First they had the entire city somehow transported to the palm of a teen boy.... the next thing they knew they were lost in a dense forest. One boy, a young teen named Kenny walked around among the panicking, trying to make sense of it all. He stepped off the front entrance of his favorite coffee shop and onto some new surface where the sidewalk and street used to be. It was an odd shade of light pink and almost leathery. He walked out and toward one of the strange shafts jutting up from the ground high into the air. They seemed to appear out of no where, and were the cause of much destruction in their sudden emergence. Cars were slammed into them... buildings were partially demolished. They were everywhere and they rose far above the skyscrapers. Walking to the one before him he saw a group of people struggling to free a man from his damaged car that had hit it broad side with his SUV. As they freed the disheveled man Kenny noticed the huge black stalk was unscathed. Stepping closer he stepped carefully around the raised and slightly sunken rim that surrounded the base of the shaft. He could see that it must go much farther underground a ways. It was wide... and black in color. Laying a hand on the surface revealed it was very solid and heavy that it couldn't be budged in the slightest. What were they and why were there so many of them? As far as the eye could see throughout the city they were everywhere. The huge metropolis was under the shaded canopy of all these shafts. Shafts that, after a certain random height, took on crazy angles and bends on their way up into the sky. Kenny knelt down and examined the ground where it came up from. There was a slight space between the shaft and the ground before it angled and went flush with the jutting structure. A space just big enough for his hand, so he reached down as far as his fingers could reach. It met the hard trunk and could go no further. If this was some sort of ground....maybe he could dig down into it. Kenny began to scrape his nails and fingers down into the crevice trying to unearth what he could....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Stephan sat in awe at himself as his cock loomed over the helpless tiny city. He could feel things crawling in his pubes like tiny, tiny fleas and it filled him with arousal....knowing they were people. Honest to god people. People....and cars...and buses...and-....wait....what was that? Stephan felt a new sensation from somewhere down in his lush forest. It was a tiny little tickle. Like something was nibbling on him. Or scraping. It was amazing! He sat and revelled in the feeling that was a mixture of a tickle and a flea bite. His new godlike powers must enhance his senses for him to feel something that miniscule to effect him like this. His God dick go even stiffer and began to dribble precum from the tip as he bit his lip. He wanted so badly to rake his nails into the hair and please himself. But not doing it served him more pleasure so he let it continue. A droplet of precum made a lazy strand downward slowly into the patch of pubes as he enjoyed every movement the tiny people were giving him....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Kenny felt the shadow cross over him and he looked above to see a massive....thing! He didn't know what it was...as did anyone else who also felt the darkness wash over them. As they looked up a massive amount of something crept towards them all! As it hit shafts on the way down it almost looked like it was going to stop. But the sheer amount of it pushed on and crashed into the pink ground engulfing some in it's substance!</span></div></div>",

He laid the ruler across his palm, almost touching the little city... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe microscopic population could only pray as they saw the vast object, seemingly hundreds of miles in length, descend from the sky in the grip of a gigantic thumb and forefinger. At first they thought it was going to flatten them, but the object finally came to rest somewhere between five and ten miles away from the edge of the city. Even that distance was too close for comfort: although nearly flat by Stephan's scale the cheap plastic ruler seemed so huge to the tiny New Yorkers that it rose higher than any mountain above the skyscrapers. They could see clearly how the white plastic surface was pitted and scarred with scratches that would normally be invisible to the naked eye. They could also see the widely-spaced black measuring lines stretching off into the distance along the length of the ruler. If that wasn't humiliating enough, they realised with shock that the entire city of New York was <i>less than the width</i> of a single one of those black lines!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephan lined up the marks on the ruler with the minuscule speck that was the shrunken city. He felt a thrill of satisfaction and excitement as he saw that the city was so tiny that he could no longer get an accurate measurement: it was certainly no more than a 10th of a millimeter across at most! The teenager wondered what he might do next with the helpless little city...</span></div></div>",

He'd reduced New York to such a tiny size that he guessed that parts of it might even have survived: skycrapers, city blocks, even whole neighbourhoods might have been pressed into the relative safety of the vast canyons that were the shallow grooves running across his toes. It pleased the boy to imagine scattered groups of microscopic survivors living as parasites on his body - at least until he took a shower, or the titanic globules of sweat simply washed them away... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a kid his age, whose body was already awash with hormones, the ability to abduct and change the size of anybody or anything he wanted was overwhelming. His already healthy ego swelled to godlike proportions. Stephan was already thinking about who he could shrink next. Having the power of life or death over millions had been pretty cool: maybe he'd shrink a few more cities and keep them in his bedroom. He could keep the micro-populations as slaves, worshippers, pets... or even snacks. Caught up in his megalomaniacal fantasies, the boy made his way to his next class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScience was actually one of his favorite classes. The teacher was just as much an asshole as all the rest, but they were currently studying astronomy and Stephan had always liked thinking about the stars and planets. <i>\"Ha! I bet they'd make great toys!\"</i> he thought to himself. Some more interesting possibilities were starting to occur to him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephan lazily entered the science room and slouched down in his usual chair at the back. The teacher was already setting up the stuff for the lesson. As the man looked up and began to speak Stephan ostentatiously pretended to yawn - but his mind was alert and waiting for an opportunity to exert his powers once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good afternoon, class.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The teacher began his lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Galaxies are huge clusters of stars. They come in a variety of shapes, ranging from spirals to irregular clumps. The smallest contain tens of millions of stars, while the largest can have as many as a hundred trillion! We live a medium-sized one that probably consists of two or three billion stars. From here on Earth our galaxy appears as a band stretching across the sky, but according to Greek mythology this was actually a splash of milk from the breast of the goddess Hera - and that is how the galaxy got its game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the rest of the class of adolescents tittered slightly at the mention of the goddess's breast, Stephan sighed. He'd heard all this before and was impatient to get to the good stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher continued: \"Although we see it as just a band of light, this is because we are actually inside the galaxy itself and cannot view it in its entirety. However, I've brought in something special today to illustrate it clearly.\" Stephan snapped back to attention as the teacher picked up a object from his desk. He couldn't see it clearly, but it looked like some kind of glass box, about 12cm on each side, with a tiny white shape inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As part of the National Schools' Science Foundation we've been loaned this exhibit, which is the most accurate model of our galaxy yet created.\" The teacher handed the object to one of the kids at the front so that it could be passed around the class. \"It's a 3D representation of the Milky Way, made using the latest astronomical data. The exact positions of more than 80,000 known stars have been etched inside a block of crystal. What you are holding in your hands right now is pretty much the Milky Way as we know it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the girl in front of him turned round to hand him the crystal Stephan smiled. A whole galaxy in the palm of his hand sounded like exactly what he wanted! He narrowed his eyes and began to concentrate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * * * * * * * * * * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the world it was still night, but among those who were still awake were the legions of astronomers, hard at work studying the heavens while the darkness lasted. They had already been startled by the recent news reporting the mysterious unexplained disappearance of the entire city of New York - but that was as nothing compared to the latest surprise. Without warning the sky lit up! It was as though morning had come, even though it was still the middle of the night... and the sun was not even in the sky! The light was everywhere, waking everybody on the planet, sending them rushing out in to the streets to look up in terror. The moon and the stars had disappeared in the glare; even the sun was all but drowned out by the brightness on what was formerly the \"day\" side of the planet. Astronomers rushed to interpret the latest data from their orbital telescopes, and reports were quickly sent to all the world leaders....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The stars are still there, but... the light seems to be coming from beyond them... we think it's from somewhere outside the galaxy itself! And not just outside it; everywhere around it! Everything beyond that has simply disappeared, apart from what appear almost to be immense reflections that must be thousands or millions of light years across. It's almost as though.... it's almost as though our whole galaxy was inside some kind of impossibly huge glass box!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then the light on one side of the planet was blocked out and a new shape appeared, fillling the sky completely. It was so huge that it took a while for people to actually recognise what it was. And when they did... a wave of hysteria spread across the world. Unbelievably titanic, studying them from beyond the most distant stars was a huge, HUGE eye! From its sheer scale scientists could only speculate that it might be as big as an entire galaxy. Then the eye slowly pulled back revealing more of a giant male face. No existing religion could account for what the population of Earth could now see:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks... it looks like a gigantic teenage boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * * * * * * * * * * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in class one of the kids was asking a question. \"Where exactly are we in the galaxy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher smiled as he answered: \"You've probably noticed that the model of the Milky Way appears to be slightly off-center. That's because it has been designed so that Earth appears to be right at the center of the crystal. Of course, you wouldn't be able to see it anyway: at this scale our entire solar system would be completely microscopic. In fact even the largest stars would be far too tiny to be seen. Remember, that little thing you've been holding in your hands is actually 100,000 light years in diameter!.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill holding the small glass box containing the model, Stephan smirked. Unbeknownst to anybody else, the tiny shape inside the crystal had undergone a subtle transformation. The previously sharp pinpricks of the laser etching had been replaced by even tinier flickers of light, glowing softly. And there were now more of them. Many more. Several billion, in fact. Stephan peered closer and tapped gently on the glass, studying the cluster of tiny specks with amusement. They were utterly minute. It was hard to believe that each one was an actual living microscopic star system. And they were all his - every one of them! Nobody yet realised it, but Stephan had used his powers to replace the model galaxy with a real one. An exact living copy of the Milky Way and everything in it - <i>including a fully populated planet Earth!</i> - that was no bigger than his palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The entire Milky Way was now just a teeny little plaything in his hand...</span></div></div>",

Stephan then brought the cube up to his face and was amazed at the sight of the milky way. Stars that would deaf your sun would be teeny specks to Stephan. All this was so exciting for Stephan.

This \"Boy held over 100000 lightyears in his palm with ease a person that big and powerful had to be a God. They where indeed right Stephan was a God! But was not a kind god.

The universe in fact was so small Stephan's gravitational pull made the Milky Way moveable without destroying the trillion year old galaxy and it's many billions of stars and planets including a teeny earth. Everyone was shock as soon as Stephan opened his grasp on the tiny galaxy to find the Godly face of Stephan unbelievable! Stephan was much closer to the shrunken Galaxy and for Earth Stephan's face was there only view. Stephan was extremely close now and earth was very lucky as each exhale was like a shower of water vapour that quenched whole star systems and the hydraulic power of the force dissolved even the largest of planets.

Stephan made his way to his desk and sat down as the teacher instructed everyone to open their history books to page 130. On that page was a large map of Europe, but the borders of the countries were a little bit different than Europe of today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay class, today we will be learning about the bloodiest war mankind has ever fought.\" said the teacher. \"This war began in Europe in the year 1939, when an evil dictator by the name of Adolf Hitler invaded Poland and set his sights on conquering the entire world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis talk of conquering the entire world didn't help much to relieve Stephen's aching erection as he continued daydreaming about the squashed city of NYC under his sweaty feet, or the billions of stars in his pocket. Stephen already had so many toys to play with, but looking over this map of Europe only made him hungry for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephen decided he could not only give himself millions of more tiny toys to play with, but also do the world a favor at the same time by snatching Nazi Germany right out of the history book and completely erase it from history! This way WW2 would not have to happen at all, and millions of lives would be saved. With a grin on his face, Stephen snapped his fingers and in an instant the map of Europe was permanently altered by the spontaneous disappearance of Nazi Germany.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere right in front of his desk materialized the enormous country of Nazi Germany, except it was no longer quite so enormous as it was now roughly the same size as a dinner plate. Stephen had already shrunken the entire city of New York, but this time he had not only an entire city, but an entire country of slaves! NYC was one city, but Germany was full of many such cities. Stephen began to daydream about what he might do with his new toys. Perhaps he would cut the country into pieces and give an entire city to each of his friends? Or maybe he would just keep it all to himself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMillions of Germans in the year 1939 were going about their daily lives and preparing for the upcoming war with Poland, when all of the sudden the sky changed without warning from a clear blue to a more dull grey. The sun was also mysteriously gone, but instead there were rows of enormous rectangular suns which showered the country of Germany in a bright light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs about 100 million pairs of eyes began to adjust to the new light, they looked up and to their total horror observed the face of a smiling teenage boy of an impossible size!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So preoccupied was Stephan with gloating over his new plaything that he scarcely even noticed the momentary pause in the class. He was oblivious to the fact that the decor of the classroom had subtly altered; that a couple of his classmates had been replaced by entirely different kids; that the hair of the girl sitting in front of him had darkened from light blonde to chestnut brown. He didn\u2019t even care that the teacher had broken off with a confused expression on his face, as though trying to re-capture his train of thought. A moment later the man shrugged in puzzlement and returned to his intended topic of the greatest mystery in human history: the complete disappearance of the German nation in 1939.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did he know that the nation in question was even now laid out on a desk at the back of the class in front of his most troublesome student, miniaturized to an utterly minute scale and completely powerless despite its military build-up. In fact, so small was it that a casual observer would likely have mistaken the tiny nation for nothing more than some kind of novelty mouse mat\u2014just the thing a school kid might own. Lying open on the desk next to the miniaturized landmass was Stephan\u2019s history book, perhaps some 200 miles thick compared to the microscopic Nazis. And inside the textbook, where Germany had once appeared on the map, there was now just a blank space with a dotted outline marking its prior location. The text on the opposite page had also changed and now listed some of the most popular theories for the incredible disappearance of the entire country on the eve of what had been feared at the time to be a potential invasion of Poland. The theories were inevitably vague and unsatisfactory, but one of the more outlandish suggestions caught Stephan\u2019s eye. He thrust his hand into the air, interrupting the teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir! It says here that many people think GOD took Germany. What\u2019s that all about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher was slightly irritated by the interjection, but he figured he might as well answer since it was a rare event for Stephan to show any interest in class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCertain more vocal religious groups have speculated that Germany offended the Lord with its wicked nature and was therefore completely removed from the world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemoved?\u201d asked Stephan innocently and with a slight smile on his face. \u201cYou mean, like God just reached down and grabbed it? Why would he do something like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher frowned slightly at the boy\u2019s simplistic description. \u201cI suppose the Church believes that it was to punish Germany.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow. So he just took a whole country full of people. Like it was nothing. That\u2019s so cool.\u201d Stephan smiled again and glanced briefly down at the country in question. Under the desk his crotch was throbbing from the sight of the \u201ctoy\u201d nation and the casual way in which he had played the part of \u201cGod\u201d. Now he just needed to complete the theory by \"punishing\" it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time the teacher\u2019s frown was clear and unmistakable. \u201c \u2018Cool\u2019 is hardly an appropriate word, Stephan. Remember, thousands of innocent men, women and children vanished along with the Nazi regime. And that\u2019s why this theory is so ridiculous\u2014do you think they also deserved to be punished by God?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephan didn\u2019t bother to answer: he was too busy studying the phenomenal detail of the miniature landmass before him, with its miniscule geography and cities like sprinklings of dust. Those of the microscopic population who were brave enough to look up at the country-sized face of the teenage boy would have noticed a momentary glow in his eyes. Once again there was a slight pause as the world around Stephan reshaped itself to adapt to a slightly different version of history\u2014one in which all the innocent citizens were miraculously transported away to live their lives safely in neighbouring countries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the teacher returned to his lecture Stephan took a stick of glue from his school bag and applied a thin film of adhesive to the blank patch on the map. Then he carefully picked up the tiny country in both hands, doing his best not to crush too much of it beneath his colossal fingertips. It was so light and fragile that he knew it would take barely any pressure to simply snap it in two or grind it into a ball of dirt between his hands\u2014but he had other plans, at least for now. Stephan concentrated instead and began shrinking the little nation once more. This time he deliberately made sure the process was relatively slow so that he could enjoy the sight of the once-huge landmass getting smaller and smaller by the second, and actually feel the sensation of it dwindling in his grasp. Soon Germany was tiny enough to rest on one hand, and by the time Stephan judged it to be small enough for his purposes the entire country was nestling right in the centre of his palm and was barely an inch across at its widest point. He was rock hard from the overwhelming sense of power and the knowledge that he had <i>millions</i> of people in the palm of his hand. Fighting an overwhelming desire to just close his fist around it and crush it he pinched the teeny little nation gingerly between the thumb and forefinger of his other hand, picked it up, and carefully lowered it down onto the page of his textbook, rotating and fitting it neatly within the dotted outline of where Germany\u2014the printed version\u2014had once been. The glue took effect immediately, holding the trillions of tons of abducted continental bedrock in place as though the landmass was as flimsy as a leaf or sticker (which of course it now was). The map of Europe in Stephan\u2019s textbook was complete once more, but now with the actual, real, <i>living</i> Nazi Germany in place of the illustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephan leaned back, highly pleased with his work. Now the Nazis could have all the \u201cLebensraum\u201d they desired and even spread out across the entire page if they wished, while the rest of the world would be spared. It amused the boy-god greatly to imagine the Nazi troops marching into Poland\u2014to find just a vast bare expanse of coloured paper, populated only by micro-organisms. Perhaps that would be the true war for the now-microscopic humans: battling to survive against encroaching microbes and bacteria that threatened to devour them. Stephan liked the idea: it would certainly be more entertaining to study than World War II. He idly probed the inside of one nostril with his pinky finger and then carelessly wiped it on the map next to the German border, leaving a faintly glistening smear of mucus ready for the armies to blunder into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Stephan wasn\u2019t known for his lengthy attention span and wasn\u2019t sure if he could really be bothered to  continue playing with them. There were surely other toys to find...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In no time, thousands of war planes took off into the air with the intention of bombing and firing at the teenage boy. But the planes were so minusculy insignificant that even a mote of dust was colossal huge in comparison. Stephen wouldn't even have been able to see them with a magnifying glass, and was unaware of their imminent attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut long before the planes could climb the hundreds of miles necessary to even reach his face, Stephen took a breath and within the blink of an eye the thousands of planes and their crews were sucked up and into his nostrils at an impossible speed. Some of the planes crashed and exploded against his nose hairs, or the interior of his nostrils, while others were \"fortunate\" enough to have a cushy landing in Stephan's nasal mucus which kept the pilots alive, but trapped their planes in his boogers. Hundreds of other planes were sucked into the depths of his lungs were they suffered similar fates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Stephen was completely oblivious that he had just inhaled the entire Luftwaffe and had hundreds of screaming pilots trapped helplessly in his lungs and in his boogers. To Stephen this had just been a normal breath and he hadn't put any thought into it, but this seemingly trivial act had just annihilated the German air force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the teacher continued to drone on about Germany and its mysterious disappearance, Stephen was certain that snuffing the country out of existence was the right thing to do. Firstly, it was a fitting punishment for what the Germans had done (or were about to do), and secondly it meant he would never have to be bored about hearing about them ever again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo that end, Stephen used his unlimited god powers and erased Germany and everything associated from Germany out of all existence so that instead of Germany having mysteriously disappeared in 1939, it now no longer existed to begin with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Stephen made this change, the teacher's appearance changed yet again and now instead of English he and all the rest of the class now spoke Latin, and there were countless other changes in the classroom. But most importantly of all, the teacher was no longer droning on about Germany's mysterious disappearance in 1939.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grin on his face Stephen leered down at the tiny stamp-sized nation. \"Now there is just one more thing to get rid of,\" he said.</span></div></div>",

They knew that their already minuscule country had been shrunken even further and placed somewhere, but they did not know exactly where. They could see the enormous face of the teenager looming over them, and this frightened them very much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Hitler was still very much in control of this tiny empire, and he ordered his troops to explore the areas beyond the borders of Germany to see exactly what was going on. From all four corners of Germany the armed forces answered the call, and moved out beyond the borders of their country and \"invading\" the strange territory surrounding them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Stephan or anyone who was normal sized, the pages of the book appeared to be perfectly flat, but to the tiny military it was a strange and uneven landscape made up of bright colored fibers which were each as large as the Autobahn! Little did the Germans know these fibers were actually the pulp of the fiber that made up the map of Europe on which they were now situated, and the bright colors were actually the ink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the west, the German army that was under the command of Erwin Rommel launched a \"Blitzkrieg\" attack through what would have been the Netherlands when the tanks and trucks ran into a strange sticky sea which the troops and machines quickly became bogged down and stuck. Unbeknownst to the German soldiers, this vast sea which covered the entire Netherlands was actually a booger that the giant teenager had carelessly wiped there just moments ago!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThousands of Hitler's most elite troops and best tanks had been stopped cold by a kid's booger! Those who were trapped in the thick sticky mucus screamed and begged for their comrades to help them, but the mucus was 100 times stickier than super glue and the men who were trapped could not be saved. Many were lucky enough to just simply be stuck, but others slowly sunk into it as if it were quicksand and there they drowned to death in a country sized booger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, this wasn't even the worst of it. Unbeknownst to Stephan the booger he had just wiped was full of millions of microscopic organisms which had lived inside of his nose, but were now wrecking havoc on Rommel's army! Each of these Amoeba like microbes was as large as a tank and these massive creatures swarmed over the helpless Germans and swallowed them up like prey. The overpowered Germans fired back with their rifles and machine guns, and some even attempted to bayonet the large amoebas, but all of this had little effect. Only Rommel's tanks with their large explosive shells were effective against the booger amoebas and a massive battle ensued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRommel radioed in to headquarters and called in air support, which showed up minutes later and divebombed the Amoebas into oblivion. Instead of staying around and suffering more casualties, Rommel went against Hitler's orders and ordered his men to retreat back to the relative safety of Germany.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*********<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Stephan had been completely oblivious to the epic battle which had just taken place on his booger. He debated slamming the book shut and just squashing the entire German race into oblivion, but decided that would be a huge waste when he could have a lot more fun with them instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his huge eyes looked over the map of Europe, he realized that aside from his booger there wasn't really anyone for his new toys to play with. Then he remembered the really microscopic city of New York which he had put in his shoe earlier. \"I wonder how they are doing?\" Stephan whispered softly to himself so his teacher and classmates wouldn't over hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching under his desk, Stephan carefully peeled off his sweaty sneaker and peeked inside the dark smelly cave. \"Is anyone still alive in there?\" he said. \"I have some new friends for you to play with! Would you like to meet them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was two ways Stephan could go about introducing the city of New York and the country of Nazi Germany to one another.

However, instead of just recreating the WWII exactly the way it happened, he decided it might be more interesting to make a mix of times. WWII Germany vs nowadays New York. So, without giving it a second thought, he made the tiny city of NY appear on his book. He scaled it to about 2/5'' in size, so the tinies would all be the same size and the war would be more even. Even as it was a whole country against just one city, NY would be obviously much more advanced in technology, so it should make up for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*********<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Hitler and the Nazis found out that there was an American city nearby, they didn't hesitate to invade it. Sending the whole army against it, they swiftly began to destroy it even more. The last few survivors from Stephan's shoe ran in panic for their lives, trying to hide from the foot soldiers that patrolled the city looking for Americans, while also trying to avoid the bombing from the <i>Stuka </i>planes and the <i>Panzer </i> tanks. It wasn't looking good at all for the former biggest city in the world, and soon enough, the entire Nazi army was already inside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*********<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephen couldn't see what was going on in the micro-war, but he could only assume it was awesome. However, after a few minutes, he started to think about how the war might actually be going. NY was nearly destroyed by his shoe, and the Germans were already ready for war, so they most likely took the Americans off guard. He realized that the war on his desk was clearly one-sided. He couldn't allow that, especially since he was also American. He couldn't let Germany win.<br>\r\nAt first, he was tempted to simply lower his thumb and flatten Germany completely, but he quickly dismissed the thought. It'd be too fast, too easy, and too boring. So, instead, he decided to give the Americans a good edge in the war to help them prevail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephen didn't want anyone else to know about his micro-scale war, so he could only use the dimensions of his own desk. Still, it would be more than enough. With just a thought, he expanded NY city's dimensions to match those of his desk, covering it completely. By then, Germany was only a mere fraction of the American city, located completely inside it. The teenage boy grinned down at his desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see how you deal with this now, you little shitty Nazis.\", he whispered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*********<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when everything seemed lost for New York, the entire city and the Americans inside started to expand. Of course, as everything in it grew, to the perspective of the people in there it seemed as if it was the Germans who were shrinking. Everyone was very confused and shocked at first, as the sudden change of scenery took them all by surprise. However, being used to the continous size changing that the teenager did, it didn't take long to them to understand the whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Germans immediately realized that things would get much more difficult for them. Even as they utterly outnumbered the Americans, each one of the Newyorkers stood over 300' in height. This meant that each one of them would take a lot of their firepower to take down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Americans, on the other hand, felt immediately relieved to see the Germans suddenly \"shrink\" to just over 1 inch in height. Since the whole size-changing craziness started, this was the first time that things started favoring them. Looking around at the floor, they could see that the diminutive Germans were just as confused as they were. But the Nazis' confusion turned to worry, while the Americans' one turned to joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow would things go from then?</span></div></div>",

Many buildings had been reduced to rubble, and thousands if not millions of people had been killed. To make  matters worse, when the city finally did escape from the stinky shoe and the people found themselves in the light of day, they were immediately attacked by a vast army of Germans from WW2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though New York had the benefit of modern technology, there were very few soldiers in the city and very few weapons with which to fight back. Aside from the NYPD and Gangs there was no one in the city who could fight back against the invading Germans, so most people fled to their homes or simply surrendered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Nazis quickly began to round up all Black, Hispanic, Jewish, and Asian citizens and began to march them back to Germany where they would be put in concentration camps and used as slave labor before eventually being killed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, before this could happen things suddenly changed and the city of New York as well as all of its people began to grow and grow, and as the city grew it began to swallow up the entire country of Germany. To the Americans it seemed as if the Germans were shrinking, but in reality they were exactly the same size and it was the Americans who had grown until each American towered over the Germans like a skyscraper, and the Skyscrapers of New York were the size of cities, and New York itself was like a continent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thousands of Black, Hispanic, Jewish, and Asian Americans who were being marched off into Germany suddenly found themselves towering like Gullivers over a vast landscape full of tiny buildings, Farmlands, roads, and people. The German soldiers who had been marching them at gunpoint were now the size of insects, and their puny weapons were now barely capable of even hurting them, let alone killing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing this, the American prisoners stopped marching and began to fight back. They didn't have any weapons, but because they were hundreds of feet tall they didn't even need any. The tiny German soldiers screamed in terror and began firing their weapons to no effect as the vast shadows of American shoes fell over them before squishing them deep into the ground. Even kids were so large that hundreds of Germans could be wiped out with a single stomp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Being boy and girl, they had recently just been separated from each other, in order to be taken to concentration camps. Then, all of a sudden, their entire surroundings started to diminish in size. Buildings, trees, and even the soldiers aiming at them, all got smaller and smaller fast. Before they could realize what was going on, Sarah and Jake, along with some other Americans, were now surrounded by hundreds of bug-sized Germans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first ones to react were the Germans, as they were the more startled ones by the change of scenario. Seeing their hostages suddenly shoot up to the sky made them realize immediately how threatening they could be now. So, without giving it a second thought, they started attacking the giant Jews.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne problem the Germans quickly found themselves into was the lack of powerful weapons. Not only were the military technology much less advanced at the time, but these soldiers were only taking unarmed hostages to concentration camps, which meant that their weapons were reduced to a few weak hand guns, like Walther P38 or Luger P08 pistols. However, they didn't have much choice, so they opened fire at the giant Americans, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah and Jake, along with the rest of the Americans around, stared down for a few seconds at the tiny Germans attacking them. Jake was wearing jeans and sneakers, so the diminutive bullets weren't even felt by him. Sarah, on the other hand, was wearing shorts and sandals, so the pelting of Nazi bullets against her skin were surely noticed, even if they only felt like sparklers sparkles when they're held close to someone's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the initial shock, both siblings reacted. Jake, being a teenage boy, immediately fought back against the Germans. Stamping on them as if he was standing on an ant hill, he used both his huge sneakers to attack his former captors. Seeing their attacks do nothing against him only encouraged Jake to continue fighting the people who were about to murder him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah, on the other hand, was just as angry, but her reaction was different. The tiny bullets tickled her feet and ankles, but she was in no mood of laughing. Annoyed by the constant tickling of the German weapons, she stamp on them a couple of times, to at least decrease the amount of tickling on her feet. But instead of staying to fight, as her brother did, she immediately thought about the concentration camps they were about to be sent to, and about all the Jews already held captive there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitating, Sarah stepped over the ring of soldiers surrounding her and proceeded towards the nearby concentration camps, intending to release as many Jews as possible before they were killed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich sibling do we follow now?</span></div></div>",

However, before they could even start taking them back to internment in Germany, right there, in the city's streets, their prisoners soon started to grow in size. And not just them, but the buildings, cars, and everything else around them. Still aiming their guns at the expanding Americans, they soon had to back away to avoid being bulldozed by the expanding motion of their captives' feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter just a couple of minutes, every American had grown to just over 300' in height. The German soldiers were still aiming their guns at them, but they weren't sure what to do next. There was a moment of tension, as everyone in the city was still trying to overcome the surprise. The tension, however, was broken by a few Americans shifting their feet, which startled the already jumpy Germans, who started to fire their guns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis immediately got the giants' attention, who, startled at first, a few seconds later were simply amused. The men couldn't even feel the almost microscopic bullets pelting against their pants and shoes, while the women (only the ones who wore open shoes and skirts or shorts) could barely feel tickles on their bare skin. The Germans, even after seeing how inefective their attacks were, kept firing at the massive Americans, not knowing what else to do. Some of them immediately started calling for back up, but most of them just kept emptying their guns on the giants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pointless German attack was suddenly halted by the Newyorkers' reaction. After a few minutes of watching, amused, as the Nazi soldiers tried in vain to hurt them, American men, women, and even kids started the counter-attack. Some of them crouched or bent down and tried to grab handfuls of tiny German soldiers, while others, too angry to keep toying them, simply started attacking them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Germans, of course, started to panic. Some kept fighting, while others simply tried to escape. The Americans, on the other hand, started to split into two groups. One, trying to go find Hitler and teach him and Germany a lesson, while the other stayed there and simply kept toying with the Germans, as they waited for Panzer and Stuka backup.</span></div></div>",

HELLLPP!!!\u201d People right along the side being used to flick a planet around screamed. Flesh-colored lines filled the sky as the world rolled in a crazy direction. The city of Stockholm ceased to exist. Nothing remained but a crater 100 miles across and 5 miles deep. On the rebound, the entire chain of Hawaiian islands were crushed into the Pacific Ocean. Then there was a \u2018Panama Canal\u2019 from Nicaragua to Columbia. Probably no people died when the center of Australia was hit, but the continent now had a mountain range over 50 miles tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephen couldn\u2019t even tell that his play caused any damage. He merely giggled \u201cFun little toy! I could just do this all day! Earth was only grape-sized so there was quite a bit of room in the youngster\u2019s palm. He didn\u2019t know how many times he flicked the planet about, but finally Stephen got bored, pinched the Earth between thumb and forefinger and held it up to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat eye must be as big as the world!\u201d a stunned Bangkok resident declared.

In fact, Stephan\u2019s keen eyes had already noticed something going on outside the window. A group of older kids were playing softball, and that gave Stephan a great idea...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Planet Earth and the seven billion people (more or less) living on it were transported into Stephan\u2019s waiting palm. This time the tiny planet was enclosed within a transparent protective shield: the boy wanted to make sure the population survived for as long as possible. Nevertheless, while a good proportion of the southern hemisphere was saved from being crushed against Stephan\u2019s palm, it was still cast into utter darkness, while the countries in the north could only look up at their new god\u2019s face smirking down at them. Mass hysteria gripped the planet as it began to dawn on the miniaturized human race where they now were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey didn\u2019t have to worry about it for long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Earth abruptly vanished from Stephan\u2019s palm... only to reappear in the grip of another, even bigger titan: the pitcher of the softball match. A fraction of a second later the tiny Earth was launched into the air and send flying towards the waiting bat. If the batter was aware that the previously white softball had changed to a mixture of blue, green and white he certainly didn\u2019t have time to react, except by instinct. He hit the \u201cball\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*THWACK*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny Earth was instantly obliterated by the force of the bat, exploding in a messy shower of dirt, water, and minute blobs of semi-solid magma. The shocked kids crowded round the debris in confusion, poking at the fragments with their toes, unaware they were crushing the shattered remains of entire continents beneath their sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephan laughed uproariously at the sight, totally loving the prank he had just played on an entire inhabited world. It made him all the more eager to experiment further.<br>\r\nThe rest of the afternoon was nothing less than a living hell for the human race\u2014at least that \u201ccopy\u201d of the human race that Stephan had brought into being to be his personal toy. The boy-god brought them back again and again at a variety of different sizes, only to be destroyed in some cruel and inventive manner. Not only that, he also arranged for the memory of each catastrophe to carry over: the human race was fully aware of every punishment that had been inflicted upon them while remaining utterly powerless to prevent the next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next couple of hours Stephan dropped the tiny planet into a beaker of acid and watched it slowly dissolve; he used a pen to scrawl \u201cI AM GOD\u201d across several continents, crushing everything underneath; he used a straw to suck up all the oceans... and then finished by sucking up the atmosphere (and much of the population) too. After that last little game he decided to experiment further by turning the Earth into a ball of candy, with a soft strawberry filling replacing the core. He popped the teeny planet inside his mouth and sucked on it thoughtfully. Of course the population died almost instantly, but Stephan was more interested in savouring the unique flavours of the continents as they were abraded away by his tongue and dissolved in his saliva. To his disappointment the planet felt surprisingly bland beneath his taste-buds. He\u2019d hoped to enjoy the fragile textures of the mountain ranges and ocean trenches, but sadly even the tallest mountains on Earth were so microscopically tiny by comparison to the boy-god that the Earth might as well have been a highly-polished pool ball, completely without discernible features. Oh well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a punishment for that disappointment the Earth\u2019s next destination was inside the mouth of one of Stephan\u2019s buddies. Mike was busy scarfing down a bag of M&amp;Ms and it took but a casual flick of the fingers for the planet to rematerialize inside the bag. Stephan then watched as Mike tipped the remainder of the bag into his mouth and smiled in satisfaction as the teeny Earth rolled between Mike\u2019s teeth and was crushed a moment later beneath a gigantic molar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephan brought the games to a conclusion by wandering into another Geography class. He wasn\u2019t really supposed to be there, but who was there who could stop him? Moreover, the teacher, Mr. Wheezely, was a short-sighted old dinosaur who was counting the days until retirement. And his desk was an ordinary classroom globe, of the kind that were used in schools everywhere...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA boy sitting at the back of the class was unexpectedly reduced to half a millimeter in size right where he sat and Stephan slid into his place, crushing the tiny mite without a second thought. Instead, the boy-god focused his attention on the globe and was rewarded a moment later by a slight gasp and low murmurings from the rest of the class. Now the actual planet Earth rested on the teacher\u2019s desk, with a metal bar, thousands of miles long, punched right through the poles and core to hold the little thing in place and allow it to be casually rotated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd rotated it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain and again Mr. Wheezely\u2019s hand descended from the heavens, sending the tiny Earth spinning helplessly. Each time his hand touched the surface it gauged immense trenches across the continents, while towns and villages, along with millions of people, were scooped up to find new homes deep under the already-dirty fingernails of the shambling, short-sighted old Geography teacher. Each time his finger stabbed down to point out the location of a major city, that entire metropolis was obliterated in a trice. Los Angeles, New York, London, Tokyo... all were nothing more than tiny little specks ground into dust beneath a mighty fingertip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the class many of the kids went up to the desk to examine the mysterious blue and white globe... but by then it had changed back to its original form.

Holding the scalpel in one hand between his fingers, he carefully sliced into the crust of the Earth roughly along the equater. As he did so, molten magma oozed out and sizzled and steamed as it collided with the oceans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephen cut the Earth in half and placed each of the halves flat side down on the microscopic slide, which he then placed under the microscope. He now could view any side of the pea-sized planet without having to rotate it or worry about it rolling off the slide to its doom. Stephen then put his enormous eye to the microscope and adjusted the magnification so he could make out countries, and even cities in great detail. Just as if he were viewing an image from a satellite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the tweezers Stephen could delicately move around both of the worlds hemispheres to his liking, and there was no where on the planet that could escape his view, and with his God like powers he could boost the microscope's magnification to nearly infinite zooming, which means he could even zoom in on specific people if he wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Stephen remembered the ruined city of New York sealed inside the dark smelly prison of his shoe, and wriggled his sweaty toes in delight. What if he were to check on that city and take it out of his shoe and place it on the slide to see how it compared to the miniature planet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was pondering this, a girl seated next to him realized he wasn't supposed to be using the microscopic, and indeed he wasn't even supposed to be in this class at all. \"Mr. Wheezely!\" exclaimed the girl, drawing the teacher's unwanted attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

All bow to my supremacy you inferrer mortals!\" He boomed with joy once more. He was loving every minute of this as he begin to get a hard-on. The people of earth where in utter disbelief, shock and panic as Stephen glazed at the sphere menacingly. \"Your a bit \u00a0big for my liking, \u00a0like the other one maybe..\" Boomed Stephen and as soon as the thought came into his head the planet shrunk down to a much smaller size before him causing a gleeful smile on the young 13 year olds face. \"This is awesome!\" Stephen boomed now much more ominous then ever before this was truly this planets God as many have up hope and bowed to the Titanic form the loomed over the planet. Massive nukes attacked Stephen up there damage was on such a microscopic level he didn't even notice. Moving his face in closer sent half of the planet into darkness as he could swallow the entire planet whole. Stephen playfully open and closed his mouth repeatedly in front of the planet \u00a0causing mass panic. He then pinched the planet by both poles.

Stephan then released that there was a scientific telescope right in front off him on the table. Stephan then looked at his hand and smiled.

Stephan had the microscope on the highest level and the city was just visible! The people of New York it was a whole new world. Stephan voice seemed to echo and boom from the heavens everything is a treat to the city even an ant would crush the city underfoot. Stephan the slid the slide out from under the microscope.

The now unnoticeable spices of the human race Stephan had killed them in there hundreds of millions. Every where in the world there was a towering body part of Stephan plotting out the Sun and crushing millions with no difficulty whats so ever. As this all happened and Stephan could fell it all happen. The once dominant people of the world where all now slaves to Stephan. Thoughts ran through Stephan's head of everyone worshipping him as there only god. Devoting there lives to worship him.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut soon all these evil and power crazed thought went to his head. And soon his already gigantic cock started to grow in size Stephan shifted slightly destroying pretty much all of Europe under his Ass checks with such ease the some most powerful countries on the planet where lifeless.Stephan looked at his underwear to see a massive bulge coming from it. The temptation got the better of the now horny God as he took of his mega sized underwear and threw it into space and covering the moon. Stephan he grasped his massive cock as it was now rock hard. Stephan moaned to himself simple thinking of all the power he has. The earth started to heat up as Stephan was letting of island sized droplets of sweat and soaring temperatures! Stephan shifted no more frequently as he was about to climax But suddenly he started to notice he was taking up more and more of the planet he was growing.\u00a0Then a sick thought ran though his head moments before he cummed. He floated away from the earth. Then seconds later the planet was rocked as Stephan a kid who only hit puberty last year had managed to shrove his gigantic cock into the earth. \"I going to cum!\" Stephan shout as the earth was the size of a baseball. Crumbling as his gripped tighten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the space of seconds. Every volcano erupted all around the world but there was no lava but White cum! Every fault line cracked and billions of gallons of cum oozed out. The cum flooded countries all over the world. Stephan moaned in pleasure as \u00a0Billions drowned in the cum and where disintegrated by the now 100 foot long sperm cells. The sperm where so big that a few dozen could destroy massive cities and entire states with ease. The destruction didn't just stop there as the planet the was \u00a0blown to pieces as Stephan cock head out grew the planet and earth was no more. It was a sticky end to earth.

I'm tired of this little planet--I want to be HUGE! It's time this universe recognized its true GOD!!\" With that, Stephan got up and \u00a0began to grow violently, shooting up hundreds of miles in mere seconds. The earth's curvature became more and more obvious as he towered higher and higher, hisevery motion causing endless disaster as he simply crushed and killed without even trying. The air displaced by his exponentially-growing body caused violent storms to sweep across the planet, his body already bigger than the entire earth<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe planet was ruined, entire countries brought to their knees. Every surviver was utterly devastated, holes covering the area, entire cities and towns crushed, destroyed, or eaten, people broken and dead or living and fearing the god Stephan. The people emerged, hope finally blossoming in their hearts after all of this cruel destruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Stephan\u00a0reappeared on the Earth's surface. His massive naked body was a sight to behold, and the power he now wielded was evident in his perfect shape and form. Not a single person who laid eyes on him had any doubt that this teenage giant was God, through and through. Stephan laughed as he looked out over the ruined planet. \"Man! I\u00a0really did a number on you bugs didn't I? Well, good! This planet will make the perfect tool to test my new powers on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to grow, his body stretching up and out, his feet doing damage on a massive scale without him even having to move. The humans ran and screamed, trying to avoid the massive appendages and ultimately failing as the feet bulldozed over them. Stephan was eager to see how much abuse this planet could take. How much weight it could withstand. Soon, his feet covered all of the United States of America. The country sank under his unfathomable tonnage, the ground shattering under the weight, magma already starting to rise up and consume the area, the oceans rushing over the land until there was nothing left. Stephan shook his head and said, \"This is the most powerful country in the world? What a load of crap! It wouldn't even make a good footstool for a god like me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moved on, still growing, his feet taking out entire countries in one step. He was a force of nature, a force that couldn't be challenged or stopped. The human race was at the whim of a cruel child who had gained mastery over the entire universe. Soon, Stephan had escaped the atmosphere, his massive upper body jutting out into space. Looking down, it was like he was striding over a road map of the world. He snickered at how pathetic everything looked from his height. He stopped moving and just stood on the most northern part of the planet, growing bigger and bigger, slowly crushing the world under his weight. He picked up the moon, still shaped as his face, and played with it like a human would with a ball. He inadvertently crushed it when he grew too big to handle it properly but merely created a new one and kept playing. He barely even had to think about it. Massive cracks started running over the planet, the core warping under the sheer weight of Stephan, magma flooding the Earth and turning it into a barren wasteland of destruction, the skies clouded by ash and smoke. All of this registered as nothing more than a pleasant tickle on Stephan's feet. He stepped off the Earth just before he smashed the thing into oblivion and sat down next to it. He slowly brought his feet together, rubbing the Earth between the enormous, soft soles, before bringing the feet together, smashing the Earth into dust. It was no more. The suffering of the human race had finally ended...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a snap of his fingers, Stephan made the planet reform, all the humans present on it once more. Those who had been smashed or eaten\u00a0back when\u00a0Stephan \u00a0was merely hundreds of feet tall, now looked up in horror as the sky was filled with the eye of Stephan. That was all they needed to see. The malice, the cruelty, the joy of destruction in his eye was the same no matter his size. Some of the humans were sure they were still dead and this was their personal Hell. Others thought that Stephan was a second coming and was preparing to take them all to Heaven. Still others, and these were the fatalistic minority, knew what Stephan really was and were prepared to be a plaything for as long as Steve was interested in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephan sighed and gale force winds suddenly ripped South America apart. He laughed at how easy it was to harm the planet and said, \"I can't believe I used to live on this pathetic little mud ball! Look at it! Size of a baseball...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe suddenly grew larger. \"Size of a ping pong ball...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grew larger still. \"Size of a marble! Pathetic! I can balance it on one finger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive fingertip rose up and obliterated half the planet, the other half barely surviving as it ground to a halt in its rotation on Stephan's finger. He bellowed laughter at this and said, \"Damn! I barely have to do anything to destroy you microbes! But that's okay, because I can just bring you all back again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a mere thought the Earth was whole again. He shrank himself down until the planet was the size of a basketball to him. He held it in his hands and peered down at the people. Without him even having to say anything they were worshiping him as God. He nodded approvingly and said, \"It's about time you specks understood! I'm God and you all survive on a whim! Tomorrow I might decide the Earth is a rotten place and crush it! And then, if I'm particularly mean spirited, I might not even bring it back! But as long as you all keep worshiping me and do exactly as I say, there won't be a problem! Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephan\u00a0couldn't hear the entire world unite as one to agree with his proposal, but he knew they got the message. He crushed the Earth between his hands again, tearing huge chunks of it off and eating it, using various parts of his body to destroy it, until it was gone again. *Snap!* And there it was again, same as ever. He was loving every second of this. There was an entire universe out there for him to toy with. And he had all the time in the world to enjoy it!</span></div></div>",

The teacher stood there in terror, as Stephen's face showed a powercrazed expression... He began growing... Slowly, but surely, just enough so he can enjoy it to the fullest. He chuckled as the walls around him crumbled down, crushing the teacher and some others who happened to be too close. He felt it everywhere in his body, the infinite power.... His height matched that of the empire state building. The growth stopped, he looked around to see tiny people stare in awe at the sight of his giant form, and perfect body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Run bugs, run or I'll step on you\" he said chuckling as he stepped out from the rubble left after his school building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis first step killed a group of students, the second destroyed a police car, every step he took destroyed something or killed groups of people. He walked off towards the city, to show the world its new God. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe growth spurt made him horny, and destructive, even more than usual.<br>\r\nThe first building reached up to his shoulder in height, he just pushed it over with his right hand, also destroying the building next to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! That's all your structures can take?\"<br>\r\nHis voice thundered.<br>\r\nThe tiny people at his feet ran around in total chaos and panic.<br>\r\nHe stomped his right foot down, causing the buildings to crack, asphalt to shatter, people fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is too easy.\" He noted, as he joyfully crushed an apartment building by jumping on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he enjoyed his power, and played around with the little city, the army arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time they got there Stephen wrecked pretty much every building in the central area of the city.<br>\r\nHe sat down to think about more cruelty he can do to the tiny people, when the annoying noise of a jet hit his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh... The ant army...\" He smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood up, and watched as the tanks crawled closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey opened fire, aiming at Stephen's chest, and amazing six pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't even feel it. \" Bow down and worship me!\" He said, but they didn't listen. He got angry again, and suddenly the tingling sensation was back...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled as he grew even bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he opened his eyes, he found that skyscrapers don't even reach his ankles in height.  Lots of tiny cities around, waiting just for him to crush them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You tiny things look thirsty...\"<br>\r\nHe took out his gigantic cock and pissed all over america, killing every living thing on it. The ground tore up, the water resources all mixed with the yellow acid...</span></div></div>",
