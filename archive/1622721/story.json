She made a sandwich of cheese. lettuce, tomato, thin sliced deli ham and onions, it was barely a meal to someone like Usagi but it was healthy none the less containing many good nutrients and fiber to help digestion. Usagi knocked and Makoto welcomed her in asking her to sit down, when she brought the sandwich out Usagi inspected it. \"Hey Makoto you said I was getting a snack...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is it.\" She replied arms crossed as Usagi looked at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's barely any meat and there's not mustard or mayonnaise or...\" Makoto stopped her with a finger to the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Usagi.

You've kept your figure on metabolism alone but now it's almost gone. You need to get back into shape, this is the first step, healthy food.\" Makoto said as Usagi picked at the sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat ALL of it. I made it to be healthy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ami said I wasn't getting...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She said you were within a healthy weight range, she asked me to keep it that way.\" Usagi finally broke down and began to eat the sandwich and Makoto smiled and calmed down to make herself one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi finished it, looking sick from the 'foreign' food entering her system, the food went down, and set Usagi on her first day of dieting...or does it?</span></div></div>",

Of course, neither Ami or Mako saw any of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, logically, when both saw that Usagi was visibly chubbier by the end of the week, they were both baffled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't get it,\" Ami said, \"What have you been feeding her, Mako?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, look, I've been eating exactly what she has been eating, and I'm perfectly fine,\" Mako responded, gesturing toward her abs, which were unchanged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi scratched her chin, pondering the situation. \"I thought these snacks might curb her hunger, but evidently she's eating more food outside of our healthy alternatives.

I mean, Usagi tries to hide all the junk she buys so I can't get at it, but she's not any better at hiding stuff than she is at dieting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlan made, Chibiusa returned to the Tsukino residence. She called out for Usagi's family, but no one answered. It looked like she was home alone. Excellent. As quickly as she could, Chibusa went around to all the places where she'd seen Usagi stash contraband in the past. Her diligence was rewarded with a variety of candy, plus a package of cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Chibiusa heard the front door open. Thinking quickly, she dumped all the snacks she'd stolen into her backpack. She barely managed to zip it up before Usagi came into the kitchen. \"Oh, hi!\" she said nervously. \"What brings you in here?\" Mentally, she was slapping herself for being so obviously suspicious, but she wasn't used to sneaking around. Luckily, Usagi was too preoccupied to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, er, nothing!\" the blonde replied, a little too quickly. \"I just wanted to see if anyone else was home! I certainly wasn't coming in here for something to eat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChibiusa thought that maybe she wasn't so bad at this after all, if <i>this</i> was what she was up against. Usagi lapsed into guilty, awkward silence before sidling out of the kitchen. So Ami and Mako had been right, at least: Usagi was definitely sneaking food. Now, the big question was what Chibiusa should do with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little girl considered throwing it away, but there was the possibility that Usagi would find it there before it got covered up with other trash. She didn't want to take it outside in case Usagi opened up her backpack for some reason. Burying it would be way too much work, not to mention extremely conspicuous. If she hid it in the room she and Usagi shared, Usagi would be sure to find it. Chibiusa gulped. It looked like, in order to keep the junk food out of Usagi's reach, she would have to eat it herself. That way, even if Usagi saw the wrappers in the trash, she wouldn't be able to do anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurtively, she unzipped her backpack and took out a few pieces of candy. Usagi probably wouldn't dare come back into the kitchen until she saw Chibiusa leave, but even so, the pink-haired girl wanted to be as careful as possible. She sat at the kitchen table with her back to the door and her backpack on her lap, hunched over to try and hide the evidence. Cramming the candy in her mouth, she chewed and swallowed quickly before shoving in another handful of snacks. Under other circumstances, she would have taken time to enjoy the candy, but she didn't know how long she had before someone else got home and stumbled onto her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finally finished the candy and cookies, Chibiusa was extremely full. Her belly jutted forward disconcertingly, and she felt a little ill. Nevertheless, she was proud of herself for helping Mako and Ami with their plan. She dumped the candy wrappers and empty cookie package in the trash, covered them inexpertly with a couple paper towels, and sat back down at the table. If she left now, there was a chance Usagi would come in and find out what she'd done, so she stayed in the kitchen looking at books until Usagi's past-mom came home. Or, at least, she pretended to look at books. Most of her attention was, in fact, focused on rubbing her round stomach and trying to make it hurt a little less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next week, it seemed like there was more hidden junk food every time Chibiusa had a chance to do a sweep of the kitchen or bedroom. Where was Usagi even getting all this stuff? Ami and Mako had said that they were watching Usagi whenever she went out, but the blonde was still apparently finding time to sneak away and buy things she shouldn't eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that she got to eat much of it; Chibiusa made sure of that. It gradually got easier for the little girl to keep up, gastronomically speaking, with the junk Usagi brought home, but Chibiusa wasn't convinced that that was a good thing. The belly she'd developed on that first afternoon quickly became a permanent feature, and she was convinced that the rest of her was getting pudgier as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Mako and Ami's point of view, though, Usagi's diet was back on track. The blonde didn't lose any weight, but considering that she'd <i>gained</i> the week before, keeping a stable weight was pretty darn good. They would have to remember to thank Chibiusa for doing such a good job next time they saw her.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Clearly she was losing weight, ever so slowly, over the past couple weeks since they first concocted their plot with Chibiusa. Initially, it had been fairly tricky making sure Usagi didn't sneak treats, but now, at the very least, they had Usagi's weight under control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder how Chibiusa's doing, though,\" Mako replied, \"She's probably put on some weight, taking all that candy from Usagi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she couldn't have gained that much. We told her to dispose of the candy, not eat it,\" Ami replied, laughing at such a silly concept as eating all the candy that Chibiusa would steal. After all, why not just feed it to the birds or allow it to return to the earth in an environmentally save way? That would be the logical, mature decision to make--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chibiusa's a kid. She's not gonna just ignore all that candy,\" Mako replied, frowning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi and Mako followed Usagi home under the pretense they were going to hang out, which they were. Still, they wanted to ensure Chibiusa was alright. Mako's comments left Ami uncertain. Was putting a child in a situation like this responsible? Ami imagined all the health issues that came with obesity. Was this, in actuality, causing far more harm than good? Was Ami just creating another candy addicted girl to force into diets?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi had her answer once she saw Chibiusa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she wasn't fat, she sure was a chubby girl, round and rolly-polly. Her pudgy hands caressed her belly gingerly, her thick fingers massaging the flesh to ensure the thick chunks of food didn't just sit still in her intestines. Her round cheeks were a shade of sickly green, no doubt from over-consumption of sweets. As Mako talked to Usagi, guiding her away, Ami approached the pink haired girl, nervously. \"Uh, Chibiusa, did you eat all of Usagi's candy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does it look like I did?\" Chibiusa said before burping. Cupping pudgy fingers over her list, blushing, she mumbled \"Uh, 'scuse me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is awful! You're getting fat. You're fatter than Usagi is. Listen, from now on, give us all the candy you steal, alright? That way we can get rid of it without it going straight to your waistline, okay?\"</span></div></div>",

Don't worry about me!\" Chibiusa said, smiling reassuringly. That seemed to be enough for Ami and Mako, though the former looked awfully doubtful. Still, they left her alone, which was what Chibiusa was after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, she had no intention of giving up Usagi's junk food. Eating as much candy as she wanted was every young girl's dream, and Chibiusa had grown to enjoy the overstuffed feeling she got from pigging out on Usagi's treats. She had to wait until Mako and Ami left, though, or they'd know she lied to them. The wait was torture. Chibiusa preferred to keep her belly full, and she was starting to get pretty hungry. Finally, after what felt like ages, Usagi's friends headed home. Chibiusa raced into the kitchen and checked Usagi's normal \"secret hiding places.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, she came away with an armload of candy and other snacks. Good old Usagi, she never bothered to figure out better hiding spots even after her food started disappearing. Chibiusa finished the whole stash without much of a problem. Sure, she felt a little overfull, but it was a good feeling. She didn't understand why Ami wanted to take that away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next couple weeks, the only exercise Chibiusa got was hiding from Ami and Mako whenever they came over to the Tsukino's. If they saw her, they'd realize that she was still eating all Usagi's candy, and then they'd take it away from her. Chibiusa wasn't having any of that. She was still stuffing herself silly at least once a day in addition to her normal food intake, and as a result, she was quickly sliding from \"chubby\" to \"fat.\" Her stomach, which had borne the brunt of her gain, muffined hugely over anything she tried to fasten around it, and covered up a good deal of her lap when she sat down. Her thighs were starting to rub together when she walked, and she'd developed a second chin and maybe even the start of a third. Chibiusa didn't mind any of this. She wasn't trying to get fat, exactly, but she really liked stuffing herself and never bothered to exercise, so gaining weight was the inevitable conclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, all good things must end, and eventually...</span></div></div>",

She had slimmed down to a healthier weight, svelte and slender. One of her first actions as a healthy individual was to stop buying junk food, which she happily did. Due to Ami's tinkering with some chemicals and experiments, Usagi now found the very idea of eating junk food nauseating. Ami had to thank a Clockwork Orange for giving her that wonderful idea to use psychological conditioning to make a person lose weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChibiusa managed to horde the last of Usagi's junk, but, soon enough, she depleted the supplies. Now weighing in at 180 lbs on her short frame, she was a fat child, blubbery and weak, and without her supply of chocolate. The week following Usagi's purge, Chibiusa began to go through withdrawal symptoms, waking up at night in a naked sweat, trembling and convulsing silently in her room, having odd hallucinations of chocolate bars hidden under sofas. She didn't have money or an allowance, so she couldn't just buy candy at the store. She had to wait for Usagi's mom to cook desserts, which, that week, she chose not to for whatever reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I didn't know better, Chibiusa, it looked like you were a cocaine addict being taken off coke,\" Rei commented one day, having brought a bag of chips, much to Usagi's repulsion, to one of their hang out sessions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up,\" Chibiusa moaned, staring hungrily at the chips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya know, maybe you should start dieting,\" Ami commented, glancing over at Chibiusa's overstuffed flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!

She giggled as she brought the sweet to her begging lips, her mouth opening up to--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chocolate spiraled out of Usagi's fingers as she fell against the ground, staring up at Chibiusa, who shook her head in disapproval.  \"What was that for?\" Usagi stammered, shocked as she rubbed her chubby, red cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Orders from the top,\" Chibiusa replied, grabbing the chocolate on the floor before tossing it out into the trash, to Usagi's horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I almost tasted the caramel...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, you're starting to get pudgy, so this is for your own good,\" Chibiusa replied, sighing as she shook her head dismissively.

What\u2019re you saying, that\u2019s not true!\u201d Rei said indignantly, puffing out her cheeks as she glared at Ami indignantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmi\u2019s right though, Rei. I mean, you go out of your way to point out my gain, but look at you!\u201d the blonde said, poking her friend\u2019s gut. \u201cLooks like you\u2019ve really been packing on the pounds lately, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true, after all. Rei had certainly plumped up, having gained about 35 lbs. within the past few weeks, putting her at 148 lbs. And it truly was obvious, moreso than Usagi\u2019s own minor weight gain by comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, there was the brunette\u2019s gut, which was one of the most noticeable areas that had been affected. It had developed a rounded curve, a creamy collection of adipose that was pushing past the hem of her skirt and causing her shirt to ride up by a fair amount. It had quite a bit of jiggle to it, as well, made evident whenever Rei decided to move in any substantial way. A muffin-top had definitely begun to form, her flesh pooling around her sides and creating a fledgling spare tire in her front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei\u2019s posterior had also seen some change, creating a bubble butt that was pressing up against the back areas of her school uniform\u2019s skirt. If one could look underneath, they\u2019d see that her panties were being strained by the extra amount of flesh that they had to contain. The fabric hadn\u2019t begun tearing yet, but it was certainly straining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Sailor Senshi\u2019s chest had also grown, giving her boobs that were each somewhat big, although nothing extraordinary. Her bra, though, was having a bit of a hard time keeping them contained, the bags of fat pushing against it and her shirt with all their might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer calves and thighs had also become quite chunky, not at the point of chafing together, but not too far off, either. Her arms and hands, though, had seen very little of her gain, only her arms actually thickening to any noticeable extent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei\u2019s face was also relatively untouched, only the beginnings of a double chin showing anything really changed there at all, but her visage still kept the same relative amount of sharpness it always had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment, Rei even had a whole stash of candy and chips in her newly-bought purse, to provide her with \u201cenergy\u201d throughout the day. This had become a habit recently: she\u2019d always bring something to school, to the point there was hardly a day she went without it. It had really helped to unintentionally pack on the pounds, especially since she tended to binge on several serving sizes worth of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have no idea what any of you are talking about,\u201d Rei said, trying to suck in her stomach a bit as she made her case. \u201cI\u2019ve only put on a few pounds, it\u2019s not<i> that </i>much!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut Rei, isn\u2019t it a bit hypocritical to point out Usagi\u2019s weight gain when you could stand to lose a few yourself?\u201d Ami pointed out with a quirked eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone listened to see what Rei\u2019s response to this would be, but the brunette wasn\u2019t going to have any of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I think class is going to start now, so I\u2019ll be on my way. I\u2019d suggest you guys go, too, we don\u2019t want too many tardies, after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she left with a brisk power-walk, her belly and chest bouncing rhythmically as she made her way along. When she felt had put a reasonable amount of distance between herself and her friends, Rei made sure to pull a bag of chips out of her bag and proceeded to tear it open, craving the salty sensation her taste buds would get greeted with. Usagi simply shrugged and bit into more of her own snack, lazily making her way into the school building as well. This left only Ami and Mina by themselves.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She couldn't think of a good cutting response to that, so she just stuck out her tongue. In response, Mamoru leaned down and kissed her. \"Mm, you shouldn't tempt me like that,\" he said with a laugh. \"How have you been? I feel like it's been forever since I've seen you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm okay. School still sucks, and I've really missed talking to you. How about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've missed talking to you too, Usagi. But yeah, I've been good other than that. Hey, listen, I'm off work all of tonight. You want to go have dinner or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" Usagi said. The couple held hands all the way to the restaurant, a little Italian place staffed entirely and incongruously with native Japanese people. Everything on the menu sounded so good that Usagi, who rarely got a chance to eat at foreign restaurants, had trouble deciding what to pick. She eventually settled on a big bowl of noodles in a heavy cream. She didn't notice the look that crossed Mamoru's face when she placed her order, too swept away by the romantic atmosphere of the little restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the food arrived, Usagi shoveled her meal in like she hadn't eaten all day. She could feel her skirt digging into her bloated stomach, but once again, she wasn't worried. \"Can we get dessert?\" she asked once she had scraped her plate clean of all the rich sauce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Usagi...\" Mamoru said, unsure of how to broach the subject. \"Have you noticed that you've been, er, putting on a little bit of weight recently?\" It was strange: when she was totally thin, he had no problems making jokes about how fat she supposedly was, but now that she really had gained a few pounds, he was all worried about offending her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" Usagi asked, her voice just a bit brittle. \"I'm still as thin as ever!\" Mamoru winced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not, Usagi,\" he said patiently. \"You've put on maybe five, ten pounds since the last time we went out, and that was only a couple weeks ago!\"</span></div></div>",

Of course, Usagi knew she hadn't gained weight, so clearly it was just Mamoru being odd about something. Maybe her outfit was a tad tighter on her body, making her look chunkier.  That had to be it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she wouldn't need to worry about her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing along with what Mamoru said despite the obvious truth being she was just as skinny as always, Usagi said, \"Thanks, Mamo-chan. So how about you thank me by paying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was gonna do that anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. But I figure an extra desert won't hurt, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Won't hurt who?  It might hurt my wallet, but I have no problem doing that,\" Mamoru replied, smiling. Usagi grinned. This whole Mamoru accepting her non-existent weight gain thing was certainly a beneficial circumstance for the blonde haired girl. However, Usagi failed to see that she had, indeed, gained weight, and that Mamoru was not lying to her or anything. She was indeed a few pounds plumper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she didn't know that.</span></div></div>",

You better watch out, or you'll turn into a real cow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sound just like Mamoru,\" Usagi muttered, hurt, but that wasn't entirely true. While Mamoru was also under the delusion that she'd somehow gained some weight, he was at least nice about it!

She turned to Mako to start making her healthy food that she could eagerly consume that was low on calories. Though it wasn't initially very good tasting, she did at least grow to like it a little bit, after awhile.  She also turned to Mako for exercise, specifically jogging. Initially, Usagi was gasping for air at the end of a mere jog, struggling to push herself off the ground, her full chest heaving. However, after a little while, she found that the running became steadily easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina, on the other hand, would help her choose clothing more flattering to her frame, emphasizing her more voluminous breasts, and not her pudgy middle. At least this allowed Usagi to look less plump. Ami, on the other hand, would educate her on many topics about weight that Usagi realized was an ideal time to take a nap. Rei was surprisingly supportive during the whole thing, albeit in her snide little way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, your fat-ass looks a bit smaller. Keep it up, and maybe it won't look like cottage cheese anymore,\" Rei giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, ya meanie!\" Usagi would retort, but she knew Rei's heart was in the right place. That was just the way she was, but she wasn't insulting her too much out of malice. She just wanted to help her friend the only way she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Mamoru helped, albeit he preferred her pudgier body.

Everywhere she went, she'd purchase a chocolate bar from a vending machine, or perhaps a large sized meal, or, on many occasions, ice cream. It would be wrong to accuse her of stuffing herself over the limit or anything, since she didn't eat if she was full or anything like that, but, combining her excessive snacking with a lack of exercise, Usagi did start to pack on some pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it was a slow increase, just like her friends' gains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing around a glutton like Usagi meant being surrounded by food all the time. Usagi would ask Mako to cook new foods and deserts for her, so she'd have to practice a little, usually testing the recipes herself. Once the recipe was perfected, the usually stuffed Mako would then serve it to the rest of their friends, all of whom indulged in at least a few of the treats.  Had it not been for Mako's exercise routine, though, she would've grown a fair sized belly after a week of Usagi's requests. However, she did start getting fluffier, which, in turn, would make it harder for her to exercise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi, however, didn't go out that often. Most of the time, she sat in her room, studying. The extra snacks she ate, many of which Mako encouraged her to take home, were not burned off as easily as Mako's were. So, spending most of her time sitting with snacks around made her get doughy over the weeks, but there was another odd side-effect Ami noticed: the act of chewing allowed her to focus more. Therefore, when studying, she was always found chewing something, be it a desert, a piece of gum, or the occasional vegetable, to keep herself healthy. Due to her occasionally healthy snacks, Ami felt assured she wasn't getting thicker, though she gradually was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei, naturally, spending an increasing amount of time with Usagi to ensure that she made occasional healthy dietary choices (just to sneak in dieting to keep her from becoming too fat), began to pick up some of Usagi's bad habits as well, such as buying candy bars almost obsessively from vending machines. The gradual habits lead to irresistible cravings. It wasn't too uncommon now for Usagi to swoon and Rei to quietly swoon when the group of friends passed by a bakery. Rei was too proud to admit there was a problem with her weight, and, thus, rationalized that, clearly, she was the victim of a rogue washing machine that shrank her clothing. There was no rationalization offered as to why her ribs were no longer visible, or why her stomach had begun to pouch over her waistband like it did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako, however, DID see what was going on, since she was very much into beauty and appearance.

Usagi was the quickest to gain weight from all her snacks and was about 225 pounds. Usagi's fat had traveled across her body, giving her thicker limbs, larger breasts, and a plump belly. Rei was the second fastest gainer due to spending time with Usagi, and now currently weighed 210 pounds. Much of Rei's fat had gone to her chest, giving her a large bosom, but her stomach was also much large. Ami had also gained much weight since she wasn\u2019t the type of person to exercise anyway. Ami was now 200 pounds because of her snacking during her studies. Ami's fat had gone mostly to her lower body, giving her much junk in her trunk. Makoto had also gained, but her gain was milder compared to the others. Mako was an active member of the group, which kept her in shape. Despite being a physically active member of the team, eventually Makoto started to gradually become lazy and was about 187 pounds by the end of the week. Since Makoto had gained the least she only got a slightly larger belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Over the week, Minako took her friends to restaurants or other public places and noticed that she was the center of attention in the group. Boys began giving her compliments, flirting with her more often, and even giving her some presents. Minako loved the feeling of being worshiped by all these admirers, but also began to become paranoid. She thought that if her friends lose weight, she would lose her admirers. So soon Minako began to plan to fatten her friends up even further. She began to offer her friends more food, try to keep them exercising and away from any mirrors. It was especially easy since each of them were still in the delusion that they were all still thin as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon things began to become complicated for Minako when\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her response was to poke her belly, feel it, to assure herself that it actually existed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she began to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hastily dialed the phone for Mako, sniffing loudly as she tucked her locks of hair behind her ears. \"Uh, hello?\" the voice of Mako asked, lazily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mako! I've gotten fat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Ami? Is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it's me. I just tore through all my clothing. I must weigh over 200 pounds or something.

Why didn't we notice this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We must've been around Usagi so much we didn't--plus Mina kept saying how sexy we--Mina!\" Mako snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Mina?\" Ami asked, curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's been making us porky! I swear she is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I cook a lot of the meals, and I know who cleans their plates and who doesn't. And I always see Mina not finishing her meals, and then dumping it on someone else. IT's almost as if she wants everyone else to get fat around her.

Chemistry was hard work, and with the finals only two months in the future, now was the time to cram all this info in. She wasn't sure she had enough time! It was coming at her faster than she had anticipated, and, if she were to accomplish her dreams of being a nurse, she had to start early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow was the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rose from her bed, lazily brushing crumbs off her bust. It was then that she noticed something peculiar. Her breasts were usually petite, rather slender and light. Next to Matoko, whose breasts were rather large, this was somewhat embarrassing for Ami. She was aware that breast size wasn't that big of a deal. What were breasts aside from giant sacks of flesh, after all? She never understood just what was so appealing about massive balls of breast fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the fact that they trembled made Ami coo in pleasure. Was she growing in that sense of the word? Her breasts weren't that much larger, but just enough so it may have been natural growth. However, there was another possibility. She  could be accumulating fat. She darted into her bathroom, staring at the mirror as she pulled her shirt over her belly. Sure enough, there was a slight layer of pudge there. Nothing significant, but it was there, nevertheless, underneath the spheres of flesh. She poked it until the flesh swallowed up her first knuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi cringed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't a self-conscious girl, but she did not like the idea of gaining weight. If anything, she felt downright disgusted with herself. She'd need to work this off, and, with less fights to deal with, there was now virtually no output for her calories. When she was younger, her metabolism was faster. Now, that wasn't quite the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was she to do?</span></div></div>",

She wasn't naive, thus she knew the consequences of her constant snacking.

It came as no surprise that her thighs were thick, or her breasts filled started to fill her hands, or any of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf anything, when she weighed herself at 131 lbs, she was surprised she wasn't a tad thicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe struggled to pull her uniform on, the buttons strained nearly to breaking point. She sucked her belly in as she hooked her skirt around her hips, feeling her flesh bunch up around it.  She finally hooked it together, sighing in relief.  Fortunately, the uniform didn't tear, but it did rise up her form a little, revealing her pudgy underbelly.  Thankfully, she foresaw this, and chose to wear a white undershirt that managed to fit over her belly.

The crickets and other critters of the night made their usual sounds as both Raye and her Grandfather were sound asleep. That was before Raye felt a cold wind brush upon her body causing her to shiver in her sleep and enter a dream that felt real. \"W-what's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around and saw she was surrounded by darkness, moving up down left and right all like a wading ocean as she saw two blue orbs moving. \"HELP! SOMEONE HELP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind them was a giant black claw stretching out from the darkness which had crimson red eyes, it grabbed the two orbs and pulled them to a row of sharp curved teeth and were devoured, Raye could only watch. \"Just what is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother blue orb and this time a pink orb flew towards Raye and hid behind her. \"Please! Help us! It wants to eat us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaye looked at the orbs gazing inside she saw a young teen boy in the blue orb and a small girl in the pink one. \"Could this be, are you souls that are seeking to reincarnate yourselves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Please! That thing wants to eat us! It's an evil being that wishes to devour innocent souls!\" The boy's soul said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"COME...TO ME!\" A bellowing voice demanded the sound echoing amongst the darkness as the hand slowly made it's way to Raye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave them alone!\" Raye took out one of her charms and tossed it at the hand, it landed on the palm causing pain to the beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hand backed away as the beast slowly roared in pain and vanished. Raye slowly awoke in the middle of the night and sat up looking around and rubbing her eyes, questioning if it really was a dream or not. To answer her question the two orbs she saved came in through the walls shocking Raye out of her sluggish daze. \"So it wasn't a dream after all. There really is an evil spirit devouring souls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, please you have to keep us safe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why me?\" Raye asked taking the coves off her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't know, we simply saw a light and headed towards it.\" The pink orb said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaye got up and headed to get a book of seals and charms, where she learned how to make her charms that stop enemies. Looking through it she stopped. \"There a containment seal, that way I can keep you safe in a container of some kind like a bucket or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! The demon has a partner! A human who killed us so that it can eat us. We were murdered!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Murderer? So you think that this killer will break the container?\" Raye asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There has to be some other way, a way that it won't be too obvious, and there will be more spirits that see the light like us. There has to be something that can contain more then one spirit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" Raye looked in her book and saw a page of the book saying how humans can contain spirits and long as they have a seal binding them inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's perfect, I can keep you safe myself. I, know my way around a fight.\" Raye said thinking how a common killer would stand no chance against Sailor Mars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaye then took a slip of paper and a brush and made the seal placing it under her clothing. \"There, now hurry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two spirits went inside Raye, who yawned and headed back to bed not realizing the effect this would have on her. The morning came as Raye slowly got up and yawned feeling it was harder to move, uncovering herself she then saw she had a pregnant belly! \"What!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got up and looked at the belly, placing a hand on it she felt the energies of the two spirits, she twitched as she realized. \"I'm...pregnant with twins...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaye has become pregnant thanks to her seal, but she know she can't remove it or she'll risk the two spirits and any other that need her help. She can't ignore her duties and hopefully her robes would cover it up. Raye sighed and hoped the day would be fine. </span></div></div>",

Placing her hand on her belly as she tried to keep her balance with her new found weight. The robes were starting to feel tight for her as she redid her belt. \"I better find a seal that will take care of that beast and I also better keep an eye out for its partner that the two warned me about\" Raye reminded herself. \"I wonder how many more did that beast and his partner kill....I just hope its only these 3\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went through out the day as she normally would. But with her new found girth it was hard not to waddle when her grandfather would pass by. She would smile at him as he would to her just hoping that he would not notice her \"added weight\". She also hoped her friends wouldn't dropped by especially Serena since she was never in good terms with her. If Serena would see her now she would never hear the end of it. Among the trees lies a shadow watching her. She seemed to feel as if someone was watching her and turned towards where she sensed it but found only the birds and the critters playing about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was after lunch when she needed to clean the statues in the shrine. Her grandfather was sitting outside having his tea fixing the strands on the broomsticks for the afternoon sweeping of the temple. She sat down and started cleaning the obelisk. She also started to clean the rest of the altar, just when another spirit wondered in and went into Raye's belly where the 3 were. She moaned once more as she put her hands on her belly. Her belly swelled even larger as the spirit made its place in her belly alongside the other spirits. Just as her belly swelled so did her breasts going into an DD-cup. \"Ugh.....How many more?!? Darn that beast! When I see it again I will make sure it goes down permanently!\" Raye murmured to her self. She struggled trying to get up when....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In a panic she stood up. Wobbling due to her new found weight, she had to think of place to hide but where? Just then she noticed a trap door in front of the altar. It looked like it was a part of the floor but it must of slid off its place when Raye stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll hide here for the meantime till he goes away....I just hope I can fit in here..\" So as she lowered her self into the trap door it was small as she would imagined. But she was lucky she could fit in. She slowly slid the door over her head as she finished getting into a sitting position. Just as the door slid close, Chad walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raye I've bought some food, I was wondering.....\" Chad looked around and saw that the shrine was empty. \" I thought her grandfather said she would be here. Must've went somewhere.\"  He walked around a bit just to check if everything has been placed. Then he walked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes or so, Raye decided to come out of her hiding place. She groaned as she murmured to herself, \" I don't wanna be in here again, not while I'm this big.\" As she hefted herself out of the trap door. She carefully placed it back. She took a peek once more to make sure the cost was clear and scurried to her room. She was nearly out of breath when she made to her room. She saw some food on the table. With her tummy growling she decided to eat. She settled herself down carefully as she ate the food that Chad left her. It was dumplings as she ate, she thought how was she going to track down the benevolent spirit. One: To stop \"it\" and its partner from messing with the spirits and Two: She wouldn't get any bigger. She was already big enough as it is, any larger, she wasn't sure if she can take much more of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she finished her snack and began to search through her books on how to located the spirit when....</span></div></div>",

She fixed her books and scrolls she needed for her research on locating the evil spirit. Slowly put herself down and went to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was past midnight. Another spirit wondered into the room where Raye slept. Like the others before it. It went into Raye and joined them in their human container. As soon as it settled in, Raye moaned but was in her sleep. Her belly surged forward as she now grew to looking like she was carrying 5 babies. At the same moment her breasts grew into and E-Cup. She rubbed her belly as she shifted positions to avert her new found weight. But she continued to sleep her good nights sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was early morning as the sun came up. She heard the rustling of the broom sticks as she knew someone was cleaning the grounds around the shrine. So she decided to get up. But as she sat up, was met by her breasts as her belly pushed them toward her face. \"What the....\" she said \" not again. I better get to work on locating that evil spirit or I might not be able to get up anymore if this continues.\" she grunted to herself. Figuring out how to get up was the hard part. Using two hands to push herself up was useless. Asking for help was not on her mind as she wanted to keep her secret a secret. From a sitting position she lay on her belly then pushed her self upward w/ her knees adding a push to help her stand up. It was successful. She was able to stand up w/out wobbling. But as she stood up. Another spirit came in and went into her. She bit her lip as she clutched her belly. She can feel it expand even larger. She grew till she looked as if she was now pregnant with 6 babies as her breasts grew into a F-Cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fell back down catching her breath as her belly now covered 3/4ths of her legs. Both her breasts and belly were sticking out of her robe. So she had to find a much larger one in which she did.

She had never tasted anything so sweet before. Soon one small bite became rapid munching as she quickly devoured the cupcake. Then she went through another cupcake, then another, then another, and she continued to eat the cupcakes one by one. Every cupcakes was so delicious, the only though in Makoto's head was to eat more and she couldn't care about anything else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough all good thing must come to an end, as Makoto realized that she was out of cupcakes. \"Oops.

This form makes me feel sick. I miss my plump and soft body.\" The creature said out loud as she examined her human form. Then she heard a voice in her head speak to her. \"Do not worry. Once the other humans begin to let themselves go, you can let yourself go as well and become more like your true self once again. The first step to make the human embrace our hedonistic ways is to target restaurants where humans eat unhealthy foods like deserts or fast food and fill the food with energy from our world. The energy filled food will start to give humans cravings that will grow over time for sweets and anything that will fatten them up. Then they will begin to change more with not only their bodies, but their minds as well. The wand I gave you has enough energy to fill at least three restaurants with the energy a day. So everyday I want to find restaurants that serve food, use the wand to fill them with energy, and observe how the humans as they begin to change.\" The woman looked at the wand in her hand, which looked like a thin rolling pin with strange symbols on it. \"You can count on me.\" She said to the disembodied voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly traveled through Tokyo, the first place she decided to use the wand on was a large fast food place with a big M on the building. She aimed the wand at the building and it glowed a green aura that was invisible to humans. After leaving the fast food restaurant, she saw a candy store and decided to use the wand once again to make sure more humans would get hook. The green glow covered the shop, and no one noticed once again. Her last target for the day was a popular bakery. She repeated the process again and was proud of herself. She decided to treat her self to some pizzas for a job well down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after she had targeted the bakery, Lita Kino entered the store to pick up a order. Her order was a small bag of cookies. Normally she would bake her own cookies for the sailor scouts, but she didn't have much time today and she still wanted to bring something to her friends. She picked up the bag, paid and left the shop unaware of the energy that filled all the food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the walk to Raye's temple, Lita was getting a bit hungry. Even though the cookies were in the bag, a small hole allowed her to smell the delicious scent from the cookies. She thought to herself \"<i>I can't eat them now. What would the others think...then again, it couldn't hurt to have just one right? After all, I should make sure they taste good since I haven't tried this place before.</i>\"  She stop by on a bench and took a quick bite from a small cookie. The one tiny bite was enough to fill her with strange energy and have an immediate effect on her. \"<i>WOW! These cookies are even better than mine! I bet the others will enjoy them too.</i>\" She finished the cookie she started and savored the taste. Though little did she realize, she began to go through the bag as she walked towards Raye's. Soon she finished the bag in only about a short minute. \"Oh no! I can't believe I ate them all. They'll all be mad at me...then again, the only one who'll complain is probably Serena. I almost always bring food, surely they won't mind if I don't bring anything this time.\" She thought to herself as she went to the temple.       </span></div></div>",

However, as Lita continued gazing at all of this transpire, the tall school girl felt her cookie filled stomach churn and lave, Lita placing a hand on her stomach as she remembered the predicament she had involving the sweets she intended to share with her friends. Despite the mistake, the incident did manage to bring forth some good as an idea began to manifest from her working mind, her brain reminding it's owner of where she was and what this could mean for her situation. \"Ah! Maybe I don't have to go back empty handed, I can just buy something from here!\" Lita paused, looking up to the restaurant she had current stopped in front of; a pizza parlor by the name of \"<i>Pizza Pagoda</i>\". Lita has heard of this place from her classmates before and, to her luck, their pizza was positively amazing from their experience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A pizza does sound good...\" Lita nodded, counting just how much money she had left from the cookies. Luckily, the cookies she had already indulged upon didn't cost that much and she had just enough for a large pizza to bring back to her friends. This was a good day, indeed! \"And I have enough for just one large pizza! Perfect!\" Lita nodded as she turned on her heels and entered the restaurant, her senses being treated to the delightful aroma of the cheesy pizza's being cooked and prepped to be taken out. Lita had to pause for only a moment to take in such a decadent zest that wafted into her nose. Even without tasting the pizza, Lita was able to visualize just how wonderful a single slice would be. However, while Lita was busy wondering just how a pizza could be so wondrous, the atmosphere in the steamy restaurant was positively rife with the dark aura of corruption that was being spread all across Tokyo's restaurants. Had Amy been with Lita right at the moment she entered, there may have been a suspicious pause from the bluenette as she would have been able to pick up the demonic pollution that hung heavily in the air. Unfortunately, Lita was without her analytical comrade and the thought of this very restaurant being a trap flew directly over her brunette head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, welcome to Pizza Pagoda~\" A feminine voice sang in a cheerful tone, Lita's ears picking up the voice as she snapped out of her trance and took in the interior of the pizza parlor finding that, surprisingly, it wasn't entirely packed, but there were still people hanging out here, most of them being girls her age. At the front there lay a long selection of different pizzas, all of them freshly cooked and practically bubbling with an inciting heat to be wolfed down and enjoyed in great excess. As an aspiring cook, something within Lita clicked, her drive telling her of an opportunity to learn just how to make these disks of dough and cheese so majestic and juicy. \"Are you here to try our Friday Special?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Friday special...?\" Lita echoed, stepping further inside to the unoccupied front of the restaurant, the brunette able to get a good look at the blonde employee that stood ahead from her. She was a rather average young woman that never seemed to cease with her bright, beaming smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's more a contest than a special but, people sure like to call it that.\" The teenager replied with a roll of her eyes, before setting forth to explain the rules of this little contest. \"Either way, the contest is basically you eating a grand total of 5 \"Monster Pizzas\" and, as a prize (and compensation for the inevitable case of bloat), you'll receive two free pizza of our 'Monster' size and a page of coupons good for a single year~!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLita perked as she took in the prize, something she was most certainly looking for to replace the cookies she ate. In fact, this prize could quite easily blow those dinky snacks out of the water if the 'Monster' size pizza was as big as Lita imagined. However...she had to defeat five of it's brothers in order to take the both she needed back to her friends. A challenge that sounded daunting now that she realized she needed to eat something that could, quite possibly, be thrice the size of a regular large pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll do it!\" Lita nodded a confident look on her face. \"My friends could use a nice big, Friday snack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hoh, a confident one~!\" The teenager giggled, \"Well, take your seat anywhere in the restaurant and we'll be right with you shortly~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLita nodded and made her way to a lone table in the middle of the restaurant, cracking her knuckles and doing what she could to prepare for the daunting digestive task that lay ahead. Not long after she had situated herself at her table, a tall and rather muscular man came out bearing two pans loaded down with incredibly large pizzas that, as Lita imagined, were thrice the size of a normal large. The school girls who were occupying the back with Lita looked up at the spectacle and could only blink in confusion as they saw the size of the pizzas as well as the one intending to eat them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them, rather... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the mammoth pizzas were placed down in front of Lita, the man paused as he took a moment to see just who was challenging Pizza Pagoda's \"Friday Special\", naturally, he was a little surprised, it wasn't someone rounded and tubbier than Lita was. \"You're a tall one, but I've seen two guys try to take this challenge on and they couldn't even finish one of these suckers...\" The man noted, looking over to Lita once more. \"I can only wish ya the best of luck kid, you're gonna need it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'm doin' this for my friends.\" Lita nodded, mentally preparing herself for her task, \"There's no way, I'm going to lose!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with her loud declaration, the brunette dove in with reckless abandon, her fired up mind cheering her on and reminding her of the prize her friends would surely appreciate...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Ooogh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLita moaned as she slumped back in against the chair, the majority of her senses sluggish and bogged down by the onslaught of pizza that the brunette had taken in. While normally not much of a big eater, Lita found herself throwing off those shackles and digging up an appetite she didn't even know she had, the end result doing well for her in the task but, leaving her incredibly bloated and lethargic. Lita lazily cast her glance downward and grimaced as she lay eyes on the glutted dome of her belly, her school uniform let out to allow the warmed, pink swell to charge out and lay on her lap as the stuffed organ within tried it's absolute hardest to deal with the immense, cheesy work load churning within. Her stretched gut let out a whining groan, as it's inner walls cramped around the resilient mass of cheese wading up within, the brunette gingerly rubbing her upset tummy in a means to quell it's digestive tantrums and process the massive food baby crowding her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, she...she did it!\" A school girl came out with in amazement, the others that had gathered around to watch their taller schoolmate try to beat the challenge, successfully down everything that had been placed in front of her. Lita had been so focused on her gluttonous task that she didn't even know she had managed to draw a crowd up until she had finally finished and could see that standing around her table was a group of cheering school girls. Off to the back, the burly man who had served all five of the prodigious pizzas could only scratch his head in bewilderment, his past experience with watching two men practically fall over from pizza overload being topped by seeing a mere school girl demolish such a whale of a meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll be damned...the girl did it.\" He muttered, shaking his head at the image of what was surely to come of such a fantastic binge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I didn't even think anyone would be able to finish it...\" The blonde waitress blinked, clearly stunned by Lita's gastric fortitude but, inwardly feeling sympathy for the bloated brunette for once it was all processed. That cheese...wasn't going to make digestion easy, that's for sure. Not to mention, the swelling of her waistline that would inevitably occur sometime after digestion. To say that the teenager did NOT envy Lita was a gross understatement of the highest quality. \"Well, as promised, you get two large pizzas free of charge, plus that of a page of coupons for future visits~!\" There goes that sunny attitude again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLita tried her best to crack a smile in triumph but, her bubbling and protesting gut only seemed to remind her that she had <b>really</b> overdid it. \"<i>Urgh...too much...pizza...</i>\" A deep rumble boomed from the bloated globe of Lita's gut, the brunette covering her mouth in alarm as everyone froze in response to what they believed was to be the victor disgorging her slaughtered meal. Lita curled forward, clutching her poor, overstuffed tummy in pain as something monstrous bubbled and groaned within her, eager to be released from it's congested birthplace. Everyone around Lita took a step back, bracing themselves for a particularly nasty eruption from the bubbling, brunette volcano but, thankfully, had their worries doused as the Lita finally gained relief from her digestive turmoil and opened her mouth to release a truly thunderous belch. Lita didn't bother to remember her manners as she lay back in her chair, the intense pressure within dissipating, and allowed herself to bask in some sense of comfort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Urgh, thank god that was just gas...</i>\" The blonde employee sighed with relief, not exactly eager clean up something that had already been inside someone's gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as the employee left to get Lita's prize, both herself and everyone else was entirely oblivious to what was really going on here. The demonic energy that had infested the Pizza Pagoda, as well as the food served, was now swirling within Lita's hard working tummy. Lita's terrible case of bloating wasn't due to the pizzas, but the excessive amount of dark energy that was filling her up en masse and doing well to further corrupt her. The fact that Lita had consumed 5 dishes that held far more energy than a normal large was doing well to work at an incredibly quickened pace and could prove to override Lita's 'defenses' and force her to gain a taste of what would soon have Tokyo engulfed in a matter of weeks, or perhaps days...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urp...now all I have to do...is get everything back to Serena and the others. I'm sure they're -ugh- hungry by now...\" Lita thought aloud, watching as the blonde teenager placed the two Monster sized pizzas in front of her with the coupon page taped to the top-most box. However, Lita was just now remembering that she needed to <i>walk</i> to Raye's house...and not just walk, but walk with her thundering, food impregnated tummy jostling about on her middle. All at once, Lita began to feel just how far Raye's house was and how much effort it would take to get there. Effort she wasn't sure she really had in her anymore...</span></div></div>",

The sailor scouts just defeated the mastermind behind recent monster attacks and Tokyo had been free for any monsters or creatures for weeks now. Every Scout was enjoying the peace, especially Mina. Mina had spent most of her time shopping, looking for handsome boys, and hanging out with the other Sailor Scouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again she was on her special shopping trips. She was looking for the latest new  Clothes when something caught her interest. There was a new store next her favorite clothes store. The decor of the store was covered in plastic lollipops, gumdrop shaped lightbulbs, and various other candy themed decorations. With all of those decorations, Mina assumed that it was candy store. Mina decided to check out the store to see what kind of candies they had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she got inside, she was completely speechless. She had never seen so much candy. It was almost like a dozen candy stores dumped their candy into one place. Suddenly, someone emerged from the back counter, carrying a box of candy and said \"Welcome to Rainbow Sweets! You're are first customer so you get to all this candy free of charge!\" she said as she handed to box over to a even more surprised Mina. \"Wow! Thank you so much I can't wait to try it.\" she said as she exited the store. Though she was happy that she got he candy, something about the sales girl seemed very familiar to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did Mina know was that salesgirl was actually an old enemy of her's, Debrine! She once tried to fatten everyone os that she could steal energy from them for her master, but was defeated by Sailor Venus. Luckily for her, the previous leader of the monster had resurrected her for his plans. Unfortunately, the leader was defeated before they could begin that plan. Now that meant that Debrine was free to get revenge. She found out Mina's identity by accident when she saw her transform. That's why she set up her new store next to Mina's favorite store. To get her attention, and then get her hooked on her candies. One bite and anyone who eats her candies gets hooked, and will gain weight quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer white cat was nowhere to be seen, perhaps he was out with Luna? Or just went out for a stroll, either way he was nowhere to be seen, which left Mina alone with a box of candies all to herself. She looked at the box, it was a nice pink box and looking at it the box was quite big for a candy box, were they bars inside? Only one way to find out Mina's brain told her as she undid the tape and decorative strap and lifted the cover. Inside was a plastic holding tray of 25 quite big round candies, which was resting on another layer of 25 below. Mina lifted both layers out and put them side by side. \"Wow these are a lot of candies! I wonder if I can finish them all anytime soon, well better subtract one from it all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted one and placed it in her mouth, and the moment she did she felt like she spiraled into a world of pure bliss, the candies were called Rainbow Sweets right? That's certainly what Minda felt the moment she took a bite, like she had placed a rainbow of flavors in her mouth, and all of them delicious. The candy had 7 layers that she chewed through, it was like a milk chocolate, easy to chew despite it's dense layers of amazing taste. Tears ran down Mina's eyes as she chewed, her life was seemingly fulfilled at that moment. \"H-How...could I have lived my entire life not knowing about these!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly took a second one the moment she had swallowed the first and began chewing, her eyes watering still from the tears of joy felt from eating these sweets. Upon looking at the box she saw the box had a memo on it. 'For more please call this number' Minako was ecstatic seeing they actually delivered! She went to her phone, carrying the tray and putting in the number and the third candy. On the other line the clerk who gave Mina the candy was serving other people as she picked up the ringing phone. \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi is the Rainbow Sweets!? I saw you delivered and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this my first customer asking for seconds already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know?\" She asked placing the fourth candy in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I recognized your beautiful voice my dear. I bet you loved those candies didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah they're amazing! I was wondering if I could have more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing sweetie, I'll have them shipped to you tomorrow.\" She hung up and an evil smirk shone on her face as she went under then store to get one of hundreds of boxes stacked inside, and to taunt her prisoner, a certain white cat, Artemis, whose four legs were chained inside a pet carrier and his mouth was given a muzzle so he couldn't chew anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well mister naughty kitty looks like you master has fallen for my trap, and this time some stupid talking cat won't foil me. She had to have had some kind of help to figure out my last plan, otherwise she'd have been a fattie like everyone else my Roses affected. Well now that you're here she'll end up in her home unable to move, and I'll keep sending her these new sweets even after that!\" Debrine laughed as she went to walk back up, then stopped and got a package of her special 'Rainbow Jello' Mix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll throw my 'favorite' customer and extra helping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at Mina's place the blond was already done ten of the candies, and her skirt became tight as she had already put on 20 pounds.</span></div></div>",

Once in the bed chambers, Michiru plopped herself on the bed, almost going to remove her shirt, but, noticing that Haruka refused to move, held herself back, choosing to see how things played out. \u201cWhat\u2019s bothering you, Haruka?\u201d Michiru finally asked, noticing the antsy Haruka standing up, surprising for the usually strong warrior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing major,\u201d Haruka said, frowning, \u201cI just had an experiment in mind, nothing huge, just a strange little thing. Stupid, really\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf it\u2019s so stupid, then tell me,\u201d Michiru replied, \u201cI like stupid ideas sometimes. They\u2019re cute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean my stupid ideas are cute. Anyway, it\u2019s just a little thing, and I know you\u2019re probably gonna say no flat out, but, well, here it goes: would you like to gain weight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, Haruka had foreseen Michiru\u2019s response a mile away: \u201cExcuse me? I don\u2019t believe I heard you correctly. Did you say \u2018gain weight\u2019?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s exactly right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, Haruka, why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cit\u2019s just a kink is all, a weird little thing that might make things fun in bed,\u201d Haruka replied, shrugging, \u201cI\u2019ve done it for you. Remember the time you told me to grow my hair out?\u201d Michiru remembered that. After the two months of growing her hair, Haruka almost shaved her head bald. She had just recently returned to her ordinary hair style, and the experience, for the most part, was something they preferred not to discuss, despite how funny and cute Haruka looked like with blonde flowing hair down to her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are aware there\u2019s a huge difference between growing out your hair and growing out your waistline, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but just try it for two months, like with my hair. Whaddya say? Think of it as payback for the hair, alright?\u201d Haruka\u2019s eyes were filled with anxiety. Michiru knew full well what that fear was: the fear of rejection, of Michiru thinking that Haruka was a complete strange fetish-obsessed freak, and maybe she did think that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt just so happened that Michiru found that to be one of Haruka\u2019s cutest qualities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll do it, on one condition\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The two stuffed each other with 6 reheated meatballs before each let out a small burp. \"Think this will get us anywhere?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dunno.\" Michiru responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you want me to gain after your little confession?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take you out maybe, or maybe you just decide to become lazy or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, why don't we try that?\" Michiru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarkua nodded and thought of what they'll do tonight.</span></div></div>",

Once in the morning started, in the past, Haruka would go out for a morning jog, darting down the streets at a brisk and powerful pace as the sun rose. Now, however, she forced herself to substitute laps for naps as she resigned herself to lying around on the sofa with her Michiru. When Michiru was forced to go to her violin practices or had a public art show, Haruka would sneak on her running gear and go for a brief little jog around the block, an activity, a week down the line, she found slightly harder to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranted, she didn't even qualify as thick yet, but the laziness had left her rather softer. She felt her belly peaking over the lips of her shorts as she pulled them over her remotely sleek legs, grimacing at the thought of being unable to run with as much ease as she did usually. Still, it was worth it to see her Michiru blimp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas, poor Michiru HAD no outlet like Haruka did, as she was neither physical before the laziness began or after it. She had no exercise routine save for drifting around in the pool. For her, it came more naturally, and the life style became all encompassing. Though Haruka doubted to see any change too soon, she did notice a slight curve to the front that didn't previously exist, a gentle convex shape that trembled and shifted as she walked. When she was painting, this bulge would scrunch up adorably, so beautifully so that Haruka needed to probe it with her soft, delicate fingers, pushing gently into her flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Michiru eat was, as always, like watching a master apply paint to a canvas, how she gracefully plucked a chip from a bag and placed it on her tongue, or how she plucked a dumpling from the plate with her chopsticks between those soft fingers of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreath taking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, one unexpected side-effect was that Hotaru, constantly hoping to win their praise in some way, started lazing around with them too. Hotaru wasn't a physical girl to begin with due to her deteriorating health, but she still maintained some activity with Haruka when she went for her jogs. Now, with Haruka doing her exercises in absolute secrecy, Hotaru had no way to know when to work out, and, thus, lazed around with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had grown slightly pudgier around the middle after the past week, her knuckles disappearing on her hands as she plucked another chip out of Michiru's bag.  Other than that, though, she was the same scrawny girl as always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, this wasn't going to have THAT much of an impact on their Princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasn't it?</span></div></div>",

She looked at her list of foods she was going to eat over the week and decided to increase the portions and get more food then usual. \"Even she has to have some kind of limit to how big she wants me. I mean how big COULD I get?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following day Michiru got up earlier then usual for a quick stop to a doughnut place, ordering two dozen of the treats she ate them on the way home, licking some frosting and jelly off her fingers before throwing them in a trash can before heading home and getting in bed just before Haruka woke up. \"Good morning, ready for breakfast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...why don't I serve us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good.\" Haruka said stretching as she was still half asleep. Michiru made enough bacon, Pancakes, blueberry waffles and eggs for five people her size. She took pleasure in eating two meals worth before the other two came down. They all sat down and ate their large meals together. After that the trio sat down on the couch and began eating from Family value sized chip backs, then switching over to tortilla chips, also family value, and large salsa containers. By the time they were done it was lunch time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll make lunch.\" Michiru offered getting up, it was harder all things considered. She made sub sandwiches, enough for the entire Senshi if they were fat! Of course Michiru ate most in secret leaving one for each of the trio to eat in front of the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen for the next few hours they slept off the sugar crashes in time for dinner. Tonight was Quintuple Cheeseburers with the works. Each Burger was the size of their heads. She made about 4, again was hers in secret. The trio ate their meals together. Then it was time for their baths. Michiru offered to go last. While the other two took theirs together for the sake of cleaning their back, since neither could fully reach their own anymore, Michiru used her time to make herself a bannana split using half a whole bunch and three containers worth of ice cream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSneaking it in was easy as the other two were in Hotaru's room seeing what still fit her. While waiting for her cold bath, since a hot bath would melt the split, she decided to dig in already. Within 20 minutes she finished both her bath and the sundae. Hiding the bowl between her growing bosom Michiru smiled thinking the day was a success. It was. So much so the next four days went like this. And on the morning after these five days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michiru, wakey wakey. I decided that I'm going to make breakfast this morning.\"  Haruka said walking out. Haruka had put on about 75 pounds since their diet started, Hotaru had put on about 40 pounds, Michiru however...once she removed the sheet from her body it was apparent she put on at least 125 pounds, her breasts were twice as big as Jupiter's her ass was nice and round each cheek. She had a double chin and her arms and legs were pretty much flabby as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichiru was ready to showcase this to Haruka. She walked downstairs almost nude, Harkua waiting for her. Their eyes met, and that's when something stirred in Haruka's mind about Michiru's 'lesson'. </span></div></div>",

When Michiru pulled the covers off it was plain to see she gained the most. Perhaps it was the rebound from her usual activities to her new lazy lifestyle, perhaps it was Michiru scheming against her to end this all, or maybe her eating with Hotaru, each trying to out eat the other, with Haruka winning each time. Either way one thing was obviously, Haruka was more then two times as fat as her lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fat took up most of her body, she could barely even move, she needed a cart with wheels to support the massive gut she had poking forward. Getting up was hard considering her legs were like fat silos. \"I'll make you breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarkua could just hear the real meaning behind those words 'this is what you wanted, now you have to live with it'. It's true that there seemed to be no way Haruka would ever regain her old shape she had worked hard to keep, she was barely mobile! As Michiru left Haruka wondered if it was all worth it, she began slowly making her way out of the bedroom, the cart creaking under the massive gut it held up. \"Oh shut up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka reached the stairs, which were recently remade to include an incline. It was easier to get down, but Haruka would need Michiru behind her to keep her from rolling back, today however wasn't a lucky day, she tripped slightly and ended up going down much faster then normal, but stopped before she crashed, a heavy sigh as she moved the cart of to the door. \"Why is it Momma Haruka has been gaining more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka peeked in on Michiru and Hotaru, Michiru making breakfast Hotaru sitting there drumming a chubby belly with her plump fingers. \"Well don't tell her, but I've been switching around foods in similar packages, so she's been eating foods with more calories then she things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond was stunned that Michiru had been tricking her this whole time! \"But...why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted her to learn a lesson from all this, Sometimes she needs to think with her head a little, but it seems she's going full throttle with the whole matter despite her recent gain, oh well. Hopefully she won't notice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWon't notice, she heard everything! Haruka wheeled herself over to the sofa, sitting down she bent the couch with her larger posterior, pondering what she just heard, Michiru, the woman she trusts and loves had been lying and deceiving her. Haruka's near immobility, her certain detriment in health. Michiru bet Haruka's life on a lesson, Haruka knew what she had to do.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Haruka heard the whole plot, how Michiru had pulled the old switcharoo on her, despite all of the trust that had built up between the two, and could feel something seemingly snap inside of her.  However, it wasn't necessarily a negative switch going off in her brain, but rather as if some barrier, some inhibition holding back in her brain, had just dissolved, despite her current ponderous predicament.  She couldn't walk on her own, getting out of bed was an incredible chore, and her gut and body were so swollen she needed mechanical assistance just to move around.  Yet at this point she didn't care.  She stood up and slid her belly apron onto the cart once again, wobbling on her heavy, overloaded legs as she tried to stabilize herself, her thighs bouncing and rubbing against each other as she seemed to barrel forward.  She was propelled forward by not just gravity's effects on her bulk but also a new primal urge to grow at any cost.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Haruka, we've been waiting for you, you seemed like you were running late for breakfast so we started without you, as you can tell.\"  Michiru motioned across her own breakfast selection, an astounding feast that looked like she had taken a serving from each selection at a well stocked breakfast buffet, complete with a tall glass of milk, which for all Haruka knew was low fat as a way for Michiru to keep lagging behind her lover in gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was worried, Mama Haruka,\" Hotaru added, her eyes avoiding Haruka's chubby face.  She knew about Michiru's plot to hasten Haruka's gain, and while hated not telling Mama Haruka something so important she didn't want to tell the secret Mama Michiru had just entrusted her with.  She stirred her cereal idly, half a box of chocolate chunk cereal with a stunning amount of milk and a big can of soda to wash it down.  She felt a bit too conflicted with herself to eat it, her turmoil almost turning her stomach. But now that Mama Haruka had joined them she couldn't resist eating what was a dream breakfast for a young lady of her age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka gazed down to her own meal.  It matched food for food what Haruka was eating, even down to the portions, but Haruka knew that Michiru had hidden a little extra something in all of her food so that the extra storage of calories would keep her gain progressing at an inhuman rate, but she didn't care.  She tore into her food like a shark, downing it all with the gusto of a speed eater, so shocking that Michiru was stunned, watching her lover gorge like a hippo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm enormous, I need to eat like this.  It's all I can do at this size,\" she said wryly, mouth full of greasy, salty eggs as she lifted up her cup of creamy milk and took a chug.  \"At this size I can't do anything but binge and wheel myself around the house, a girl has to let loose some way or another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mama Haruka?\" Hotaru asked as she slurped down a spoonful of soggy chocolate crunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I didn't say anything, Haruka,\" Michiru commented, setting her fork down as she stared across the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't need to.  Look at us!  Look at the difference between us, and we eat and drink the same amount of food!\"  Haruka slapped her huge gut and motion to her spread of food, before picking up a plate of bacon and maple syrup to slurp it all down.  \"Isn't this a bit odd? Just a bit?\"  There was a twinge of frustration in her voice.  Haruka smiled, chuckled a little, and began to lean across the table, her breasts bouncing and hanging onto the tabletop and giving Michiru quite a view of her flabby cleavage.  \"I think I've learned my lesson, huh?\"  Hotaru and Michiru gasped some as Michiru tried to stutter out the beginning to an explanation, a plea to Haruka.  \"So you want me to slow down, huh?  To think instead of going full throttle?  I can hardly even walk now, the only wheels in my life anymore are the ones on my cart, not my car!  I've sped way, way past my lesson!  And once I've gone this far, there's no stopping.  I'm going to go wherever my stomach takes me, and if you're gonna trick me into bloating up twice your size then I won't resist.  Pour whatever additives you want, slip in all of the chocolate and sugar in the world, I'll eat it all, until I'm just a living mass of flab.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, I....\"  Michiru was a bit stunned to hear Haruka let loose so much so suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But under one condition.  I don't want to go into enormity on my own.  I've come to realize that these new pounds are a part of me, I know that sounds crazy, but it's the truth now!  I'm not turning back, but that means I won't let you either... Nor Hotaru.  I've I'm going to be huge, this whole family will be.  I don't care how tough it will be to go on without our immobility, how we'll care for each other at an enormous size, but I want all of us to get so fat we can't hardly even roll out of bed!\"  Hotaru looked up at Michiru and then to Haruka, as everyone tried to take in what she had just established.  She would let her own body decline into enormity, languishing without learning her lesson, but only if everyone in the house did? Michiru couldn't help but roll this around in her head.  Was Haruka trying to make a point too?  Was she gambling her own size just to even the play field?  Now Michiru didn't want to stop either.  Even Hotaru seemed oddly intrigued by this whole affair.  It seemed that Haruka had turned this into a weight gain version of chicken, with whoever deciding to back out of the gain outing themselves as the cheater in this whole affair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hotaru, we're going to go along with Mama Haruka's plan,\" she said, grinning, licking some eggs off her plump lips.  \"But with one compromise.\"</span></div></div>",

Hotaru was the smallest out of them at about 1100 pounds. Hakura was 1510 pounds, but was not the heaviest. Michiru had the title of the fattest in the group at a ludicrous weight of 1760 pounds. All three of girls were too fat for clothes and sat nude in the middle of the kitchen so they could get food easily. Ever since their drastic increase of weight all three began to change not only physically, but mentally as well. Now they were all too lazy for manners and they all became only concerned with eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally it would be impossible for ordinary people to live like this, but in Japan there was an increase in weight gaining, so a new law was passed. This law was to provide for overweight people with more money. They politicians of Japan thought that the overweight people would use this money for help in decreasing weight. Most of the citizens that were fat did use the money for physical trainers or liposuction. Little did they realize that certain citizens like our trio would use this law to spend their new easily gained money on more food. This helped them adapt to their new life style and let them get enough money for Makoto to make more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately over the month the trio never noticed that Makoto had put on weight as well. Since the trio had become so lazy Makoto also had to clean their house along with other chores, while dealing with other things in her life like school. Though half way in the middle of the month the stress had gotten to Makoto. She had to work while Michiru, Hakura and Hotaru got to pig out?!? It wasn't fair, so she decided to start gaining weight as well. She still made more then plenty of food for them while sneaking some of it for herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Makoto was close to becoming immobile as the outer scouts(minus Sailor Pluto), at 800 pounds. She could still move, but barely soon it wouldn't be long before she would be beyond being able to move. \"I have to find someone who can feed us. I don't want to lose this weight and neither will the other girls. Looks like I'll have to make a call.\" said Makoto to herself as she slowly moved towards the nearest phone.

As long as I make sure to I'm nearby Usagi while she's cooking I can help improve her cooking!\"</i> once her thought was over she said \"Okay, Usagi can cook for me.\" Of course Ami and Usagi weren't aware of Makoto's plan and thought she was co-operating with their plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day Usagi was in the kitchen with Makoto while Ami was studying in another room. \"Okay time to cook! I'm going to make something healthy like...\" \"WAIT! Usagi, do you want some cookies?\" said Makoto as she interrupted Usagi. \"Yeah, but I'm not that good at making cookies.\" said Usagi.\"Don't worry I can teach you how to make cookies and lots of other sweets you like.\" said Makoto. Since she knew how much Usagi loved sweets. All she would have to share some of her food with Usagi and give her tips on how to cook, and she would still get yummy fattening food.<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------<br>\r\nOver the next week Usagi kept coming over to Mako-Chan's house and feeding her junk. Makoto also kept feeding Usagi some of the sweets to keep her happy and from noticing that she was gaining more weight.

Though one day she decided to visit Makoto because she believed she had lost weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ami entered the house though she heard something that sounded like someone ripping clothes. She rushed into the kitchen and was shocked by what she saw. Makoto was so fat that all her clothes were ripped to shreds on the floor. Makoto was standing nude in the kitchen just eating a gigantic cake, in pure bliss. Then Ami noticed Usagi next to her, who was also eating a giant cake. Usagi had also gained weight at an alarming rate. She was still much smaller than Makoto, but what was alarming was how fat she got in a about a week. She was about half the size of Makoto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Usagi! How could you let this happen, Makoto was suppose to lose weight?\" yelled Ami. \"I'm sorry but Makoto showed me how to make my favorite sweets. Want some?\" It was no use trying to talk to Usagi or Makoto like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi decided that she had to switch tactics. Luckily she brought a medical book about obesity filled with facts about obesity to scare them in to losing weight, hopefully.\"Did you guys know that obesity can lead to diabetes, heart attacks, liver failure, breathing problem and early death?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi and Makoto...  </span></div></div>",

Ami thought that she could escape through the cover of the fog, but she didn't notice Mako. Makoto was still on the ground after she fell, so when Ami ran by Mako was able to grab her leg and trip her. Shortly after that, the fog cleared up and Usagi found Makoto and Ami. Because of the hard fall, Ami was out like a light. Her transformation faded and she returned to normal, leaving her defenseless against Makoto and Usagi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater she did wake up, and Makoto had her arms behind her back so she could move them. She tried kicking Makoto, but her kicks were very weak and Makoto didn't feel a thing. \"What are you doing Mako-chan?\" \"We're tired of this diet! We want more than just the healthy stuff. You probably don't understand what it's like to eat all that yummy food and have the weight to go with it. Usagi and me will take care of that though. Usagi is the food ready yet?\" Usagi then walked into the room with nothing but unhealthy junk food and deserts. \"Yep! Sorry we had to be so forceful Ami-chan, but it's the only way to show you why we like miss the fat and food so much.\" said Usagi as she stuffed a slice of cake in Ami's mouth. Ami struggled of course but, Makoto was too strong and knew how to keep Ami pinned down with her weight. Usagi was also a little stronger and could force Ami to eat if she tried anything funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the rest of the day Usagi and Makoto kept forcing Ami to eat nothing nutritional. When the sun set, Ami had gained 100 pounds of fat. Ami also hated to admit it but all that food was delicious. The cake, the chips, the hot dogs, the rice balls, the sushi, and other delicious treats were being eaten by Ami, and as the day continued her resistance was fading until after sunset. Usagi and Makoto had gotten extremely hungry after watching Ami eat all day. So they decided to make themselves a feast, however that did mean Mako had to let Ami go. Mako wasn't worried though, she thought Ami would either be too fat and tired to escape, or she might haven given up and decided to join them. Soon both of them began gorging on the food and were in a state of bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi noticed this opportunity and thought about this situation. Since they're distracted Ami could sneak away, and try to stop them tomorrow. Of course she might need help from Rei and Mina, since they were using their weight to over power her. As long as she had back up she maybe able to help them lose weight. Soon Ami got up, but wasn't quite used to her new weight yet and slowly walked to the door. Once she reached the door she was about to leave, and yet the scent of the food was clouding her mind. After doing nothing but eating all day Ami was considering joining Usagi and Makoto. She knew it was unhealthy, and yet couldn't help but drool from watching them eat to their hearts content. She was torn between helping them get in shape and joining them.

She had to think of what fatty cells looked like under a microscope, how the food was processed, and all the nasty procedures taken to make sure the food was unhealthy, just to avoid caving into her own inner hunger. Soon the smells reminded her of death, and, after stumbling slightly with her chubby frame, managed to search for her comrades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went slowly now, hiding behind the cover of the numerous walls. She was extra careful now that her pudgy arms were wide enough to be scene when she hid behind a tight corner. She had grown so fat she barely recognized herself.

She wanted to diet now, if not only to ride herself of her plump thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard Rei and Mina's voices in the distance as they darted off.

Her mind told her not to eat anymore but her body didn't listen as she began eating more until she finished the sandwich. Once she was done the sandwich though, she began to focus again. Little did she realize was that eating that huge sandwich had made her tired. Ami decided that she would go home and rest so she could be ready to help them lose weight. \"Okay tomorrow we will start getting you two back into shape!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto grinned as she could tell Ami loved the food. It was only a matter of time before she would submit and give up on trying to get them to lose their weight. \"It's working Usagi!

When Ami-Chan comes back tomorrow she'll have to try and take it again. As long as she keeps taking our food and eating it she'll be hooked!\" said Makoto, but her words fell on deaf ears. Usagi was still eating and once she was done she said \"What Mako-chan? Did you say something important?\"<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nOver the week Makoto and Usagi began making more non-nutritious food and Ami soon fell into their trap. Even though Ami began taking more food from them each day, Makoto and Usagi always had more than she could take. Ami had gained much weight without realizing it and was now just a little under 200 pounds. Usagi had gained weight as well, she was at 550 pounds but was envious of Makoto's weight. Makoto was now 970 pounds and immobile, now all she did was sit while Ami and Usagi just feed her more. By the end of the week Ami had given up on trying to make them lose weight and soon began to become jealous that they get to eat all day, and as much as she hated to admit it, the fat made them look radiant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day Ami told Makoto and Usagi \"Okay, you win. Forget losing weight...can I you help me gain weight too?\" Makoto and Usagi were ecstatic that Ami now understood the joys of being a glutton. \"Sure Ami.

If all three of us are as fat as you, then we won't be able to move, then who will feed us?\" said Ami. \"You Ami, after all Mako-chan's too fat to move, and you were the one who tried to make us lose weight.\" but Ami didn't agree with Usagi's decision. \"You've gotten to pig out more than me.

It may take a few days, maybe a week, even with my skills. Mind you, I might not be able to make one at all with today's technology.

A device to rid Haruka of all her fat? Could Ami do that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka drove up, she called Usagi minutes before, she was waiting outside with Chibiusa. They looked in and were surprised by the fact that what they heard over the phone was true! Haruka slowly made her way out. \"Are you...okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I alive, though moving is quite hard at the moment.\" She responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi helped by pushing from the back, she was having a harder time then she thought. \"Oh, Chibiusa, please don't say anything to Hotaru is she asks...I know it will be painful, but she can't know where I am, least until Michiru makes amends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" Chibiusa held her head low, feeling bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Michiru will hopefully realize soon and hopefully learn the errors of her ways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Until then what are you going to...\" Then a rumble in Haruka's stomach ended the conversation rather quickly as the trio chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I did skip breakfast.\" Haruka said, Usagi helped her into the kitchen and laid out all her treats she was hiding, she snuck on into her own mouth before giving Harkua a share.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like I picked the right place to crash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that supposed to mean!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing.\" Haruka giggled, since Haruka placed her hopes on Ami she decided indulging herself wouldn't hurt for the meantime. She ordered up a lot of pizzas, so many Usagi was shocked, however Haruka smiled at it, when the pizzas arrived later that night she told them it was for all three of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just bought as many as she could afford at the time, after eating about a dozen pizzas the last five or six boxes were left to the Moon pair. They helped themselves to the food and stomach ache that came with, when the duo burped they all had a good laugh.

Despite a week having passed by, the fact remained that Michiru had yet to apologize.  She was sure the blue haired beauty knew her location, but, for whatever reason, her beloved had failed to show her face in the Tsukino household.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, she was having her own fun here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Usagi, is that pizza here yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, right, about that...heeheehee...\" Usagi's giggle told the blonde lesbian more than anything she could have seen.  Plus, the scents wafting through the air also implied a lot to boot.  Usagi walked in, grease smeared over her lips as she grinned, scratching the back of her neck, \"I kinda got a little bit hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, stupid Usagi!  No wonder you're getting fat,\" Chibiusa mumbled from her position on the sofa, resting a piece of cake, ironically enough, on a sizable stomach bulge. However, the cherubic girl was completely correct: Usagi was rather plump.  From her rounded calves and thighs, still sleek despite their volume, to her wide, spacious hips that now filled more of the sofa seats than ever before, her soft tush now so inviting for Haruka's fingers, to the size of her belly as she leaned forward, flab sliding over her waistband, her breasts now substantial, her arms thick, and her face rounder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka wanted her then and there, but had not the strength to lift up her massive body from the sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, squirt, you aren't exactly a stick, ya know!  And I'm not fat!\" Chibiusa was no slouch either.  She was built like a smaller version of her mother, and even now was akin to her. As the offended girl rose, her cheeks flushed as though her head were a giant tomato, the back of her skirt tore as her hips spread the fabric apart, much to the poor girl's humiliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, if you weren't willing to get teased, don't tease someone else.</span></div></div>",

Once the machine drained them, she had enough energy, and vigor, to return to her ordinary activity. Due to sheer determination alone, she was able to lose much of her weight. She had slimmed down to about 160, which, while much heavier than before, was lithe compared to her original state. As she ran her pudgy fingers over her pot belly, she noticed that, despite the give of her flesh, there was strength buried within, great strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, no Michiru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Chibiusa and Usagi occasionally exploited the machine, they hadn't been as eager to work out as Haruka was. At the same time, they weren't as giant as Haruka. Their loss, while tiny compared to their lesbian friend, was enough to slim them down to a weight below Haruka's, though how much smaller was debatable. Usagi and Chibiusa were less lazy, but they were still prone to sitting around, making fun of one another, the other unable to take the other's berating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, no Michiru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it wasn't until Ami came that Haruka received an answer.

Sadly they found undoing the damage themselves wasn't as easy as she had hoped. The pair together probably lost 30 pounds each, Miciru losing more due to her health being better overall. Michiru realized she needed Haruka to help trim them down to size with an exercise routine. She found herself taking a taxi, she used her money on food to feed her and her overweight 'daughter' so buying a used car was even impossible, when she arrived she payed the fee. She saw Haruka's car, she was there all right. With a nod she walked up and knocked. No answer, she knocked again and was met with a shock,Usagi's mother who was never much of an eater was FAT, not chubby, like as big as the women she opened the door to. \"Oh *huff* Hello, you're Michiru aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhhhh yes ma'am. I came to talk to Haruka.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I see, well she's upstairs with Usagi, so head on up, I'm almost done with lunch.\" The now heavy mother said walking into the kitchen, when Michiru walked by she saw enough food for a Thanksgiving feast! Her attention taken away for mere moments was enough to have her bump into something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm sor...\" One hand dropped, the other covered her gasping mouth, the large object she bumped into was Chibiusa! Michiru couldn't understand it! The once small girl was now bigger then Michiru! She looked at the girl's face, smothered in chocolate and icing and berries from pies Michiru walked in front, jaw still dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Chibiusa?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi *buuuurp* Michiru, they're...*urp* upstairs.\" Chibiusa spoke through her four chinned mouth. Michiru was looking at all the rolls on the girl's stomach, and could only assume the worst for her lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe headed upstairs, she felt the weakness to them, like not one but two massive objects had been carried up recently. When she reached Usagi's door she heard the sounds of eating and giggling. The door was cracked open so she peaked inside, when she did she would almost wish she didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Haruka and Usagi were clearly immobile. Haruka was wide both ways, taking up almost all of the room that belonged to Usagi, speaking of which, the long haired blond was placed onto the bed like fat belly of Haruka, who she was beginning to take after. \"So, no Michiru today I guess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, oh well. She lied to me anyway. She obviously didn't really care to listen. It's her loss.\" Haruka said shoving a chocolate bar down Usagi's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichiru backed up. Then looked in and saw the final straw, the two Frenching each other! Michiru snapped there and then and realized what she had to do.</span></div></div>",

Michiru lifted three sugar cookies, still a little warm from the oven, onto a plate and brought them out the couch where Hotaru was reading. After setting down the plate and picking up the empty one, she leaned down and kissed her adopted daughter on the top of the head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to go run for some errands. Your papa should be back in about ten minutes, but if you need anything before she gets home, just give me a call, okay? I'll bring home some dinner, so tell Haruka-papa not to worry about cooking anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" As Michiru left the room, Hotaru leaned down to grab a cookie. The little belly she'd developed over the last week pooched out above her skirt. No sooner had she finished the last of her cookies than Haruka got home. Hotaru set down her book and went to greet her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome home, Haruka-papa!\" she exclaimed, giving the blonde a big hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, sweetie,\" Haruka replied, hugging back. \"Do you know where Michiru-mama is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She said she had to run some errands, and that she'll bring back dinner. Is that okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure it is.\" When Haruka finally broke the hug, she pulled out a small white bag and handed it to Hotaru. \"I drove past the candy store on the way home, so I bought you some of those malt balls. Don't spoil your dinner, though.\" Hotaru nodded, wide-eyed and serious. She took the pound of candy back to the couch and finished it well before Michiru came home with takeout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt dinner, Hotaru ate everything that was put in front of her. She was a bit full from everything she'd eaten that day, but Haruka-papa had told her not to ruin her appetite. Haruka, for her part, assumed that Hotaru hadn't eaten much of the candy, since the little girl obviously still had an appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner, Haruka went out to the garage to work on her motorcycle, and Michiru fixed Hotaru a big bowl of ice cream, which the girl ate without complaint, figuring that this was part of dinner and that she therefore had to eat it. She went to bed that night stuffed to the gills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next few weeks, her life continued in more or less the same pattern. Haruka and Michiru each plied her with treats without realizing that the other one was doing the exact same thing. Moreover, she kept finishing her meals because she felt obligated to do so, and since her parents were figuring out how much food to give her purely through trial and error, her portions were increased slightly every day as Michiru and Haruka tried to determine her limits. Hotaru herself was too shy and nonconfrontational to question any of this, so she just ate whatever she was given and went through most of her days very full indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of all this, she was starting to fill out. She'd been extremely thin when she'd come to live with her adoptive parents, so Haruka and Michiru didn't think too much of her increasingly meaty arms and thighs other than that she looked a little healthier. If they noticed her protruding stomach or start of a second chin, they chalked that up to the same thing.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After several weeks, Hotaru found herself resting on her bed, her pudgy hands on her belly. She felt the food gurgling within her, her fattened body reaching its limits. While she was in pain, at the same time, she felt a second feeling: acceptance.  Her new parents were giving her all this food as a sign of their love and devotion to her. Before, she had been underfed, even malnourished. Now, while a bit heavier than healthy, she was at a less dangerous weight, and no longer felt the nagging pain of hunger claw on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDownstairs, Michiru figured it might be a good time to give her little girl a snack. As she prepared a sandwich for her, one filled with meats and lathered with mayonnaise, she approached the stairs only to find Haruka walking in the same direction. They almost bumped into one another, Michiru making sure not to drop her hero sandwich as she collided with her heroic girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Michiru!\" Haruka laughed, \"Sorry about that. You can go first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Haru--\" Michiru stopped mid sentence as she glanced down at Haruka's hands. Within her fingers was a bag of candy. \"Uh, Haruka, you know that's fattening, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mind if Hotaru gets chubby, but you're abs feel so good when we--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not like that. Well, if you're the expert on healthy eating, what's with the sandwich?\" Haruka asked, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's for Hotaru.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka raised an eyebrow. \"Uh, this was for Hotaru too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them stared at each other blankly before coming to the same conclusion: they were both feeding Hotaru. The two of them kept staring before giggling into their hands. \"You mean all this time we've both been feeding Hotaru extra?\" Haruka replied, smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks that way. Poor girl. No wonder she's getting chubby,\" Michiru replied, \"Alright, next time you, or I for that matter, give Hotaru food, let's both know about it so we don't stuff the poor girl like a balloon, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, so, now let me just give her this candy,\" Haruka said, about to walk up the stairs, only for Michiru to block her path, \"Look, I paid for this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can eat it then, but Hotaru's having a healthier meal, like a sandwich. It might be a good idea for her to start dieting soon, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't recommend that,\" Haruka replied, \"Girls who are forced to diet at a young age tend to have terrible confidence issues later on, and Hotaru's already a shy girl. Telling her to lose weight would crush her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're right, but we can't just fatten her up some more, can we? That would be a terrible parenting strategy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe I can help,\" Setsuna said, entering the chamber with a serious look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where were you all this time?\" Michiru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was off in my study, alone with my thoughts,\" Setsuna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were totally watching soap operas again, weren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT IS NEITHER HERE NOR THERE!

The poor girl had a difficult life, and I would hate to think that the three of us did anything to prolong that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about her weight?\" Michiru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She still appears to be within a healthy weight range for her age, and she's a growing girl,\" Haruka answered. \"If she wanted to lose weight, I would certainly help her, but as long as she's comfortable with herself and her weight isn't causing any health problems, I'm with Setsuna. Our princess deserves to be spoiled a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichiru frowned. She agreed with the other two in principle, but she was worried about the consequences for Hotaru. Their daughter wasn't a very sociable child to begin with, and kids could be so hard on anyone who was different. If Hotaru started to become overweight, things could only get worse for her. Any child who would pick on someone as sweet as Hotaru obviously wasn't worth listening to, but she wasn't sure if Hotaru would see it that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just worried about how the other kids will treat her...\" she said. Haruka smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If any of the other kids says one bad word about our daughter, so help me...\" she shook her fist. Upon seeing Michiru and Setsuna's shocked expressions, she burst out laughing. \"I was kidding! Though, seriously, at the very least I'll give their parents a stern talking-to. Michiru, Hotaru knows that we love her, and that's what matters. Kids can be cruel, but what's more important is that she has an accepting, loving family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right,\" Michiru conceded. \"I'm worrying too much. The important thing is that Hotaru knows how much we love her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka wrapped an arm around Michiru and kissed her on the cheek. \"Worrying is just another way of showing love, as long as you don't go overboard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe issue decided, Setsuna went back to do very serious, definitely-non-soap-opera-related things in the privacy of her study, while Haruka and Michiru went upstairs to see Hotaru. Haruka knocked on their daughter's door. \"Come in!\" she said, barely loud enough for her parents to hear. When Haruka and Michiru entered the room, she heaved herself into a sitting position with her back against her headboard. Her stomach bunched into two thick rolls. Haruka thought she may have been slightly exaggerating when she said that Hotaru was still in a healthy weight range. On the other hand, she was used to Hotaru being unhealthily skinny, so she was probably just overestimating how overweight the girl was in comparison to a normal child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, your papa and I want to apologize for feeding you so much.\" Hotaru stiffened. Had all the love she thought her parents were showing through food been a mistake? But Michiru continued: \"We love you no matter what, and you can still eat as much as you want, but we don't want you to feel like you <i>have</i> to eat everything we put in front of you. We're trying to take the absolute best care of you that we can, but we make mistakes sometimes, too.\" As she talked, Michiru rubbed Hotaru's stomach in slow, soft circles. It felt wonderful to Hotaru, and helped relieve some of the pressure on her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, Michiru-mama,\" she replied. And she did know, at least intellectually. However, deep down, there was still a part of her that inexorably associated love with food, and that part was terrified that her parents would stop feeding her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. We love you so much, sweetie,\" Michiru said, kissing her daughter on the forehead. She set her sandwich down on Hotaru's night table, and Haruka did the same with the bag of candy. \"Like I said, you don't have to eat these if you don't want to, but they're here if you do. Dinner's in a few hours.\" She stood up and, along with Haruka, left the room, closing the door quietly behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as they were gone, Hotaru grabbed the candy and started stuffing it into her mouth. She had gotten a bit of a shock, and even though she was still pretty full, the food-is-love part of her needed reassuring. The sandwich met a similar fate, though, since it was bigger and more substantial, it took longer. Soon, Hotaru was lying flat on her bed again, massaging her bloated stomach. She groaned from how full she was, but really, she felt better now that she was full of her parents' love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt dinner, Hotaru ate as heartily as ever, and when questioned about the food her parents had brought up, she said that she hadn't eaten the sandwich. To cover her tracks, she volunteered to do the dishes and washed her empty sandwich plate along with the dishes from dinner. While she was drying the last bowl, it occurred to her that she was alone in the kitchen. Hotaru knew her parents kept it full of the kind of food she liked, and even though she was full from dinner, she was tempted to sneak some treats, because more fullness meant more love, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUltimately, though, she decided against it. Food was only a comfort when people she loved made it for her. Besides, she was pretty full from dinner, so instead she went into the living room and flopped down on the couch, not wanting to go upstairs again until she'd digested a little. Her belly was huge, rising above her chubby form like a big hill. Hotaru ran her hands up and down it, enjoying its warm pliability as well as what it represented. She didn't miss being stick-thin at all.</span></div></div>",

She looks like she just got fattened up like a pig for market!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHotaru did hear these words as she sat timidly in her seat at school. Her pudgy, thick fingers squeezed the hem of her skirt in tension, waiting for their barrage of insults and cruel jabs at her to end. Unfortunately, they didn't. They merely changed focus. When one person grew bored of bullying her, another group would start commenting on how thick her arms had grown, how plump her stomach was, how jiggly her butt had become, or even how she was starting to develop a double chin. Hotaru, having glanced at herself in a mirror earlier, knew all their comments were entirely true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she liked how she looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy didn't they?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hotaru!\" Chibiusa called, approaching Hotaru's desk around lunch time. Her pink haired friend had seen Hotaru slowly grow chubbier and chubbier, and, though early on she had expressed concern for her health, had accepted it fairly quickly. She didn't make comments about Hotaru's developments nor did she tease the poor girl, but, on this day, for the first time, Chibiusa heard another girl's loud catty remarks behind Hotaru's back. The pink haired girl gave her a hateful glare before turning back to Hotaru's sad eyes. \"Have people been doing that all day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHotaru nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, did you say anything to make them stop?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHotaru shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChibiusa frowned as she approached her friend, wrapping her arms around her plump frame. \"Look, don't let these people push you around. You're a soldier of death and ruin! You're strong enough to stand up to a couple bullies. They can't be scarier than planet sized abominations out to destroy all life as we know it, right?\" At that moment, Hotaru felt planet sized. \"Look, just punch 'em. Punch 'em really hard. That'll shut 'em up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't want to hurt them,\" Hotaru replied, frowning, rubbing a pudgy knuckle under her chin, \"If I did that, I'd get in trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haruka would punch 'em,\" Chibiusa replied, \"So better it be you getting into a fight than your papa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa wouldn't fight a child--no wait, she probably would...but I can't let her know! I don't want any of them to know I have a problem. I like how they spoil me and everything, but if they knew about my problems, they'd try to fix it. I want to have the confidence to just brush their comments off. I need thicker skin for something like that, and the only way to get that is to just take the abuse and not let it hurt me. Ya know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really, but I guess...I say you should just deck 'em.\"</span></div></div>",

She was getting larger and larger each week, and her clothes which were just replaced with new larger clothes were already being strained by the mounds of flesh it was holding.

Slowly, very slowly, they parted, Chibiusa's slight, yet still soft, fingertips stroking across Hotaru's large, plump cheek. She giggled, slightly, before running her hands up the scale of Hotaru's larbe belly, her fingers stroking the sides of her large breasts. \"I like you this way, so, if you don't mind, I'd like to be like you, ya know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you're my friend--well, maybe a little more than a friend, ya know?\" Chibiusa replied, smirking with a little blush dabbed on her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm more than a friend.

That way, I can gain a little, and since you'll be eating less, you might drop a few pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHotaru stiffened. She still couldn't help but think of the food her parents gave her as physical expressions of their love, and giving that love away felt...wrong, somehow. On the other hand, she certainly didn't have the willpower to eat less without help. If she did, she would have stopped gaining weight long ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right,\" she conceded eventually. It might be a little hard, but it was the best option she had at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, there was a knock on Hotaru's door, and Michiru entered the room carrying a tray piled high with what must have been an entire pan of brownies. She set the tray down on the nightstand, kissed her daughter on the top of her head, and left the two girls alone again. Hotaru felt irrationally protective of the brownies, but she recognized it as a ridiculous feeling, so she plucked one of the tray and handed it to Chibiusa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go. I could eat this whole tray, so I'm counting on you not to let me do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Chibiusa took a big bite out of her brownie. \"Sounds like a plan,\" she said with her mouth full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruthfully, Chibiusa wasn't a huge help. Since she was new to gaining, she lacked her friend's eating capacity, and thus became full after only a few brownies; her flat, flabless stomach poked out only a little. Hotaru finished the rest of the tray, just as she had threatened. Chibiusa had trouble trying to stop Hotaru, since, of course, <i>she</i> didn't think Hotaru needed to lose any weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next few weeks, the two girls spent most all of their time together, partly for the pleasure of each other's company, but mostly so Chibiusa could act as portion control. To her delight, she soon developed a thin layer of fat, and as she got used to overeating, she was able to make a more substantial dent in the amount of junk food Hotaru was able to eat. Where Hotaru had become wary of eating to her limit, Chibiusa, who was far too thin to have mobility problems, relished the feeling of a bloated stomach, especially since, whenever she got too full, Hotaru would give her a soothing belly-rub. Chibiusa, needless to say, made sure to get too full as often as she possibly could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough losing a few pounds wasn't as obvious on Hotaru's bloated body as gaining a few was on Chibiusa's svelte one, Hotaru <i>felt</i> healthier. She wasn't able to do much exercise, so her loss was slower than Chibiusa's gain, but it wasn't long before her clothes started to fit more comfortably and simple movement became less of a chore. All in all, she was very happy with the way Chibiusa's \"diet plan\" was working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, Chibiusa looked great with a little extra meat on her bones.</span></div></div>",

They may have been young, but they discovered the pleasures of an adult women's bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough as they continued to make out, they failed to notice the remote. After Chibusa dropped the remote, it became damaged as it hit the ground. Soon it began to spark, and small amounts of energy escaped from the small but powerful remote. The sparks from the remote began to grow into large bright orbs of bizzare energy. The orbs were bright and large enough for Chibiusa and Hotaru to notice and quickly end their pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chibiusa, what is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one of the orbs began to float towards Chibiusa until it was dirrectly in front of her face. Once it was in her face, she smelled something. The orb was producing an amorma that  smelled like a combination of foods that she enjoyed. She smelled roast duck, chocolate, and even pizza. The scent began to make Chibusa extra large belly demand for food. So Chibusa leaned forward as best she could and ate the sphere of energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CHIBIUSA! How could you eat that? You don't even know what it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChibiusa didn't hear her friend though.

Just a little flabby meat on the belly.  Her thighs pushed against the lips of her jeans?  Not a huge issue.  She was wheezing slightly after a brief walk up the stairs? A little disconcerting. Still, even though Chibiusa felt more like a younger, bratty sister to Usagi than a genuine daughter, when her pants tore straight up her butt, she became concerned for the girl's health.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter doing a little investigating, which consisted mostly of Usagi spying on the girl as she went about her daily routine, she discovered the potential source of her fattening frame: Hotaru. If the now awfully chubby soldier of ruin was losing weight, Chibiusa seemed to find it in Hotaru's wake. It was clear that Hotaru was the cause, but it clearly wasn't malignant. It was just incidental.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she needed to talk to Haruka and Michiru about all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi wrapped at Haruka's door, which lead to the sandy haired senshi emerging, lazily scratching her scalp. Judging by the fact she was dressed in a fluffly bathrobe, Usagi probably caught the poor woman at the wrong time. Regardless, the reincarnated moon princess puffed out her chest as she said, determined, \"Haruka, I need to talk to you about something important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, how important? Is there a new enemy?\" Haruka's eyes narrowed, her gaze focused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, no, not exactly.\" At this, Haruka relaxed. \"It's just that Chibiusa is getting a little fluffier, and I think Hotaru's responsible indirectly by accident for it, sorta.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, that wouldn't surprise me,\" Haruka replied with a shrug, \"I mean, she is getting a little porky herself, and they're both good friends. Makes sense they'd rub off on one another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Usagi could respond to this, Michiru approached the doorway, running a brush through her waves of azure locks. \"Haruka? Who're you talking to--ah! Usagi! I hope Haruka didn't flirt too much with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuppressing her blush, Usagi pressed on. \"No, I'm just discussing Chibiusa's weight with her. I think she's gaining because of Hotaru.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wouldn't surprise me,\" Michiru replied, \"Hotaru's been losing weight, so maybe Chibiusa's trying to help Hotaru get skinny, but she's been getting fat as a result. Possibly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How don't you know for sure?\" Usagi asked, raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're new to the whole parenting thing,\" Haruka replied, shrugging, \"Are you much better of a mother?\" Usagi didn't respond to that one, knowing she couldn't say, with a straight and honest face, that she was, indeed, a better mother. Chibiusa was like a sister to her, and she treated her like one: with condescending comments and immature rivalries. \"Look, maybe we should...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sailor Pluto was approaching the castle of Crystal Tokyo to talk to Neo-Queen Serenity, when she noticed an obese person out in front of the castle. Setsuna didn't recognize the person at first but as she approached the castle the fat figure began to look familiar. When she could finally see the overweight figure, she was shocked. The once thin and elegant Queen of Crystal Tokyo was now at least 350 pounds. Her long and beautiful gown once covered her legs, but now the gown had stretched with her belly and now only covering a small are below her hips, showing off her thick new legs. Her arms were also thick with fat, and her fingers had become stubby from her new fat. Her bosom was no longer petite; her breasts were now large and round spheres of fat. Serenity's face had large cheeks and multiple chins that made it nearly impossible to move her neck anymore. The most noticeable feature of the Queen was her large stomach that was only a few feet away from touching the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Sailor Pluto was a gentle woman, she couldn't help but stare at Serenity. Serenity noticed Pluto's shocked expression but understood why Pluto was shocked by her new look. \"Hello Setsuna-san! It's been so long since you've visited. I know I\u2019ve changed since the last time you saw me. Why don\u2019t we talk more over lunch?\u201d asked Queen Serenity in a polite and calm tone. Though Sailor Pluto was still shocked by how the queen had changed she was still polite enough to accept her invitation to lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetsuna followed Neo-Queen Serenity down a long hall way. She noticed that the queen had installed a conveyor belt along the floors, presumably to travel around the palace easier.  Setsuna assumed that with the installed conveyor belt, Serenity over used it and became too lazy. \u201cThat helps explain why she gained so much weight. Maybe while I\u2019m here I\u2019ll talk to her about going on a diet and getting rid of this conveyor belt.\u201d When they stepped on the conveyor belt they quickly reached the dining room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the dining room was a table loaded with food. The food wasn\u2019t ham, chicken or anything else Sailor Pluto recognized. The things that were on the table were lots large donut shaped chocolates on the table. The food on top covered the whole table making it impossible to see the surface of the table. Setsuna also notice several large chairs surrounding the table each about the same size as the queen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Queen Serenity could sit down she heard a servant from the end of the hall way yell \u201cYour Majesty, we need your help with an urgent royal matter.\u201d So Queen Serenity rushed over to the source of the voice leaving Setsuna alone in the dining room. Of course the Queen had forgotten to warn Setsuna that the chocolate on the table was addictive and a jelly inside that is really fattening. Soon she became hungry and reached for the table to grab some of the food. At first she took a small bite, but after one bite she was filled with happiness. The chocolate was delicious and jelly inside was incredibly sweet. Soon one bite eventually became rapid large bites and she had gone through dozens of these strange jelly filled chocolates in only a few minutes. After eating about three dozens of these strange and yummy chocolates, Setsuna was full and too tired to get up out of the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour later Setsuna digested the food and\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was then she noticed her fingers sank into the ball of mass that was her belly.  She glanced down at the small convex surface, her eyes wide with shock. How did she gain this much weight in such little time? It wasn't a massive amount of fat, only a good fifteen extra pounds, but it was fifteen extra pounds over the course of a mere hour. No doubt this is how the other senshi had grown so quickly. Rising to her feet, albeit sluggishly, she darted back to the time gate. Something had to be done to change this. She had to go back to the past to reverse whatever caused them all to gain so much weight--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Setsuna, hello there,\" Ami's polite voice drifted into Setsuna's ear. Setsuna glanced over at the girl. She too had grown fat, though not nearly as plump as Queen Serenity. No, her plump hands rested on her basketball sized belly as her thick thighs buckled against one another, her round cheeks dimpling slightly as she smiled gently, approaching the ruler of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ami, what happened here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean the whole weight gain that's been spreading?\" Ami asked, considerately resting a pudgy finger on her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, specifically.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm not sure when exactly this all started, but...\"</span></div></div>",

Ami? Are you okay?\" said Setsuna as she noticed the strange look on Ami's face. Ami had a goofy grin on her face and she her eyes were dull as she stared at something past Setsuna. Sailor Pluto turned around and realized that Ami was staring at the food on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi rushed towards the table and sat in one of the large chairs. It wasn't long before Ami began to consume as much food as she could. She ate the chocolates one by one at and ate them at incredible speed as if she hadn't eaten for days(though it was clear from her weight that she had been eating a lot lately). She didn't pause or even glance at Sailor Pluto as she devoured the food in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetsuna could only stare as she was shocked to see that of all people, Ami eating like a pig! Ami used to be so focused and disciplined, but now she just gave in to hunger as soon as she noticed the food. Setsuna began to worry that if Ami was in such a state, then all the other Sailor Scouts and Prince Darien might be in even worse shape. She had to do something about this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about to leave the room when she heard her stomach growl. Even though she just ate about an hour ago, she was hungry again. Soon she began to stare at the table as she remembered the sweet taste of the chocolates and the yummy jelly inside. She began slowly walking towards the table towards the food. She was about to sit down when she remembered that her current goal is to stop everyone from becoming obese versions of themselves. Though Setsuna had a strong will, it was weaken by the loud growl of her stomach and the delicious food nearby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Sailor Pluto...     </span></div></div>",

We must obey the queen.\" The servant replied as many placed multiple dishes before the duo, all the same, junk food after junk food after junk food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe aroma filled the room all around Setsuna, each nostril was filled with the smell of chocolate and jelly, her lips, tongue, cheeks and throat all remembering the sensation of the food she had consumed and her stomach gurgled begging, pleading for more. Her mind was saying 'NO! NO!' But her stomach said 'PLEASE! FEED ME! PLEASE!' Setsuna had a cold sweat, and silently prayed everything would be all right, because at that moment Setsuna gave up her responsibilities and her life, for this fattening meal, and grabbed the sweets. \"FOOD!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetsuna ate a whole sweet per hand, sitting next to Ami, relinquishing her ability to stand from this point on. The two were digging in like hungered travelers who had traversed a desert, shoveling the junk down like it was droplets of water, faster and faster as they ate, growing slightly more each and every time they swallowed, moving from a piece a hand, to two a hand, three, four, sticking fingers through holes or right into the things for five a hand, then from there! They feasted more and more each passing second, a loud rip as Setsuna's skirt ripped exposing her widening ass to the world, and her scout outfit tearing but she paid no mind. \"MORE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of Course miss!\" A servant replied as servants started bringing treats in by bigger and bigger dishes, the sounds of inhuman eating, chairs creaking, a belch or two, and gurgling stomachs filled the dinner hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat fate has befallen these girls?

The goo landed on Ami's plump arm. Ami was too distracted to notice the cream running down her skin, but Setsuna couldn't miss it. She stared at it, her eyes narrowing as she drew nearer, ready to wipe it off. No, too slow. Ami would notice by that point. There was only one option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe licked it off of Ami's skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue haired girl trembled in surprise, crushing some gooey treats in her hands. Some sprayed over Setsuna's cheek, which Ami stared at, hungrily. As Setsuna attempted to lick some off, Ami drew nearer, her tongue far faster. She sucked it off her face, but her lips and Setsuna's tongue met. Before they knew it, the two of them were kissing. Ami threw her arms around the taller, though merely chubby, Setsuna as the two of them tumbled over. Setsuna could taste the sugar in Ami's mouth, and remained locked, her tongue struggling to lap up whatever food had yet to dissolve in her partner's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only then that Setsuna realized how disgusting what she was doing was. She had to go, had to solve the future's problems, didn't she? Ami was too heavy for her. She couldn't push her off like this, but, in a way, Setsuna didn't want to push Ami off. it felt so good under her, the weight pressing all resistance out of her system in favor of longing, pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was wrong!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it felt right...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what're you two doing in here?\" Setsuna recognized that voice as Haruka's.

She was about to bite into it when the visuals of Ami and Neo-Queen Serenity returned to the forefront in her head. If she gave into the allure of the food, she'd end up a bloated blob, and she'd never help. She needed to get away from her temptation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran out to leave Ami to certain uninterrupted gluttony. Ami would return to a right state of mind later, and maybe then she'd be a useful ally. At the time, however, all she was was but a cow grazing. The other Senshi were no doubt equally infected with this mindsets. Their minds remained the way they were, but their hunger forever altered. She knew that, as with all addictions, there was a way to fix everything, but the problem now was that she needed to fix the problems now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to go to the past and stop the man from giving the queen that food.

Sex and Explicit sex is allowed but nothing disgusting, one on one only and nothing that involves fetishes in the vein of bondage and so on, and that includes tentacles <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. No gore. At most the girls can get gashes and cuts but no severed limbs or anything serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. No deaths, vore is okay if it's temporary and no popping with inflation and berries. (Edit: If they're unimportant characters they can die, IE Chad or Greg or nameless persons)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. No size limits, make em as big as their namesake if you want ;)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. For simplicity sake please use the English dubs names, I'm sorry but it's easier for me to remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. Nothing too out of character, keep them close to their personalities in the show (edit: Though if you want some lesbianism go ahead! Don't make it sudden though.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. Have fun!</td>",
