Ever since the defeat of the Dazzlings, Twilight had taken it upon herself to figure out the odd source of their magic. At the risk of word spreading, she didn't even think of telling anyone about it. \"Come on...\" she thought as she picked up the last two pieces, \".... all my work for this one moment....\" She had to do this slowly, the slightest movement could set the pieces in the wrong place. As carefully as possible, Twilight dropped the pieces into what she believed was their right place. For a moment, nothing happened. Then a flash of red blew forward as the necklace lost it's cracks. Twilight tried her hardest to contain her excitement, even though she had pretty much fixed a weapon of evil. Looking into the gem, she saw her reflection as it smiled back at her. Holding it up to the moonlight, a slight gleam of red and gold came across her face...... then the idea came. Twilight didn't know why she wanted to do it, but she was. Checking the strap to face sure it was tight enough, she slowly placed it around her neck. She looked at herself in the mirror and posed, a strange grin coming to her face..... a strange evil grin.</span></div></div>",

Luckily, the table she had put it on was her homework table she had in her bedroom. She looked at it and smiled to herself at a job well done. She was about to turn away when she noticed the gems color had changed from red to purple. \"Okay.... that's odd.\" Before she could pick it up, an odd purple mist emanated from it and began heading for her. \"And that is not good!\" Before Twilight could do anything however, the mist encircled her and obscured her vision. She opened her mouth to scream, but just as she did the mist began to flow into. She kept screaming, until she noticed it was slowly changing. It was becoming music, and it was becoming more enchanting and mesmerizing as more mist flowed in. \"This must be how those three felt when they became sirens.\"Twilight thought as the song she was now singing drove her eyes down. She knew what was happening and felt like she should be freaking out, yet she felt happy about this. The song kept her calm. Although it had no lyrics, she knew what it was, it was a song of comfort, a song of power.... and submitting to it. By the time the mist had disappeared, she was softly singing herself to sleep. Before she closed her eyes, she looked over to her necklace and smiled. \"Tomorrow, I'll test how strong I am.\"</span></div></div>",

My idea is to bring her to my house after school so that we have privacy. The last thing any of us need is someone finding us out before we are unstoppable.

I really don't think anyone will care. Now, any more questions?\" After a moment of silence, Twilight clapped her hands in happiness. \"Great! Once school ends, you all grab Sunset.

The other girls watched and gathered around, simply awestruck. \" Wow.\" Fluttershy said, \"Their so beautiful.\" \"Indeed.\" Twilight nodded, \"Beautiful to all, but also hypnotic to those who do not serve me.\" After ended her display, Trixie ran to Twilight and hugged her tightly saying \"Thank you Mistress.\" Twilight once again ran a hand through Trixie's hair and said \"You'll find that that's not the only thing I've done.\" Confused, Trixie created a mirror and saw what Twilight had meant. </span></div></div>",

RD brought her hands forward and revealed the hair gel. \"I figured you'd like it.\" Scootaloo looked at the jar in silence untill squealing in happiness. She grabbed the bottle and opened it, clearly seeing it was hair gel. She put it into her hair, already seeing the difference in the front. \"Let me help you with that.\" RD said as she helped run the gel through Scootaloo's hair. Scootaloo smiled in pride as she kept running her hands through. After a moment though, she began to lighten up, feeling the urge to relax. Her eyes began to glow in a rainbow pattern as RD finished rubbing the gel into Scoots hair, making it perminantly like her own. \"Now....\" RD said as she circled her hypnotized fan. \"What do I think Mistress Twilight wants me to do with you?\"</span></div></div>",

Pinkie and RD were stunned silent, Fluttershy was hiding behind AJ, Rarity was stating how the orange clashed with the green leaves, and Twilight was staring intently. \"Something was up with that rainstorm,\" AJ said as she tried to pull Fluttershy off, \"Ah know that's what turned these apples this color. What's worse, Big Mac's planning on selling these apples despite this.....change.\" Twilight pulled an apple off a tree and looked it over.

The girls gave a quick lookover, seeing if they could find anything wrong with her. \"Her eyes still have that orange sheen to them.\" Rarity said. A.J. nodded \"True, but ah don't think anyone's gonna notice it.

One by one they left until Applejack and Twilight were alone. With a smirk to her face, A.J turned back to Twilight and said \"Come back under mah control Twi.\" In an instant, Twilight was back to kneeling before her mistress with the same smile to her face as before.

She now had complete control over the mind of her dear friend with a simple bite of an apple. If these apples could make anyone fall under her control, then maybe she could use them to gain a little more power in the school. Then again, Big Mac was gonna sell these apples. With a little wordplay, she could make it so they couldn't live a day without an apple from Sweet Apple Acres. Thinking even more, if the fools ever got into dept from buying apples they could just work it off in the orchard.

Pinkie Pie: Wonder at cheering a friend up, though the dear can be loud and sometimes undignified, but it's far better then her 'other' side. Fluttershy: The poor dear is often afraid of her own shadow, but she is certainly a proper lady otherwise. Applejack: She is quite undignifed and can be a brute if she wants. However that is mainly due to her upbringing and she is able to hold it down. Rainbow Dash.......\"<br>\r\nRarity stopped at the picture of RD as her head filled with what aspects of a true lady RD had. In her opinon, that was nothing. \"Not a single thing that the poor dear does could possibly be considered befitting a lady....or female at least.\" Rarity huffed and turned over in her bed. \"If only there was someway that I could show that girl how to behave.\" She reached over to her nightstand, grabbing a perfume bottle. She gave herself a few squirts, breathing in the wonderful scent. After sighing with relaxation, she stopped. She looked to the bottle for a moment, then got off the couch. She opened the doors of her closet, seeing a large multitude of dresses that she created over the month. A dark grin began to creep on her face as the gears in her head began to turn. Rarity knew she had magic in her, maybe it was time to see how she could use it personally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(A few days later)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell signalling the end of school rang out loud. Rarity watched as students wandered the halls, looking for her target. Sure enough, she was right by the water fountain. Rarity was certain Rainbow did not have soccer practice today, so there was certainly no risks of interuption. Rarity giggled as she thought, \"Once I'm done with her, she'll probably quit the team just to learn from me.\" \"Hey Rarity.\" RD said when she noticed her friend, \"Whats up?\" \"Well darling, I was wondering if you could.....come over to my house.\" Rarity mentally kicked herself for her hesitation, but Rainbow didn't seem to notice. \"Sure, I could do with a little girl-to-girl time. Let's get going.\" As the two started heading out of school and to Rarity's, Rarity tried to figure out what to do. Through her days of work at home, she had managed to make two special things to 'help' RD. She had made both a special perfume and an enchanted dress. The question was...what to try first?</span></div></div>",

She turned toward RD. \"oh, yes. They most likely went out for a bit. Come inside.\" She said as she pulled out the key from her pocket. Once inside, Rainbow Dash tossed her bag in the middle of the floor and leaped right onto the couch. \"Oh now I want this plan to go through sooner!\" Rarity thought to herself in rage, after seeing Rainbow's beginning behavior, and in her house. RD noticed Rarity was starting to look a tad angry, \"oh, I'm sorry Rarity. You want me to move that?\" \"Oh no, it's fine, really.\" She said, trying to hide the anger. <br>\r\nShe then rushed upstairs to her room to get the perfume bottle, then ran back downstairs. \"What's with that weird thing?\" RD asked, seeing Rarity holding the bottle. \"This? Oh, it's a new type of perfume I made, and I wanted you to be the first to test it.\" Rainbow Dash just shrugged and went with it. \"Okay, lay it on me.\" Rarity gave a first spray, and RD smelled it. \"Meh, It's nothing too special.\" She gave a second spray, RD started to cough. \"*cough cough* Uh Rarity, *cough* it's starting to get a bit strong!\" After a third spray....</span></div></div>",

The smell kept getting stronger as Rarity gave a few more sprays. As the smell kept coming, RD was beginning to feel a strange detachment. It felt as if she was an empty shell, waiting to be filled with something. Soon the perfume was all RD could smell and she could barely move...or think. \"Doesn't it just smell divine Dashie?\" Rarity said with a smirk. \"Rarity......\" RD tried to say \".....what the....\" Before Rainbow could say anymore, Rarity put a finger to her mouth. \"No, no Rainbow, you shouldn't even think of using the horrid language I knew you would use.\" With the magic in the perfume clouding her mind, RD became confused. She seemed to remember speaking like that before, but couldn't figure out what Rarity had wrong with it. \"Why...not?\" \"Because a lady, such as me, wouldn't use it. I would try to be more polite about it.\" RD was confused, but listened anyways. \"Ok...... Excuse me Rarity, but what is in that perfume?\" Rarity giggled as her plan seemed to be working. \"I am so sorry Rainbow Dash, but a lady doesn't reveal her beauty secrets. Doesn't it smell wonderful though? Any lady in her right mind would think so.\" RD tried to think of an awsner, though that was difficult in her current state. \"Am I a lady?\" she thought to herself. Suddenly the perfume started to become even stronger, the aroma itself becoming pleasing to her. \"It does smell lovely Rarity.\" RD said, trying to speak in a way Rarity might approve. \"Wonderful darling, though I must say that your wardrobe is not as refined as a lady would want.\" RD looked to her sports shirt and unrefined skirt. What was wrong with them? As RD looked to Rarity though, she began to see what. Rarity's clothing was refined and dignified, made with wonderful detail but not enough to draw too much attention. Exactly what a lady would wear. \"I guess your right Rarity.\" Rarity put a sympathetic hand to her friend's shoulder. \"Don't worry darling, I did happen to have a nice pair of clothes for you. How would you like to try it?\" Something in Rainbow was wanting her to say no, trying to say that this wasn't like her. Being a lady though, she wouldn't deny her friend's act of generosity. \"That sounds delightful Rarity.\" RD said in a tone similar to Rarity. \"Let's go then darling.\" Rarity said as she got off the couch, RD following.</span></div></div>",

She was acting just like Rarity would probably be acting. It was clear to her that Rarity had done something to her and whatever had happened to RD was not wanted on her part. AJ knew RD enough to know that besides her friends, sports was one of her greatest likes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter school, the girls all met together (minus Rarity and Rainbow) to discuss what was going on. \"Alright girls..\" AJ started \"There is no why that Rainbow would have wanted this to happen to her. Rarity has brainwashed her or something, ah just know it.\" Twilight shook her head \"I really hate to think Rarity would do something like that, but I think you're right.\" \"Excuse us.\" RD's voice calmly said from behind the girls, \"Can we join in?\" The girls turned to see RD with Rarity right beside her, smiling proudly. </span></div></div>",

She held her night bag in a somewhat tight fashion on her left shoulder while she felt her phone in her left hand. The girls had arranged for a sleepover and Applejack was the winner of Pinkie's straw picking. This decision would have been okay with Fluttershy if it wasn't for the fact that her work at the shelter was busier than usual today. It was already nighttime by the time someone took her shift and only got darker when she reached her house. For the sake of her friends though, Fluttershy knew she had to brave the dark of night. It really didn't seem like much of a problem, the orchard wasn't too far off and what animals were found along the path were usually friendly. So there she was, walking along the grass in the darkness. The path was right in front of her and lights from the house could already be seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*squeak*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm..?\" Fluttershy stopped at the sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*squeak squeak..*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my....who's there?\" Fluttershy looked around for the source of the pained squeaking, her head turning about until she saw a slightly rustling bush. She creeped over to the bush and saw a sight quite painful to her. A small bat laid in the grass with a seemingly sprained foot. \"Oh my goodness, come here you poor thing.\" Fluttershy carefully picked up the wounded mammal and cradled it as lightly as possible in her arms. \"Don't worry, everything's gonna be fine. I'm always prepared for this.\" Reaching into her bag, Fluttershy pulled out two popsicle sticks, presterilized and ready for splint usage. However, it seemed her little 'friend' wasn't quite so innocent. For the moment she turned her back, the faking bat sprung towards the girl's neck and bit deep. Fluttershy felt a little light headed as the creature worked it's feeding before flying off into the night. The bite would have meant little if the Equestrian magic in the girl began having an odd reaction to the bite. She began to feel dizzy, the world spun as a strange pain entered her mouth. \"No....what......ughhh....hisss....\"</span></div></div>",

Besides, I haven't seen anything in this world that would even compare to the danger back home.\" With that, Twilight closed the door behind her and left the girls wondering what to do now. \"Do you think that maybe we should follow her?\" \"Well, ah trust Twilight enough that she can HEY!!!!\" \"Ha ha ha, I win again Applejack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight shivered as she walked out into the orchard, thinking that maybe she should have put her regular clothes back on. However, she was not going back and worrying her friends. Plus, it was still a little hard adjusting to furless skin and needing clothes instead of just using them as decoration. A few dead leaves crunched beneath her feet as she walked down the path. The moon shone through the trees, creating ghastly shadows along the ground and around the other trees. With Pinkie's \"Giggle at the Ghosties\" song in her head, Twilight kept her fear at bay. At least she could until something else came along.........<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>hiss....Twilight....</i><br>\r\nThe voice sounded close, and yet it was so soft one might mistake it for being far away. Twilight turned around, unsure of where the sounds were coming from. \"Who's there? Show yourself.\" Twilight's voice attempted to show bravery but anyone could tell she was startled. <i>Twilight....</i> This time, the voice was definitely closer and more identifiable. As it sounded a third time, Twilight looked up to the trees where she was certain she heard it. What she saw froze her in her tracks, silhouetted against the moonlight and hanging off a tree branch was a figure. Even in the moon's light it took a second to recognize it. When it unfolded it's wings and showed it's whole self however, then Twilight knew what it was. Her hair was ruffled and split and her clothes were slightly torn and dirty. As she took to the air, her grace was evident and her razor canines reflected the red in her eyes. \"F..Fl...Flutterbat....\" As the being landed softly on the ground, she gave a 'come hither' motion. \"Twilight....hiss...come here....\"</span></div></div>",

It started with a frog croaking in a wrong note due to a sore throat. This sour note created a ripple in the small pond the frog sat on. This ripple spread out in a square pattern, confusing and frighting a small flock of ducks on the shore. The upset ducklings waddled to a nearby tree, their mother loudly honking in protest. This honking awoke a squirrel one minute before it normally did. Enraged, the squirrel took one of the hardest nuts it could find a tossed it down at the noisemakers. This acorn missed the target and began rolling along the hillside. The acorn passed under a raccoon, whose paw broke the nut open while tripping the raccoon. This raccoon believed a snake was underfoot and darted towards the nearest shelter. This shelter just so happened to be in a trashcan which unfortunately was already taken by another rac coon. As the two fought, rubbish in the trashcan began to fly out and roll down the pavement. One particular piece of newspaper caught the eye of a bluebird, who picked it up and soared high into the sky. The bird swallowed the paper, not realizing it was about to enter a struggle for air it wouldn't win. As the bird squirmed, a single feather came off and blew around in the air. This feather floated through town on that disaster filled air until it reached Sugar cube corner. The window was open and the feather was blown in. Lightly, ever so gently, it landed into the tufts of pink hair belonging to one Pinkie Pie. That one feather, charged with all of negitivity passed to it, was about to become the undoing of life as Canterlot High knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alarm on Pinkie's bed jingled a soft, harmonious tune....which was met with an oversized hammer whamming it into pieces. Pinkie's eyes twitched in anger as her fluffy hair deflated. Her light and happy demeanor was nowhere in sight as she stomped out of bed. She looked in a mirror for a slight second, no speck of happy ness on her. \"I'm....in....a bad mood.\" She growled as she grabbed her bag and headed out, both a light sucking aura and her outside clothes appearing out of nowhere.</span></div></div>",

I mean...who else in this school is both an amazing guitar player, singer, and athlete?\" Rainbow opened her mouth to speak, but Pinkie cut her off. \"No one. You're the only one. Certainly no one is as amazing as you and your many talents.\" The darkness was creeping closer and closer, inches away from the pride filled Dash yet stopping cold. \"Well, I don't know if I'm the only amazing...\" \"But I insist Rainbow!\" Pinkie blurted as she got right up to Dash's face. \"Your the best around, better than anyone else in this whole school and you know it.\" Pilling out a gold medal and placing it upon Dash, the prideful athleate gave a chuckle. \"Well, I just might be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow shivered as the dark aura engulfed her, that final sentence giving it the chance it needed.

Why the heck am I letting all the losers in school off for thinking they're even half as cool as me.\" \"Such a position is only reserved for me and your friends, and even then it isn't enough.\" With a primal roar of self worth, Rainbow rushed into school, her body giving off it's own dark aura.\"Now...my other friends just need a similar yet different push....\"</span></div></div>",

Right as Pinkie was about to grasp the door with her darkly colored hand, she heard something whizzing through the air. She caught the object in question, a soccer ball, just before it hit her head. \"Who did this?!\" The girl turned around to see none other then Rainbow Dash running towards her. \"Pinkie! Thank you so much for catching that! I kicked that ball way too hard and....uhhh....you okay?\" Pinkie walked very slowly over to Rainbow, a look of unforgiving annoyance etched on her face. The two were soon face to face, the cold aura now wrapping itself around Rainbow. Pinkie held the ball up to the annoying one's face and with one swift motion, popped the ball. The color on Rainbow Dash began to drain as Pinkie dropped the deflated ball at their feet. Without a word, Pinkie stomped her way into school, leaving the colorless Rainbow in a strange pool of depression. \"Suddenly I don't feel like kicking this anyway.\" An emotionless Rainbow said as she sat down. \"Or standing.....or sitting...\" The depressed, colorless girl now just played there, the first victim of Pinki's contagious bad mood.</span></div></div>",

She then noticed Rarity was holding a dress, with a strange centerpiece sewn on it. \"What the heck is that?\" She asked, pointing at it in disgust. \"Oh, this? It's a new idea I came up with for a fashion line. I brought this dress in to see what others think. Pinkie scoffed at this, \"Well, I THINK that it's stupid.\" She ripped the centerpiece off and tossed it in the trash. Rarity just stared at the hole in her dress, shocked, and started to walk away with a tear in her eye. She stopped at her locker, found some old rag on the ground, and decided to use it to patch the hole. \"Well, it didn't have to look good anyway.\" Rarity said as her color started to slowly fade. </span></div></div>",

Taking a deep breath in Pinkie got out of her seat and walked over to her grey friend. \"Um...Pinke?\" \"What?\" Pinkie growled without turning around. Fluttershy eeped slightly but tried to stay calm. Looking to Pinkie's picture, a picture of a cupcake complete with dark colors, Fluttershy decided to use it as an ice breaker. \"So...your drawing's nice.\" \"It's not supposed to be nice! It's supposed to be dark.\" The aura around Pinkie began to spout as she stood up, causing Fluttershy to shrink back down. \"Well um....it doesn't have to...\" \"Oh will you be quiet. It's not like any of these weasels listen to you anyway. They just suppose you're one huge doormat.\" A chill ran through Fluttershy as Pinkie's aura touched her but she tried to keep calm. \"But... They don't....what's the problem?\" \"You know what the problem is, you're too much of a softie. Just so dopey and happy to do whatever someone else wants.\" Fluttershy'd mind, working with the dark aura, began to show Fluttershy  many memories of being bullied and pushed around. \"How about you stop being such a doormat and grow a spine for once? At least get mad or something.\" Pinkie turned the girl around and pushed her back to her desk. Fluttershy eyed the happy bunny drawing and growled at the memories of his bratish nature.

When chocked up with the idea that Pinkie never was normal to begin with, it was hard to NOT think Pinkie had a hand in all of this. Within the crowded hall, AJ was deep in thought as she looked over the books she had in her hands. \"Now let's see....notebook...textbook....library books.....uhh....where the heck is everyone?\" AppleJack's eyes scanned the hallway she was walking through, finding it empty and devoid of any people. Her head turned to the clock, still 8 minutes before school truly started. Without a moment's notice, AJ found her body feeling the impact of someone else. \"Ohh mah goodness! Ah am so sorry!\" AJ's eyes looked forward to see the unrecoiled form of the dark auraed, bad mood having Pinkie Pie. \"Well you should be you hillbilly. Not eat enough 'turnip greens' or something?\" The aura seemed to reach for AJ, but the girl tried to keep calm. \"Now Pinkie, don't yah'll think that's...\" Placing her hands to her hips, Pinkie began to spout off in the most stereotypical southern belle voice she could bother trying (which was still quite remarkable.) \"Oh well ah do declare. Ol little Applejack oughta wash out the slop troughs before she goes off speaking to any of us 'city slickers.'\" The darkness was enveloping AJ as Pinkie went back to her normal voice. \"Hear that? Because all I hear outtakes your mouth..oh sorry...yet mouth. Understand THAT cowgirl? By the way, what is up with your worthless clothing? I know your just another hayseed in a barrel but at least try to look normal! You wear that stupid hat even when you're inside. In fact, just give me it!\" Pinkie tore the hat off AJ's head and walked off with it, eventually tossing it to the ground and walking all over it.\" As the color left Apple Jack's body, she slumped over and attempted to grab it before giving up. \"What's the point?

Quickly picking up her pencils, Sunset turned to see a VERY happy girl standing behind her.\"Hi there!\" the hyper sounding voice of the person said. \"Are you a new student? Of course you're a new student, because if you were here before than I would know who you are, but since I don't know you, you're a new student. Anyways, I'm Pinkie Pie! Anyways, as I was saying......\" As Pinkie rambled on in her nearly indescribable fashion, Sunlight rolled her eyes and used her free hand to rub her forehead. There was no way this would be happening if she was at a school where everyone valued equality as much as her. Holding out her hand, Sunlight tried to close Pinkie's mouth while saying. \"It is nice too meet you Pinkie, but please don't treat me different than anyone else.\" Pinkie giggled as she said \"I'm not silly, this is how I act towards any new student. I just get so excited because that means that I have one more person to add to my friend list. Then again, unless that person is a total meanie pants, I'll certainly be friends with them. As far as I know, I'm friends with everyone in the school.\" Without even meaning to, Pinkie took a look a Glimmer's direction card and gasped. \"Oh wow! You're in the same first class as I am!!! That means we can have even more chances to talk to each other and get to know each other!\" Pinkie kept talking, despite the annoyed moans of Glimmer as they walked to class.</span></div></div>",

They falsely accused me just to get me thrown out.\" Fluttershy tried to hold back tears while Pinkie just stared. \"I kept this tattoo to remind me of the true path to happiness and friendship.\" Pinkie looked to Fluttershy and saw she was on the verge of tears. \"Okay!\" she said as she grabbed Glimmer's hand, \"Story time is over! We have more friends to see! See ya after school Fluttershy!\" Fluttershy watched as Glimmer was dragged seemingly against her will. The last thing she saw was her equal sign tattoo.

She could tell Fluttershy was trying to walk at the same pace Glimmer was and every time she did, the equal sign glowed. Twilight looked to the hat in her hands and grimaced.

Glimmer turned towards on of the doors in the hallway and said \"Certainly that's where my room is anyways, follow me.\" The two followed her as she went down the stairs, Fluttershy more eager than Twilight. Twilight looked to the walls and noticed that the walls were painted in an uninteresting tan. Twilight couldn't help but shake her head, even she would have picked a better color than this. Then again..... it just meant that it wouldn't have as much attention as the rest of the house. Twilight froze, the second she thought this, a strange vibe went through her body. It wasn't a painful feeling, but a strange dull feeling that seemed to take energy from her. Having a bad feeling, Twilight drove that thought from her head and keep walking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are.\" Glimmer said as she smiled, \"My little hideaway in the house.\" The two girls looked to the room in curiosity, pictures of equal signs dotted the room with equal space between. The bed wasn't anything to extravagant, but also wasn't too shabby. Twilight felt across it and noticed the not too soft feel of it. \"Makes sense.\" she thought \"You wouldn't want to be too comfortable.\" Twilight could feel the dullness go through her and could also see Fluttershy's cap glow. Pulling her eyes away from the equal sign covered bed covers, she looked to Glimmer who was grabbing what appeared to be a music player. \"Would you like to listen to a little music? I have something I think you'll both equally enjoy.\" At the thought of such music, Twilight could feel the dullness getting stronger. \"That would be wonderful Glimmer.\" Fluttershy said in an even blander tone than before. Glimmer smiled as she pushed the play button. The three simply sat as a strange mix of instruments began to play out. \"I made this myself to help remind me of equality's beauty.\" Glimmer said as she laid back, \"It's not too good though.\" \"That's okay Glimmer.\" Fluttershy said as the smile on her face got wider, \"You're no better at music than me.\" Twilight couldn't help but nod and could feel the dullness getting stronger as she did. Unlike before however, the dullness felt....comforting. As the music kept playing, Twilight could feel herself slipping, falling deeper into a sense of happiness equal to what Fluttershy was no doubt feeling.</span></div></div>",

No one would be laughed at, feel insecure about themselves, or be without friends. Because they would be the same...everyone would be <u><b>EQUAL</b></u>.\" A smile grew on Twilight as she began to feel her urges of individuality fade away, replaced by a need for equality.

It's been engrained in our nature to be superior then others, a drive to set up barriers and make ourselves seem special.\" Glimmer's smile returned she looked to the equal mark tattoos on her. \"I realized that such a thought process needed to go, and there was only one option.\" Glimmer took another walk around the principals, noticing they were trying to fight the magic keeping them as statues. \"You four are lucky, you get to witness just how much I've prepared for making equality to reign at this school.\" \"Oh yeah?!\" RD said as Glimmer pulled a small music player from her pocket, \"Just what is that supposed to mean?\" Glimmer walked up to the door to make sure they could hear her. \"Twilight and Fluttershy told me some very interesting facts about you all. About certain magical properties you hold. While the girls are now sickened at how unequal their powers make them, they were happy to use them to help. I now have different variations of my wonderful equality-based clothes. The caps I've now placed on Celestia and Luna keep them still as statues, but quite receptive to the voices of those who have embraced equality.<i> Recorded or otherwise.\"</i> Glimmer clicked the play button on her music player and sat it down on the desk. \"It'll take a few seconds for it to start, but it will be quite a nice presentation. I'll leave you four to simmer with them. I'm certain no one outside these conveniently near-soundproof walls. Who knows, you all might find it easier to accept equality.\" Glimmer headed for the door out but before she did, she said one more thing before leaving. \"Just to give you one last piece of info, if your friends wear the equality caps and clothes long enough, they won't need continuous conditioning to accept equality anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls heard the door close before they heard a recorded message assumingly from whatever Glimmer had planned.

No papers to check over, no troublemakers needing a talk, nothing to do at all. Taking a moment to reach under her desk, she pulled out a yearbook from a year or so ago and looked over it. \"Hmm....my my...these students just never change do they?....Hmm.\" Celestia's eyes stopped at a specific picture near the end of the book. It was a photo of her handing the Fall Formal crown to...\"Twilight...\" <br>\r\nThat night, that magical unusual night. The night when everything Celestia knew was thrown into question. Sunset's little hypnotic light show, Twilight and her friends stopping her....it was just all so extravagant. Of course she had to let the princess leave for home, but all that power inside her. Just the thought of it all bubbled emotions the principal hadn't felt since the Dazzlings had hypnotized her and her sister. \"All of that magic, such a student here would change everything. Plus, as unprofessional as it may seem, there was something about that Twilight...just.....\" Celestia shivered \"No...keep those thoughts away.....for now.\" However, there was no doubt in her mind, the next time that pony princess came through would be the last time she'd ever leave. The only problem was how to do it.  She had nothing to bring Twilight under her sway and nothing to help her find anything. Plus, she would need a reason for Twilight to come here so as to not look suspicious when she 'decides' to stay. Her eyes turned to the window thinking until they meet the body of Sunset, happily walking through the halls to her locker. It seemed those two parts weren't true. </span></div></div>",

She gave precise details on the usual stances a hypnotist took in planning and when to assume the worst. As the conversation continued, Celestia also took note of the many ways hypnotism could be avoided and even broken. While the myriad troubled her, she realized these would be good for future reference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sunset continued on the topic of ways to break hypnosis, her eyes darted once more to Celestia's rather quick note taking. The more she wanted to believe the principal's good intentions, the more it seemed there were other intentions. \"...dominion. Well...I think that's all I can tell you. Although I don't see why you needed to ask me about all of this.\" Celestial chuckled once again as she flipped through her well-taken notes. \"Trust me Sunset, you've done more help then you realize. Now run along and have fun with your friends.\" Celestial kept a pleasant smile as Sunset quickly made her way out of the office. \"Hmm...if I know that girl, I think I added just enough of a suspicion to my words. She's probably going to get Twilight's attention right now.\" Putting the notebook in her pocket, Celestia turned to the door of her sister's office. \"It might be best if I test my knowledge on my sister first.\"</span></div></div>",

It almost made her wish Luna was outside to see all of this, but her sister was busy at the moment. With a look to her watch, Celestial mumbled to herself. \"Should be here any second now....\" Sure enough, a strong glow was beginning to from the statue and the mirror connected to it. Celestial grinned as she saw Twilight's form coming out. \"Whew...that always takes a lot out me.\" The principal took a deep breath and tried to give a calm, yet surprised look to her face. \"Twilight, what a nice surprise.\" The purple girl jumped slightly and turned around at the voice. When her eyes met that of Celestial, she took the tinesr step back. \"Princc....I mean Principal Celestia. What are you....\" \"Oh, I was merely enjoying the sunset out here, I didn't realize you would be here.\" Twilight figure seemed to relax a moment while her eyes still conveyed tensity. \"Well...I receive word that there might be a little trouble here.\" Celestial giggled as best she could. \"Oh...I bet Sunset said that. I feel she might have merely overreacted over a simple question I had asked her. I am quite glad you are here though...\" With a 'follow me' motion, Celestial asked in the most sugar coated voice she could make. \"Would you be a good student and come into my office please?\" Celestial saw the girl nod and follow her as she made her way into the school. No one else was there so the only sound the two heard were their own footsteps. In a short time, the two made their way to the office door.

The girl marveled the taste, so gooey and sweet and yet slightly crisp. \"Mmmmm, these are really good Luna. You really should make more of these.\" As Twilight took another, Celestia began speaking. \"So I believe you said that the reason you came here was that Sunset had said something was wrong.\" Twilight nodded as she finished swallowing her second bite. \"She didn't really explain it, she just said that you were acting unusual.\" As Twilight bit into her second brownie, she tried to savor this one more compared to her just eating the first one. \"Well now, that certainly doesn't seem very descriptive at all. Well, I suppose I should explain myself, you see after you and your friends defeated.....\" As Celestia kept talking, Twilight's squinted her eyes. It seemed that for a moment everything went blurry before quickly returning back. Twilight polished off her second brownie and felt like she really wanted another despite thinking she had plenty. Her eyes drooped as she felt a strange feeling of numbness enter her head. \"Are you alright Twilight?\" Celestia said with a devious smile, \"You look a little tired. Maybe you should eat another brownie to get some energy.\" Twilight put a hand to her head, as she attempted to stand up. \"No no.....it's just....my head....what was in those....ugh....\" \"I think you're just tired after your trip Twilight, you need to get some rest.\" Twilight yawned as she slumped back into her seat, her eyes forcefully closing. \"No...I....so tired....\" As the purple girl fell asleep in her chair, Celestia looked to the clock and saw there were ten minutes before most students began arriving. \"Luna, hide Twilight where she won't be found for the day. The mix we put into your brownies will keep her asleep long enough for school to end.\" \"Yes sister.\" Luna said in a monotone voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Hours later)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the end bell rang out through the halls, Sunset did her best to stay hidden from the cameras. She had not seen Twilight at all today and had no notice on her letter. Through these thoughts, she decided something had happened to Twilight and she had a very bad idea about what that something was. Celestia had made an announcement during the day that all student and staff were to leave as quickly as possible after school and that statement had all in question. Quickly ducking into the bathroom, Sunset saw that no one was in. Holding her ear to the door, Sunset listened as the sounds of feet scuffling around quickly quieted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia looked over the camera feeds and was pleased to see her announcement was met with speed. All the students had left, which meant it was time to move Twilight from her hiding spot. \"Come sister, it's time we begin our work for the night.\" The sisters pulled the still sleeping Twilight from the locked office and began carrying her, unaware of Sunset hearing them as they left the office.</span></div></div>",

Instead of a simple click, we'll give her something she'll find quite.....enthralling.\" The Vice Principal nodded and did as she was told. \"Wait before you start it up though, we need to wait a few moments.....three...two....one....\" A slight groaning could be heard from Twilight as the 'special' brownies began to wear off. \"Ugghhh....wha.....what?\" Twilight looked at the position she was in with frantic eyes, already attempting to struggle from he binds. \"Awww....\" Celestia said in a mock amused tone, \"....your struggling isn't doing anything. How sad.\" Twilight's head swerved to the principal as her face conveyed a mix of surprise, anger and confusion. \"Principal Celestia!? What's going on?! What are you doing?!\" Celestia put a hand to Twilight's mouth with a shush. \"Before I answer anything, yelling will do nothing for you. This being the band room, there are sound absorbers all along the walls which mean no sound goes outside this room. With that out of the way, you my dear are about to become my favorite student. You see, ever since you came here there was something about you that fascinated me and compelled me to want you here.\" \"So what? You're going to keep me strapped up in this chair forever?\" Celestia chuckled. \"What? What kind of monster do you take me for? I don't want to torture you, no I think there is a simpler way to do this.\" With that, Celestia motioned to her sister, who turned on the metronome. As it started, it sounded very much like any other metronome. The drive was beginning to kick in though and soon words could faintly be heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Obey.....me....obey....Celestia......obey......me.....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have such a voice, don't I?\" Celestia said as she walked towards the chair pile and grabbed a chair. Twilight listened to the metronome before giggling slightly. \"You think this is going to work on me? Just a simple metronome?\" \"It worked on Luna and she never noticed, but it's not just the metronome for you, oh no.\" As Celestia pulled a seat in front of Twilight, she continued. \"You see, you are somewhat easy to figure out. You are someone who has little true will to themselves. You are constantly given tasks by others and you follow and you do everything you can to keep from falling behind or failing. Your mind will constantly follow the metronome without you knowing it.\" \"Well, it will take more then that to do whatever it is you plan on doing to.....\" Twilight's mouth hung in realization......already her speech was attempting to be in time with the words of the metronome. Celestia pulled out a small screen and began typing into it. \"Now that you have established your predicament, it is time to make you mine.\" Flipping the small screen over to show a green spiral, Celestia said. \"Now be a good student and look into the spiral.\" The metronome effects were already in place as Twilight could not resist looking into the hypnotic spiral.</span></div></div>",

You will obey me and only me or those who I allow control over you, but you won't think you do it because you are entranced. You will do it because you wish to be my favorite student, to receive my admiration and please me. You will study as hard as you can to show your intelligence to me and your only big desire is to make me happy. Do you understand?\" In the same voice as before, Twilight said \"Yesss.\" \"Good....however, I want you to know getting grades is not the only way to please me. You could simply stay by my side, obeying my words and loving nothing else.....maybe except for one thing....\" Celestia bit her lip, the thoughts from before coming up once more. After motioning Luna to cover her ears, Celestia put a hand to Twilight's cheek. \"You cannot explain it, but the very sight of me fills you with an odd emotion. An emotion you will not be able to control and helps guide you towards obeying me. When we are alone in the future, you will talk to me about this emotion and the conclusion you came up for what it is: Love. You will believe it is nothing to be ashamed off and declare it for me there.\" With a soft smirk, Celestia now cradled Twilight's whole face in two hands. \"You obey me, you belong to me, and you love me.\" \"o..bey....b-elong....lo-ve.\" Twilight mumbled. \"Now, I am going to wake you up in a moment. Afterwards, you will seem like your normal self but with everything I've told you in your mind. The feelings and urges, you've had those ever since we first met.\" Celestia began to untie Twilight's braces as she motioned Luna to uncover her ears. \"Now Twilight, when I count to three, you will awaken and everything I have told you will be true in your mind. You will have no recollection of this hypnosis session and will ask me what you have been doing. One....two.....three....\" As Celestia said three, Twilight began to stir in her chair. She brought her head up ad her eyes twinkled at the sight of Principal Celestia. \"Oh, Principal.....wh...what are we doing here?\" \"You had said you were stressed out so Luna and I played you a relaxing melody. You must have fell asleep.\" \"Oh...well I certainly feel relaxed Principal Celestia.\" Celestia put a hand to Twilight's cheek and softly said, \"Anything for my favorite student.\" Twilight blushed, Celestia's hand on her face gave a feeling a happiness across her mind.</span></div></div>",

Better yet, I think some of the student's would be more than happy to help clear this out.\" The woman had been up in the old school storeroom, deciding it was well over time to give the room a cleaning. Junk, broken decorations and bric-a-brac everywhere and not one bit of it had been touched on years. Except maybe for when she realized Sunset had been sleeping here before her big change but even then there was a load of dust. Wiping the sweat from her forehead, Celestia decided she needed to catch her breath and so sat down on one of the large crates behind her. Taking a look around the room, Celestia sighed. \"No doubt about it, there will be student's looking for extra credit.\" She lifted herself off the crate only to stop mid push. A glinting object seemed to be poking out of the otherwise unwanted rubbish. \"What...hmm...\" Celestia didn't know why, but the handle she saw was just asking for her to grab it. Taking one hand on the structure, the woman have a firm hug and the object was freed from the pile. Taking a good look at what she now held in her hands, Celeste was surprised to see what looked like an old arabian style lamp. \"Hmm..this must have been a play prop. Doesn't seem too damaged.\" Celeste was right, the lamp appeared nearly untouched by the specks of time around it. Of course, there was quite a bit of dust anyways. Decideing there was no harm to it, Celestia decided to see what a good run would do for the object's look. With one run though, blue smoke poured from the top and began to swirl around the Principal. It quickly enveloped her and Celestia had nothing to stop what was about to happen to her.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....or to Canterlot High for that matter.</span></div></div>",

When her sister wouldn't respond to the alarm this morning, Luna had made the assumption Celestia had already left. The storm that was in effect today might have done that as Celestia never was one to like lighting. However the car she used was still in the garage when Luna looked and now she found that the door was still locked. \"Sister...sometimes you confuse to no end.\" The woman mumbled as she entered the school and flipped on the lights. After shaking out Her umbrella, Luna began the mundane task of going up to the offices. Her footsteps echoed through the halls as she trudged her way to the office, rivaled only by the occasional thunderclap. Upon reaching the office door, Luna pulled out her keys again only to find this door already unlocked. Without another word, Luna stepped in and was greeted by the sight of her sister sitting behind her desk. \"Sister! Thank goodness you're alright! I was worried when you didn't seem at home.\" Celestia only sat thier, a proud and simply strange smirk about her. Luna stared at her sister and noticed her wardrobe was different than usual. Pink heart patterned braclets on her arms were accented by her odd choice of clothing similar to a belly dancer. It really didn't help when, with a snap of Celestia's fingers, Luna found herself in a blue variant of that clothing choice. \"Ummm....sister?\" Celestia sat for a few minutes more before appearing right in front of Luna in a puff of green smoke. It was at this point Luna took notice that from the waist down, her sister was a trail of the green must. All of this was hidden however when Celestia touched a finger to Luna's for head.

It didn't help that she had to crouch low into the mud of the stream. In science class, the homework many of the classes had involved collecting a list of mosses, leaves and other specimens. One problem known to Twilight was that while the listed objects could be found in any meadow around town, the best examples were found on the edge of the forest. She didn't bother asking her friends to come with her because she knew they'd say no. Most of the students either spoke fearfully of the forest and it's rumored inhabitant or wanted nothing to do with it. With the thought of a good grade however, she wasn't about to let rumors frighten her off. She kept following and wading through the stream, unaware of two yellow lights watching her from the darkness of the treeline. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on...\" Twilight groaned, \"Were is that moss? I should have found some of it by now.\" She had been following the stream for a while and her legs were starting to feel cramped. She stood up to relax....only to find a sight that really freaked her out. There was nothing but trees surrounding her. She was certain the stream only ran through the edge of the forest when she started. \"No problem...\" Twilight said in a somewhat-calm tone, \"I'll just follow the stream back out.\" She turned around.....only to see multiple branching paths in the stream. With a sigh, she picked one and went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Several hours and multiple failed follows later)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Twilight wasn't doing everything she could to keep herself calm, she'd be crying. Every path she followed only brought her to a dead end, or worse a similar point in the stream. She had no clue where she was and to top it all off, she didn't bring her phone. \"I'm lost....\" she whispered, fear and worry finally taking her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can tell you're full of fear, would you like me to help you here?\" The voice startled Twilight, though she was happy to hear anyone. She looked around for the source of the voice and saw two yellow lights in the shadows. \"Come with me and it'll be alright, you could say I'd be your guiding light.\" The figure stepped closer, allowing Twilight to see her full body cloak. \"Zecora is who I be, now will you follow me?\" \"Yes.\" Twilight said \"Please help me.\" Zecora chuckled as her eyes glowed even brighter. Before Twilight could do anything, the glow filled her vision. She fell to the ground asleep.</span></div></div>",

There was no doubt in her mind, her eyes had some strange sort of eyeliner around them. It was a deep white color that seemed to branch out into an odd pattern.

I gotta meet my friends so we can discuss........\" Twilight stopped, what did they need to discuss? She couldn't quite remember for some reason. Her mind kept going back to the forest and Zecora. Her bright yellow eyes, her mysterious cloak....Twilight shook her head as she drove the thoughts out. \"Maybe my friends will remember.\" she thought as she got herself ready.

You'll ask her about it when you see her again.\" Twilight stopped for a second, how would she see that Zecora woman again? No one had any clue where in that unfathomable forest she made her home. As her thoughts kept processing, Twilight was unaware of two things. The first was that the designs on her were starting to reach to her neck. The other was that she had long since turned away from Sugarcube Corner and was walking right towards the Everfree Forest. \"There was just something odd about that woman that I just can't get my head around. Why would she just help me like she did, she hardly even knew me.\" As Twilight came closer and closer to the forest's edge, her markings gave off a faint glow. A fog was beginning to envelop her mind, clouding up her thoughts. She stopped as she reached the tree-line, trying to remember what she was doing. \"What... why am I here? What was I.....how....\" She looked to the forest, something clicked in her head. It felt like there was something important she had to do, but what? Shrugging, Twilight entered the Everfree. She had no idea where she was going, however her feet seemed to follow a set path. It was like she always walked this path, like she lived her. An odd smell began to waft around as Twilight could make out the light of a clearing a few feet away. She saw the outlines of a large hut carved into a tree and smiled. Something about the sight of the hut gave her comfort. As Twilight came closer, the door to the hut opened. A woman covered from hair to toe in black and white tribal stripes stepped out and gave a sinister smile. \"At my front yard, this I find...</span></div></div>",

Twilight was understandibly still confused over what the heck Zecora was talking about. However, something inside Twilight compelled her to follow her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stepped in the hut and closed the door, she found herself in Zecora's arms recieving a strong hug. Twilight slightly struggled at first, but as the markings on her began to reach her chest, she snuggled in the warm embrace. \"Closeness to me makes the spell work fast, already I'll be able to change your past.\" Zecora whispered to herself. She then looked to Twilight's clothing and with false suprise said. \"Why are you wearing such strange stuff, doesn't it feel horribly rough?\" Twilight looked to her clothes and said \"But...I've always worn this.\" Zecora shook her head. \"When I found you abandoned and alone, I gave you clothing much like my own.\" Zecora left, possibly to search for more appropriate clothes.

Twilight instantly knew what Zecora was telling her, almost as if she was... \"No,\" she thought \"Don't even think that.\" Twilight turned towards the closest door and quickly went in.

Not wanting to arouse suspicion, Twilight began changing clothes. As she put the tribal garb on her, she once again sighed at her mother's kindness. Something felt wrong, but Twilight shook it off. She remembered this garb. As the markings glowed brighter, she began to remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Flashback]<br>\r\n\"Are you sure we should do this honey?\" \"You saw what she did with those powers, think about what she might do if she grew up! We won't be able to control her!\" Twilight looked up to the two as they argued, they had often argued when around her ever since those odd colors came from her hands. \"Well, are you sure leaving her here is the best option dear?\" \"It's better this way honey, with our luck some beast will eat her before she can do anymore damage.\" The woman nodded, but got down beside her. \"Mommy has to go now baby, take care.\" The two started walking away and Twilight reached after them. She thought they would come back, but they didn't. For a few minutes, the baby cried. It was as the night began to fade that Twilight heard a noise. She was rasied up and heard a voice. \"A child all alone, such an act I won't condone. You must have quite a chill, so wrap you up I will.\" As Twilight was being wrapped, she was turned around to look at the woman's multi-marked face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight took a deep breath as Zecora opened the door. \"I remember this mom, I remember all of it now.\" Zecora grinned, already Twilight was so close in her grasp. Looking at the markings on her however, they didn't even reach her legs. There was still a chance the spell could break. She had to limit the chances Twilight had with the outside world. Luckily Zecora knew that there was no school for Twilight today. \"I think you've been outside enough today. Inside our house you'll stay.\" Twilight nodded and hugged her 'mother'. \"Sure mom, I'm feeling tired anyways.\"</span></div></div>",

How are you three liking our school so far?\" \"It's really quite something Miss Celestial. However, there is something my friends and I have found quite a problem....\" \"We have?\" Sonata's comment on Adagio's word was met with a quick backhand from Aria. \"Oh...yeah...there was something...\" Celestia looked back to Adagio. \"Well, if there is anything we can do to help you three feel welcome, we would be happy to help.\" The three girls smirked to one another before opening their mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ahhh..ahhh..ahhh...ahh</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin those first few cords, Celestia and Luna's eyes shimmered green as their eyelids half closed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sonata and Aria kept their pitches, Adagio crept forward to Celestial while pushing Luna to her. \"You see Dear Principal, my...sisters...and I have found there to be quite an odd ratio of girls to boys. Not only that, but all the guys are either huge jerks or too wimpy to mean anything.\" \"Of course..\" Celestial said in a hypnotized voice. \"Yes, now we were thinking what to do for the case of a love emergency...and we were thinking....well...why not allow...certain parties to intermingle? Do you understand?\" \"Yes miss Adagio...in fact my female students are being suspected of it already....\" \"Perfect. There is nothing wrong with admiring one of the same gender. I mean look at you two...can you honestly tell me you never thought about it? Cause I think you should. Who needs those worthless guys anyway?\" Adagio stood up and signaled the others to stop singing. \"Now...we would like to go to lunch. I do believe that's the current period.\" \"Go right ahead...my sister and I now have things to discuss.\" The three girls felt the pink mist flow from the two and into the pendants on their necks.

The wooden door behind her didn't shut all the way, as it had done ever since they bought the apartment. Sonata was draped across the torn and grimy couch,  flipping through the television channels. So far, the only things she found were the news reports and different patterns of static. \"How much today?\" Adagio's voice came from the doorless bathroom without a touch of comfort. Aria sighed as she took off her hat and layed a small hand full of bills and coins on the end table. \"Eight dollars and two cents. Barely enough to cover our rent this week.\" Adagio exited the bathroom with a can of insecticide dangling from her hands. Her once poofy and curly hair sagging and oily from a lack of washing. \"Therefore not enough to get the water running again. I swear I just hate this dump.\" Ever the optimisitc, Sonata turned to her friends/sisters and tried keeping thier spirits up. \"Well, we are still lucky to have this dump. The landlord was understanding enough to let us stay here even after the months we 'convinced' him to let us stay for free.\" \"But that was in a room with actual beds, running water and a bathroom that wasn't infested with roaches and spiders.\" All three former sirens sighed. Everything just went downhill for the poor girls after that faithful night against those darn Rainbooms. \"I just wish there was some way we could start over.\" Sonata whined as she finally turned the tv off. Aria rolled her eyes while Adagio stepped towards the girl. \"We've been over this Sonata, our necklaces which gave us our hypnotic abilities are gone. It's not like something to replace them is going to fall from the sky. Now turn off that thing before you go over our maximum time.\" \"But I did....\" The three girls watched with curiosity as the tv began to rattle and shake. The picture changed repeatedly despite no inputs to do so, the audio creating a blur of white noise. Eventually it all stopped, with a large wooden chest popping out of the screen. Sonata jumped off the couch, leaving a spring to pop out and looked over the object. \"Hey girls, there's a note here....for us!\" Aria and Adagio followed  behind and read the inscription.<br>\r\n<i>Dear Adagio, Aria, and Sonata,<br>\r\nWithin this chest lies your hope and salvation from the squalor you're in.</i><br>\r\n\"Open the chest and you will find.....\" Without finishing the sentence, Sonata opened up the chest. Between the slight cracks flew three red gems which, upon reaching the girls, former into necklaces. As if by magics, the girls were coated in a bright light as thier beauty and clothing were restored. None of the Dazzlings knew quite what to say, and instead continued to read what was on the chest.<br>\r\n <i>In addition to restored versions of your gems, I have included a new world for you three to play in. Jump into this chest and you will be taken to a world similar to the way it was before you began your assault of Canterlot. The difference however will not only be your intelligence over the situation, but also the way your powers work. You will not only have your voices, but certain objects I have enchanted for your use. Also,<br>\r\nYou should now be able to 'upgrade' your powers based upon how many people are subservient to you. Good luck Dazzlings. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitation, each of the girls dived into the chest. Upon doing so, the chest vanished without a trace of knowledge that either it or the Dazzlings were ever in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
