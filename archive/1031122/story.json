Princess Lara, the eldest of the two royal children, had left on her gryphon steed a few days ago, an emmisary to the neighbouring Kingdom of Nithra, in hopes of negotiating a peace treaty.  She should have returned by now, yet there is no sign of her anywhere.  King Lars has sent out soldiers to find her, and even Lara's younger sister Sandra is helping to look when she is able to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat has happened to Princess Lara?  Was she attacked by Nithran soldiers?  Did a wild dragon attack her and her mount?  Or did something worse happen to her?</span></div></div>",

Softly, you hum to yourself, dressed in the same clothing that all the stable attendents wear, proud to be useful and not just a figurehead like your sister, three years younger than her.<br>\r\nHearing a loud caw from behind you, you turn around in surprise, gasping as you see your sisters golden steed limping in, a piece of cloth in his beak.  \"Farathern!  There you are!  B-But, where's Lara?\"  You dash over to him, seeing blood on his right hindquarters, a large gash in his thigh.  \"What happened!\"<br>\r\nHe caws loudly, pawing lightly at your sides, looking anxiously outside, shuddering, then rests his noble head against your chest, whimpering softly, seemingly in pain.<br>\r\n\"Awwww... there there...\" You coo soothingly to him, wrapping your arms around his neck, even though his huge size make him quite an armful for you.  \"It's alright now... just calm down and we'll get this figured out...\"<br>\r\nHe nods, slowly laying down, closing his eyes, looking quite tired...</span></div></div>",

He seems to like your scent quite a bit, heavily mingled with the smell of gryphons - you've been around them all day, after all. His nest is exactly as he'd left it of course, set aside from the other gryphons since he was one of the special mounts.  \"Here you go. You just lie down and I'll get some bandages.\"<br>\r\nHe nods slowly, laying down, licking his beak slowly as he watches you walking over to the chest where medical supplies for the gryphons were kept, gathering some salve and bandages for his leg. Then you return and crouch beside his leg, pouring some of the salve onto the wound and rubbing it in.  He coos softly, rolling onto his side and lifting his leg to give you better access to the wound.  Working quickly, not minding the blood smearing against your fingers from his wound, you puts the healing salve all along his gash and then start applying the bandages. Your intent on your work on his leg to notice anything else, though when you're done, you give his underside a glance to check for further injuries, noticing his sheath bulging quite a bit as he watches watches you still.  You laugh a little in amusement.  \"Heh... guess all that adrenaline had to go somewhere...\"</span></div></div>",

I'm gonna need you in best form tomorrow to find my sister...\"  He whines softly, looking at you, pleading with his eyes, his black cock shifting a little, the tip showing a bit.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You look around quickly, going as far as stepping out into the yard to see who is about. Seeing no one, and hearing the soft call, almost a whimper, coming from the gryphon, decides you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step quickly back into the stall with the griffon. Placing your hand on his side, you say, \"You need to roll onto your side if I'm going to help you!\" You know the gryphon can't understand human speach, but when he rolls onto his side you can't help but wonder...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thick tip of his shaft is sticking out of his sheath, glistening wetly. He shudders when you place your hand gently upon it. You're amazed at how slick the fluids leaking from the tip are. Taking a small glob that has just oozed out of a small hole in the tip, you rub your hands together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incredible!\" you think to yourself as your hands slide almost frictionlessly across each other. You look down to see almost a full 12 inches of jet black penis now extending from his sheath! It is almost as thick as your wrist and the heady scent of his musk fills the air! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a gryphon handler, as well as a princess of an area known for the quality of its stock, you're quite familar with the way intercourse works, even though you have no first-hand experience yourself. None the less, you're quite surprised to feel yourself responding to the scent of his musk! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor just a moment, you wonder what it would feel like to have this magnificent animal mounting you... Then, you shake your head. \"That could never happen!\" you tell yourself. But, the thought comes again of you lying naked below him, with just the end of his thick tool inside you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" you tell yourself firmly as you take his penis between both your hands. He coos softly as you start a slow pumping motion. Soon, you find yourself sweating as you pump faster. The gryphon is starting to pump his rear legs. His talons have come close to striking you several times in his excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he stiffens. Thick, cream colored jets of gryphon semen shoot from his organ! You pump several more times as his seed sprays the walls of the stall, splattering everywhere! Finally, the eruption tapers off to finally dribble one last glob over your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step back and look around. Still no one is in sight. You also find, somewhat to your surprise, your own loincloth soaked with your juices. Almost against your will, you stick out your tongue to taste the creamy fluids on your arm!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt has a heady, musky scent that makes you drip more of your own fluids into your already soaked small clothes. And the taste reminds you of a buck deer taken during the height of the rut. It's a taste you've come to enjoy! You hurry to clean up the stall before anybody comes and finds what you've done. But, you find yourself wishing you had not wasted it by allowing the gryphon to shoot into the open air...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your thighs sliding together with your own slickness, you tell the gryphon, \"Rest well. Tomorrow we go to find my sister!\" You make your way to your rooms, not stopping to bathe as you would normally do. All night long, your dreams are of being mounted by one gryphon after another after another...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake early, tired, but unable to sleep any longer. The scent of your own musk is strong as you don your flying gear. No one is about the gryphon stables when you arrive there. You saddle your own mount and hobble her before going to get your sister's mount. As soon as you enter his stall, he catches your scent and his erection suddenly slips from his sheath, extending a good three feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're suddenly well aware you could indeed lie beneath a gryphon and have him inside your own sex. You shake your head to clear that image away. You have a rescue to preform! \"Ah, but after...\" a soft voice whispers inside your head. You can feel the wetness between your legs beginning again! </span></div></div>",

You shouldn't even be having this fantasies anyway, you two aren't even the same species probably not even compatible anyway.

OK, you don't want to suffer like poor Marie, whose hysterics never stopped until she had been led away.   [You only hope they stopped then.  You never saw her again.]  But you are not some toy for his pleasure.  That might be fun, but you want him to beg first.  [The fact you are favorably thinking of that has got to be a bad sign.  The very idea should repel you.  It shouldn't matter how much he tries to seduce you.]<br>\r\n     From somewhere, you recall hearing \"When rape is inevitable, relax and enjoy it.\", and your mother's reply, \"It won't be inevitable until you relax.\"  Sounds like good advice to you, but how to resist?  The blasted gryphon is way bigger and stronger than you.  He is going to overwhelm any resistance you put up.  What can you do?  Nothing...  Say...  Nothing might actually work...<br>\r\n     Your futile efforts to resist cease, a surrender your assailant barely notices.  That's not good.  You need his eager attention if this plan is to work...  So as he is casually ripping your leathers off, you turn your attention to his member, which is frightenly big [and distressingly attractive as well.  You have got to pull this off quickly, or it won't be an act.]  A couple of kisses and rubbing works very well.  In fact he has stopped stripping you.  Next step, look around even as you continue to fondle his weapon.  Perfect.  Your desperate plan might even work.  Now a couple of kisses as your hands drop to the ground and get ready.  Then you are ready, and reluctant to act.  You are actually worried this monster might get hurt?  With all your force you bring the two rocks you picked up together on opposite sides of his tool.<br>\r\n      The screech of pain is all you could have hoped for.  He has lost all interest in doing you.  Now you can get away... if that massive body wasn't falling right on top of you with stunning force.  You black out.<br>\r\n     When you wake, the news is not good.  True, he has not recovered, and is still whimpering in pain.  But that huge gryphon body is right on top of you.  You are not going anywhere.  And you must have gotten tossed around a bit, to your loss.  You can't reach anything vulnerable.  So when the pain subsides he can pick up from where he left off, and there is nothing you can do about it.  Looks like you shot your wad.<br>\r\n     As you consider what to do, you notice a couple of things you had glossed over earlier.  Your sister's belly, has she been raped?, and is somehow magically pregnant already?  You hope not.  You already know she is taking this worse than you are.  You won't like it, but you could stand giving your father a very unusual grandson.  Sis might never recover.  but maybe she hasn't been violated yet.  A courting Gryphon often gives its intended a meal.  It could be that sis has just been overfed...  Well, it could be, and you certainly hope so, even if...  Well, he doesn't seem interested in courting you, which is too bad since....   You hurriedly try to think of something else.<br>\r\n     Those chains... A gryphon may be clever and those paws may be pretty good at manipulating stuff, but getting sis into those cuffs should be beyond him.  Then how? ... Maybe he has a human partner, which makes her situation all the worse.  Or maybe the gryphon is human...  She had heard of magicians transforming people.  Was this a case?  Where he still remembered being human.  If so, maybe her fate wasn't quite as dire...<br>\r\n     Your captor is recovering, and if you want to do something, you had better do it fast...  \"Let that be a lesson to you.  You don't just grab a girl.  You ask, politely, and make sure she is in the mood.  You need to make her happy too...\"  As you go on, you realize you are sounding like you will give yourself to him if he is a good boy.  That's wrong.  This is still rape.  Still, it will be a lot less horrid.  And you see no chance of escape now.  Best for it to be not completely terrible.</span></div></div>",

True, a couple of your ladies in waiting had not waited, and let slip some facts neither you nor she was supposed to know.  But most of your knowledge of the subject comes from romance novels, which were often horribly vague just about the time things were getting interesting.  But you at least know how you would like to be seduced.  You have spent several nights imagining the whole thing, and enjoying such thoughts far more that your mother or father would approve.  So even if your ideas would seduce no other girl, they have a good chance to work on you.<br>\r\n       Finally, you pause for breathe, and the gryphon gets up off you and moves over to a flower bush, and starts picking a mouthful of them.  This is the first step on the seduction program you have outlined.  He is going to seduce you?  Not really.  This is still rape, even if it is rape with good manners.  You won't have the option of saying no, and his paying any attention.  But he will at least ask, and he might do it your way [tho you are not too such what that is].  <br>\r\n      Meaningless as it may be, you are debating whether to say yes or not.  It will likely make what follows much more enjoyable, or at least less terrible, but image is important.  Your royal parents may be very sad about this beast forcing itself upon you, but they will be furious if you don't fight to the death.  However much they will grieve at your death, they will blame you if you survive, at least without clear evidence your resistance was vigorous, even if futile.<br>\r\n     You have to admit there is something to their attitude.  Granted, you would say no if it were a real option, but you might well hesitate.  And you will be enjoying his courtship, if not completely, at least far more than the more prudish think you should.  And for the watcher, the difference between you being seduced, and your being forced is not all that easy to see.  And you don't want any such watcher to decide it was seduction.<br>\r\n     On the other hand, having that big brute lay flowers at your feet, and croon a song to you [Not that Gryphons exactly sing well, but the very effort...] it will be rather enjoyable...<br>\r\n    You mind is still a muddle as he approaches, and ... walks on by...  He walks over to your sister, lays the flowers at her feet, and starts caterwalling.  You are relieved, and furious.<br>\r\n     But now what?<br>\r\n     Escape is possible.  He is focusing on sis, and you at least will get a good start.  Maybe you can even find a good place to hide.  Escape back to the castle won't be easy, but at least possible.  But possible is an optimistic assessment.  His main attention may be on your sister, but he may be watching you too.  Gryphons have wonderful sight, and just a casual glimpse..  Nor can you be sure of finding a place where he can't find you.  And if you do succeed, there will still be a lot of men who may hope for marriage by rape.  Some of them might make good husbands, but you want to avoid all of them.  You might make it, but ...<br>\r\n    Saving your sister might be a better idea, if it is possible.  She always was more uptight about sex than you were.  And right now she looks horrified by the attempted seduction.  Trying to stop the gryphon might be a good idea.  But how?  He is way stronger than you, and he might just go back to raping you if you succeeded.  Not a great choice.<br>\r\n    Try to persuade her to just put up with it?  You know she isn't going to like the idea, but she may not suffer as much that way.  Or...<br>\r\n    But you are going to have to act fast.  Maybe the gryphon will go thru several more pieces of nonsense before he gets to it, but he will be expecting a positive [or rather not too negative] response from sis pretty soon.  If you do nothing, you are pretty sure you won't like the result.  [Not that you expect anything good anyway, but if you act, there is at least hope.]</span></div></div>",

She moves closer, sniffing along your body, taking deeper sniffs over the scratches and cuts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of this, she stops, moving higher, her slender tongue slithering out from her beak. Pressing against a cut on your arm, the wet appendage begins to lick and clean your wounds. The feel of its causing you to shiver in both fear, and enjoyment of feel of her warm, wet tongue along your skin, each cut stinging at first to her licking, but then feeling very good once it was clean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind begins to wonder in the subtle pleasure, thinking of how wonderful her tongue would feel licking along her lower lips. You shake your head, such a thing could never happen.

Her slit burns with every thrust, lubricated only by your creamed shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain and again, you drive yourself in as deep as you can into her most intimate of places, your seed oozing slowly from both holes as you shudder, holding your cock in her up to your furry sheath as you flop down on top of her, exausted, loving how the tigress fights you to the gushing end, roaring with rage at your violation of her loins, especially when she is not in rut, her whole body shaking in murderous fury.  Her claws dig into the ground, muscles tense as your seed fires into her, before her body is forced down again by the sudden dead-weight of your colapsing body.</span></div></div>",

You pull your thick penis from her mouth, taking a moment to admire the way her saliva makes your phallus glisten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hook a razor sharp talon carefully under her riding leathers. Your claw easily cuts through the soft leather, leaving only the thin silk of her everyday clothing covering her body. Using your talon, you easily cut through the material, shredding everything so the princess will have nothing left to even attempt to hide her nakedness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes take in the generous curves of her breasts. While griffons don't nurse their young, you've seen enough of that kind of thing from the grass-eaters to know their purpose. And the way the darker ends have become hard, little nubs has somehow affected you. Your erect member feels even stiffer than before! Or perhaps it's the scent of her musk escaping from her sex that has done it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can almost taste the heady scent gently wafting up from the spot between her lower limbs. \"Legs!\" the humans call them. No matter. Whatever they are, they will soon be spread as you relieve your pent-up need on her; and in her! In fact, right now would be a wonderful time to begin!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing the top of your beak, you spread her legs. Her scent suddenly becomes so strong it is all you can do not to reach your climax right then! \"Why deny myself?\" you think. You rub the thick, heavy head of your penis through the soft, softer than the downy feathers of a hen, covering sitting just over the opening of her sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral quick strokes later, as the princess lies moaning softly; thick, hot fluids erupt from your member, coating the princess from head to slit! She sits bolt upright, suddenly wide awake, gasping for air as your spasming member spews forth its load!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of your load has entered the princess' mouth and she begins to spit, trying to get the thick fluids out. You tap a breast with one razor sharp talon and she freezes. You shake your head. She swallows hard! You can smell the fear radiating from her. You nod your head and she scoops up some of the thick semen. Looking at you, she puts her hand to her mouth and slurps in your juices!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks surprised, as if tasting something she should hate, only to find she likes the taste. You nod your head again and she begins cleaning herself of your seed. By the time she's finished to your satisfaction, her flat stomach is bulging. She manages to stand sluggishly. You watch as she totters to the edge of the cave, ready to pounce should she try to escape. She hasn't paid nearly enough for her to be allowed to die just yet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to face back into the cave, she spreads her legs slightly, leaning forward as her hand grips the edge of the rock wall. A bright red color appears on her face as she suddenly begins to make water. Once she's finished, she slowly comes back into the cave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want to take her now, your erection throbs with your desire! But, her middle is bulging as you've never seen before! Taking her now might break something inside her. And you do so want to make her pay for the years she's stolen from you! Oh, what to do...</span></div></div>",

Oh granted, this is where her parents and friends will expect you to go, and they will come after her and you, but they will be far too late to save her from whatever revenge you care to exact from her.  Even if you are very careful, she has very little chance of lasting that long.  And you will likely be careless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   As you fly on, the ground rolls away far below and you laugh over the foolish princess' 3 fatal mistakes.  <br>\r\n   She had insisted on a big wild gryphon instead of one of the tame ones that had been bred in captivity.  That is a mistake you can forgive her for.  After all, she was able to see how superior you are.  Not that this was hard.  Domestic gryphons are just wimps.  <br>\r\n    Then she had refused to listen to her instructor in how to fly you.  That is not forgiven. True, her folly was necessary to your escape.  An experienced rider could give you such pain that doing as told is the only choice.  She simply doesn't know how to control you.  That is fine, but her inexperience has caused you many a grief as she tortured you by accident.  Well, you will be doing the torture now...<br>\r\n   And now she has made the final mistake of flying alone with you, putting herself at your very limited mercy.  Prideful princess, she must be regretting ignoring the advice and orders of her seniors.<br>\r\n    If you were somehow feeling kind-hearted, you might feel she was the innocent victim of her parents' love.  They had simply never had the will to discipline her properly.  You have seen the same with gryphon chicks.  The one most deeply loved is \"spared\" the harsh lessons of how to deal with life, and as a result is spared the burden of a long life.  Soon enough the princess is going to discover how much better off she would be if her parents had applied a strap a few times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   But now the mountains are coming into view and the princess realizes that she is indeed lost if you enter them.

Not to mention several other tools of gryphon discipline.  She is using none of them well, fortunately, but she is frantically using them all as fast as she can.  <br>\r\n   The sheer number of blows means some hit the right spots.  Her legs jam the spurs into you.  Most hit thick skin where they can do no more than inform you of your rider's orders.  But every now and then, a spur hits the tiny sensitive area and your vision almost blurs with pain.  The whip is equally futile 9 blows out of 10, but that 10th..  Her sawing on the reins is mostly just as useless, but every now and then she gets it right almost by accident and you have trouble staying on course.<br>\r\n   The whole of it in her inexperienced hands is still not enough to dominate you, but it is nearly impossible to fly properly while she is making this fuss.  And she will get better with practice.  Something must be done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Suddenly, you make a dive, followed by a steep climb, then a wing-over, a barrel roll, and several other wild actions.

Looking around, you are shocked to find the Princess hanging headdown from just one strap.  She actually did neglect the most basic of safety precautions.  The fool.  She deserves all the things you are going to do to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   But even as you are considering how to fly with her hanging off your side like that, you see the last strap open and the princess fall into empty space towards the ground far below.  For a second you enjoy the spectacle of her falling to her death.  Then you dive to her rescue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    That princess is going to die, slowly, painfully, and at your convenience.  She can't be allowed the quick and painless death of this fall.  But rescuing her is going to be tricky.  Not impossible.  Gryphon chicks sometimes get too cocky and find themselves falling.  You have dived to their rescue a time or 2.  But the chicks were able to at least break their speed.  And you were watching them and ready for them to be so foolish.  The princess caught you by surprise and is falling like a stone.  This is not going to be easy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The dive to reach her is the easy part.  Fast as she is going, you can fall a lot faster when you want to.  You will reach her long before she gets to the ground.  But then you have to stop her fall, and that won't be so easy.  Grab her and brake as fast as you can and you will end up with just about half a princess.  Again, much too easy a death for her.    Instead, you must match her speed, flip over and get under her so she lands on your belly where you can grab her [No way she can hold onto you hard enough to stay by the time this is done.  Even if you trusted her on your back, she would just lose her grip and you will not be able to save her this close to the ground.]  Then you have to roll back over and brake for all you are worth.  If it works, you will flatten out a few feet above the ground and zoom off.  <br>\r\n   <br>\r\n   A human doing the math would take a year, and likely get it wrong.  But this is an area where you have a big advantage and have already figured out you have a margin of nearly 20 feet, if nothing goes wrong and if the ground below is level [which it isn't].  Dicy, distinctly dicy.  Still, you are not about to let the princess escape you this way.<br>\r\n   Down you go.  As you approach, you see the princess is staring at you, with hope? on her face.  Could she not realize yet that you are no longer her toy?  Well, that can wait.  The ground below won't.  <br>\r\n   So far, all according to schedule...Time to flip over and slip under her to give her a place to land.  Of course, flipping over gives you an unwelcome view of the approaching earth too, but you keep your cool.<br>\r\n   She lands with barely a thump and your arms grab her as she grabs them.  Very good.  Now flip over and full power to stop this fall.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   It would be nice if you could fly directly up.  Then you could break your fall and land, if necessary, without a thump.  But you can't manage that steep an angle, at least for long.  Instead, you must go forward and up, which makes your intended flight plan something of a U, if there is nothing at the botton to hit.  And that is the tricky part.  There has been no time to choose a path and if there is a hill, or even a big tree, in the way, things will get messy.  But you think your path is clear...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   ...almost clear.<br>\r\n   As you pancake the ground, revelling in your success, you suddenly see the one stupid big tree right in your way.  You swerve to avoid it.  There may be enough room...<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

And you are on the very edge of your ability to control your path.  There is no way you can avoid coming all too close to it.  [well no good way. A real sharp twist will avoid the tree, and send you plowing into the ground at top speed.  You'd end up being a mile long skid mark.  Just maybe you would survive that, but the princess won't, and you would be so broken and battered that you would only survive until something found the trail of blood and followed it to you, and dinner.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   You bank to one side, overstrained muscles trying to get that tiny degree of path change that will save you.  It's going to be close, very close.  You can even imagine coming just close enough that you escape, but the princess is knocked out of your arms.  [A picture that causes you to clutch her as close as you can.  You did not go to all this risk just to let her escape at the last moment.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   For a second, you wish you were human.  For the princess, terrified and whimpering as she is, this will all be over before she can fully grasp the danger.  But a gryphon thinks much faster in such situations.  Very useful in the air when decisions must be quick, and right, or you are dead, but right now it means you have a \"long\" time to watch that tree approach and get bigger and more in your way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Then you are going past it, and away from it, up into open air where you are in your element.  Success!  For a moment you understand those crazy thrillseekers who seeks such danger for the sheer joy of overcoming it.  Not that you have any intention of ever being one, but at least you know they are not completely insane.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Even more important, you now have a helpless princess.  Clutched in your paws, she can only cling to you.  Even if she wanted, she can't get loose or bother you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Well, maybe bother you...<br>\r\n    Clutched to your chest, she is a lot \"closer\" to you than on your back.  You feel your loins starting to stir.  Yes, definitely you are going to have her before you eat her.<br>\r\n    You wonder for a moment why she, and human females [among some other races] are so sexually attractive.  She doesn't look at all like a hen should.  She really ought to bore you.  But human females are anything but boring.  Strange, tho a good deal of fun.<br>\r\n   Maybe it's a survival tactic.  They may not like being raped, but it's better than being eaten, and a lot of monsters are \"gentle\" with women because they have other uses for them besides food.  Maybe...<br>\r\n   Well, it doesn't really matter.  What does is that you are getting hot and have the means to take care of that, right in your paws.  You start looking around for a place to have a quick bang.  Nothing too obvious.  Maybe best to just hold off until you reach the mountains.</span></div></div>",

Your best weapon is your dive, and when diving you can ram a gryphon lance all the way thru the other gryphon.  And if it dives, your rider can just point the lance at it and it skewers itself.  Facing one and lacking one of your own, your choices are flee or die.<br>\r\n   But the princess is in your arms, not on your back, and it is going to be really hard to get her mounted in the little time you have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Could you use the lance yourself?  Not impossible.  But frankly not that effective.  Aerial combat takes all your attention even without having to think of that lance.  You can only use it effectively by taking attention from keeping track of what you foe is doing, catching the right wind, your own maneuvers...all vital.

Your foe is not going to wait while you land and let her climb back into the saddle.  It has got to be something fast...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Let's see.  Do a roll.  Halfway around you toss her into the air.  You complete the roll and she then lands on your back.  It could work.  Gryphon acrobatics are very popular at court and you have have seen a dozen riders jumping grypon to gryphon while in wild maneuvers.  They could do this blindfolded.<br>\r\n   They could.  They are experienced professionals who had practiced their tricks until they had them down pat.  You are smart and talented, but you have never really tried something like this.  And the princess?  Well, at least the 1st part of this doesn't require her to be much more than a dead weight, but she is still going to make some fast use of that empty head of her's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Well, no better idea presents itself to you, and you are not going to run from this twirp, so...<br>\r\n  Suddenly you are twisting and rolling.  As the princess finds herself shifting from looking at the ground to sky, you fling her upward, a trick that really gets a scream out of her.  But you are busy completing the roll and then trying to be under her when she comes down.<br>\r\n   A sudden load on your back tells you you have succeeded at the 1st part.  Not as well as you could have hoped, but if she did not land on the saddle, she at least is close, and not in immediate danger of falling off.  You slow your speed as much as you can without stalling and dropping like a rock.  Now it is largely her turn.  She should be able to scramble into the saddle, bind herself in, and get the lance into action.  Should be if she had paid the least attention to lessons she could be barely forced to attend, much less pay heed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    You can see your foe is puzzled by your actions, but is not wasting his chance to get into a great diving position above you.  If that ninny blows it, your situation is going to really blow.</span></div></div>",

Now remember the straps this time.  No way you are going to stay on without them.  <br>\r\n   Amazing, she actually does remember them.  Now time for you to rattle that gryphon lance to tell her to get it ready.  <br>\r\n   Now please don't stare at the diving gryphon and start thinking about how you are dead center for its dive.  Get that lance in position to stop that dive!  Don't drop it like you did last time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Well, at least you don't see it dropping past you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   You have to continue to fly slow and straight.  That makes you easy meat for your foe, but your rider is inexperienced to put it mildly.  Any attempt to dodge will confuse her more than it will the other gryphon.  And your ability to look back and up is poor as well.  So you are pretty much confined to waiting to feel the impact of the diving gryphon, or to seeing it swoop past.  You steal a glance that shows the girl is waving the lance in what is vaguely the right direction.  You are not at all confident she will use it right, but will the other gryphon risk making a shish-ka-bob of himself?  It takes a lot of nerve to aim right at that huge needle and hope it bobbles to the side at the crucial moment...  Well, you will find out, all too soon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Then there is a swoosh to your left and you see the other gryphon pulling out of his dive after passing you.  You have done it!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Well, not fully.  The enemy is trying to gain altitude to try a 2nd dive.  He may have lost a round, but he is not ready to quit.</span></div></div>",

You suddenly realize you have been flying all day, and some of that was with every muscle you had.  You are far from exhausted, but you are shocked at how tired you actually are.  There is just no way you can outfly that jerk who has been resting all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Instead you bank and fly to the nest.  You expect the other gryphon will again try to dive at you, and you can only hope the princess will do her job again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   At least you can spare a few more glances upward now.  Not that this is comforting.  The gryphon is indeed diving, and the lance in the princess' control seems to waver all too much for your comfort.  But there seems no alternative to your flying slowly and smoothly, and bracing yourself for the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Then the gryphon is diving past you on the right, a good deal closer.  Apparently he held off until the last second, but then gave up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    But not fully.  He flies in front of you and starts flying at you, a last stand.  You joggle the lance a bit to remind the princess to aim the lance forward, which she does, and you leap forward.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The two of your rapidly close.  To the observer, it might seem the two of you will hit.  But your foe has already flinched twice, and can see your determination now.  He will flinch again.  Still, if he does, he is accepting your dominance, and that this is now your nest...  Desperation has steeled many a spine...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   But not this one.  Your foe bows his head and dives beneath you.  The princess, not realizing what is happening, tries to lower the lance to hit him anyway, but you have no problem in soaring up enough to cause her to miss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   As you watch your foe fly away to find a nest somewhere else, you can hear the princess cheering.  Just what she is saying is not clear to you, but she is clearly thrilled by her victory, which can be considered a good one for an undertrained novice.  In fact, you are actually feeling something positive towards the princess.  <br>\r\n   But you keep that under control as you head in for a landing.  Your revenge will be starting in just a few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Plenty of room for you and a mate to sleep, with room for the eggs as well.  The height assures you that few pests will come calling.  And the grounds below look to be good hunting.  The former owner kept the nest itself in good repair too.  Yes, a very nice home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The princess too is pleased with the place.  Could it be she still thinks you are just being notionate and will go back to being a beast of burden in the morning?  Is she really so ignorant of how much peril she is in?  <br>\r\n   So it would seem.  She is clearly more concerned with the chance to get her feet back on the earth than with your claws and beak.  You let her keep her bliss for a moment longer as you consider what torture to start with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Rape is definitely near the top.  The day's events have really got you stroked.  But there are a few preliminaries you want to consider 1st.  Terrorize her until she offers herself for the false hope of safety?  Just attack and take your time beating down her feeble defenses?

You will show him some firmness...  You are pouncing on his smiling figure even as you hear the princess yell for you to stop.<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n   A quick easy pounce and you will be paying back a lot of humiliation.  The princess may have some \"redeeming characteristics\" that will keep her alive for a little while, but this man dies!  You leap..<br>\r\n  And miss.<br>\r\n  How could you?  Well, never mind.  Turn and attack before he can escape.  You attack...and miss again.<br>\r\n  This can't be.  In fact... Your third attack is more exploratory than really attacking.  And as you were sort of expecting, your paw goes right thru him without touching anything, or bothering him in the slightest.<br>\r\n  \"Yes, this is just an illusion.  You can't hurt me at all.

But you can only kill her once, so if you don't have to rush, you don't want to.  Ratchet the fear and terror up slowly, with her 'knowing' she is going to end in your belly, making each moment for her a tiny bit worse than the one before...  Yes, a very good program.<br>\r\n   And that means not damaging her, yet.  1st, she can be scared, then scared a lot, then terror.  Then you can start the actual hurting..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   But for now you answer the princess' appeal for you not to hurt her with a slash of a paw.  It is not designed to actually hit her, just be an attack you would not have even dared start before.  And it will hit if she does not dodge.  For a moment, she looks at your swinging paw as if she is just stunned, but finally manages to jump back, only barely keeping her feet.  The fear on her face is quite satisfying, maybe enough payback for giving you a name like Fluffy.  But she has a very long list of other humiliations to answer for and you see no way she can pay for even most of them other than fatally, and no interest in finding a way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Now that you understand your situation a bit better, madam, I suggest you remain quiet while I explain to your new master why he should spare you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Master?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Yes, you are now a slave of this Gryphon, with no choice but to do whatever he demands of you.<br>\r\n   \"Which is the 1st reason you should not be too hard on her\" he continues, turning to you.  \"You have always found the stableboys and their grooming enjoyable.  Now the princess Lara can serve you in that role, keeping the place and you clean and grooming you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I'll do no such thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"You will if you want to survive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   A growl from you confirms that and the proud princess cowers.<br>\r\n   You have to admit the man has a point.  A nest can get messy and so can you for that matter.  Nothing you can't handle for yourself, but it is a bother, and you have to admit these humans can do a better job at it.  Having the princess as a slave would be an improvement of your lifestyle.  Still, years of her slaving away will not make up for years of you being a slave.  If you decide a slave is that useful, you can capture some peasant lass.  Maybe you will hold off a few days while she slaves, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Now, the next reason is that if you spare the princess Lara, I can aid you in also capturing Princess Sandra, and her mount.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The other princess?  Just another human for the most part.  You of course wouldn't mind mounting her, and she will make a nice meal of course, but she is nothing important.<br>\r\n   But her mount?  That's a hen!, a mate ready for breeding.  The sort of thing males kill and get killed over.  That is offering you fantastic treasure!  You don't think you would trade the princess for the hen, but the idea is thinkable.  You have to admit you want to hear more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"The basic idea is fairly simple.  You will fly back to the palace, apparently the victim of some disaster.  I can supply you with a message apparently from Princess Lara that will beg for immediate help, and I can arrange that no aid will be immediately available, except for Princess Sandra.  The girl is good hearted, and quite impetuous.  She will quickly mount up and follow you, back to here I presume, where you can take her prisoner and have another servant girl for your pleasure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"That's treason!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Indeed so.  And it was treason for me to arrange for your escort to be late when I knew you would be too impatient to wait, and when I was well aware the gryphon was eager to escape, and treason to apply some 'alterations' to your equipment that seriously weakened your ability to deal with the situation, and treason to...do some other things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"But why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"...I shall reserve that.  I deem it most unlikely, but you just might escape somehow and pass the information on.  There is no need for you to know more than that you and your sister are deemed in the way of certain friends of mine, but we still have hopes that you might be useful in the future.  So you are the gryphon's property until we find a use for you.  You are to be his good little slave and maybe he will let you live long enough to become our slave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   You have to admit the idea sounds good.  Letting the princess live is no small thing, but if you get a hen..  And if you get hen and princess, her continued survival is your decision anyway.  <br>\r\n   Still, it is best not to appear too eager.  So some demands should be made no matter how willing you are to agree.  So what to ask?</span></div></div>",

He still has to bow. <br>\r\n   But if he wants a different king, those who back the current king often show even less sense and insist on bowing to the old king's chicks.  All sorts of fuss can result.  That means killing the entire royal family can be a good idea.  Alternately, marrying into the old royal family is sometimes done.<br>\r\n   That would make sense, at least as much as you can expect from humans anyway.  They hide the princesses with you and then will fetch one back to be queen if needed.  That could be what he is up to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Of course this is all speculation and could be entirely wrong.  And it doesn't really matter.

And what risks will you be taking for this reward?  It better not be too great.  There are plenty of other gryphon hens around.  It may not be easy to find one, but it is pretty much just a matter of looking.  So what are the details?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I thought you would find the deal attractive.  Just to encourage you, I'll remind you that the royal stable has a large number of hens, hens that we will be breeding.  If things go very well for us, you will have a harem at your command.

Having a lot of chicks, and somebody else to do all the work involved... That has to be a tempting offer.  Of course there are those \"ifs\" and \"maybes\" involved. Still, it does give you reason not to kill this !@#$ when you get the chance.  Turning him into dinner as soon as you get the chance was certainly on the short list of things to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Now, you should remain here for the next 2 days.  I assume you will indulge yourself with Princess Lara.  Do try to keep in mind that we want her to live.  <br>\r\n   \"By the 3rd day, the hunt for her will have moved away from the palace area.  You will sneak in to the Princess' playhouse.  I will be waiting for you there, and we will dress you up like there has been a nasty attack you just barely survived.  I also have a few gifts for you there.<br>\r\n   \"From there, you will fly to the palace and the stable.  Just do your best to look to be on your last breath as you stagger in.  <br>\r\n   \"Princess Sandra will there wanting to get any news as soon as possible.  The king will have ordered her not to take part in the hunt for her sister, but when you give her the note saying her sister is in terrible danger and needs help immediately, she will leap onto her hen and insist you fly to her sister.<br>\r\n   \"You of course will do just that, and I expect you will have no problem making her your prisoner.  You will need to keep the ladies here for about a week.  You can have your fun with them, but we may want them back.  So you can use any idle time to dream up ransom demands.  I will contact you and arrange details.  <br>\r\n   \"Beyond that, who can say?  There are just too many factors.  But who knows?  Perhaps you will soon be the 1st king of the gryphons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   That's a title you doubt you want.  Why bother with all the disputes between your \"subjects\"?  And your subjects would be even more bother since they would object to your ruling.  Leave that sort of title to humans.

You can't expect to win all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   But obviously the princess is going to need \"training\" in her new duties.  And this seems like a good time to start.  She must learn to obey your every wish, so it is time to give her some orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   First, she is to strip.  She doesn't understand at 1st, but a few gestures from you and suggestions from the GryphonMaster give her the idea.  You had expected some resistance, but she seems very aware of what your claws and beak can do, and your willingness to use either.  So her only resistance is to only take off one item at a time.  You are going to have to break her of that habit, but right now it is pleasant enough to just see one new treasure at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The princess is a striking figure.  A tall blond with plenty of figure at hips and chest, she is arguably one of the great beauties of the day.  Certainly one would have to travel a good distance to find a better.  <br>\r\n   The GryphonMaster for one is not interested in doing that travel.  He is instead watching avidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Please, can't you give me a little privacy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"By no means.  Your desires are not important.  Only obeying your master here.

Putting you on public display will make a better slave of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The comment likely was meant for you more than for the princess.  And you have to agree it makes sense.  You can't say you want this [former?] enemy getting joy of the princess' misfortune, but he is right.  Her very desire for him to leave is a reason for him to stay.  You merely growl and issue an order for her to get back to stripping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   A moment later her twin beauties are on display.  A very nice rack, you have to say.  Firm and large.  You are enjoying this a lot.  So on to further treats.  <br>\r\n   Her flying pants come off, and then her formal pants, revealing a splendid set of legs and her small clothes.  Another growl and she is showing you her hair color is entirely natural.   She tries to cover for a moment, but one last growl and she is fully open to your inspection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   As you and your friend? drink your fill of this wonderful sight, you consider what should be next on the program.  The GryphonMaster has several suggestions, mostly lewd.</span></div></div>",

Not that there is any place to run, but you had expected her to cower against the sides of the nest.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   No big matter.  You pause to smell her.  The scent is quite inviting.  You are torn between the desire to mate with her and to eat her.  For the moment, you want to do neither.  Mating is definitely coming, and eating is still an option, but both should wait.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Still, you can take a taste now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Your tongue comes out and starts licking the girl's breast.  The lass seems to think this is to be followed by a bite [not a bad idea, but...] and this breaks her nerve and she tries to get away, quite unsuccessfully of course.  You are irritated and order her back to you.  Getting control of herself, and seeing no alternative, she slowly gets close to your beak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   This time you put your tongue between her legs.  You find her taste exquisite.  She is naturally not as thrilled and is only restrained from another escape attempt by a growl from you.  So she stays and suffers.<br>\r\n   However it seems her suffering is not as extreme as she had expected, at least not in the way she had thought.  The gleeful presence of the GryphonMaster is almost unbearable to her.  But your physical violations are first bearable, and then desirable.  You deem this interesting and continue to lick and she continues to get more excited.  It takes a considerable period, but her passion continues to build until it can't be contained.  <br>\r\n   You find her climax a tad disappointing.  Her juices taste heavenly, but it is not at all a dramatic event, no screaming or collapse.  So you try again, an attack that meets only objections to the GryphonMaster's presence, objections you ignore.<br>\r\n   She comes 5 times before you decide you have had enough.  She just doesn't come that hard.  Well, maybe with different tactics later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The GryphonMaster is again suggesting she be made to take an oath of loyalty.

So you give a growl to order her into position.  She doesn't understand at 1st, and when the GryphonMaster explains that she is now to taste you, she protests loudly.  <br>\r\n   The GryphonMaster derides her protests  \"Go ahead.  You've done this before.\"<br>\r\n   You aren't so sure.  True, the princesses has been as uncontrolled in sexual matters as other things, and her parents would drop on the spot if they were told of the full range of her escapades, but oral sex like this is pleasure for the boy and work for the girl, quite the opposite of what the princess deems the way the world should work.  So it is entirely possible she has gone down on none of her lovers.  <br>\r\n   Still, one of them may have told her that her parents forbid her from doing that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   In any case, you want it, and will have it.  Another growl from you and she is reduced to begging for mercy you do not have.  You put yourself on top of her where she can see your weapon as it expands out of its sheath.  Her gasp is quite satisfying.  <br>\r\n   You position yourself in front of her face and move forward, to find she has clenched her teeth.  This time a growl is not enough.  Nor are warnings from your viewer.  It is only after you reach down with your beak and make a snap that could have taken off her head that she opens up and swallows your tool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Or rather tries to.  It seems there can be too much of a good thing.  It takes her considerable effort to just get the head in, and that fills almost her entire mouth.  Try tho she may, no more of you goes in.  Rather disappointing.<br>\r\n   However, now the GryphonMaster proves useful.  \"Stroke it with your hands and tongue. Be the proper little whore.\"  Apparently fearful of what you would do, she quickly complies.  <br>\r\n   Much better.  She needs long strokes with her hands to get all of your shaft, but she does it and the feeling is quite pleasant.  Her tongue may be small by your standards, but it is washing the most sensitive part of your body and you are getting more and more aroused.  It builds and builds and finally you explode.  <br>\r\n   The cum mostly goes right down her throat, tho it splatters out of her mouth in several directions as well.  Not surprisingly, she chokes and get your shaft out of her mouth.        <br>\r\n    As she gags and finally catches her breath, you consider doing it again.  Definitely a lot more fun for you than her, which is a twofer.  But there are other things to do as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The GryphonMaster continues to advise an oath of loyalty, but it is getting time to have union with the princesses.</span></div></div>",

You are just so much bigger that she can't even slow you down, much less stop you.  It is a bit disappointing that she seems to realize rape is unavoidable and she might as well enjoy it, or at least minimize the pain.  Anyway, she is soon holding still as you position yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   You take your time about it.  You can slide your tool in long strokes up and down her body, a quite pleasant sensation.  In fact pleasant enough for you to keep it up until you have no intention of stopping.  Your excitement builds, until suddenly she is covered with your juices again.  This time, she doesn't choke, but all of her is wet now.  <br>\r\n   That was pleasant, but just toying with her is not enough.  Now to the big act.  Your gryphonhood is soon between her legs, and then poised over your goal.  <br>\r\n   It does not poise for long...<br>\r\n   The girl gives a gasp as you enter.  She is by no means a virgin, but the expression 'hung like a horse' is no compliment when applied to a gryphon.  None of her lovers have been anywhere close to your size.  <br>\r\n   Which is a bit of a problem.  She is just a tiny human and lacks the space that a hen would have.  So she will be far from your best piece.  Still, the saying is true, that there is no bad sex, just good and better.  So you start stroking, short and careful ones to be sure, but still strokes, and still quite enjoyable.<br>\r\n   Surprisingly, the princess seems to be starting to enjoy them too.  Not at 1st, but with each stroke, her excitement is building.  You are a bit confused by that.  She is still an enemy you want to torture, but forcing her pleasure is a form of torture, a bit overrefined really, but still falling in the definition, and a quite pleasant one for you.  Besides, she is to be your slave now, and have such an enjoyable way to reward her would be nice.<br>\r\n   But you still would like her crying in pain and agony...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Well, you have to decide fast.

And while hurting the princess is a goal, pleasuring yourself is even more of one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    You try to speed up your climax, but she is close too, and the race finishes in about a tie, a very noisy one on her part at least.  So much for your theory that she doesn't come hard.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   You at least are in no mood to do much but lie there on top of the lass.  This merely bothers the princess since the bottom of the nest is intended to be soft for the eggs and you merely force her into it rather than crush her against something hard.  disappointing.  <br>\r\n   But you find it pleasant stimulation when she starts trying to wiggle out from under, so you make no effort to stop her from getting loose and to her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The GryphonMaster now declares \"Now that the fun is done, it is time for her to take the oath of slavery.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Never!  I'll die fir..\"  A growl from you reminds her she may be speaking the literal truth.  Thereafter she begs and stalls, but the final result is not in doubt.  \"If I must, I must...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The oath is long and detailed, describing in a tremendous variety of details and ways she is acknowledging being no more than your tool, without any right or ability to do other than your will.  You lose track of all the details long before it ends.  But the princess is not taking it well.  In fact she has a steady stream of tears coming down.  So you find it enjoyable.<br>\r\n   The GryphonMaster explains that she is now legally your property.  Even if she were to escape and return home to become queen, you could simply order her back her and she would be required to come.  He gives a variety of reasons why this is so, but you pay little attention, deeming it so much hot air.  If she escapes, she will find some excuse to ignore the oath.  Still, the oath may mean that some humans may find it convenient to bring her back to you.  More important, the princess clearly feels the oath means something.  And as long as she does, it does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Now I must take care of other matters.  Remember, on the 3rd day, sneak back to the Princess' playhouse.  If things go as they should, you would not be spotted no matter how open you are, but best not take any chances.  From there, we will start step 2 of this revolution.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    With that, he vanishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    So now what?

Of course, this takes a good deal of ordering to give her the idea what you want.  And she is not as good at it as the groom you are used to [stupid chick neglected all of her studies, especially those involving work], so it takes her some time.  Still, it is a relief to be out of harness.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Now you could use a little grooming.  This time the princess gets the idea right away.  And your harness packs contain a few grooming tools, which she is able to use well.  Apparently all the time she spent making sure her own hair was perfect [even if the servants did the actual work] was useful training.  Just the same there is a whole lot of you to groom, and the job takes hours.  <br>\r\n   Not that you complain.  In fact, you are starting to think that it is just as well the princess may survive for some time as your slave.  She does a nice job now and should improve with practice.  She will be nice to have around.  Still, the picture of your revenge by very slowly killing and eating the princess is highly enjoyable.  Definitely not to be abandoned just for a few feathers being smoothed.<br>\r\n   But at least you are not thinking so hard of ways to cheat on the deal and get both hen and revenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Eventually you are properly groomed, at least by the standards you want to apply for now.  so now what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Hmm...  The place is a bit of a mess.  The prior occupant was a young male who of course did as little cleaning as he could.  Since you want a hen to be moving in shortly, the place needs some work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    But the grooming has left you a bit stroked.

She doesn't understand at 1st, but as your staff begins to emerge, she gets the idea.  At 1st, she doesn't resist much, but as you push her to climb onto your stomach, she realizes your intent is for her to impale herself, another step in her acknowledging your mastery.  As has been the pattern, she objects, but not for long.  A growl and she is straddling you, facing your weapon.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   She takes her time before mounting you.  Her 1st act is to apply hand to your monster, apparently hoping a hand job will satisfy you. You doubt it will, so you let her continue.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   She has to take long strokes to get all of your equipment and it takes some time to get you fully excited.  But it does build up.  You know you will come soon...<br>\r\n   And so you do.  Quite a spurt that goes all over the lass.  She looks at you in the hope you are satisfied, but you want her on you and gesture for her to mount you.<br>\r\n    She buys a little time by using a hand on you again, which you allow since she is using her other hand on herself, apparently having accepted that she is going to have to do you and wanting to be a little warmed up.<br>\r\n   At your order, she positions herself on the tip of your spike and pauses until you order her with another growl to continue.  Then she plunges down.  <br>\r\n   As before, she is just not big enough to be a really good lay for a gryphon.  Still, she brings you quickly to release.  And she has suffered another reduction in status, being no longer able to say she was merely attacked by you.  In some respects her being forced to pleasure you would make no difference, but it is still harder for her to think of herself as the innocent victim when she was the one taking the active role, no matter how much she was forced into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    But you feel in the mood to give her a reward, that being the right to sleep cuddled up with you.  You of course do not bother to consult her about this reward, but it is one she definitely appreciates since she is still naked, and the night is cold, at least by human standards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The next day, you awaken feeling a need, that of hunger.  Now that you think of it you have not eaten all day yesterday.  It was just too busy a day.  So it's time to go hunting today.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   But what about the princess?  It seems pretty much a no brainer.  Just leave her here to clean up the place.  Still, maybe it is wise to keep her close to you, even if that is more trouble.</span></div></div>",

So rush off in pursuit now.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   A human might deem it blind pursuit, but you are a creature of the air, and so was whatever stole her.  As open as the sky looks, there are certain directions that are much more likely than others are.  So you climb as high as you can and then fly off in the most likely.  The odds are not nearly as good as you would like, but you have good odds of catching it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   You are beginning to worry as you fly and fly and see no sign of your quarry.  There is all too much chance you selected the wrong way.  Are you doomed from the start?  But then you spot something far below.  As you continue to fly, you get a better view and get the good news that you were right.  The princess is below!<br>\r\n   The bad news is that it's a dragon carrying her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   It's rather a little dragon, by dragon standards.  Of course, if it had been a big one, it likely could not have flown high enough to reach your nest.  But little still means big enough to give you serious pause.  Were the princess not involved, you would steer clear of it.  But she is, and so you are going to have to deal with this brute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   No sense in trying to bargain.  Dragons have this ego problem that makes them think they are superior to everything, even gryphons.  No threat you can make will hold water.  And dragons have this thing about princesses.  Even if you were willing to pay a ransom, the greedy dragon would demand something outrageously impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   So direct fight or be sneaky?  You have the advantage of surprise now, and could lose it at any time.  A swift attack could work wonders.  But the princess could easily fall to her death.  Very serious risks that way.<br>\r\n   Maybe something sneaky like follow and wait for the dragon to land and leave the princess, and then grab her back?  Safe and easy, if everything goes well, which is not likely.</span></div></div>",

So you are going to have to feed her.  The simple way is to use your beak to carve up the food for her.  A few chews and you are dangling scraps of meat small enough for her pitiful mouth and teeth to handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    As she starts taking the meat, you realize there is something odd about the situation.  Something quite familiar actually, but also strange You think about for a minute ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   It finally hits you.  You are acting like a proper parent, going out of your way to feed your new chick.

You drop the meat and bound away as if she were a horror attacking you.  The princess has no idea what has upset you of course, but you are being entirely rational.

Instead you \"cower\" as far from her as you can get while she fills her belly.  The idea you might grow tolerant, much less fond, of her is horrifying.  You try to tell yourself you are just being paranoid.  One little moment like that surely has no meaning ...<br>\r\n   But when night falls and she comes to sleep with you, you are almost ready to flee the nest rather than let her.  But the facts are still the facts.  She has to be kept alive, at least for a little while, and that means she is not to freeze.  And that means she must huddle against you all night.  <br>\r\n   Only this night, she is not the one shaking with fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   By morning you have decided that you were worried about nothing.  How could you seriously think you could like such an affront to your gryphonhood?  Pure hysteria.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   In any case, you have other things to do today.  You are going to have to leave the princess on the morrow, possibly overnight.  Given she has already been stolen once, you need to do something to keep her saf... that from happening again.  <br>\r\n  The basic idea is to build a little hidey hole.  Something she can duck into if something approaches.  A really good one will take all day to make.  An alternative is to make a patrol of the borders of your territory.  Announcing to all of your neighbors that a powerful gryphon is in residence and is ready to punish incursions can make hiding unnecessary.  Still, that may not convince all, and it will not leave time to make a good place to hide.</span></div></div>",

Something could still come in your absence and snatch the princess.  So you are going to have to hide her very well.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The basic idea is simple enough.  Usually at least one gryphon parent is always present, but there are those exceptions.  So a nest contains little holes where a gryphon egg or chick can be stashed.  They aren't really good hiding places, and will be even less good for a human, but with a little work, they should be effective for anything but a determined search.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   First you need to find one of these little holes, which takes little time now that you are looking for one.  But you search until you are satisfied you have found all, a total of 6.  As it happens the 1st found is the best for your purposes, and you get to work altering it to conceal a human.<br>\r\n   The princess gets the idea fairly quickly and starts helping.  Her 1st efforts are a disaster, but you let her persist and are shocked at how much she improves your ideas.  Since you know it's there, you can spot it, but any visiting gryphon is going to be digging at random.  It will even be warm enough that she can sleep alone in it.  Not warm enough to be comfortable, but you no longer have to worry about losing her to cold.<br>\r\n   You suppose you should not be this shocked.  Humans are tricky little things and you were captured because they are so good at hiding.  That the princess can hide so well is just to be expected.  But you are so used to her being incompetent at everything.  It wasn't what you thought would happen.  <br>\r\n   Well, it is no big thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   But you realize most of the day is done.  If the princess does a proper job of grooming you, there won't be time for sex.  Well, a quickie or so, but noting like as much as you are in the mood for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Sigh, you just can't have everything. </span></div></div>",

She is learning pretty fast about proper gryphon grooming.  She was a dead loss as a princess, but she is doing pretty well as a slave girl.  The long strokes and the scratching is so soothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   However, you suspect she is stretching the job out, hoping it will last until you are ready to sleep.  If so, she is out of luck.  You may not want to bother with a lot of sex right now, but you are going to get off tonight at least.  So just as she is getting her hopes up, you roll over and gesture at your enlarged organ.  <br>\r\n   She is not at all willing at the moment, but has learned you do not take no for an answer.  So she tries to satisfy you with a hand job.  A warning growl tells her more is required.  She still hesitates, but before you deem it necessary to apply some chastisement, she gets an idea and surrounds your tool with her breasts.  Then she starts rubbing up and down.  Being well endowed, she manages to   <br>\r\nengage your entire member.  It's surprisingly exciting, and leads to a tremendous explosion, that goes most everywhere.  <br>\r\n   This of course means the princess must go back to work cleaning you up, and you drift off to sleep before she is done.  You wake to find she spent the night with you again.  You had been intending to have her use her hidey-hole, but decide not to bother about it.  <br>\r\n   Instead, you must get ready to capture the other princess.

Several of the workers approach, apparently protesting, but they are just workers.  They have no authority over the princess and she does over them.  So they are set to work helping her instead of stopping her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   It takes way too long in your view of course, but eventually she is ready to go to her doom.  You rush out ready to take off and lead her and she follows.  then you are both airborne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   You take a wrong direction at first.  They will certainly send others after you, and you don't want them to have a direction.  The princess might suspect, so you need to disguise this a little.  Fortunately that is not too hard.  You need merely find a big landmark and turn there to the proper direction.  It helps also that you can search for updrafts that easily carry you higher in the air and allow you to travel long distances with very little effort.  As you use each, you have to change direction each time, and the princess will be hard put to realize you are nowhere near the original direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    All in all, it is a very pleasant flight for you.  You have your hen all but in the nest and you have two little pieces to play with.  You consider cheerfully what you will be doing to the girls.  The GryphonMaster wants them alive, but he surely doesn't need more than one of them, and you are not eager to please him anyway.  You have a long list of tortures you will try over the next week or so.  <br>\r\n   First of all, you have to deal with your hen.  Revenge is all very well, but it can wait.  Tonight is going to be a night to remember.  Yes, indeed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The mountains appear, and then grow.  Finally you are approaching the nest.  All is as expected.  You and the princess land.  As the little princess gets off the hen, the older girl is yelling something, quite possibly a warning of how much danger she is in, but it is too late for her now.  She is so deeply trapped, you can ignore her for the moment and concentrate on the hen.</span></div></div>",

Now it is time to display what a great male you are.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The courtship dance varies from gryphon to gryphon, but the basic are the same.  You are showing her all your good qualities, so you must strut for her, do some flying tricks, muscle tricks, doing them in the order demanded by her, without her telling you which trick she wants next... [ok, it shows intelligence and your willingness to pay attention to her needs, but you still deem it her taking advantage of you.  Can't she just say what she wants?]<br>\r\n    It is really all just a formality in your case.  What sensible hen is going to reject something like you?  Still, it is an important formality.  A gryphon hen is absolutely loyal to her mate, unless something better comes along.  The better you impress her, the less chance of anything better showing up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Her acceptance is eager, but one last formality must be taken care of.  She needs to be fed by you.  There is some leftovers around the place, but fresh meat would be so much better, and you have these humans around here.  One of them might as well do something useful...by being an excellent meal.  The younger lass ought to be the more tasty, so you advance on her...<br>\r\n    And find the hen in your way!  <br>\r\n    She hisses that you are not going to harm her little chick.  She will stop you.<br>\r\n    Stop you?  How?  She is barely over half your size.  And that difference is all muscle.  Not to mention you have spent so much time learning how to fight well.  You could be 2, maybe 3 of her, and not work up a sweat.  What can she possibly do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    ... except make your life a misery.<br>\r\n    There is that...  You will be living with her day after day after day, and each day she can keep pecking at whatever you do to irritate her.  And you can't strike back because she will just fly away, and you want her here.  You just have to sit there and take it.  Or you can just accept in the first place that she gets her way.  Women...how do such weak things get to be so powerful?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Having been a mated gryphon, you know you are licked right from the start, but you figure you might as well make some noises.  There is always the chance she is not as determined as she pretends.  And you do want her knowing you are doing her a favor.  But you know even as you roar at her that you are nothing but noise, and she knows just as well that you will yield and all your threats mean nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     But the little princess doesn't know it.<br>\r\n     Just as you are ready to back down, she steps in front of the hen, who tries to get her behind her, only to be ordered not to by the princess.  The silly goose actually thought you were about to attack the hen and is trying to save her.  Now she is at your mercy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Well, not quite.  The hen gives you a look that warns you there are very definite limits on what you may do to the princess, but you do have a good deal more freedom than you had.  In effect, the princess has acknowledged her slave status.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Stripping her seems the best way to confirm that without getting your hen stirred up.  So just rip it off her?  Or order her to take the clothing off?<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

But you might as well make sure she realizes her status is that of slave.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Step one is to hook one of your sharp claws into the top of the lass's flying garment.  A quick jerk and her clothing is ripped open well below her waist.  She tries to keep herself decent, but now you carefully insert all claws into the outfit and pull, going all the way to her feet.  Now she is dressed in an armful of rags.  Hardly a bit of cloth is more than a couple of inches wide.<br>\r\n   The girl remains a little too defiant in your view, so you put a paw on her head and force her down.  She resists at first, so you change your plans from having her kiss your paw to having her kiss your tool.  She resists of course, but there is no chance of her being successful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    But then, you would have thought that there was also zero chance of her swallowing your entire staff. ...  That magic the GryphonMaster gave you works!  You fit nicely into her mouth! [Nicely in your view of course. She is nearly choking.]  For a moment, you consider just thumping away at her, but you have a hen waiting.  A mere human can wait for your spare time.<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n    You push the lass off your rod and grab some of the leftover meat, which you take over to your hen.  She eats, and then formally accepts you as her mate.  You rub beaks and then bodies, and then she presents herself.  And you mount her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Ah bliss...  The humans can be fun, but they are just humans.  They just don't compare to a real hen.  Your joy increases until you explode into her.  What you have been working for all this time ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Once you are done, you take a moment to scream your joy to the skies.  When you return your attention to the nest, you find the 2 girls are huddled behind your hen, who is treating them like chicks.  So much for any ideas of bothering them tonight.  Ah well, that can wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Right now, you should get these flying harnesses off you and the hen.  Tearing them off is a bit of fun, but having the girls remove them helps train them as proper slaves.  <br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

So you order the girls to remove your and your hen's harness.  It takes a bit to get the message across, but your hen is just as eager to get the harness off.  They don't really bother, but it is more comfortable without them.  <br>\r\n   It takes a bit of time removing the harness, and once that is done, you set to work altering it.  Several parts are meant to control the gryphon of course, and you destroy or remove them.  You question whether you will ever wear this harness again, but if you do, you definitely want to be the one in charge.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Once both harnesses are off and altered, it is time for sleeping, and you pass a very pleasant night.  You snuggled up with your hen makes this hard to avoid.  It would be better if the 2 girls were not also snuggled up with the 2 of you, but if it makes the hen happy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The next day is a hunting day of course.  The leftover meat won't last long with the 2 of you going after it.  [4 technically, but compared to you and the hen, the girls eat nothing.  Indeed, they can likely get by on the scraps you miss.]  And you expect the hunt for the princess to cover this area in a day or 2.  The GryphonMaster wasn't sure, but if you stock up now and then hunker down for the next few days, the hunt will go elsewhere.  So step one is to get a good supply of meat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Having been raised from her egg in captivity, and from captive-born parents as well, the hen is about useless as a hunter.  That's something you will have to train her in, later.  Right now, you want results and so must do all the hunting for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   It's a so-so day for hunting, and when you finally find a proper meal, it is inconsiderate enough to run for cover.  It doesn't make it, but you still get roughed up and are more tired than you had hoped.  But even if you have complaints, you have your rations.  Maybe you will need a bit more, but you can get by with this much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Returning to the nest, you see nothing of course.  That little toy of the GryphonMaster's works amazingly well, and at any distance at all, there is just bare rock ahead.  But something seems a bit wrong...<br>\r\n    When you get close enough to finally see the nest, you see things are very wrong.  The nest is empty!  No hen!  No girls either for that matter.<br>\r\n    Dropping the meat and checking around, you soon find the hen's harness is also missing.  Clearly the girls put it back on the hen and are now flying back to the castle!<br>\r\n    You have got to chase them down.  That won't be too difficult.  The hen is slower than you, and burdened with 2 riders.  Not that they are heavy [tho the extra weight will slow the hen a little], but the harness is made for 1 rider.  If they try to fly fast, they will soon have only 1 rider.  So you should have little problem overtaking them.<br>\r\n   If you take the right path...  They might take the roundabout way you came here, or the direct route.  Which way to follow?</span></div></div>",

But it is also the longer route.  If you take the shorter path and don't find them, there is a chance of finding them on the other one.  So off you fly on the direct path, worrying that everything is ruined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   There is little to do but worry.  You of course must concentrate on flying fast and furious, but that really does not take that much time.  You have loads of time to curse your willingness to keep that harness.  For that matter, just a simple act of telling the hen not to let the girls leave the nest would have done the job.  They had no way to force her to fly off.  But no...  you just didn't think of the chance they might try to run away from your plans of torture and rape.  Somehow you had this idea they were just going to stay there and let you do what you wanted.  How could you have been so dumb?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    You have all too much time to figure out the answer as there is nothing in sight.  Finally, the castle is close ahead.  It is still way out of sight, but even if the hen is ahead of you, she will reach the castle before you can catch her.  Time to switch to the other path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Once there, you start flying away from the castle.  If the hen was taking her time, as you expect, she has not gotten here yet, and so you have intercepted her.  If she has passed here, it is already too late.  You can only hope. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   For some time, you hope, and worry.  But as you start to really worry, you finally see them, far ahead and well below.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Now how to persuade them to turn around?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The same trick you tried on the dragon could work here.  A diving challenge, the hen desperately turns, and one or both girls fall off.  You should be able to grab them as they fall, and then it's back home.  But they may be well tied on...<br>\r\n   Maybe just order the hen to turn around.  She surely wants to stay there.  So you just tell her to go home and she will.  But she is used to obeying her rider.  She may refuse to listen to you.</span></div></div>",

All you have to do is let go and Sis is a red spot on the ground.  She has to know you are not eager to do that.  Indeed, you have no intention at all of letting her off that easy.  But she can't know that.  She has to face an apparently very real chance that if she doesn't do as told, her beloved sister is dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   And she is riding a reluctant mount.

But it hardly takes more than a paw to hold her in position, and despite [or maybe because of] her cries, you leisurely get in position for a full thrust into her back door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Once again, you find the new toy very useful.  You sink your entire shaft into a hole you could not have entered at all before.  Instead you merely filled her up.  More than fill her, to judge by her screams, but these are largely screams of outrage, not of savage pain.  In either case, they are pleasing to your ear, as are the physical sensations you get as you thrust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   This time you are quick to come, and you see her looking much more violated.  You are not sure if you want to end her virginity just yet, or get to your hen right away.  The more punishment the better, and the more fun, but she might enjoy that, at least enough to take the edge off her current shame.</span></div></div>",

She objects, but she is hopelessly overpowered in the first place, and in no position to fight either.  A moment later you are plunging in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Once again, your tool is resized to fit, tho perhaps not as efficiently this time, at least if you measure by her cry of pain.  Apparently, she is..er..was a virgin and full is a little too full.  Of course these humans have a thing about virginity, and she may be upset abut losing that status.  Well, that's just jam for you.  <br>\r\n   You continue to thrust and enjoy yourself as she sobs beneath you, but you notice they are changing tone.  The sobs of anguish are becoming sobs of passion.  A rather unexpected event, and not a welcome one.  But you hardly want to stop now, and thrust away, hoping to come before she does.  That you succeed at, but even as you withdraw, she shutters from her own climax.  <br>\r\n   Looking her over, you are rather confounded.  You had expected terror of you, dismay at her fate, and at least an attempt to hide from you.  The 1st two you think you see, but she is definitely making no effort to stop you from continuing.  Not that she could stop you, but she should be trying a little..<br>\r\nHowever, your hen is now calling, and that makes the girl unimportant.  You rush to become a divinely happy gryphon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    And so to bed.  Maybe a harder day than you had been planning, but right now you can not be happier despite the flaws.  Even the two despised humans cuddling up to you seems right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Morning brings the start of a time of relaxation, even idle boredom.  You have plenty of food, and don't need to leave the nest.  More important, you have been warned not to.  The hunt for the missing princesses will be covering this area soon.  Maybe today, maybe in the next 2 or 3 days.  So you must hide.  There may be none in the mews who can come close to matching you.  Maybe not even any 2 unless they work together very well.  But there are dozens of gryphons in the mews.  Should they discover you, all you can do is flee, or make sure they never discover you in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   So how to pass the time?  Well the older lass, your former rider could use a working over.  Indeed, she is acting just like she expects you to give her the same treatment you gave her sister and she does not expect to find it enjoyable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    You will enjoy it of course, but maybe let her stew a bit.  She can spend the day grooming you and then tomorrow...</span></div></div>",

Granted, without it, you would simply be too big to enter at all, but it shrinks you to the proper size to enter, which is small enough that she can handle it.  And she is doing a good job of handling it.  Indeed she is building up to climax and then reaching it and your own excitement makes stopping out of the question.  A moment later you are baptizing her final hole.  Well, at least you had fun.  You remind yourself that no matter how much you want the girl to suffer for her sins, it would be silly to hurt yourself just to hurt her.  Still, you are not in the best of moods as you order the girls to start grooming the 2 of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    As they get to work, you consider what to do with them should a scout appear.  Holding them close has a good chance of controlling them, but if you slip at the wrong moment, a sudden scream would be a real problem.

They do not get the idea at 1st, and you wish you had taken that communication device before you are done, but eventually they realize you want to watch some lesbian incest.  As you had hoped the elder sister is not adverse to the idea, at least when refusal angers you.  And the younger girl is horrified by the plan.  <br>\r\n   But she has no choice but to submit and soon the lasses are kissing and caressing each other. [And you are stroking yourself]  The elder of course is the more active, and the one enjoying it the most, but the youngster is not passive.  Hands, and then tongues, caresses their breasts, and then each is burying her tongue in her sister's pussy, and enjoying it.  The elder sister is on top of course and not letting her sister stop, even after she climaxes and does so again.  The 3rd time both come together.  A moment later comes your 2nd eruption.  Definitely a great idea, no matter how much the lass was actually punished.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   As they relax, you look over the guilty sister.  Hard to tell with these strange humans, but she seems cowed.  Next time she will keep quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   As it happens, she doesn't have another chance.  The next couple of days produce few scouts, and those far away.  The day after that, nothing.  The search is moving elsewhere and will not be back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Now to a normal life.

A couple of reasonable sized ones are smart enough to watch the sky and escape as well.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   But eventually, you find what you are looking for, a big buck that is too hungry for his own good.  So as he chows down, you dive down, with predictable results.  He may be big by deer standards, but you are several times his size and he dies before he is even aware you are there.  Just about a perfect kill.  You suppose that at one of those diving competitions the humans put on, you might have gotten silver instead of gold, but you would bet on winning one of those silly events too.  In any case, you have plenty of fine eating here.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   So off to your nest again.  The deer is a serious load, but well below your limit.  Still, you are feeling a bit tired as you arrive at the nest.<br>\r\n  Which is empty again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  You look frantically around and discover the elder lass is still here.  That suggests this was not another escape attempt, but what has happened?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   A cry from below alerts you.  Looking down to the base of the cliff, you see you hen, and it seems she has caught something... A moose!?  What the devil?  A moose is big enough to give you trouble.  Oh, you are a heavy favorite of course, but a broken wing or leg often means death for the wild creature, and a moose is big enough to break a few of your bones before he is meat.  Even 100-1 odds are not good when you die from the one.  And your hen is much smaller, and even less skilled.  She would still be a clear favorite, but the chance of injury is way too high. Is that why she is down there?  Too injured to fly?  You rush down to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   No, she is fine. Not a scratch on her.  Her problem is more mundane.  She just can't carry a full moose up to the nest.  Not surprising.  It's going to be a tough haul for you.  But what happened?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Well, she was getting hungry, and when the girl suggested going hunting...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Girl?  Oh yes.  The other lass is here, even mounted on your hen.  You had been too worried to notice that, or that the hen is wearing her harness for that matter.  Should be more alert than that, but anyway...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The lass put on her harness and the two of them took off.  They didn't have much luck at 1st.  They found lots of game, but it spotted them and ran off, or she didn't dive right, or ...  But then they saw this big fellow and she finally did a great dive and the lass nailed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   ??  That is not making sense.  What does she mean, the lass nailed it?  The moose is big enough that the hen would been lucky to kill it with a blow.  How in the world could the mere human hurt it?  Much less kill it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   That is when you see the gryphon lance is bloody and that the moose died from one bloody big hole.  A few more questions verify the picture.  Using the gryphon lance, they had been able to kill the moose from a safe distance.  Just fly down and poke it.  They had still taken on more than they should have, but it is a tad hard to argue with success.  Instead, you must do the heavy lifting needed to get this moose into the nest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Once that is , uf, grunt, done, you have a talk with your hen.  Not that you really get anywhere.  She likes hunting, naturally, and having lived her entire life with humans, never hunting without one, she deems it perfectly normal to have one with her when she hunts.  The idea of the human dominating her barely occurs to her.  She will be doing this in the future, often most likely.<br>\r\n   But maybe your fears are overblown anyway.  She agrees she belongs here, and not flying back to human territory.  You did remove all the ways the human can force her to do as demanded, and with one girl still here in the nest, she didn't dare try anything anyway.  So it could be you are making a fuss about nothing.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n   But while moose meat proves quite tasty, if only for the change in diet, it still galls a bit to be outhunted.  You are the male, and you are supposed to provide the meat while the hen stays in the nest and cares for the eggs and chicks.  Maybe you can't stick to that 100% [A nest full of hungry chicks needs a fantastic amount of food and it can keep both parents on wing to supply it.], but it is still what you should be striving for.  <br>\r\n   But they outdid you this time, and they are only going to get better.  How are you to do so much better that they must accept your position?  <br>\r\n   Well, if their success was due to a gryphon lance, maybe two can play at that game.  Take the other gryphon lance and the other lass and you should be able to do it.  It surely is not going to be that simple, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    But maybe that should wait.  There are a bunch of gryphon hens around here who are surely pining for your attentions...</span></div></div>",

You rate yourself at the top, and see no reason to think your hen rates you lower.  So you can do quite a bit of wandering.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Gryphons, as large hunters, have to live quite far apart, which makes finding a nest a bit of work.  Indeed, you only manage to find 2, both of which have the cock present and determined to chase you off.  You of course flee from both, the 1st in a leisurely manner.  Both of you know you would win easily in a serious fight.  But any wound could mean you lose, so best to flee now and return another time.  He will likely be sticking close to home until the eggs are laid, but if you can slip in when he is gone, she is going to be most welcoming.<br>\r\n   The other one could give you a serious tussle and he wants to make sure his hen knows that.  Again, you think you have the edge, but even more so a fight is not worth the risk.  So you must flee, and do so quite rapidly.  Too bad.  That likely means his hen will get the wrong [from your view] impression and when you sneak back, will have nothing to do with you.<br>\r\n   Well, it can't be helped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Returning at the end of the day, you of course look around for evidence that some other cock has tried to beat your time, but as you expected, you find none, and doubt your hen would be able to hide the evidence.  The presence of the 2 girls also suggests she has been faithful.  Just to be on the safe side, and because it is great fun, you seduce her again, a most wonderful idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Now what to do tomorrow?</span></div></div>",

So a full day of flying and you pretty much cover the land within reasonable flying distance of your nest.  You find 4 nests.  2 have stud males around.  Not able to match you, but still too strong to take on in a match to the death.  Not much chance with their hens.  <br>\r\n    The other two are much better prospects.  Not that you will fight their cocks either, but the hens can easily see your superiority.  One proves not immediately willing.  You figure you will need to bring by some food to induce her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The other is immediately willing, but her cock returns before you can get anywhere.  So no luck, right away...<br>\r\n    As you start to fly off, the hen caws out some directions to you.  With nothing better to do, you follow them.  They lead you to a large patch of trees.  Per instructions, you take a position on the left side and wait.<br>\r\n    After about an hour, you see both hen and cock flying in your direction.  The cock is clearly taking no chances his hen will get some on the side.  He flies almost wing-tip to wing-tip with her.<br>\r\n   But as they reach the stand of trees, the hen gets the 1st tree between the 2 of them, which means the 2nd, 3rd and other trees also separate them as she flies down the left side and he goes down the right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Reaching you, she wastes no time in presenting herself, and you mount her quickly.  It takes you no time at all to come, after which she flies off, and by using maximum effort, she reaches the far end of the stand about the same time the cock does.  The 2 fly off with his having no idea of her escapade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   But the other hens are not going to be so co-operative.  The obvious solution is to provide them with a meal, and it has to be the right size too.  This is one case where bigger is not better.  She has got to be able to eat the whole thing before the cock returns and finds enough scraps to make him suspicious.  <br>\r\n   Fortunately there are some goats that fit the bill nicely, and they are rather tasty too.  Unfortunately, they are hard to catch.  Well worth the effort, given the reward, but still it's going to be a lot of effort, and a good chance of failure.  <br>\r\n   Is there a way to improve the odss?...</span></div></div>",

There is much to be said for fresh meat.  Your hen is more practical.  If a rider will give her chicks an advantage, she wants them to have it.  And she has seen how much a rider helps her hunt.  That alone is a major selling point.  Lots of young gryphons effectively die of starvation.  Maybe most of them die of some foolishness, but that foolishness often is because they are too hungry to consider the risks if a meal is at stake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Of course, you still don't really trust the GryphonMaster, and there are some suspicious points, so you demand more details out of him and let him persuade you reluctantly.  But a deal that at least sounds good is eventually reached.
