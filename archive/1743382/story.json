It was a cool summer morning but still she felt hot under the thin mattress, her dense fur more suited for colder climates than the one she resided in.  It was an effective tool to encourage the 18 year old out of her bed in the morning though, anything to escape the heat she was enduring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't even bother to push off the covers, just rolling off to the side, dropping onto the floor with a dull thud, the husky lying on her front, wide rear left pressing up into the air.  She was healthy in appearance, not overly thin, her fur bulking her up a little as well, but it was clear that under that fur she had wide child-bearing hips and a large bosom.  She was totally naked, nights in the summer too hot for her to ever wear anything in bed, leaving the dog totally nude  while she tries to awaken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grumbled out to herself as she pushes herself up onto her hands and knees before finally making the last struggle to get up onto her feet.  She stood there, unsteady as she tried to awaken, only pulled from her daze when her alarm clock  began to buzz on the nightstand beside her, the husky silencing it with a quick slap.   She finally smiled to herself, her thick, bushy tail curling behind her rear and giving a few quick wiggles as she started to move finally towards the bathroom, humming happily to herself as she moved through the empty house.  Her family gone for the week to visit her grandmother, giving her the total reign of her life, meaning she can finally have real fun.  She was happy to be able to walk around the house naked, gathering herself up breakfast before moving to get a shower, all the while contemplating the day ahead and what she needed to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Author's notes: Just throwing this out, if anyone wants any particular storyline here continued on or have any ideas for things they'd like to see written, give me a poke on here, always happy to hear from folks, hopefully I can tweak the story to your ideas or continue the storyline you wanted done! :D )</span></div></div>",

Along with them was her friend Barb, a vixen with more then a bit of a wild side considering their times in college. After a while, while on the way to go down town they ended up at the entrance to a strange fair that popped up over night seemingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls smile at one another, all having the same idea and pay the five dollar fee to get in and start to wander around.

She hated working in  the clothing store downtown, she prefered more physical experiences and with that job she just had to stand around all day and tell people they looked good in their choosen outfit.  She at least knew her friend was working the same shift as her today, so hopefully she could kill a lot of time with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulls on a pair of plain white cotton panties and bra before grabbing her work uniform for the store, a soft salmon coloured cotton blouse and a rather tight fitting black skirt that reached to just above her knees.  The skirt clung tightly over her  wide hips and full ass, the dog grumbling out to herself as she shifts around in it, tugging down at the hem before just shaking her head and instead she just grabbed her three inch high heels and stepped into them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rushed out to grab the bus, not able to ever have passed her driving exam, so she had just resigned herself to taking the bus to her work each time.  She had her timing down right though, the bus pulling up literally the moment that she arrived at the stop, the husky's tail starting to wag quickly as she hopped inside and handed the driver her pass before finding a seat.  She beamed to herself, maybe today would be her day!</span></div></div>",

They were the usual assortment of customers that she had seen dozens of times, from the young girls like her trying to find something to wear for the coming weekend, to the lost looking men who were trying to pick up something for their wives.  She kept away from the men mostly, she liked to try and be nice and help people out but the men always seemed to come off as creepy when asking for clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe does notice a few people around that she hadn't seen before, the young dog glancing between them as she tried to decide which one to go and try to help.  The first was a short girl around her age, a young mouse girl who was poking around the underwear section, holding up a few bras against her small breasts.  The second was a chunky cow woman, about 35 years old, a big, busty woman who was looking through the skirt section with an annoyed look on her face.  The other was confident looking tigress standing at the counter waiting for someone to help her.  The TIgress looked like a smug bitch though, wearing an incredibly tight pair of spandex shorts and a tight T-shirt, as if she had just dropped in during a workout, something the seven foot tall, near amazonian tigress seemed to do a lot.</span></div></div>",

She wanted a peaceful start to the morning and she knew that the other two looked like they would probably be trouble for her; the mouse looked like she'd be easy though, she was only a four foot eight inch prey fur, what trouble could she be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mouse was busy looking through the sets of bra and panties that the store had, holding them up against her front with a worried expression on her face, most of the bras seeming far too large for her small breasts.  She was a cute little thing, with short, snowy white fur across her entire body, the only other colours the pinks of her ears, nose and long furless tail.  She wore loose, baggy clothing which kept her hidden, hiding her rather small body, obviously the girl was embarrassed by her body, something that Victoria never had to worry much about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky stepped in beside her suddenly, beaming down towards her, tail wagging behind her toned rear, \"Hey there!\" Vicky nearly called out towards her, the mouse nearly jumping out of her skin, dropping the few collected pieces of clothing she had, turning rapidly to face Vicky.  Victoria was about 6'7\" in her heels, nearly two feet taller than the tiny mouse, and it was obviously taking its effect on the mousette, who was leaning back in near fear as she stared up into Vicky's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...yeh...hi there...\" She finally said, her voice quiet and low, the mousette taking a few steps back, before she squatted down to pick up the clothing she had just dropped.  \"Sorry about that...you kinda snuck up on me...\" She glanced off to the side, barely able to keep eye contact with the looming husky. \"I'll just be going..\" She began to hang the clothing up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't!  It's fine, I'll help you find something cute to wear.  You looking for something to show off to your boyfriend?\" She asks with a small smile down at her, tail wagging away again behind her back.</span></div></div>",

The cow noticed her immediately, her right eyebrow perking slightly as the bovine just watches the approaching dog she stood a few inches taller than and easily wider then, her annoyed facial expression shifting finally when she seems to decide that Vicky isn't too threatening, turrning into a small smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there!\" She said loudly, coming to stand infront of the seven foot cow, still shorter than her even in her heels, an unusual feeling for the dog who was used to being the tallest of all of her friends, something that seemed to intimidate most of the men she tried to flirt with.  \"Can I help ya with anythiing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh.  Yeh.\" She looks down across the rack of skirts again before glancing up towards Victoria, folding her beefy arms over her large tits, short, thin tail flicking a few times in annoyance. \"Does you store not serve bigger sizes in clothing?\" She snorts out in annoyance, a blast of air rushing over Victoria's face who looked a little shocked at that, messing up her already scruffy fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erf?  Well, we mostly do!  We even served an elephant once!\" Vicky smiled again, nearly seeming proud of herself for that, but the cow seemed less than impressed so Victoria kept talking. \"What all are you looking for anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A totally new outfit, got a big date tonight and I want to look my best for her.\" The cow said, Vicky nearly giggling at the 'big date', immediately holding back a joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!  Well, I'm sure we could find something in your size, come 'ere!\" She giggles and grabs the cow by the hand, padding off towards the back store room, the cow begrudingly being led off, obviously annoyed at being led by the dog but she wanted a new outfit so she stuck with her for now.  The dog dragged her into the back room, doors swinging shut behind them, leaving them both alone.  The dog padded up to the racks of clothing there, where it held more of the far larger pieces of clothing for their customers<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria was quick at poking through the racks, her energetic personality coming in handy as she quickly moved around, looking for clothing that fit and matched before she finally reappeared infront of the cow with a big smile on her face, holding out the selection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cow blinked at the speed, and finally cracked a smile towards the helping husky, taking the selected clothing that all looked great to her, but she quickly noticed something was missing. \"Uhhh, sorry lil husky, you forgot the panties....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!  There weren't any in your size! Don't worry though, with thighs as chubby as yours there's no way anyone'll be able to see up your skirt anyway!\" Victoria said it with a smile, she was simply trying to pass it off as a joke but the cow's face changed, a deep frown appearing as she glared towards the husky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You lil bitch......!\" The cow snorted again, warm air and even a little bit of mucus hitting the dog in the face again, \"Call me chubby?!  I'll make you pay.\" She grunted out deeply, clenching her hands into tight fists before pulling out a tiny remote, barely noticable in her paw, rapidly pressing several of the tiny buttons, the dog just standing there, a confused look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does the cow do with the remote?</span></div></div>",

She tried to groan but no noise filled the air around her, there was no noise around her at all....except for loud laughing, and by loud it was literally booming from somewhere far overhead, as if the Goddess herself was laughing.  Vicky looked up, and suddenly realised, she couldn't move her head, she couldn't move anything, she was totally held in place with no feeling around her, as if her body was numb<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mymy, it certiainly seems to have worked again, I definitely have to use this more often.\" The cow was talking again, and when Vicky turned her vision she found herself staring up at the cow, who was towering over her, totally naked now.  Victoria wanted to scream but no voice came out, and even when she tried to run she couldn't move in the slightest, stuck in place at the hooves of this cow. \"Well, looks like you guys do have panties in my size.  What luck!\" She giggled at her own joke, reaching down to grip at the now transformed dog, picking her up to dangle her new body infront of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria lost sight of the cow now, her vision seemed to be more or less fixed from a single point, and now it was staring across at 'herself'.  It finally hit the dog as she stared across at herself, the wide ass section of a pair of white cotton panties, and she quickly realised her position was from the crotch piece of the panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look like you'll be confy, lil cutie.  Don't worry, I think you suit being panties better than being a doggy, and I'm sure you'll have fun with me and my girlfriend.....\" The huge cow let out a loud laugh, turning the panties around to stare down into the crotch piece, as if she was staring directly into Victoria's 'eyes'. \"Who knows, my little darling....I miight even tell her about you, you could join in with us.\" The cow bit her lower lip with a little whine, the cow grinding her thighs together what seemed like a hundred feet below to the dogpanties. \"Goddess damn me....I'm already getting wet at the thought of that......mmmmm,  damn....better put you on before I start dripping on the floor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved Victoria down over her body, before stepping down into the panties, holding her there for a few seconds, just letting the dog stare up along those massive towering legs, but her main focus was on those damp, furred lips.  Unfortunately for Victoria she suddenly finds out she still has her senses of taste and smell, and even some feeling as the cow's cunt drips a single droplet of juice down into her 'face'.  The dog's 'mouth' fills with the overpowering taste of the cows potent musk, right before the cow yanks her up, pulling her flush against her privates, the dog's vision going entirely dark, her nose nearly overloading with the incredibly potent scent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm...ohhh...you feel so great.....mmm, my girl'll love to meet you now...\" She says before she starts to put on the other clothing you had gotten her, getting ready to leave the store.</span></div></div>",

Just change out of them, and the whole thing is forgotten, okay?\" She followed her back to the changing room, waiting to take the \"merchandise\" back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the waiting room, the cow quickly strips off everything she hadn't paid for, then zaps a hanger, turning it into an exact copy of Victoria's current form. She then points the gun at Vicki, turning her back, then instantly shooting again, watching as she flutters to the ground. She catches her then walk to the mirror. She holds up the former clothes hanger, \"This is what you were, and what I'll be buying,\" She then holds up Vicki's new smaller thong body. She wasn't nearly as sexy in this form, more the kind of thing worn for day to day, \"and THIS is going to be what I buy accidentally, and insist your friend out there keep as a way of saying thank you. And if you thought being the front of my panties was great, you'll just LOVE being the back of your lovely skunk friends thong. Enjoy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left the changing room, explaining that she'd like to purchase it all. She strikes up a conversation to get Vivian to follow her to the register, and upon paying, starts putting stuff into bags. She gets to Vicki's new form and stops \"Oh dear, i didn't mean to buy this. This is her size. I... I always bought something for her while shopping... Look, you've been so nice, would you take these? As a way of saying thank you?\" Vivian start protesting, not sure how to react, so cow girl lays it on thick \"I know it's weird, but... I dunno, i'm ready to move on. And seeing as I bought them thinking of her, maybe giving them away, something positive, it'll help meget over her, you know? Please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivian looked into her eyes, trying to think of a polite way out of this, then her shoulders drop \"Okay ma'am, if you really think it will help you, I'll take them\" She took them into her soft paws, looking at the plain thong, thinking it's not too different than what she usually wears to work. \"Thank you ma'am\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cow woman smiles at her and pats her shoulder \"No, thank YOU.\" She walks away with her purchases, then mutters under her breath \"That's what you get you condescending little bitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivian at there staring at the thong in confusion for a second, wondering if there was any policy for this kind of thing, then decides...</span></div></div>",

Happily, she let it snap back and pulled it up tighter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoor Vicky, however, was feeling sick. Within the thong, her former dog body, absorbed the fart completely. Her nose was in the worse spot possible, right under her hole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I wonder where Vicky is? Oh well, I don't mind. I can now let out all the farts I want now without worry, this is great!\" Vivian cheered, much to Vicky's dismay. Vivian was about to walk out of the dressing room before her stomach started growling. Vivian smiled, thinking this was the perfect time to really test out her new thong. She plopped right down on the bench, wiggled her bottom to get comfy and than -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPPPPRRRPPPPBBBBPPPPPPRRRPPPPBBBBPPPPPPRRRPPPPBBBBPP!!!!!!  PPPPRRR!! PPPRRR!! PPPPRRRPPPP!! \"Ahhh, what a relief that was! I feel SO much better now! Now, did it pass the test?\" She stood up and checked the back, it was still clean and scent free. \"Yes! I'll be wearing this everyday!\" Vicky would defiantly throw up if she could now.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a few moments of studying and turning the thong over in her hands, Vivian decided that it would be best to return it to the display racks along with the other female under garments. Vivian was tempted to keep it, but her conscience just would not let her. Vivian walked behind the check-out counter and grabbed a spare clothes hanger, one with clamps. She then clamped the hanger at both ends of the thong's waistband, completely oblivious to the fact that the thong was actually her transformed friend. Victoria wanted to howl out in pain, but could not since she now lacked a mouth. She was relieved when the sharp pain subsided as quickly as it began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skunkette then quickly made her way over to the side of the store that where the female underwear garments where located and hung the skimpy underwear up with the other thongs, never suspecting that the plain, black thong was Victoria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh,\" Vivian began as she started to confusedly glance around the store, \"I wonder where Vicky ran off to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivian shrugged her shoulders; she figured Victoria probably ducked out of the store to get something to eat. This wouldn't be the first time. That's when Vivian noticed a rather large breasted red vixen that appeared to be trying to squeeze into an ill-fitting bra, and decided to walk over and offer the vulpine her assistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria watched her friend walk away. Victoria was torn. She was glad that her skunk friend decided against keeping her, the husky was well-aware of the powerful stinkers her skunkette friend's rear could let loose, and the thought of being wedged into skunk's plump bottom was equally as dreaded. Still, Victoria wished that Vivian would have noticed that the thong she just hung up was really her friend and co-worker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria could do nothing but dangle there on the rack, and watch as Vivian\u2019s rounded backside bounced away. Victoria wanted to scream for help, but yet again went unheard. It was if she was screaming in her own head. She tried to move, but that too was in vain. Vicky eventually gave up, and resigned herself to just hang there, unable to believe this was all really happening. The former Husky hoped that the cow lady would show mercy and return to reverse whatever it was she had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did I do?\u201d Vicky thought. \u201cAll I said was that she had thick thighs, I didn\u2019t mean to insult her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime slowly crept by for the poor husky, minutes slowly rolling into hours. Victoria helplessly watched as customers came and went.  There was a shapely mare, a curvy, slender tigress, even a plump cow, though this was not the cow Vicky was hoping to see. Eventually a voluptuous, white she-wolf entered the store, wearing a red blouse that showed plenty of cleavage with its plunging neckline, formfitting dark blue jeans and carrying a brown purse. A few minutes later an Amazon of an alligator woman entered, wearing a tight fitting white crop top T-shirt that revealed a flat belly, and well-defined abs. She also wore blue denim short shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe she-wolf was speaking with Vivian at the checkout counter. She was looking for something, but Victoria could not quite hear what it was. The gator woman seemed to be simply browsing around. The two did not really catch Victoria\u2019s full attention until they both eventually migrated toward her vicinity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth women were looking through the store\u2019s selection of ladies underwear. They did not seem to pay much attention to each others presence as they both kept inching closer to the rack that Victoria was hanging from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, please go away, please go away, please go away!\u201d The former husky thought as the two females drew ever closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky started to get nervous. The two predators were both well endowed in their upper and lower bodies. The wolf female was considerably shorter than the reptile, about as tall as Vicky\u2019s original body,  if maybe an inch or two taller. The lupine had a curvaceous, hourglass figure with enormous, perky breasts that strained against the fabric of her top. The canine also had curvy hips, a full, shapely rear, and long legs to boot. Victoria could see the material of the wolf\u2019s jeans stretched taut around her curvesome lower body, and Victoria feared that her thong form would be an equally tight fit on the fellow canine\u2019s rounded backside. Vicky whimpered at the very thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria\u2019s attention then shifted to the alligator. She was over a foot taller than the wolf, and had a thick, somewhat muscular build, yet still possessed generous curves in all the right places. The reptile had strong looking arms, and huge breasts, though proportionally they weren\u2019t quite as large as the she-wolf\u2019s, but still pretty damn big, and they strained against the fabric of her small T-shirt. Alternately the gator had a larger lower body than the wolf. She had shapely, broader hips, thick thighs, and long toned legs. She also had a long, heavy, powerful tail and a rounded, prominent backside that was even larger than the wolf\u2019s butt! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alligator\u2019s shorts were almost too small for her large rump, even for short shorts, they almost looked panted on. The fabric was pulled taut against alligator\u2019s behind, and her buttocks were bigger than a person\u2019s head! Victoria imagined this larger woman slipping her on, her tiny thong body being completely swallowed up, vanishing between the gator\u2019s huge buttocks. Victoria again whimpered at this thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe husky had the sinking suspicion that before it was over, one of these two would be leaving with a new addition to their wardrobe, and as they drew even closer Vicky hoped that it would not be her. Sadly the dog\u2019s wish went unheard as she was suddenly picked up by\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With an unchanging facial expression she snatched the dog thong from the rack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Husky thong tried to beg to the amazon that picked her up, but her voice went unheard as the wolf brutally started to stretch her,<br>\r\n'Ple-ase, st-op, stre--tching, m-e' Vicky begged, watching the bored face of the she-wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Found something?\" The Alligator peeked over, looking at her friends choice,<br>\r\n\"Perhaps, I'll need to try it on though\" Growled the wolf girl, stretching the thong with a reserved look, \"Oh they're on sale today\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf finally bared her teeth happily to the thong, making a decision \"Small, but durable enough, where's the changing rooms?\"<br>\r\nWith one last stretch and a shrug from her friend, she thudded over to an employee to ask. A small scowl came across the canines lips when she saw the employee's scared face, \"I don't bite...\" the wolf growled, her tone telling another story.<br>\r\n\"S-sorry, can I help you with something?\" The skunk girl tried to regain her composure infront of the curvy customer infront of her. The aura the predator before her stopped her from telling the wolf that the thongs couldn't be tested before buying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky watched Vivian direct the wolf to the changing rooms, effectively leading the wolf to the thongs execution room. The little thong girl stared at the giantess's waist with fearful awe,<br>\r\n'It's impossible' She worked out, 'There's no way I can fit around that! I was made to fit Vivian, Vivians only skinny!' The poor thong gave Vivian one last look before the wolf wandered into the changing rooms with the alligator close behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf dumped all the cloths she picked up into the changing room. Without making a fuss she closed the curtain. With a little effort, the wolf wiggled out of her shorts, pausing with an annoyed look as she struggled to wiggle her large paws through them <br>\r\n\"F*!kin' shorts...\" she grumbled quietly, putting on an annoyed face as she tried to fit her claws through without ripping the shorts apart. She yanked down a loose pair of regular white panties before snagging the thong. With one last disapproving look, the wolf dropped them on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky shuddered in fear on the floor, watching the wolf's dusty paws as they stepped onto her. Sharp claw filled hands reached down to slip the thong on to the hulking feet.<br>\r\n'Please no...' The poor thong whimpered, sliding past the feet to the wolf girls lower thigh where she got stuck. The husky hoped the wolf would stop there, realizing the thong wouldn't fit. Her hopes were dashed as the wolfs stubborn hands started to tug her harder, inching her to her destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's your first thong?\" A voice belonging the the Alligator chirped among the stalls, making the wolf blush red as she yanked it the rest of the way,<br>\r\n\"Die\" Growled the wolf, listening to her friends laughter,<br>\r\n\"Your way too insecure sometimes\" The friend retorted. The wolf fidgeted with her thong with an annoyed look on her face that slowly turned into an awequard smile,<br>\r\n\"Thanks for coming along\" The wolf spoke as she began to try on her other clothes, enjoying her shocked friends stutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky was in hell as the wolfs powerful cheeks chewed her up like gum. An indescribable taste spread over the poor thongs tongue as she was stretched painfully with each movement. Sharp claws nipped and pulled her constantly, unused to the concept of a thong. Vicky begged the wolf to let her go, more out of panic then practicality. Forced to watch the wolf try on clothes as she flossed the amazons hulking thighs was too much, but Vicky just couldn't pass out. All of her senses were overloaded with the short tempered wolfs rump constantly grinding and pulling her body around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an eternity, the wolf looks like she's finished. With one last pluck of the defeated thong girl the oblivious wolf decided to...</span></div></div>",

The former husky was snatched from the rack and the reptile began to study the seemingly simple, skimpy piece of underwear that she held in her hands, oblivious to it once being a person. Victoria began to panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPut me down,\u201d she screamed, \u201cI am NOT underwear!\u201d Unfortunately Vicky went unheard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gator\u2019s orange-yellow eyes continued to examine the tiny black thong. She started to test Vicky\u2019s elasticity by stretching the part of her that formed the waistband when the gator\u2019s lupine friend walked over. The yellow eyed she-wolf saw the thong in her friend\u2019s hands, and then noticed the thoughtful expression on her scaly companion\u2019s face. The wolf smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d The white furred wolf asked, raising an eyebrow at her reptilian pal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d The gator asked in return, speaking with a deep, feminine voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little small don\u2019t you think, Abigail?\u201d The wolf asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026I don\u2019t know, I think it might fit me.\u201d Abigail, the alligator replied.<br>\r\nThe wolf then stepped behind her friend, and looked towards the larger female\u2019s rather sizable backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d The wolf said, not sounding convinced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbigail detected the she-wolf standing behind her, and looked back over her shoulder where she found the wolf ogling her rear and rolled her eyes. \u201cTsk, would you get outta here?\u201d The alligator asked before batting at the canine with her heavy tail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bosomy she-wolf laughed as the alligator\u2019s tail connected with her side, not hard enough to cause pain, but firm enough to push her aside. \u201cOh, I can\u2019t help it, Abby,\u201d The wolf began, teasing her buddy, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just so big and round. I mean, I know I have a big ass, but yours is simply massive!\u201d The wolf finished with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut it, Miranda.\u201d The now blushing alligator told the wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay, I didn\u2019t know alligators could blush.\u201d Spoke the wolf, Miranda, as she continued to rally her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up!\u201d Abigail snapped, becoming even more annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, fine.\u201d Miranda replied with a chuckle. She started walking away when she paused and looked back, \u201cDon\u2019t want you to sit on me or anything.\u201d She said snickering. Abigail growled and walked off in a huff, leaving the laughing Miranda behind. Vicky was carried to the check-out counter where Vivian was standing. Vicky noticed that the female skunk looked a bit uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-hello there and welcome! Can I help you with something?\u201d Vivian nervously asked, apparently intimidated by the large predator now looming over her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbigail was accustomed to being feared by others, in a way though it upset her. Just because she was an apex predator, and her bite pressure was comparable to having a small truck dropped on someone, people stood back. She was not a mean girl, and did not bite\u2026much. Abigail chose to disregard the small mammal\u2019s reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I wanted to try this on, but there\u2019s no price tag.\u201d Abigail explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky saw this as a stroke of luck. Surely Vivian would know that underwear came prepackage and could not be opened or worn before buying, and she would inform the husky\u2019s unaware captoress of such. Indeed Vivian did know this, but she was so afraid, and not wanting to upset the large gator decided to just go along with things, and let it slide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, I-I can find the price for you.\u201d Vivian nervously stammered as she hastily started searching through the catalog on the store\u2019s computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, yes those are fourteen dollars.\u201d The skunk spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMay I try this on first?\u201d Abigail asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVivian, no!\u201d Vicky called, but again went unheard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure the dressing rooms are this way.\u201d Vivian said as she gestured for Abby to follow. She led the alligator to the dressing booths and as Abby opened one she turned toward Vivian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cThank you.\u201d She said kindly and then stepped inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are most welcome.\u201d Vivian politely answered with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbigail closed the door behind her, and Vivian leaned against a wall and breathed a relieved sigh. She then walked away towards Miranda to offer her assistance, the wolf was also intimidating, but the skunk handled canines better, one of her friends was one after all. Vivian then remembered that Vicky had not yet returned and wondered what was keeping her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, somebody help me!\u201d Vicky screamed as she was dropped on the bench inside the booth along with the alligator\u2019s gym bag. Abigail of course could not hear her, as the transformed dog tried to move, but could not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbigail, still standing began to strip out of her tight denim shorts, the alligator growled in frustration as she struggled to get them off her wide hips. Vicky soon found herself looking up at the plump buttocks of the alligator that now stood with her back towards the former dog, naked from the waist down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh God,\u201d Vicky said, started, \u201cthis isn\u2019t happening.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky watched as Abigail studied herself in the body mirror. The reptile\u2019s body was covered in forest green scales, while her lower jaw, the front of her neck, her breasts, belly, groin, and crotch, as well as the palms of her hands, the soles of her feet, and the underside of her tail were covered in smooth beige scales. She also had several rows of bony, plate-like ridges running vertically down her back and tail. Her skin appeared tough, but somehow soft at the same time. Vicky also noticed that the crocodilian\u2019s finger and toenails were sharp and black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbigail had an thick athletic build, the muscles in her arms abs, and legs bulged, but only moderately so, suggesting that this alligator was physically powerful, yet her unmistakably female figure retained generous curves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat really caught Vicky\u2019s attention however was Abigail\u2019s butt. The she-wolf was not exaggerating earlier. The thing was simply huge! It stuck out, and was so plump and round; one had to wonder how Abigail sat in chairs without breaking them. This was easily one of the largest rumps, if not the largest Vicky had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow does she find pants that fit?\u201d Vicky thought as she looked on in awe. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I\u2019ll fit over that monster.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbigail turned around and snatched Vicky up with one hand. \u201cNo! Please!\u201d The transformed dog screamed as she was suddenly lowered and the alligator raised a leg. Abigail put one bare foot into Vicky, and then the other. The poor former husky began to cry as she was pulled up Abigail\u2019s long shapely legs. Vicky came to an abrupt halt when she neared the reptile\u2019s thick thighs. Abigail let out an irritated growl, and started pulling at the thong, determined to make it fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon, dammit!\u201d Abigail grunted as she struggled to squeeze into the skimpy, obviously too small lingerie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky meanwhile was in hell. She was stretched so much that she feared that she would rip apart. Each tug caused unbelievable pain for the living thong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw, give it up lady I won\u2019t fit!\u201d Vicky whimpered. The stubborn gator girl of course heard none of this and kept at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, inch by inch Vicky was pulled up Abigail\u2019s meaty thighs until she bumped into the underside of Abigail\u2019s enormous buttocks. Vicky was painfully stretched further as the alligator grunted and forced her bountiful bottom inside of Vicky, somehow she managed to hold together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEw, ew, ew!\u201d Vicky groaned as she was slowly dragged between two massive butt-cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere!\u201d Abigail triumphantly spoke as she finally completed her task. She turned her back to the mirror and raised her tail to get a better look. Vicky was now wedged deep in between the two biggest buttocks she had ever seen, totally swallowed up the giant gator\u2019s ass. Except for the part of Vicky that formed the waistband, and the tiny bit of her that protruded from the top of the cleft of Abigail\u2019s rear and from under her tail, from behind it looked as though the alligator was not wearing anything at all. The portion of Vicky that formed the crotch of her thong body was pulled flush against Abigail\u2019s. Vicky could feel herself rubbing against the alligator\u2019s moist labia, hugging the gator\u2019s unmentionables as she gradually became a living camel toe for the reptile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pungent odor between Abigail\u2019s hams was too much for Vicky to handle, and the living thong found herself grateful for no longer having a mouth because she would have surely vomited from the smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbigail continued studying her rear in the mirror, and with one final pluck of the waistband she let the thong snap back into place. Finished her examinations, she lowered her tail, covering Vicky further. Abigail pulled on her short with as much difficulty as taking them off, and exited her booth to find Miranda standing outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d Miranda asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what?\u201dAbigail asked in turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow does it fit?\u201d Miranda inquired, smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbigail paused for a moment and awkwardly looked away. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026a little tight.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda began laughing. \u201cI bet.\u201d She giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t start.\u201d Said Abigail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you going to buy it?\u201d  Miranda asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Abigail answered after a moment of thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey made their way to the checkout counter where Abigail paid Vivian and informed the skunk that she\u2019d be wearing her purchase out of the store.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maybe checkout the guys.\u201d Miranda answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two females continued talking as they walked along down the street and poor Vicky was crushed and ground up between Abigail\u2019s large buttocks. The wolf and alligator carried on. It became clear to Vicky that the two were good friends, roommates. Miranda seemed to be the brains and the leader, while Abigail acted as the brawn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were close buds, but the alligator seemed almost afraid of the wolf. The she-wolf seemed nice enough, but there was something about Miranda that said \u201ctread with caution\u201d. Miranda and Abigail eventually reached the city\u2019s waterfront and made their way from the boardwalk down to the beach where Miranda brought a hand to her stomach as it started growling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you find us a place to sit, I\u2019m gonna change and find a snack bar.\u201d The wolf spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, get me something too.\u201d Replied Abigail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, right.\u201d Miranda sarcastically answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, come on, Miranda, I bought the snacks the last time.\u201d Abigail complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, alright you big glutton,\u201d Miranda said with a chuckle, \u201cI\u2019ll get you something to eat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair then parted ways. Abigail began searching for a place to set up, but the beach was crowded today. She finally spotted some space between a female bobcat sleeping, wearing a one piece swimsuit as she laid on top a beach towel, resting on her belly, and a female coyote, wearing a bikini top and sarong with dark sunglasses as she read under a sun umbrella. They did not seem to be together, so Abigail approached the space between them. As she drew near, the coyote\u2019s ears perked up. She looked up from her book and lowered her sunglasses. Her eye nearly bulged out of her head when she saw the tall alligator walking towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time the bobcat had woken up and had also detected Abigail\u2019s presence. The bobcat and coyote looked at each other, then to the space between them, and connected the dots. Without a word they hastily collected their things and then bolted off in opposite directions. Abigail just giggled as she watched them flee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore room for me.\u201d She said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbigail dropped her gym bag and crouched down as she reached for the zipper. While she was squatting her gut let out a groan. Abigail suddenly passed gas, quite loudly. She paused for a moment, completely caught of guard, before laughing it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky however was mortified. She was taught against Abigail s anus when she farted. The thong cried in anguish as she felt the alligator\u2019s warm, putrid flatus absorb into her silk body. The earthy odor was awful, and Vicky\u2019s acute sense of smell did not help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbigail pulled two beach towels out of her gym bag, and laid them out side by side on the white sand. She then took out a collapsible sun umbrella and plants it into the sand over the towel Miranda would be laying on. Being a reptile Abigail enjoyed sun bathing, and as such gave her smaller companion the umbrella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClothing was optional on this beach, many females were either partial or fully nude, and so Abigail slipped out of her crop-top, her impressive breasts bouncing as they were freed from the small, restraining T-shirt. She then removed her shorts, with slightly less trouble than before, though she chose to leave on her little thong. She placed her clothing in her bag, and then lay down on her towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short while later Miranda returned wearing a red bikini, and her arms filled with food. The two shapely predators ate their fill and then settled down to watch a group of cute males that were tossing a football around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater Miranda started reading a novel, and Abigail was lying on her belly, her head resting on her crossed arms as she basked in the sun. She soon dozed off. Unable to hear Vicky\u2019s pleads for help, and completely oblivious to her presence as she stewed in the gator\u2019s ass. Miranda looked up from her paperback and glanced over at her large friend\u2019s big behind. Abigail\u2019s tail was to one side, and Miranda spotted the black T-back styled thong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026It looks kind of nice on her.\u201d She thought, and then returned to her book.</span></div></div>",

She sprinted into the bedroom, grabbing her uniform from the wardrobe, a simple pair of light blue scrubs for her top and bottom, an unflattering outfit for her body but she had never minded it much, except when she was trying to flirt with the doctors.  She grabbed the nearest bra and panties to her before starting to move towards the front door, pulling on the underwear even as she walked.  The panties and bra were the wrong type to be taking to work, her bright pink lace bra and panties, decorated along the hem with a few frills, less for comfort and more for showing off.  Vicky pulled the scrubs on as well, before grabbing her hand bag and running out the front door to catch her bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky panted out loudly as she ran down the halls of the hospital, dodging past the various other nurses and patients that were walking around, even hearing a giggle from one of her friends as she ran, \u201cLooks like someone\u2019s late again!\u201d Alecia called after her, the squat Jack Russell poking her tongue out towards Vicky as she ran past, Vicky just flashing a flustered smile in return.  This was the fifth time this month that she had been late, her supervisor getting more annoyed at her each time it happened, she knew she was definitely going to be in the firing line today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer supervisor stood at the end of the hall at the reception area for the sixth floor, the miniature poodle leaning on the counter, looking over a piece of paper, glancing at the clock every once in awhile.  Vicky sprinted right down to her, panting out loudly as she stops in front of the short poodle, offering up a weak smile. \u201cSorry I\u2019m late Julie\u2026Won\u2019t happen again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie glared across towards her as she looked up from her piece of paper, turning out to be the work rota, her thin tail giving an annoyed little swipe. \u201cFive times.\u201d She growled out loudly towards Vicky, shaking her head slowly before she glanced down at the rota again. \u201cI\u2019m sick of this.  You need a time out.  Go down to section 8, they\u2019re short staffed there.  You\u2019re going to be filling in for the next month down there.

She hadn\u2019t worried about it much at all those few times she was padding through it, but her friends had made it sound horrible.  Aggressive patients, many of which were larger than the canines forced to work there, it was the reason why usually it was worked by only non-canines. These non-canine nurses and doctors were generally just as aggressive and hostile to the canines made to fill the spaces down there, paid far less, given more experimental or cheaper drugs to use on their patients.

Life was different in the cities, non-canines were second class citizens compared to dogs, only allowed to hold lesser jobs, go to worse schools and treat their own kind, even if there were a shortage of canine doctors they weren\u2019t allowed to help out.  Vicky had no problem helping out, and if she was at home, she\u2019d have jumped at the chance to enjoy time with the non-canines, but here in the city the non-canines hated the canines as much as they hated them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky stepped into the elevator, pushing the bottom for the second floor, the designated area for \u2018Sector 8\u2019, a single floor held for the non-canines while canines had nearly a dozen for themselves.  Vicky rocked on her paws as she waited in the lift, trying to cheer herself up, she was sure if she gave out a friendly atmosphere the others would relax around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors slid open finally, and as soon as it was, a dozen non-canines, ranging from Felines to pigs all stopped to glance towards her, lowering their heads slightly before they continued on their way.  Vicky just smiled, trying  to look as friendly as possible as she padded out of the lift and took a right, heading down towards the reception area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reception was staffed by a looming horse, a Clydesdale, just like one of the families that owned a farm by hers.  She padded right up to her, offering a bright smile as she held her hand up towards the near nine foot horse. \u201cHey there!  I\u2019m Vicky, I\u2019ve been assigned to help you guys out for the next month!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horse glanced across towards her, frowning deeply, letting out a loud snort from her wide nostrils, blasting warm air over Vicky's face.  She glanced down towards the offered hand before stuffing a file into it, \u201cGet to work then, I\u2019m sure you aren\u2019t being paid to talk.\u201d  Vicky\u2019s ears lowered at that, but she just nodded, taking the file before turning and walking off, trying to avoid the gazes being cast towards her from the other nurses.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The news was reporting an explosion in the counties nearby military base, a few miles from the city she was in right now.  There were pictures of the canine base, military personal rushing around to try and put out the fires which looked like it had engulfed the armour yard.  Vicky didn\u2019t keep up with the news anymore, nothing was too interesting to her, but she had heard that there had been dozens of bombings in the past few months, all seeming to target military bases, taking out tanks and heavy armour mainly.  Vicky knew what the result of that was going to be though, the canine section was going to get floated with injuries now, but she was still stuck in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky was standing at the reception area, lent over the counter so she could poke casually through the waiting files, only two of them, and unfortunately both were marked \u2018XL\u2019, meaning they were very large patients so she wasn\u2019t allowed to work on them for safety reasons.

She was wearing a loose pair of cargoes and a loose, buttoned up blouse, but they seemed to clash with the footwear she wore, thick boots that seemed more designed for combat.  She was clutching her arm, the right sleeve of her pink blouse blackened and slightly burnt, and Vicky immediately picked up the scent of petrol and smoke from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky immediately felt the atmosphere change, several of the nurses freezing up around the reception area, fur standing up on end immediately, all of them staring across at the front of the leopard\u2019s cargoes, a strange little symbol, a \u2018C\u2019 with two diagonal lines going from bottom left to top right.  Vicky didn\u2019t get why they were acting so strangely, so she just offered a bright smile across towards the leopardess, moving across to greet her. \u201cHey there, I\u2019m Vicky!  Want to follow me?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leopard was immediately taken back by this, tail poofing out slightly as her eyes narrowed at the dog infront of her, and suddenly a voice cut in, as one of the tigress nurses stepped up to the two. \u201cNo, its okay Vicky, go and get some rest, I\u2019ll deal with this\u2026\u201d She said, lighting gripping Vicky by the arm and starting to try and lead her away, but Vicky shook her head and held her ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s cool, Becka!  I\u2019ll look after her!\u201d She offered a friendly smile towards the Tigress before waving the leopard towards a nearby treatment room.  The leopard hesitated for a moment, staring at Vicky with her bright green eyes, before she finally padded into the room, rapidly followed by Vicky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky couldn\u2019t help but notice the smell of petrol and smoke on the leopard, but it was strange, there were several other scents on her, bitter and rather potent, something she had never sniffed before.  It was bizarre, and all she could think about was that bombing in the army base recently, could THIS be the terrorist?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She padded up to the leopardess, who had taken a seat on the treatment bed, shifting uneasily as she hugged her burnt right arm against her breasts as she peered out towards the Husky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo!  What happened, miss\u2026.?\u201d Vicky said, noticing the leopard stiffening up at that question, but Vicky just offered a warm, caring smile across towards the feline, reaching out to put a hand on her left shoulder, tail giving a slow wag behind her rear. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Miss, we all make mistakes sometimes.  I even burnt myself with some cheese once!  It stuck to my lip when I was eating a pizza.\u201d She giggled, offering a smile again towards the feline, trying to get her just to relax around her, it was the only way she'd be able to treat her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feline just stared back though, seeming a little uneasy but she finally just nodded, lifting her arm up to let Vicky see it. \u201cShahir\u2026there was a backsplash when I was fixing my car\u2019s engine when it broke down\u2026Think it as some oil or something....\u201d She watched Vicky constantly with those wide, emerald eyes, as if seeing if the dog bought her story, but Vicky just smiled and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t even have a car!  I couldn\u2019t pass my driving test, didn\u2019t like sitting still for all that time!\u201d She giggled out loudly at that, reaching up to slowly peel back the blouse, leaving her arm exposed.  Some of the fur was missing from the arm, the flesh on the exposed area bright red, but it wasn\u2019t a bad burn.  \u201cThere we go!  Mmmm, looks pretty good to me.\u201d She turned away from Shahir and padded across to the medicine cupboard on the wall, before digging through for a few long moments, a frown appearing on her face.  She shook her head and stepped back, before offering another smile across towards Shahir, \u201cStay here, Miss, I\u2019ll be back in just a second!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky disappeared out into the corridor at a flash, moving at a full sprint down the corridors, leaving Shahir alone in the room, but she wasn\u2019t alone for long.  Becka appeared at the door only a moment after the Husky disappeared, standing in the doorway with a scowl on her face. \u201cYou should get out of here Shahir!  Where do you think she\u2019s running too? Probably to get security!  You can\u2019t get captured here, not now..\u201d The large tigress growled out, but Shahir just tilted her head across towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she even noticed Becka, you worry too much about the canines.  I doubt she was even paying enough attention to me to realise.\u201d The leopardess sniffed down towards her own arm, easily detecting the scent of the explosives, but she still doubted the dog had even paid attention to her to work it out. \u201cHang around though.\u201d  Becka nodded and stepped out into the corridor again, barely a few seconds before Vicky appeared again, but there were no security guards with her, and her face was a picture of happiness and beauty, showing a bright smile across towards the leopardess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShahir seemed even more concerned about the dog\u2019s joy, none she met had ever seemed to happy to be at work, especially not a dog being punished.  She felt the weight of her knife in the thigh pocket of her cargoes, knowing it was there if she needed it, but it was quickly revealed that she didn\u2019t need it.  Vicky held out a small tube towards the feline, written on it was \u2018Xervenen,  Canine\u2019.  It was burn ointment, but it was for canines, the more expensive, far better brand, kept back only for dogs while the Non-Canines were forced to take cheap, ineffective products.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026that\u2019s a dog one.\u201d Shahir said, pointing across towards it, just assuming the dog had probably missed that or couldn\u2019t read well enough, she had known some very stupid dogs working in places while non-canines who were far smarter were banned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm, so?  You need it, sure the boss wouldn\u2019t argue with that!  Anything to make people feel better!\u201d She smiled, a polite little smile as she reached out to hand it to Shahir before handing her a roll of bandages as well. \u201cTake a shower, then apply it and bandage it up!  Only a few days and it\u2019ll be all cleaned up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShahir just didn\u2019t know what to say, canines were never nice to cats, never had any even smiled at her since she was born in the depth of this city\u2019s \u2018ghetto\u2019, but Vicky had quite happily broken the rules just to help her out.  She felt a warm blush spread across her cheeks before offering up a smile towards Vicky, \u201cThank you\u2026..thanks so much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky giggled at that, leaning in to give her a wet lick on the nose, something she often had done to many patients and friends, nothing sexual in it to the dog, it was simply a friendly act to her.  She waved a paw towards the door, not even noticing that Becka was watching through a slight gap in the doorway. \u201cIts no problem at all!  I hope you have fun at the festival today!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShahir blinked at that, beginning to stand up from the bed, her face nearly bright crimson beneath the white fur of her face, the blush growing deeper. \u201cYou know about the festival?  Didn\u2019t think any of you dogs even knew about our celebrations\u2026especially one to do with celebrating our\u2026well\u2026.\u2019non-doggyness\u2019.\u201d She let out a giggle at her own phrase, smiling towards the Husky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!  I even celebrated it once!\u201d She giggles at the memory, tail wagging, \u201cWhen I used to live in the country\u2026mmm\u2026.\u201d She rumbled out to herself, tail wagging behind her rear. \u201cWow was that a wild few days\u2026.\u201d She was blushing herself, but quickly shook her had. \u201cBah!  Anyway!  I\u2019m gonna be here for the rest of the day, even if this bits closing down, I\u2019ll probably be back in the canine section or somewhere else.  So if you need anymore help at all, I\u2019ll be here.  Just ask for Vicky Mason!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShahir smiled and nodded, moving towards the door, \u201cI\u2019ll do that\u2026thanks for the help Vicky, was nice to meet you.\u201d She stopped at the door, holding it open as she just stood in the doorway, spotting Becka a few feet down the corridor.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For the next three days work would end early for all of them in the city and they\u2019d be back in their ghetto for mass parties.   Canines never got to experience the festivals, usually it was far too dangerous for them to enter the ghettos but none seemed even interested in it.  Sometimes a camera crew would beam out images of the festivals, but it was usually in a form to insult the felines and their ways.  Vicky knew it was different though, she had gone to a small one out in the country where she lived, she'd even dyed her fur to take on a less canine appearance.  It was simply a way for non-canines to keep their cultures intact, so in the mass parties they often celebrated small aspects of each different race that made up the huge communities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Sector 8 closed she was sent to reception to help file people away and get them appointments, a far worse punishment for her than her time in Sector 8, too boring as she was just left sitting still for hours on end.  At 3PM though she was able to get a short break, the dog able to stretch out in the rest room while watching a mindless soap on the TV, barely able to even keep awake during it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky had nearly slipped off to sleep when suddenly the ground seemed to shake beneath her, the dog letting out a startled little yelp as she slipped off the edge of the couch to land on her rear in front of the TV.  She blinked, surprised at that, but eventually just giggled to herself, putting it down to her own stupidity, but it was because of something else.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Attention was pulled in from the rest of the hospital as several doctors and nurses rushed into the room with Vicky, passing right by her to the South-facing window.  A nurse appeared beside Vicky, snatching up the TV remote from where Vicky had been sitting on the couch, beginning to frantically flash through the channels.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky glanced across to the crowd gathering at the window, hearing gasps and whimpers of fear, beginning to straighten up and move towards the window.  The nurse seemed to finally find the channel she was looking for, the news, where the news anchor, a busty poodle girl was growling towards someone off screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts just an earthquake, Danny.  Jeez, stop being such an idiot.\u201d The anchorwoman said, folding her arms over her large tits, glaring off towards whoever she was talking too. \u201cA giant?  Are you an idiot, I\u2019m not going on live and saying there\u2019s a fucking giant in the city without actual confirmation.\u201d She rolled her eyes at that, turning to look towards the camera, ears seeming to flick as she noticed it was recording before she quickly plastered on her fake smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky watched, a confused look on her face, she didn\u2019t believe what she was hearing, there was no way what they were saying was true, especially now that her favourite anchor woman, \u2019Jennifer La Bon\u2019 had said so.  Vicky had held a crush on her for nearly a year since she moved to the city, but she wanted to look out the window anyway, especially with how people were panicking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crossed over to the gathered crowd, some of which were already breaking away and starting to run back out of the room.  Now that that crowd had separated she got a clear view outside, where her worst fears were quickly realised, and then far surpassed.  Outside, far out across the city, standing just outside the suburbs loomed a giantess.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Vicky wasn\u2019t a smart girl, and didn\u2019t know too much about size but she was easily able to guess that the hospital wouldn\u2019t even come up to the feline\u2019s toes, people would probably not even be visible to her.  She was tens of thousands of feet tall now, a true goddess to the dogs now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurses around her were beginning to flee, and quickly Vicky was all alone at the window, the scared furs trying to evacuate the city already.  Vicky didn\u2019t run yet though, she\u2019d met Shahir, she was sure she probably was a good girl.  Shahir had already changed her clothing though, she was now wearing a black T-shirt with red lettering across it, stretched out across her large breasts, nipples poking out of the black material.  The lettering spelt out \u2018FFNC\u2019 and beside it was the same symbol she had seen on Shahir\u2019s cargoes earlier, Vicky knew what the letters meant at least, it stood for \u2019Freedom For Non-Canines\u2019, the slogan of dozens of rebel groups that had fought against the canine government.  On her bottom half she was wearing a simple pair of black, tight fitting jeans that hugged across her beautiful body, showing it off far better than it had been for Vicky when she\u2019d met her earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShahir observed the city for several long moments, a smug smirk plastered across her face, just basking in her new position for several long minutes before she finally made a move.  She reached down to her rear, tugging out a massive letter, the simple piece of paper seeming to have grown up along with the leopard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe begins to read it out, what does it say?</span></div></div>",

Your arrogance and ignorance has led to this, there is no one to blame but yourselves.\u201d Shahir spoke loudly and clearly, but her voice was nearly too grand, the vibrations easily felt striking against the buildings all around, glass cracking and straining against the powerful voice.  It echoed to Vicky, booming towards her from the open window she stood at, but also sounding from the TV behind her as the news channel beamed it directly around the area. \u201cYou treated us as nothing but a pest that you could push around, but while you sat around and enjoyed the easy lives that our sweat and blood gave you, we prepared.  Our scientists, the ones you claimed were beneath you worked for years on our secret weapon, and now its ready.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crumbled up the piece of paper with a smirk, glancing down over the city quite literally at her feet. \u201cYou canines are all to blame for this, you let this happen, sitting by while we were punished and oppressed simply because your population was larger and better armed.  So you will all be punished.  Right now across the continent, seventeen other girls like me are destroying major cities, we\u2019ll make sure you learn your lesson, even if we have to teach it the hard way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShahir reached into her back pocket and pulled out a small, precut plastic tray, a very strange shape to it.  She squinted down at the city as she held the tray in her right paw, seeming to be looking for something, and then finally she moved.  She lowered the tray down, upside down, seeming like a baking tray made out of plastic, to Shahir it was only about an inch deep but that was several hundred feet high to normal sized people.  She lowered it down, setting it down on top of a section of the city, which Vicky immediately realised was the ghetto area.  Shahir was protecting it\u2026this was trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Shahir said with a large smirk.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shahir let out that cute little giggle again, the same one Vicky had actually enjoyed hearing mere hours before, but now it was near deafening, and rather intimidating.  She straightened up over the city, playfully putting her paws on her hips as she looked down at the city, like a mother about to scold a disobedient child. \u201cThis is going to be a lot of fun lil doggies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took her first step forwards, deliberately slowly, letting her gigantic foot move carefully over the top of the city, splaying her toes out, casting an impressive shadow down over a large part of the suburbs, as hundreds of furs lost their sky, replaced by the underside of a feline\u2019s foot.  She just let her foot hover there for now, giving people a clear sign of their doom for a few long moments before finally she lets her paw drop.  Vicky watched from a distance as the foot hit the ground, watching several hundred houses disappear under the cat\u2019s foot, smoke and dust clouds rising up hundreds of feet into the air, streaming up from between her toes.  The vibrations hit her hard, the hospital shaking just like every other building in the city, some of the nearby ones even tilting slightly and crumbling to the earth, falling into piles of rubble with just the first step from the titan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShahir smirked from on high, just pressing her foot down into the earth, feeling the ground giving way under her impossibly massive weight, and once she was satisfied she lifted her foot again, looking down at the paw print she had left.  There was a gigantic paw print left in the ground where hundreds of houses had been before, an extremely neat print that had dug down into the soil.  To Shahir dust fell from the bottom of her paw as she held it up, but to the unfortunate souls that had survived beneath her hovering foot the falling dirt was like hills, flattening even more houses and vehicles without the leopard even noticing the new damage she was causing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky could hear the news in the background constantly, talking about the attack, even mentioning the other attacks on the other cities.  \u201cMiliya, Praty and Chiibui have stopped reporting in to us since the\u2026uhh, Breeya has stopped reporting as well.\u201d Jennifer La Bon growled out in frustration, as she peered past the camera at a screen, \u201cThe mayor has just confirmed the news.  We offer a full surrender to the attacking Leopardess\u2026. I repeat, we surrender.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky looked back out the window, seeing that very clearly Shahir hadn\u2019t been given the information yet, or simply they didn\u2019t care if their little city offered up a surrender.  The towering leopardess was just standing there in the suburbs, casually sweeping her left foot across the ground, as if she was just brushing dirt off the floor, and really, that\u2019s all she was doing.  The foot tore through the housing area, sweeping up new mountains of dirt with each little swipe, burying thousands of furs and their houses, not even realising the true extent of the damage she was causing with her fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShahir stopped suddenly, standing there in  the centre of the suburbs, toes clenching and relaxing every few seconds, as if she was lost in deep thought as she looked out across the city.  Finally her thin lips just cracked in an intimidating smirk as a dark idea crept into her mind, the titanic feline suddenly stepping forwards.  Her massive feet swung over the city, crushing down ontop of the more heavily built up areas now, buildings flattened beneath her gigantic paws without the cat even feeling any resistance before the 'towering' achievements of the dogs were reduced to dust in her paw prints.  She was heading directly towards the most heavily populated section of the city, where the buildings stood easily the tallest, the business district, but also, the hospital that sat only outside of the business district.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky watched her approach, beginning to lose sight of her face from the more and more severe angle,  her large breasts blocking out her face from view as she moved closer to the hospital.  She stopped short though, looming over the business district like a vengeful goddess, the tallest of the \u2018skyscrapers\u2019 not even toe height to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShahir rumbled out happily to herself, before the feline suddenly turned away from the business district, giving everyone a view of her jean covered ass, the tight, dark material clinging across her full, toned ass.  She had something much worse planned for the district, the leopardess grabbing the waistband of her jeans and panties in one, tugging them down sharply, revealing her white ass, decorated by black spots that a thousand canines could easily live within with room to spare.  From this very radical angle though, Vicky could see up between her thighs as well though, easily spotting the thicker muff of white fur there, covering her pink nether lips.  She only had a moment to see them though, as the goddess-like leopard sat down sharply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky lifted her arms and let out a terrified scream, expecting that gigantic ass to land on top of the hospital as well, but it didn\u2019t, landing simply on top of the business district.  Vicky was nearly thrown off her feet as the incredible vibrations shook the hospital, parts of the ceiling out in the corridor falling loose with a loud crash.  Vicky managed to stay on her feet though, staying at the window so she could keep an eye on the events outside, but all she could see was the depths of the leopard\u2019s impossible deep butt crack.  She could do nothing but stare as the gigantic cat just giggled out loudly, rocking back and forth a little on her rear.  Tens of thousands had disappeared beneath that ass, crushed into dust by that impossible weight, the mountain like leopardess just enjoying herself.  Despite the horror, Vicky couldn\u2019t help but look across towards that gigantic rear end, staring through those spread out cheeks with a low rumble to herself.  She was a few hundred feet away but that ass totally dominated her view, and even from this distance she got a clear scent of her ass.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Vicky could hear the news buzzing in the background still, the poodles voice trying to compete over the sound of wind.  Vicky stepped back from the window eventually, just moving to look back at the TV, and she was quite glad that she did.  The TV screen was filled with just the looming image of the leopard\u2019s nether lips, white fur against the soft pink of the lips, barely visible through the thicker fur around her vagina.  Vicky felt herself blushing even as she just watched that, trying to imagine what it must have been for the poodle who was left standing ontop of her building with a camera, aiming up at that gigantic vagina, dwarfed simply by a female\u2019s womanhood\u2026\u2026.Vicky imagined it was probably pretty humbling experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is\u2026unbelievable\u2026\u201d The poodle was stammering out as she appeared in front of the camera, having just set it up on its tripod. \u201cThe rest of the station has evacuated but I\u2019ve continued on to report the story\u2026\u201d She looked a little worried about that, ears flattened down on top of her head, a short whimper sounding out into the air. \u201cThis unidentified feline had just sat on downtown\u2026I can\u2019t possibly know but the death toll must be near the hundreds of thousands\u2026\u201d Her ears were flat as she looked around behind her again, the camera aimed up at her, which made it look like her sky was simply that vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky felt it the same time as the anchorwoman did, the ground starting to shake powerfully underfoot, sending Vicky tumbling down to the ground in front of the TV.  The reporter had better balance, even quick enough to grab her camera up again, turning the view away from that vagina, aiming it in the other direction.  Shahir was pulling her jeans back up again, the open waistband dragging along the ground, like a monumental shovel, scooping up dozens of buildings as it slowly dragged along the ground, the huge feline not even standing as she pulled her pants up.  The anchorwoman was whimpering out sharply in fear as she filmed the approaching jeans and panties, the bright pink panties rapidly closing in on the poodle\u2019s building. \u201cOh god no\u2026this can\u2019t be happening\u2026this can\u2019t\u2026.\u201d Her sentence ended in a scream as the pink filled the screen and the camera spun away, before filling with static and going dead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky stumbled up to her feet and rushed across to the window once more, just in time to see the jeans sweep up over the feline\u2019s ass, but it was a horrible effect for the city behind her, including the hospital.  Rubble was thrown across the city, some entire buildings dropping like they were specks of dust for the feline, flattening other buildings but the hospital was mostly untouched except for a few chunks that smashed onto the roof.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the huge leopard stood up, more rubble fell in great clumps from seat of her jeans, crushing down on other buildings, made even worse when the leopard reached back to brush lightly over her rear end, clearing it of rubble with a happy rumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe\u2026.seems kinda fitting, mmmm?  All you evil dogs dying under the ass of a cat.\u201d She giggled quietly to herself, before she began to walk again, padding across the city again, casually, as if she was walking in the park. \u201cBut now all you lil folks got to see my butt, gonna have to make sure none of ya get outta here.  Too bad\u2026.for you all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe padded until she reached the outskirts of the city, her paws constantly straddling the packed interstate, the eight lane motorway packed with vehicles as dogs tried to flee the city.  She kept walking for a short distance, until she reached the front of the main group, before she dropped down onto her hands and feet.  She leant over the top of the motorway, squinting as she tried to make out each individual car but she couldn\u2019t, it was just a brightly coloured mess to her.  They enjoyed a real view though, the leopard's T-shirt hanging open enough to show off a huge amount of cleavage to the tiny furs, a final moment of some joy for many of the males.  She was going to have at least a little fun here as well, and she knew she hadn\u2019t eaten all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leant in, poking out her long, raspy tongue, letting it land heavily ontop of the front of the group, the gigantic pink organ flattening a few hundred cars with just its landing.  She began to shift forwards, dragging her tongue forwards with her as she moved, either flattening the cars out or scooping them up, feeling hundreds of them piling up on top of the fleshy organ.  She occasionally pulled the tongue back into her maw, gulping down the collected cars, before returning to lapping the cars up like it was the world\u2019s best cream.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her breed had been built for speed and endurance, often meaning she had far too much energy to deal with, so being able to burn it off was always a fun experience to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rushed around her bedroom, tail nearly wagging behind her toned, flexing rear as she ran, rapidly gathering up her selected clothing.  She pulled on a pink bra and hipsters, before pulling on a pair of loose grey sweat pants and a tight fighting white tank-top.  She contemplated wearing trainers, but decided against it, she preferred to feel the earth against her feet when she was running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t take any time to rest, just rushing down the stairs and out the front door in a flash, letting the door slam behind her as she tore out into the street where she lived.  She lived out in the suburbs of the city, her family\u2019s house one of dozens like it in the long row of houses, a great spot for her, close to her job, her school and her favourite park.  It had been one of the few reasons why she had never learnt to drive, along with her lack of concentration when just sitting around in a car when she\u2019d rather be running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take long for her to reach the park, the dog passing several other joggers as she kept at a near sprint for as long as possible.  Her maw hung open as she ran, tongue hanging out the side as she panted loudly into the cool morning air, feeling the breeze ruffling through her dense fur as she just ran for as long as she possibly could.  She constantly sniffed at the air when she was sprinting, keeping touch with all of those around her, sensitive sensory glands meaning she could pick up nearly every other person around her, many of which she recognised but some were totally new to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to slow eventually as she closed near the centre of the park where the crowds were the thickest, but also where she could grab a quick drink from one of the water fountains before she continued on with her run.  She slowed right next to the large water fountain that marked the centre of the park, dozens of other furs of all ages standing around it, chatting with each other or just enjoying the day.  She passed over to one of the small water fountains by the edge of the clearing and leant in to take a long drink, letting the cold water cool her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe straightened up slowly, letting out a happy growl to herself as she just looked around, seeing who all was around today.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Vicky\u2019s eyes focused on a figure close by to  her, large ears flicking and twitching curiously as she observed the large  Gecko from a distance.  She was an impressive looking female, incredibly toned and athletic, further added to by her smooth scales, giving her a very sleek appearance.  Her colouration was standard for many geckos, a darkish green across her back before fading to a near yellow along he inner body.  She had hair on her head, a wild mane of bright, neon blue hair that looked as unkept and scruffy as Vicky\u2019s fur.  Vicky couldn\u2019t help but stare at her, the lizard was wearing a loose tank-top and extremely tight fitting spandex shorts that hugged her rather full rump, nearly seeming out of place on such an athletic lizard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky sniffed towards her, recognising the sweet, musky scent of her sweat from her jogs before, but she had never gotten a chance to actually  meet the lizard, usually just passing her rapidly.  She wanted to say hi this time though, and she wasn\u2019t going to lose her chance as the seven foot  three inch gecko stretched against the park bench, right leg lifted  up to rest on the back of the bench as she easily lay forwards to touch her toes, giving Vicky a great view of her brilliant ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there!\u201d Vicky said cheerfully as she approached, her curled tail wagging quickly behind her as she moved up to stand beside the gecko, beaming towards her.  \u201cI\u2019ve smelt you around here before!\u201d She said rather simply before holding out a hand, \u201cI\u2019m Vicky, nice to meet \u2018cha!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Gecko blinked as she looked up from her stretch to the dog standing over her leaning form, before slowly straightening up, her large tits nearly bumping against the shorter Husky\u2019s chin. \u201cAh\u2026well, hi there dog.\u201d She said, reaching a large hand up to rub the back of her neck, working out a kink there before she looked back to Vicky, offering up a little smile to her. \u201cI\u2019m Abi, nice to meet you.  My, aren\u2019t you a pretty little thing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky\u2019s cheeks flushed crimson, ears standing more upright as she shifted in place, \u201cAwww, thanks!  You\u2019re really pretty too, and ya smell nice!  I never see you reptiles around!\u201d Vicky clasped her hands behind her own rear, swaying from side to side as she stood in front of the gecko. \u201cI like your clothes!\u201d She pointed down at the spandex shorts, \u201cI can\u2019t wear those, they\u2019re too hot on my butt because of all my fur.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbi smirked to herself, flashing lines of predatory, sharp little teeth, something that Vicky actually titled her head at, she never really had considered lizards as a predator until she was looking at Abi now.  The lizard noticed the hesitation and just smirked a little wider, leaning down towards Vicky, her large, thick tail sweeping  through the air behind her full ass. \u201cThanks for the compliments, lil darling.\u201d Abi rather shamelessly glanced down at the dog\u2019s behind when she spoke of it, eyeing up the loose sweat pants that pretty much hid it with a sharp, annoyed litle tut.\u201dThat\u2019s too bad, bet you have a nice butt too.  But despite how much I\u2019d like to talk about your butt more, I need to get back to my jog.\u201d She poked her tongue out at Vicky, the tongue a good few inches long, without the lizard even having to try much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky watched in amazement at the tongue before looking into Abi\u2019s eyes, the gecko\u2019s eyes a beautiful lavender in colour.  \u201cHehe!  I\u2019m out running too!  I could run with you, we could even race, then you\u2019d have plenty of time to look at my butt from all the way behind me!\u201d She said with a giggle up at the gecko, tail wiggling again behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbi\u2019s face cracked in a big grin at that, rolling her eyes as she lifted a large hand to rest it on Vicky\u2019s head, ruffling up her fur.  \u201cYou really wanna challenge me lil cutie?  Don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever lost a race in my life.\u201d She stood upright, stretching up onto her toes, \u201cMy legs are longer than yours lil darling, you don\u2019t stand a chance!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky just poked her tongue out at the tall gecko as she moved up to stand beside her, facing off down the path she just had came down.  She pointed down towards a lamp post two hundred metres down the path, before turning to smile back up at Abi, \u201cReady to be left in my dust?\u201d She teased, already bouncing up and down on her feet in preparation, curled tail lashing around rapidly behind her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbi just giggled down toward Vicky, glancing off down the path before suddenly bolting off, large tail bouncing around behind her full ass.  The gecko\u2019s wide feet landed on the warming concrete, wide toes build for traction and suction giving her a lot of easy grip on the ground.  Vicky let out a shrill little giggle before chasing off after Abi, she always liked finding people to exercise with, she\u2019d even let people throw a ball for her to fetch, something most dogs found to be a humiliating, insulting act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite Abi\u2019s height difference, Vicky easily caught up with her, slowing only long enough to stick her tongue out at her new friend before accelerating again, starting to put a gap between the two.  Abi was actually shocked, she had never been beaten so easily, but she had never raced such a athletic breed before, her natural competitiveness however took over, she liked winning and having the upper hand in relationships.  She liked the husky but wasn\u2019t going to let her win, so she knew there was only one thing she could do as she focused hard on the dog running in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky started to slow down as she closed in on the lamp post, starting to turn already to gloat, but as she started to look back she was hit by vertigo, going light headed and nearly dropping onto her face.  She looked down at the ground quickly to watch her feet to help her keep her balance better but something was odd.  She slowed to a stop in front of a fallen tree branch, at least 10 feet long and half a foot thick, but it didn\u2019t seem to cover the pathway ahead of her at all, instead the pathway seemed to stretch for a hundred metres either side of her, little did she realise that the tree branch was just a twig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky\u2019s ears finally sank as she felt the ground shake below her, hearing the heavy breathing of her rival coming up behind her, just far louder than it had been before.  She spins around and looks up, eyes widened with fear and shock as she watches the gigantic figure of Abi looming over head, over two hundred feet tall to the now two inch  husky.  She could only see Abi\u2019s face for a moment of the large rise of her very impressive tits before the lizard\u2019s feet replaced the sky overhead and the dog lifted her arms above her head to let out a shrill scream.</span></div></div>",

It was a shocking hint to Vicky of what would happen to her if that foot did land on top of her, but luckily for her the foot just glided overhead, landing mere inches from her.  Vicky just dropped down onto her rear, eyes watering as she shook in fear, her heart beating incredibly fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gecko didn\u2019t even stop, she just slowed her run until she was simply jogging up to their target lamp post, the gecko reaching out to slap it with a broad hand.  She spins around on a heel to face back towards Vicky, a large smirk appearing on her face, those sharp little teeth looking far more threatening to the little dog now that they were about half her height. \u201cAwww darlin\u2019!  Looks like I won, and imagine, you had such a good start.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky just sat there, whimpering out sharply to herself as she hugged her arms around her large chest, shaking there on the cool concrete.  The gecko watched her sitting there like that before frowning at that, seeming a little bit annoyed that the dog didn\u2019t reply to her immediately. \u201cUhhh, hello?\u201d She said, sounding even more annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky looked up towards Abi slowly, eyes very slowly drawing up over her, starting at those large toes, each toe three quarters the size of her, looking up to the lizard\u2019s crotch covered by the thin spandex, an obvious camel toe in the front from the dog\u2019s new angle.  Suddenly the lizard\u2019s hand moved in front of her crotch, curling a finger up towards her face. \u201cI\u2019m up here lil doggy.\u201d Vicky followed the direction up until she found herself staring at the gecko\u2019s huge grinning face. \u201cGood girl!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-you\u2026.you did this to me?!\u201d She whined out sharply, ears flat on her head, a few tears running down her cheeks, the dog shifting back on her rear, shuffling back from the massive gecko slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlls fair in love and war, lil cutie.  You didn\u2019t tell me I COULDN\u2019T shrink ya, now did you?\u201d She pokes her tongue  out towards Vicky, seeming to keep up her friendly persona, despite having just rendered the dog into a literal bug now. \u201cBut like I said, I won your little race.  And I want my prize.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cP-prize?  What are you talking about?\u201d Vicky couldn\u2019t even stand up,  her legs were too weak and she felt nauseous, her mind swimming as shock racked her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve decided I want YOU as my prize, its only fair.\u201d She says with a rather friendly smile towards the dog, leaning down towards her. \u201cYou\u2019re just the right size to be my prize, lil cutie, I\u2019d love to take you home with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t do that, I\u2019m a dog!  It\u2019s not allowed!\u201d Vicky  shouted up towards her, mustering as much courage as her fragile little body could summon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbi didn\u2019t look impressed at all, folding her arms over her breasts, cocking her hips to the right as she perks an eye ridge at Vicky. \u201cOh?  So you\u2019re telling me what I am allowed to take as my prize now.  Do you really think you\u2019re in any position to boss me around?\u201d  Vicky just stared, opening and clothing her mouth a few times, unable to find any real response to her. \u201cI like you, wouldn\u2019t have asked for you if I didn\u2019t, but I don\u2019t like people telling me no.\u201d She says, glaring down at her slightly. \u201cThere are a lot of dangers for little folks like you\u2026\u2026.especially if folks like you happened to get A LOT smaller.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbi smirked down to Vicky,  the look on the dog\u2019s face making it painfully clear that she realised who had all of the power in this little relationship now.  Vicky kept quiet for a few long moments before she just  slowly nods up towards Abi, \u201cYou win\u2026ma\u2019am\u2026.\u201d She whines out sharply, head dipped submissively, which brought a very happy smile to Abi\u2019s face, her large tail lashing around behind her full ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is such a good girl\u2026awww\u2026you know how to make a girl happy.\u201d She leant down, demonstrating her flexibility again, able to lean from the waist and plant a kiss to the entire body of the dog at her feet. \u201cBut my only problem.\u201d She straightened up once more and waved her paws down over the hips of her spandex shorts, and Vicky immediately realised what she meant right before she said it. \u201cNo pockets.  So, now I have to think of somewhere interesting to put ya\u2026 Now, where should you go\u2026.?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Hehe, and I don\u2019t want to have you smeared over my tits before we get some real fun in.\u201d She squats, spandex shorts tightening over her groin region, the shorts creeping up between her nether lips, an intimidating enough sight for such a small dog.. \u201cBut I have a good idea!  You liked trying to make me look at YOUR butt, now how about I give you a perfect chance to see a perfect ass?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky\u2019s eyes widened again, the dog starting to creep backwards again but Abi just cut her off by moving a hand behind her, smiling a little. \u201cNow.  Don\u2019t make this hard lil doggy, haven\u2019t I proven I win enough already.\u201d She focused down at the little dog, lavender eyes staring powerfully down over Vicky\u2019s shaking little body , and Vicky was forced to endure that same feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu as her head began to swim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world changed for Victoria again, swelling out once more as the tiny dog was left sitting on her ass in a small crater on the path that had been too small for her to even notice before.  She slowly leant back, tracing her eyes up along the now god-like Gecko that squatted over her, the dog\u2019s main focus however fell on that crotch again.  It was like a canyon to her now, the dog knew she could easily get lost in the canyon alone, which made the prospect of her rear even scarier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was nothing but a speck to the Gecko now, a little red and white speck barely noticeable on the ground between her huge feet.  This was power though, Vicky was nothing to her now, Vicky probably wouldn\u2019t even stand a chance against a single ant.  To Abi the temptation was to exert even more power, make her dog even smaller just for the sheer hell of it, but she resisted, that would come later for the big gecko.  She scoops her claw down, scooping up the miniature husky inside her finger claw, lifting her rapidly to her face, staring down at the tiny creature she had full power over.  She could even BREATH the dog in, the thought of that alone getting her wet.  She shook her head, pushing the thoughts from her mind for now, she knew where she wanted the dog, and she was determined to put her there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky was screaming the whole time, shouting out tiny curses and cries for help, but the Gecko couldn\u2019t even hear her voice any longer, just moving her paws around behind her back, her free paw gripping the back of her shorts and tugging them open while the paw holding Vicky moved her over the now open shorts.  Vicky got a nose full of the potent stink immediately, the musky, earthy scent of the gecko\u2019s ass mixed with her strong sweat.  She got a look as she was tipped over slowly, the dog staring down at that impossibly huge chasm that stretched out far below her.  Vicky gripped at the claw as best she could, digging her claws in but she found no grip at all,, slipping down until she fell from the claw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Abi it was only a few inches to drop but to Vicky it was like a few hundred feet, the husky falling down through the air, a shrill scream sounding out into the air but none could even hear the slightest noise, not even her tormentor.  The dog disappeared down into dark cavern, the gecko smirking as she watched her prize disappear before finally releasing the waistband of her shorts, letting them snap shut.</span></div></div>",

She was too small to be pressed between both cheeks but she was held easily in place by the thin layer of sweat her blush fur was stuck too, the dog barely able to even shift on those smooth yellow scales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was little movement there, the dog only hearing the dull, double rumble of her tormentors heartbeat, the vibrations from it alone easily felt through the lizard\u2019s thin layer of scales.  It was so slow and calm, compared to her rapid, accelerated beat, the husky panicking down in those depths, knowing the predicament she was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gecko finally started to move then, starting at a slow, careful walk, those mountain-like ass cheeks flexing and grinding with each motion she made, but to Vicky she was still too small to be ground together because of the depth she was in.  She could hear the scales further out on the rump cheeks grinding and rubbing together as the lizard moved, but she was close to the very base of the cheeks, safer here.  She knew she was safer because of it, but because of the close proximity to the gecko\u2019s tail hole, she got an overpowering scent from the lizard\u2019s rear, only made worse by her own very sensitive nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbi was just getting started though, her walk became a march and then finally a jog, those cheeks crushing in deeper and deeper with each step, Vicky able to nearly  FEEL the incredible wall of flesh and muscle opposite her closing in each time but she was still safe for now.  The smell was getting worse though the longer that the gecko moved, sweat and heat causing the already powerful stink to intensify, growing more and more potent with each passing second.  The spandex shorts were near air-tight, making it like a sauna for the trapped dog, the scent fogging the dog\u2019s head and making her thoughts swim, nearly sending her slipping into unconsciousness but she held onto the sounds around her, but it was a struggle to stay awake.  That was until she was pulled back to reality as a loud, sharp crack filled the air around her, what would have been a door slamming shut, only intensified a thousand times because of her size.  The gecko was home, and it was finally time for Vicky to find out what this lizard was truly like, had she claimed  the husky as a prize for fun, or for cruelty.</span></div></div>",

The gecko yanked her shorts down at the back, exposing her rear fully to the natural light in her house, temporally blinding the tiny dog.  When her vision returned to her, she found herself staring out at the gecko\u2019s massive rear end, reflected in the pristine glass of a full length mirror positioned infront of her.  The gecko standing there, totally naked, holding her rear apart with her right hand, the gecko lent round as she peered curiously at her own ass, beautiful lavender eyes tracing over her own ass, looking for her lost prize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky didn\u2019t know what to do for a moment, she didn\u2019t really know if she wanted to be found, but it was most likely a better option than to be left stuck to the ass, especially now as she turned to look deeper into the crevice, realising she was only ten feet or so from the tight, clenched sphincter of the lizard\u2019s tail hole.  She looked back towards the mirror and pulled both arms forwards, peeling her arms free from the sweat coated scales, waving both hands towards the gigantic lizard.  Abi stared for a few long moments before her face turned into a deep frown, shifting her hips slowly to try and get a better view of her rear but she couldn\u2019t see anything at all, the dog simply too small for her to see especially from this distance.  She tried to focus, lavender eyes widening as she tried to cause the dog to grow but she couldn\u2019t force up the dog\u2019s size, not without being able to see her and visualise her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbi grunted out in annoyance and rolled her eyes, letting the cheek go, her full ass closing up again, nearly leaving the dog left in total darkness once more, on able to see a tiny amount of light from far below her, occasionally catching the slightest glimpses at the back of the lizard\u2019s calf or the carpet.  That was until the carpet was replaced by the view of white tiles, and the dog new where they were immediately by the faint smell of old water and bleach; they were in the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky struggled and screamed out, trying to cast out her voice as loud as she could but all she got back was a slight echo as the  sounds bounced around between those cheeks.  She expected death to reach out and grab her, the dog\u2019s life to end with the simply act of flushing the toilet but that wasn\u2019t to be, as the gecko tugged her rear apart again.  The gecko\u2019s other paw swung into view, carrying a massive sheet of toilet roll, which she carefully rubbed along the inside of her cheeks, sweeping up as carefully as she could, trying to wipe the dog off like you would a stray speck of shit.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Soon made even worse as the gecko shifted up a magnifying glass, holding it over the tiny speck stuck right in the centre of the damp spot.  \u201cHehe!  Is that your little tushie sticking up in the air?  Go on, lift your tail up, I want to see it even more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky glared up towards the gigantic eye, stretched out even more by the magnifying glass, becoming a near sky to the speck-sized dog.

She could hear thunder above her, but it was just the lizard letting out a happy \u2018murr\u2019, the vibrations easily felt through the toilet paper she was left stuck too, a truly degrading place to lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm, seems you were right though, I\u2019d end up looking at your little ass.  Now I want to see it bare though, take off your clothes like my good little girl.\u201d Abi\u2019s voice was deafening still, far too loud for the tiny dog, making her ears ring, but she could still make out each word.  Vicky was obedient, the dog slowly pushing herself up from the sticky surface of the toilet paper, quite an effort for the dog, but she made it.  She tugged down her sweat pants and panties in one go, before tossing them aside, before pulling her tank-top off, no bra underneath to hide her, leaving her totally exposed to the Gecko\u2019s piercing gaze.   She turned and bent over forwards, clasping her hands around her ankles to keep herself down, revealing her ass and cunt, framed by her toned, white furred thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbi smiled far above, tail giving a short wag, watching that toned little ass pressing up into the air on her instruction.  She liked obedient girls, her last few girlfriends were mostly all obedient and nice but this was something else entirely, she\u2019d only shrunken a few people down before, and they all screamed and complained constantly, none actually followed orders when they were give.  She eyed that ass through the magnifying glass before finally speaking again, nearly two minutes after the dog had taken that pose. \u201cYou\u2019re being really good so far.  Now, I want to see those tits.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky complied again, standing upright and turning to look up into the sky, her arms dangling at her sides, ears lowered flat onto her skull, the dog looking totally defeated, and she was.  Her perky pink nipples sticking out of the white fur on her breasts were barely even visible to the titanic gecko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm\u2026.goddess dammit\u2026I want you\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She could do nothing but stare far above her, towards the Gecko\u2019s face, a cute, innocent expression across her muzzle right now, seeming totally out of place to Vicky with the lizard basically holding her captive like this.  Vicky said nothing though, just watching quietly, her eyes quickly dropping from that innocent expression to those large, bouncing tits.  The tits were incredible, even behind the lizard\u2019s tank top, obviously there was no bra on underneath yet her breasts still were totally perky and firm, very little sag in there.  Vicky had liked them at first, but now they were actually intimidating, like two mountains crashing into each other with each step the lizard took, throwing out echoing rumbles that dwarfed even thunder to the tiny canine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbi sat down on the couch, setting the loose piece of toilet paper down on the armrest before she reached down to grab her tank top, tugging it off her and tossing it to the side.  She turned to face down towards the piece of toilet paper, her tits finally on display, pink nipples poking out from the yellow scales.  She flashed a huge, toothy smirk down at the piece of toilet paper, barely able to see the dog she was showing off to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm\u2026.like I said earlier, wish I could\u2019ve put you in here to show you what a REAL woman is like\u2026\u201d She poked a finger down towards her deep cleavage, \u201cNow I get to show you\u2026.\u201d She picked up the toilet paper, moving it across to her chest, holding it in front of her right breast, holding the toilet paper so the tiny speck of a dog was left in the shadow of her nipple. \u201cJeez, look at that, FIFTY of you wouldn\u2019t even be the size of my nipple\u2026.mmmm, bet I'm making you feel like even less of a woman now, hmmmm?\u201d She could feel herself getting wet, grinding her thighs together slightly as she peered down at Vicky, chewing lightly on her lower lip.  She loved this, she had enjoyed lording her large tits and ass over even normal sized girls, but here she was with a dog who was nothing compared even to just her nipple, or even her clitoris.  This was perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe\u2026.now for the final question\u2026.\u201d She lifted the toilet paper up to her face, before blinking, making a face as she picked up the scent of her own ass from the sweat soaked into the paper.  She poked her tongue out to the side, pulling her paw back a little as she let out a loud giggle down at the dog. \u201cJeez, glad I\u2019m not you, that must be quite the smell\u2026\u2026maybe I should put you somewhere that should stink even more\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just like all my other little bitches then...and I guess you want to end up like the rest of them, hmm?\" She wasn't being careful with her voice now though, not speaking quietly to protect Vicky's ears, this was her full volume, enough to cause the dog's ears to ring.

She Vicky must still be trapped and at the mercy of her butt. That thought really turned the gecko on. This small dog was literally at the mercy of her private parts. She grinned as this thought made her hornier than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I don't NEED to see you to have fun with you,\" she said, clenching her monstrous buttocks hard, trying to feel the little canine shoved into her crack Meanwhile, Vicky could hear a squelching noise as she turned and saw the massive ring of flesh that was the anus start flexing and puckering, almost as if it was coming to life. \"There's plenty of fun games for me and my little passenger to play!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lizard ran back to her room and turned on a small fan she had sitting on the table. She then laid on her back in the center of the floor, and displayed her flexibility by rolling back and standing on her head, her naked ass pointing straight up at the ceiling, her pussy starting to drip juices onto her chest, and enjoyed the moment for a minute before she spread her cheeks apart as much as she could, letting cool air and light invade her crevasse to prepare for the next part of her plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky awaited what would happen next. The gecko surely couldn't leave her in there forever, could she? Her thoughts were interrupted when the gecko's anus suddenly took on all of the likeness of a black hole as Vicky's gravity was suddenly shifted towards it. She would have fallen if it wasn't for the the thin layer of sweat on the gecko still holding Vicky in place, so she remained trapped in the soft cheeks of her captor. Vicky knew that it was loads better out here than actually INSIDE of the gecko girl. She also noticed it was getting much cooler, with the air now slipping in and out of her prison, getting rid of the stench, but it was also drying and evaporating the sweat holding her in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gecko then went into part two of her plan and took one of her hands off of her buttocks, while still using the other to hold it open. She brought her free hand down, open palm, onto her cheeks and slapped them as hard as she could. She watched as the force rippled through them, causing them to shake and wave. She did this repeatedly, getting turned out by the whole ordeal. The ripples, nothing more than a display of her physique to the gecko, was nothing less than a very bad earthquake to the husky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky held on for dear life, but the sweat was drying up quickly. As soon as she was able, Vicky turned her body around and dug her claws into the gecko's flesh, which didn't even phase the large woman. A mosquito bite would have been more noticeable. At first, it seemed like Vicky would be able to hold on, but she suddenly noticed the gecko doing something with her hands, as a thunderous boom echoed around her, and shock waves went speeding past her, making her grip weaker. It was like trying to climb an erupting volcano. More booms and earthquakes invaded the canyon and the husky girl felt as if she could hold on no longer.</span></div></div>",

A loud wet squelching noise and the feeling of flesh rubbing her on all sides was invading her senses, other than the horrible smell emanating from the pit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gecko gave a start and tightened up for a brief moment. She felt the husky's impact on her clenching muscle, and acted quickly, she turned in place and grabbed a  mirror from her nightstand and held it at an angle to get a clear view of her hole. What she saw was the biggest turn on of her life. A little speck of a dog pinned in place by the tiniest of wrinkles in her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe this!

You're practically caught in its teeth!\" the lizard said, flexing it a few times, watching in awe as the canine speck disappeared into the anal folds, only to re-emerge when she relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that was it. Vicky learned just how pathetic she was. She was being totally dominate by the tiny wrinkles in another woman's anus which appeared enormous to her.

She was getting a real kick out of this, and wanted to make it last as long as possible.

The aroma between the cheeks was sweet in comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titanic lizard rump's muscles acted in unison and Vicky went over the edge into the bottomless pit that awaited her. Nothing could stop her fall and she felt the entire world fade away as it was replaced with the sounds and stench of the lizard's bowels, finally coming to rest when she hit one of the walls of the colon and became lodged in it slimy embrace, the mucus easily holding her tiny form. The beast had finally won out and now she was finally fully within the gecko's private parts.</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gecko couldn't come up with words to describe it. This was beyond domination. This was nothing short of turning a person into a insignificant sex toy for your butt to play with whenever it became lonely. The gecko's fingers worked deep inside her pussy as she imagined what it must be like being so deep inside her backside, forced to endure every moan, every ounce of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Vicky knew this experience all too well as the tunnel went wild with the lizard's passion and started to quiver and shake.

A foot? Could she even reach her anymore!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed her eyes as she approached her climax, and stuck a finger right into her tight anus, forcing it in until it could go in no further and wiggling it around against her walls.

Wave after wave of pleasure ripped through her, tightening the entrances to her body and spraying her juices all over herself.

She did, however, realize she was now standing, something that understandably struck her as odd given that she was sitting only just moments again. She lifted her hands up, and rubbed at her eyes, before giving her head a good shake, in order to regain her senses. What she would open her eyes to see, however, would certainly serve to startle her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat stood just a few feet before her was the same ring she had just found only minutes ago. However, to say it had undergone an impressive size change would be an understatement. The intricate metal works of the steel band stretched far above her head now. Heck, she'd need one tall ladder just to reach the top of it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah... That's weird!\" She laughed it off to herself, thinking the ring had just grown to an absurd height, and turned to continue her walk. It was not until then that she would realize what had truly happened. She was standing on the park bench still... With the rest of the park stretching out beyond her for miles upon miles. Blurred figures of simply enormous figures went about their business far off in the distance, all of which sized appropriately to be gods and goddesses in their own rights. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky's mind started to race. Had she shrunk? If so, just how small had she gotten? What the hell did that ring do to her? With her heart beating faster, in a state of panic, she looked around for some sort of answer. While she wouldn't very much like the sight she saw, she was completely awestruck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooming far ahead and above the ring, and, in effect Vicky, was the same wolfess she had sat down next to before. Absorbed still in her reading, the wolfess was a terrifying sight to Vicky. She had to be over a mile tall! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky gulped, and set her vision back down to the ring. It seemed like she had two choices now, given that the plunge off the bench would be outright suicide. She could risk the ring again, and attempt to reverse the effects... Or she could try and get the wolfess' attention, however impossible that may seem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a small amount of thought, she decided to....</span></div></div>",

She stuck her finger into the fresh, white icing. It was the same colour as her father's snowy fur, but the girl took no notice. She was too worried about where her dad was. She licked the bit of icing off the tip of her finger with her little pink tongue. It tasted sweet. She peeled more of the wrapper back, exposing a large portion of the cupcake. Something didn't seem right. She could feel it. Maybe she was just imagining things. She opened her mouth wide, exposing her large front teeth. She pulled it closer and closer, ready to take the first bite out of this delicious cupcake.</span></div></div>",

The husky giggled as she noticed that little ads were printed along the side of the vehicle, just like on a real bus! The whole thing reminded her of the toys she used to play with as a pup\u2026 but as she flipped it around in her hands, she heard something rattling around inside. She brought it up to her ears, shaking it curiously. Yep, there was definitely something inside. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cOooh! Sounds like there\u2019s a little somethin\u2019 extra!\u201d</b></span> She smiles, her ears perking up in excitement as she pries off the top of the bus with her claws. What could possibly be hidden away inside, she wondered?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally pulled the roof straight off the bus, and bent over on her hands and knees, peeking inside with an eye. As her eyes adjusted, she realized that the bus\u2019 seats were full of little mouse people, each about two centimeters tall, all looking frightened and disheveled after she had shaken the tiny bus so fiercely. Her heart sank as she remembered the warnings that had been going around the neighborhood a few days prior. This was a tour bus! The mice people had been taking these buses all around the city, and the police had strictly demanded that the larger anthros do not interfere. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cOh, no\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, little guys\u2026\u201d</b></span> She frowned, holding the bus up once again as she looked sadly down on its terrified passengers. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cDid I ruin your tour?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was tempted to just put the bus back down and pretend it never happened\u2026 but she couldn\u2019t just do that! She had to make it up to them somehow! She rubbed her chin with her other paw for a few moments, pondering, until an idea struck her. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cOh! I know!\u201d</b></span> She smiled, her ears perking up and her tail wagging with excitement. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cI could give you guys a tour! I could show you around way faster than this dingy ol\u2019 bus ever could!\u201d</b></span> The mice seem horrified by the idea of being carried around any longer, but their protests go unheard by the dim-witted husky, too busy excitedly coming up with ideas for her \u2018tour\u2019. She could show them around the museum, or take them to the beach, or, or\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to just start with the park. She carried the bus-full of mice around and she continued her job, giving completely nonsensical descriptions of everything she sees. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cAnd over there, we have... a duck! There are tons of those, like, pretty much all over the place,\u201d</b></span> she says, pointing excitedly, putting on her best \u2018tour guide\u2019 voice. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cOh! And there, we have our park\u2019s famous statue! I don\u2019t know who it\u2019s of, but\u2026 it looks pretty cool!\"</b></span> Meanwhile, the captive mice try to ignore the husky\u2019s booming voice, hoping that she eventually gets bored and puts them down. The entire trip, the driver of the tiny bus speaks breathlessly into his radio, reporting their predicament and calling for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround the park, various guards and police officers are notified that a mice tour bus has been taken captive in the area, and instantly jump into action, questioning everybody they see.

Her heart instantly leaps in her chest, remembering that she technically wasn\u2019t supposed to be interfering with the mice\u2019s tour. She nervously hides the bus behind her as she turns to face the officer, though she\u2019s not very subtle. <span class=\"cbrown\"><b>\u201cThere is no need to be alarmed, but about a dozen mice have gone missing in this park recently,\u201d</b></span> the police officer, a muscular hyena, calmly questions. <span class=\"cbrown\"><b>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t happen to know anything about that, would you?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201c... no,\u201d</b></span> she lies, obviously nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hyena almost immediately notices that the husky was trying to hide something behind her back. <span class=\"cbrown\"><b>\u201cHey! What are you trying to hide?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201c... n-nothing!\u201d</b></span> She insisted, nervously. She hoped it wouldn\u2019t come to this, but it seemed like she didn\u2019t have any choice. Without moving her arms, she quickly hid the entire bus down the back of her tight briefs, instantly pressing the bus against her toaned ass. Most of the mice clung to their seats for dear life; the bus driver, however, had been standing up at the time, and was accidentally sent flying. The husky was too distracted to even notice one of the mice slipping between her furry cheeks, not even able to feel his tiny struggles. The other mice could only watch in horror as the bus driver, and in turn, his radio, was swallowed up by the husky\u2019s voluptuous rear. Their only chance of escape was now gone. They were helpless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cop crosses his arms, thinking he has her dead to rights. <span class=\"cbrown\"><b>\u201cShow me your hands,\u201d</b></span> he demands, only to be surprised then the husky reaches her hands out in front of her, revealing them to be empty. <span class=\"cbrown\"><b>\u201cAnd your pockets.\u201d</b></span> Vicky rubs the sides of her sweat pants, pointing out her complete lack of pockets. The hyena grimaces, realizing he\u2019s reached a dead end. <span class=\"cbrown\"><b>\u201cHm. Well, have a nice day, ma\u2019am.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cY-you too,\u201d</b></span> she said, nervously, before sighing in relief as the hyena wanders past to interrogate somewhere else. She quickly walks off to somewhere private, grinding the bus, still full of passengers, between her thick thighs as she walks. Finally, she hides behind one of the restrooms on the edge of the park, and finally pulls the bus from her sweat shorts. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cPhew. Sorry about that, little guys. That must\u2019ve been sorta gross,\u201d</b></span> she giggles, cradling the bus like a doll. The mice inside were now terrified beyond belief, but they were too small for her to notice. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cI\u2019m not really, like, supposed to be giving you this tour. But I\u2019m not gonna let that stop us!\u201d</b></span> She smiles, wagging her tail as her excitement returns. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cThis is going to be the best tour ever!\u201d</b></span> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut first, she needs to find a way to hide them. She rubs her chin, pondering her situation. She didn\u2019t have any bags or pockets, and even if she did, the bus would be way too big to effectively hide in any of them. Eventually, she decides to just get ditch the bus altogether. It was totally busted up, anyway, since she tore the roof off. The mice themselves would be much easier to hide. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cBut first, let me put you somewhere a little more\u2026 comfortable,\u201d</b></span> she smiles, giggling at the concept of hiding the mice with her impressive bust. She reaches into the bus and grab the tiny mice one by one, ten in all, tucking them into the front of her ill-fitting bra so that her cute little heads remain poking out the collar of her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mice were miserable as they were pressed tightly against her perky breasts, clinging to her shirt for dear life, afraid they might fall deeper and meet a similar fate to their driver. The husky herself, on the other hand, was gleefully skipping around town, leaving the tour bus far behind her. She certainly made better time than the bus did; within a half hour, she had shown the mice every single thing of interest within a half-mile interest, even though the nauseated rodents had long ago stopped listening to the canine\u2019s ramblings. Eventually, even the husky grew tired of sprinting all around town. At this rate, it would take them weeks before they reached anything truly interesting, and she was desperate to show them one of her favorite spots...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The remaining ten mice tucked away inside the husky\u2019s tight shirt chattered amongst themselves, their tiny voices unheard by the oblivious canine, as she hiked up the mountain trail with natural ease. Their bus driver was probably still stuck somewhere in the dark, warm, sweaty valley between Vicky\u2019s athletic cheeks. He had gone completely unnoticed by the canine, and the mice could only hope that he was okay back there. In the meantime, all they could do was ride it out and hope the rest of the husky\u2019s \u2018tour\u2019 goes smoothly. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cWow. Y\u2019all see that?\u201d</b></span> Vicky said upon reaching the top of the hill, watching out over the expansive cityscape that stretched from horizon to horizon below. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cThis is the most beautiful view of the city, right here\u2026\u201d</b></span> The mice were actually beginning to enjoy themselves as they looked out over the spectacular view, awed by the sheer size of the city. Their regular tour guides never showed them places like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was about lunchtime, so Vicky decided the adorable little mice should have a picnic right on top of the hill. She freed them from the confines of her bra, setting them down on a patch of dirt with an amazing view of the city. Although she only had a single energy bar to spare, the rodent people were so tiny, they were able to easily divide it up between themselves. Vicky sat down by them as they relaxed on the hilltop, giggling as she watched the tiny, doll-like people have their feast. The rodents were beginning to enjoy their tour at this point, and were charmed by the husky as she told them stories of her misadventures around town. After their picnic dragged on for a while, though, Vicky noticed a ticket that seemed to have fallen out of one of the mouse\u2019s pocket. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cOh! What\u2019s this?\u201d</b></span> She smiled, curiously. The mice didn\u2019t seem to be able to speak loud enough for her to hear, so she enjoyed any possibility of communication.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to squint to read it, but from what she could tell, it was some kind of ticket for the tour the mouse were supposed to be taking. She first noticed, in a particularly big font, the text <i>\u20183 DAY TOUR\u2019</i>. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cYou guys are on a three day tour?\u201d</b></span> She smiled, her tail wagging as she was filled with excitement, which ended up knocking some of the mice off their balance. Apparently, the little tour they were taking needed three days just to make it a couple miles\u2026 but with your size, you could show them all the coolest spots in the entire city in that time! As she watched the mice finish their meal, her mind raced as she tried to come up with a plan on how to fill the three days with as much stuff as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time they finally finished with their little \u2018picnic\u2019, the husky was eager to get moving. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cAlright guys, let\u2019s get moving,\u201d</b></span> she said, tucking the mice one-by-one into her bra once again; they didn\u2019t seem to resist much this time, and in fact, some of the males seemed positively eager. She giggled, glad that they were getting comfortable tucked away beneath her tight shirt. Satisfied, the husky jogged down the hill again, a plan already half-formed in her mind. Today, she\u2019d stop by a few interesting vistas, stop for dinner, see a few things along the coast, and be home by sundown. She giggled at the idea of making the mice little beds out of napkins\u2026 but she\u2019d cross that bridge when she came to it. First thing\u2019s first; it was time to visit...</span></div></div>",

There were so many different speices Vicky could barely believe it, from short mouse girls and birds to looming whales, crocodiles and equines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced out across the beach as she tried to look for spots that could fit her in, and could only see about four of them.  One was next to an Orca, the looming female was just over 20 feet tall.  The next was beside a tall equine, the toned, muscular female clydesdale was near amazonian at around 18 feet and powerful looking.  Another was beside a short mouse girl, but she wasn't like many mice Vicky had seen, she was busty and wide hipped, like a super model instead of flat chested and short like many in her species.  She was even taller than many mice at 5 foot 4 inches.  The final space was possibly the most dangerous, but it was also the biggest space, for good reason.  The space was beside an amazonian crocodile woman, about 18 foot tall, toned and lean, definitely a powerful and dangerous predator.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Vicky frowned when you realized that, despite the fact that the rest of the beach was incredibly crowded, there was a huge, empty space surrounding a large gator woman who was just innocently sunbathing on the shore. Alligators, bears, orcas and such always tend to get stereotypes as dangerous predators\u2026 but Vicky tries not to judge people based on just their species! The husky had made friends with plenty of suspected \u2018predators\u2019 that turned out to be some of the nicest people she\u2019s ever met. Besides, the gator woman looked so lonely, just lying there by herself. Nobody should have to be lonely on the beach! Some places are just sacred! Thus, the husky comfortably set down her towel on the sand a few meters away from the giant alligator, without a moment of hesitation. A few of the other beach-goers stared at her and muttered to eachother, as if wondering how she could be so daring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she tried to mind her own business, she couldn\u2019t help but take a glance at the alligator woman every once in awhile. It was rare that she got so close to an anthro so big. She noticed that the huge reptile seemed to be sunbathing topless, and her breasts, pressed against the sand, looked to bigger than the canine\u2019s entire body. Vicky wondered why an alligator would ever bother sunbathing, until she realized the woman is probably cold blooded. Maybe she\u2019s just warming up? As the husky got ready to take a dip in the beautiful pacific ocean, the alligator suddenly muttered something over her shoulder. <span class=\"cgreen\"><b>\u201cYou\u2019re in my spot,\u201d</b></span> the reptile growled over her shoulder, not bothering to open her eyes or even move a muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cUh\u2026 actually, I\u2019m all the way over here,\u201d</b></span> the husky smiled, thinking that there had just been a misunderstanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alligator woman groaned, having to put up with another moronic beachgoer. <span class=\"cgreen\"><b>\u201cNo, I mean\u2026\u201d</b></span> She said, holding out an arm, still not bothering to open her eyes. <span class=\"cgreen\"><b>\u201cYou\u2019re in MY spot.\u201d</b></span> The alligator gestured to the sand all around her, and Vicky realized that she was trying to claim a whole swathe of the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cWhat? You can\u2019t call dibs on, like, the whole beach!\u201d</b></span> Vicky said, indignantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alligator slowly turned her massive head, her huge, yellow, reptilian eye staring daggers at her. <span class=\"cgreen\"><b>\u201cYou\u2019re not very bright, are you, runt?\u201d</b></span> She growls, looking like a formidable godzilla as she loomed over the canine. She showed her huge maw to the husky, pointing at the dark tunnel of her throat with a claw.<span class=\"cgreen\"><b> \u201cYou either get OUT of my spot, or you\u2019re going to end up IN here. Your choice.\u201d</b></span> Vicky was a little intimidated by the view down the gator\u2019s throat, but she maintained her composure. The alligator was probably just bitter about how she\u2019s been treated in the past, and just wanted to be left alone. But\u2026 Vicky still believed that they could be friends! She just had to be persistent!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cY-you wouldn\u2019t eat me,\u201d</b></span> the husky shook her head, the nervousness apparent in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge gator woman cackled. <span class=\"cgreen\"><b>\u201cWhat makes you so sure?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky sighed, choosing her words carefully. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cBecause\u2026 I think you\u2019re a good person,\u201d</b></span> she said, staring at her paws, shivering with fear as the reptile towered over here. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cA-and\u2026 you wouldn\u2019t want to hurt anybody.\u201d</b></span> Vicky flinched as the gator lifted up her chin with a claw, but remained dedicated. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cAnd I think we could be friends!\u201d</b></span> She yelled passionately, finishing her speech. The alligator woman raised a brow, taken aback by the canine\u2019s response. She had never met somebody so brave\u2026 and/or stupid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\"><b>\u201cInteresting theories you have there,\u201d</b></span> the alligator smirked, smiling a big, toothy smile, showing her rows of huge, sharp teeth. <span class=\"cgreen\"><b>\u201cWanna test them out?\u201d</b></span></span></div></div>",

It\u2019s no secret that a number of anthros have passed through the gator woman\u2019s digestive tract over the years; this was normal for predators of her stature, after all. While it\u2019s nominally illegal, as long as she only eats someone occasionally, the authorities look the other way, knowing that trying to take down a predator of her size would only result in extensive casualties. Indeed, the gator could just gulp the ditzy little husky down right this very moment, and nobody else on the beach would dare to interfere. Indeed, she imagined the canine\u2019s curvy, voluptuous figure would make for a fulfilling snack\u2026 however, the gator couldn\u2019t help but be intrigued by the brave teenager. Nobody had ever stood up to her like this for as long as she could remember, much less tried to call her out on her \u2018bluff\u2019. Perhaps this little mutt would be more entertaining alive\u2026 <b><span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cAlright, dog. Let\u2019s be \u2018friends\u2019,\u201d</span></b> she smirked, reaching out and gently picking up the husky by the waist with her huge, clawed hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"clgrey\">\u201cW-whoa! What are you doing?\u201d</span></b> The husky wriggled around in her grasp as the gator woman slowly climbed to her feet, soon towering over the rest of the crowd, not bothering to put her top back on, letting her huge, scaly breasts loom over every anthro on the beach. For the spectators, it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to witness a rack of such impossible proportions; most were distracted, though, by the terrifying event that was unfolding. They were sure that poor canine woman was about to get eaten, right before their eyes! The beachgoers collectively held their breaths as the reptile lifted Vicky up to eye-level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\"><b>\u201cJust taking you along for a swim,\u201d</b></span> the gator teased, her tone making it obvious she was mocking the husky\u2019s naivety. <b><span class=\"cgreen\">\u201cWe are \u2018friends\u2019, after all, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</span></b> The gator woman gave Vicky a good look down her cavernous throat, making it obvious what would happen to her if she declined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201c... yes, we\u2019re friends,\u201d</b></span> Vicky said, trying to hide her fear, as she was starting to regret this whole thing. She squirmed a bit in the gator\u2019s grip; she was being held up around two stories in the air, and with her fear of heights, she wasn\u2019t quite enjoying it. The gator cackled sadistically, seeing the helpless canine\u2019s discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\"><b>\u201cWell, fantastic, then. Hold on!\u201d</b></span> The reptile clutched Vicky tightly against her soft bust as she braced herself; and suddenly, without warning, the gator began sprinting towards the water. <span class=\"cgreen\"><b>\u201cCannonball!\u201d</b></span> The swimmers in the ocean before her tried desperately to swim out of the way, but a few slow or unlucky anthros ended up getting caught beneath the huge woman as she descended into the water. Luckily, the water was deep enough that they weren\u2019t injured, but a couple were pinned underwater by the gator\u2019s huge bikini-clad ass, pressing them into the sand. The gator woman didn\u2019t even notice them, so entertained by the horrified look on the husky\u2019s face as the two of them plummeted into the ocean at terrifying speeds. <span class=\"cgreen\"><b>\u201cWew! Wasn\u2019t that fun?\u201d</b></span> She teased the canine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky was panting, her heart still beating rapidly in her chest. She didn\u2019t expect the gator to run that fast, nor did she expect the jump to feel like she was falling to her doom. Still, she had more pressing concerns. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201c... those\u2026 people\u2026\u201d</b></span> She eventually managed to choke out between pants. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201c... you\u2026 landed on them\u2026\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gator was confused for a moment, but when she concentrated, she realized she could indeed feel a couple anthros pressed beneath her rear. <span class=\"cgreen\"><b>\u201cWhoops! Silly me!\u201d</b></span> She cackled, scooting over, reaching deep underwater and picking the anthros up from where she was once sitting. They didn\u2019t seem to be permanently injured, but they had been knocked out by the lack of oxygen. <span class=\"cgreen\"><b>\u201cAw, poor things. These silly little anthros never seem to have any sense of self preservation\u2026\u201d</b></span> She teased Vicky, as she dangled the two unconscious anthros up in front of her face. <span class=\"cgreen\"><b>\u201cHm\u2026 they look like they\u2019d make a great snack, though,\u201d</b></span> she said, just to see Vicky\u2019s horrified reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cN-no!\u201d</b></span> The husky yelled out instinctively, despite her lack of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\"><b>\u201cNo?\u201d</b></span> The alligator replied, feigning surprise. <span class=\"cgreen\"><b>\u201cWell, a gal\u2019s gotta eat somethin\u2019. I guess we can go out to a restaurant, but only the most premium buffets can fill this belly\u2026\u201d</b></span> She gestured to her large, toned stomach, which was covered in slightly lighter scales than the rest of this body. <span class=\"cgreen\"><b>\u201cWhat, are you offering to pay?\u201d</b></span> Vicky saw where this was going. She was already having some trouble financially, trying to get her foot in the door in a place like this. She definitely couldn\u2019t afford some fancy buffet\u2026 but the gator might eat these innocent people if she declines\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cFine...\u201d</b></span> Vicky sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\"><b>\u201cThank you! You\u2019re such a good friend,\u201d</b></span> the gator cackled, taunting the husky. She leans back, holding her arm out just far enough to drop the unconscious anthros gently on the beach. A few beachgoers rushed over to resuscitate them while the gator swam out into deeper waters. <span class=\"cgreen\"><b>\u201cThere\u2019s actually a nice little place right on the beach near here. We don\u2019t even have to leave the water!\u201d</b></span> The gator had the canine ride on her shoulder as she swam parallel with the shore, travelling around 20 mph with ease. During the quiet time, Vicky wondered what she ever did to deserve all this. It almost seemed like the gator was seeing how far she could push the canine before she broke. Still, she had to be strong. Maybe, with enough patience and willpower, she could break through to the emotionally stunted reptile\u2026 or maybe she\u2019d die trying...</span></div></div>",
