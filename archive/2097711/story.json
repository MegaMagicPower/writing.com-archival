You cleaned your entire apartment for it, had someone look after your cat, and everything was perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly people started to show up, but soon everyone was here.  You noticed your Ex-Girlfriend across the room, talking to some people.  She was wearing a black crop top, and jean shorts.  You knew why, she always tried to play the \"want what you cant have\" thing with you, but it wasn't working, not tonight.  She was chatting with some friends, but you noticed her look in your direction a few times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko had arrived early, she wanted to hang out a bit before the party.  You always loved to be around her, but were worried you would get on her nerves a bit.  You always asked her about what japan was like, and you started to learn a little Japanese as well.  She was wearing one of your Slayer t-shirts she wanted to borrow because she thought she wouldn't stand out much in it, when in reality it made her stand out more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison came a little late, but she was coming from the city so that's pretty normal.  She instantly got with her friends and has been with them the entire night, so you haven't gotten much face time with her, but seeing how the last party you saw her at ended, that might be good so you don't go off and leave for awhile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, there was a knock at the door.  Being the host, and a damned good one, you checked on it.  You opened it to a girl you didn't know, blonde and absolutely gorgeous, wearing short shorts and a blue tank top, it took you by surprise and you forgot to say something for a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you Ben?\" She eventually asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I..um..yea, that's me, can i help you?\" You finally said, feeling like an idiot for not saying anything,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here for the party, i came with..\" you heard a crash in the kitchen, completely missing who she was with. \"Can i come in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um..yea..sorry about that, come on in.  I just got to go check on that.\" You barely stammered out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went to the kitchen to find a plate on the ground and Yukiko standing over it, luckily it hadn't broke, but there was still a small mess of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm so sorry! I'll take care of it!\" She said but you reassured her and said you'll take care of it, and let her go talk with her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking care of the plate and the mess, you figure you might as well have a drink, since you were here.  You took a shot of rum, and was about to go on your way when you heard someone call your name.  You look up to see...</span></div></div>",

You turn around and find Yukiko standing behind you.  \"Are you feeling okay?\" She asked, giving you a worried expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel fine, why do you ask?\" You said to her, confused about why she would ask.  Did it look like that shot was too much for you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just....um...well,\" she starts, seeming to have trouble finding the right words. \"Well, I remember you being taller.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Yukiko and examine her.  Taller? What did she mean by that? But then you realized, you normally were looking down at her, but now you were looking her right in the eyes.  \"Oh my god...\" You mumbled, completely in shock. \"Are you wearing heels or something?\" You ask her, hoping the answer was yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, of course not.\" She said, gesturing to her feet.  You looked down at them, and saw a pair of navy blue Converse, not something that would add to her height.  Suddenly, you feel lightheaded but it quickly passes.  You look back up at her.  Wait, up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were staring directly at her mouth.  Half a head shorter than you just were.  Suddenly, Yukiko grabs your hand and says \"quick, let's go to your room, figure out what's going on.\" And she pulls you along with her, her strength obviously more than you have with your smaller frame.  Once you get to your room, she turned around and asked what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I just felt dizzy and all of a sudden I shrank.\" You didn't want to believe it.  Can this really be happening? People can't shrink, can they?  Suddenly, you get lightheaded again...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What are we going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou called down for a minute to take everything in. You look up at your giantess friend. Her tits looked so good from down where you were. Her white tee shirt clung to them. Her nipples poked out from underneath. What about your clothes! You looked down and saw how loose they got. Your pants were on the floor. You don't even remember them coming off. You looked at the pile of underwear, blue jeans, and boxers on the floor. Your shirt was large enough to cover your manhood up. You still felt a small surge of embarrassment course through you as you realized you were standing there pantless in front of your cute friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko made wire contact and noticed your nakedness. She blushed and took a step back looking down at her own feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I tell you something?\" She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\" you reply<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's kind of silly but..

You walk up to her and wrap your arms around her. Your head is just above her belly button and your hands meet around her ass. She feels so big and warm. She felt tense when you first embraced her but she relaxed now. You start moving your hand up and friends her ass. It feels so nice and round. You feel your cock get hard when you feel another spell. You get lightheaded and the room spins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get back to reality your head is right at the height of her pussy. You unbutton her shorts. Her big hand starts rubbing  your back. You unzip hey fly and let her shorts fall to the floor. You look at her soft purple panties. You run your along the elastic around her leg. Your finger explores the elastic on the top side of her thigh and traces her panties down towards hey womanhood. You feel her hips move slightly towards you. You slip your finger under the elastic right above her pussy. Your finger follows it down to her clit and past it to her pussy. You touch her slit. It is already wet with excitement. Yukiko reaches down and lets her panties fall to the floor. You kiss her thigh lightly and move your finger towards her clit. You start to rub it with your thumb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes\" she moaned. You look at your giantess' pussy. It looks so big. Yukiko takes off her shirt and starts rubbing her nipples. Her tits are so round and perfect. You take in the size of her. She is less than five feet tall and your height is at her pussy. You look at her massive legs in comparison to you. Her size turns you on so much. As you continue rubbing her clit you feel a giant hand on the back of your head. She pushes your head into her pussy. You wrap your arms around her ass again and start licking her clit. She starts to moan louder. She steps backwards and lays on the bed behind her. She spreads her legs for you and you dig in. You start sucking on her clit. She goes crazy. Then you stick a couple fingers in side her and you hear her cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Oh god! Yes!!!!\" She screams<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushes your head away from hey with her giant hand. You crawl in bed next to her and give her a peck on the cheek. She reciprocates with a big kiss on the lips.</span></div></div>",

But what should I say about it, so nobody thinks that you\u2019re missing??\u201d You think things over, and you believe that you\u2019ve come up with a decent plan, and explain \u201cAlright, I\u2019ve got an idea! Say that I got a bit of food poisoning, and that I\u2019ll be stuck in the bathroom for the night. Say that I bumped into you before I ran in there, and that\u2019s why you know about it. Tell them that they can still hang out here if they want, but if they can leave a bit earlier than we planned. And tell them I\u2019m sorry about the situation, and that I\u2019ll definitely reimburse everybody for any payments they made for the party. And go and grab the keys in my room, so we can lock the bathroom, so it\u2019s more convincing. Does that work for you, Yukiko?\u201d She nods and gives you a confident thumbs-up, and runs over to your room to lock the bathroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd once the preparations were completed, you ask \u201cSo where are you planning on hiding me? I\u2019d rather not be found like this, especially by Rachel, because things are still a bit rocky between us right now. Although, I really should fix that once we figure out this whole shrinking business.\u201d Yukiko makes a worried face, and says \u201cOkay, but don\u2019t freak out about it. I think we should put you inside my shoe for now.\u201d She makes a face like she\u2019s waiting for an explosion and you just remain silent for a few moments while you process it, and simply say \u201cWhat?\u201d So Yukiko explains, \u201cWell, I can\u2019t put you in one of my pockets or my purse, because you never know if something would knock into you or if I\u2019d accidentally pull you out. And plus, we can\u2019t hide you somewhere in the apartment, because you never know what could happen. And you\u2019ll be completely out of sight, AND you\u2019ll be right next to me.\u201d She smiles at you, and you think that Yukiko\u2019s cute demeanor might be tricking you, but you relent and say \u201cAlright. I asked you for help, so I should have some faith. But please be gentle\u2026\u201d Yukiko giggles and says \u201cSure!\u201d and starts to pop off her right green flat, revealing her bare foot. She places you gently inside the flat, right around the toe section, and you mentally prepare yourself for the experience. And as you try to rationalize what was happening, you are completely awestruck by how Yukiko looks from your angle. Her Slayer T-shirt and jeans looked so strange from your vantage point, and it was mentally jarring to imagine that a girl, who was a solid foot shorter than you, was the largest thing you\u2019ve even seen in your life. Yukiko seemed much closer to a mythical goddess, who could control all aspects of your life with a finger (or a toe), than your good friend and equal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see Yukiko smile and wave at you, as she slowly puts back on her flat, and you brace yourself for the impact of her insanely gigantic toes. You position yourself where her 3rd and 4th toes would meet, so you wouldn\u2019t be harshly flattened, and your head winds up stuck between both massive toes. They don\u2019t smell or feel particularly great, but they\u2019re not unpleasant either, given that they\u2019re feet and you don\u2019t particularly like them one way or the other. Once Yukiko felt that you were nicely secured between her toes, inside her flat, she walked back to the party to continue their plan. She explained everything to the rest of the people, and everyone seemed to take the news well enough, and they didn\u2019t seem interested enough to pry too much. Yukiko wondered if that was because everyone thought that she was already a trustworthy person, so they would be no need to question what she said. And since everyone seemed to want to stay a bit longer, Yukiko decided to have some fun and mingle, and try and not think about you, at least for the time being. She chatted with the other guests, and had a bit to drink to try and relax, and in doing so she started to pay less and less attention to you who were stuck between her slightly sweaty toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd while Yukiko was enjoying herself, you also felt yourself getting even smaller than before, and by the time you stopped, you were a lot closer to \u00bc of an inch tall. Now, your only hope is that your shrinking had finally come to an end. So now the toes were big enough to grip your head like a pebble, were now huge enough to treat your entire body like a puny pebble. And they were ruthless with how they treated you now, willing to squeeze you harshly between their massive toe flesh, and cramming you into the small sweaty spaces that were between her toes. You tried to struggle, but it was no use, as they reveled in using you like an insignificant toe toy. And as the night went on, Yukiko completely forgot about her plan to keep her now tiny friend hidden and safe until later, and just figured that a pebble got caught in her flat. Usually, she wouldn\u2019t be this forgetful, but the party activity, something that Yukiko rarely experienced, mixed with the moderate amount of alcohol made her much more forgetful tonight. At one point, while Yukiko was chatting with Madison, you tried to make your presence known again, hoping that it would spark her memory, but it had an undesired result. Yukiko did feel you, but figured that whatever was stuck in her flat was bothering her again, and simply started grinding that ball of her foot harshly and uncaringly, grumbling in an annoyed fashion. She quickly said to Madison, \u201cOh sorry about that! I think a piece of my flat\u2019s insole got messed up, and it was bothering me.\u201d Madison laughs and says, \u201cAww I hate when that happens! Although it can be a nice stress reliever, if you mess with it occasionally.\u201d Both girls laughed at their shared experiences, while Yukiko took Madison\u2019s advice and started to prod at you more forcefully and aggressively, reminding you that as close of a friend as you were to Yukiko, her toes viewed you more a pleasure toy to be abusively dominated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs things simmered down, and people started to meander out of the apartment, Yukiko followed suit, and made her way back to her own apartment for the night. By this time, it was around midnight, so she was a bit tired, and planned on heading to bed once she got home. And as she walked, you were tossed all around her massive and now fairly sweaty toes, getting pushed into small crevices and folds, getting flattened under the toes themselves, and getting smothered between the currently monolithic pillars of flesh. But to your surprise, you didn\u2019t feel like anything was breaking, although you did experience varying degrees of discomfort. You figure that you must have gotten a lot more durable now, and you reason that if it was possible to become as small as a tiny pebble, then it was also possible to become super-humanly durable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 10 minutes of walking, which was incredibly eventful for you in your current trap among Yukiko\u2019s toes, she finally made it to her apartment. And she was very ready for a good night\u2019s sleep. She was still a bit relaxed from the alcohol, which increased her exhaustion, but she had a short moment of wonder. She could have sworn that she forgot about something, and she mumbled to herself \u201cHmm\u2026 what was it? I\u2019m sure it was important, maybe\u2026\u201d And you yell, knowing that she\u2019d never hear you, \u201cC\u2019mon Yukiko! It\u2019s me! Remember me! You couldn\u2019t have drunk that much tonight to be this forgetful!\u201d So before Yukiko prepared to go to bed, did she remember the friend that she originally stowed away in her flat? Or did she continue with her bedtime routine, completely oblivious to the suffering of her good friend who was being vigorously used by her long and slender toes?</span></div></div>",

Looking around the dark cave of your friends shoe it seemed to big.  Or you were just so small.  Your most recent shrinkage left you feeling even more useless, and pitiful.  What were you going to do now?  You were lost to the world, if Yukiko even remembered you it would be a miracle, let alone if she could see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the thought entered your head, the shoe was lifted up.  You felt the ground beneath you slip away as gravity took over and the shoe was tilted by its giant host.  Falling out of the shoe the light blinded you for a second while you fell through the air, only to be stopped on a padded surface.   Your vision coming back to you slowly, you saw the light blocked out by a giant shadow, a slowly it faded into view.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant face of Yukiko was above you, making up your entire sky.  Her nearly flawless features expanded by so much.  But she was looking at you with a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got smaller\" She whispered, sadness in her voice.  \"How could you be smaller?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were speechless, unable to think of anything to respond to, but she wouldn't hear you anyway.  You were so small and useless now, your friend was like a goddess to you, she was your caretaker, your world, everything.

How often does this kind of thing happen? Even if she was drunk, you'd think she would somehow remember.   As your cursing her for leaving you trapped with her bare foot, you feel her stop suddenly.  Far, far above you, she mumbles something about trying to sober up.  You have no idea what she could mean by that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden, but muffled, sound of running water fills your ears.  She must have meant getting some water to drink.  The pressure of her giant toes around your tiny head starts to get lighter.  Your blinded by light as she removes her foot from the shoe she had trapped you in and you feel gravity push you against the sole of her shoe as it's lifted up somewhere only your goddess of a friend could know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko places the shoe down and you are able to stand up once more. You make your way to the opening and peer out, seeing the massive form of Yukiko above you, bending over slightly, examining something.  The ceiling far above her gave away where you were.  You'd been in her place before, and you'd recognize her bathroom pretty easily.  She moved back to a standing position and you watched as her arms moved to her sides, and lofted her slayer T-shirt up, covering her face and revealing a black lace bra.  You never knew she'd be into something like that, but you felt you'd learn a lot about her sooner than later because of your current situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko turned away from you, the last thing you see is her throwing her shirt to the corner.  Now's your chance, you climb up the side of the shoe, something that proves harder than you expected.   By the time you get to the top, Yukiko has stripped down to just her bra and panties.

But before you pull your body out of the flat, you see her carelessly toss her bra, which she had already removed, right into where her shoes were. The bra knocks right into the flat that you were climbing out of, and it sends you down to floor along with the thrown bra and discarded flat. You feel disoriented again, but you\u2019re still not all that hurt or injured, and as you start to get back up, you hear Yukiko say \u201cOh no! Ah whatever! I\u2019ll put everything away later.\u201d And then you hear a much louder torrent of water, and you can swear that the room is getting warmer and muggier. You look around, and you can\u2019t seem to see Yukiko anymore, but when you turn your attention to the closed shower space, it all begins to make sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko was taking a shower, which explained the sounds of water, the increase in temperature, and her rush to remove her clothing. And you figure that it would be much too dangerous to stick around in here while she showered, so you make your way to the door to crawl under. You aren\u2019t sure how much heat you can handle right now, and if it got too hot and humid, you may just pass out. And then who know what could happen to you? So you make your way to the bathroom door, as the beautiful and captivating sounds of Yukiko humming to herself fill the room and your ears, but you try to not get too distracted by it. You briefly think about how Yukiko really has a nice singing voice, and you are happy that you were able to hear it today, as she probably would feel too embarrassed to sing if she knew that someone else could hear her. But you are able to reach the door without too much trouble, and in a short amount of time, so you quickly crawl under it so you can formulate a plan. You pass through the living room quickly, intent on reaching Yukiko\u2019s bedroom before she\u2019s finished showering. But as you move, you have an idea, and decide to check your phone, because all of this could be solved by a simple text. You notice that you don\u2019t have a signal at all, as if you were under a deep tunnel, and you don\u2019t really understand why that\u2019s happening, but you surmise that it\u2019s because of your current diminished size. You also see that your phone has a very small amount of battery left, so you quickly turn it off to conserve what little energy it had left. But you make a mental note of the time, as it was about 12:30, so you figure that Yukiko won\u2019t stay up for much longer after she gets out of the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally reach Yukiko\u2019s bedroom, you notice how neat and orderly the room was, where the only thing that really seemed out of place was a pair of fluffy slippers. They were right around the door, and they had a very strong scent that you could distinctly smell, but for some strange reason, you seemed to like the smell. You walked a bit closer to them, and saw that they looked really fluffy and that they\u2019d probably be very soft and comfy as well. And it seems like your eyes adjusted well to the dark, because you can make out all of the imprints that were made by Yukiko\u2019s massive foot and toes, and those imprints look really cozy. You were very tired, and you felt very tempted to just climb into Yukiko\u2019s discarded slipper and rest for the night, regardless of the danger that might cause you. And you\u2019d probably stay nice and warm if you went all the way down to the toe section, where the smell would be at its most extreme and the built-up heat would remain at its strongest. But before you do anything too rash, you look at her bed and see her night stand, and you think that it might be a good spot to get Yukiko\u2019s attention from. And even though you were feeling tired, you think that you had enough in you to climb up one measly night stand at least, before you call it quits. But as you think, it feels like Yukiko\u2019s slipper is actively tempting you with its unique aromas and textures, and you really just want to cuddle up inside there and rest forever. But you shake your head, because you need to make a decision, since Yukiko won\u2019t be in the shower all night. But you do figure that you have some time, since she won\u2019t go as fast while she\u2019s moderately intoxicated and tired, but you should still make your decision. What do you do?</span></div></div>",

Yukiko noticed your struggle and giggled to herself before walking over to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched her as she effortlessly moved her clothes aside and uncovered the doll house, then pulled tout if the closet.  It was a big one, made more for dolls ab out 6\" tall.  It had all the rooms a normal house would need, and was more detailed than any.dollhouse you'd seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't thought of this thing in a long time.\" Yukiko said, bending down to look at it as well.  \" It seems to almost be the right size for you.\" She tired to joke, and you appreciated it, but she noticed your sad look and stood back up, walking over to her bed to sit down on the floor and lean against.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought her knees up to her chin and rested her arms on them, sadly looking at you.  Turning your attention away from the doll house you made your way over to her and sat down next to her, only reaching about her breast height now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we going to do?\" She said. \"What happens if you keep getting smaller? Will it ever stop? What if you get so small I lose you forever?\" Tears starting to fill her eyes, and you stood back up and gave her side a hug, or as much of a hug as you could.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Yuki,\" you tried to reassure her,  \"I trust you more than anyone else for this.  Besides, I'm kind of....enjoying this.\" With that last comment, you regretted it.  She didn't know about your fetish, and you didn't know how she would take it.  You backed away from her a bit, and shenlooked over at you, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoying this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to look away from her, embarrassed at your confession.  \"Yea, I kind of have a thing for....giant women.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile crept across her lips, and then a laugh.  She while the tears away from her eyes and looked at you again. \"Really? This whole situation is happening and that's what you think about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, I guess so.  I mean, I can't help it, you know?  Besides, if I shrink away to nothing, and I'm on you somewhere, you won't lose me because I'll always be a part of you.\" You hoped she would appreciate the joke,  of course the thought turned you on.  You weren't exactly thinking about a modest area to be on in that situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before you could continue, you once again felt that familiar sinking feeling.</span></div></div>",

After a few minutes the feeling faded, and you were too scared to look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God,\" you heard Yukiko above you, louder than before.  You finally faced your fear and looked around.  Everything towered over you, her bed like a small apartment building, her desk and dresser on the other side of the room like a warehouse, and finally, Yukiko herself, sitting next to you, your once short friend, now almost a goddess to you.  Her hand covered her mouth, while you were staring at her from the neck hole in your shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't hit you that you were naked, not at first.  Awkwardly you covered yourself with your hand and stared up at her.  \"Well, you've seen more of me than I intended.\" You said, trying to break the silence.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, I can barely hear you from down there.\" She said back to you.  She adjusted herself to get more on your level, but found it difficult.  Instead, her large hand reached out for you, her tree like fingers wrapping around your waist, not too tight, but enough to get a grip.  This small thing for her, was huge for you, and you couldn't help but be turned on by it, and you hoped she couldn't feel that against her palm.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted you onto her bed.  It stretched out like a lake, and you barely even made a dent in the blanket.  She sat on her knees, just taking you all in, and you stared back at her.  \"I was just going to say we should get to sleep, but now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's okay,\" you replied.  \"I think i could use it.  We can deal with...this in the morning.\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, well, where would you like to sleep?\" She asked.</span></div></div>",

You climbed into her hand, and immediately fell over as she stood to her ful hieght.  She held you just under her breasts, blocking her face from you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worry was starting to set in, what would happen in the morning? Would you be smaller? Would Yukiko even remember you?  What if you shrank so much overnight she couldn't find you? The thought of being as small as a speck of dirt to her was scary, but then you thought about seeing her that big, and a feeling of arousal came.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand lowered to the dresser the dollhouse was on, and Yukiko waited for you to make your way off, which you did.  You walked up to the front door, and stood in amazement.  Even compared to this dollhouse you stood at the size of a child.  You had to reach up to the door handle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing hold of it, you turned back to Yukiko who was crouched down and watching you with a look of sadness.  \"Thank you!\" You yelled at her, but her only response was a small smile, that didn't hide her worry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked in the door, and looked outside the window as Yukiko stood back up and prepared for bed.  You watched her move aout her room on, elegantly and smoothly.  Seeing something that massive move that way was still amazing to you, and even more so when she began to undress.  She slipped her skinny jeans off and then began to lift her shirt over her head, leaving her in just her underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to the lightswitch, as she threw the shirt away from her, indirectly towards you.  It landed on the dollhouse, covering you in darkness.  You heard her settle into her bed, miles away from you, before you made your way to your own.  Laying down, you stared at the dark ceiling, wondering just what the world would be like in the morning, until you finally drifted off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

She made her way to the dresser, and you couldn't help but take it all in, the smooth, elegant movements, how she effortlessly opened a drawer you'd never be able to budge.

Or maybe she just saw you as a pet now, and didn't care what you saw.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe removed her bra, her back to you so you didn't exactly see anything, before putting on an oversized shirt and removing her pants, opting to sleep in nothing else.

You don't know this woman, she could do anything to you, and you were terrified to figure out what she would do.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was worried there for awhile,\" she continued, trying to add a hint of sweetness to her voice to ease your worries. \"After Yukiko brought you out and gave you to me, I didn't know if you would ever wake up.  I'm glad you did now, I was just getting ready for bed.\" She stsrted to reach down for you, which scared you even more.  \"Don't worry,\" she said, noticing your hesitation, \"I won't hurt you, I just want to help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand came down towards you, you were just shorter than it was wide.  This was all so new to you, you didn't even know what to do.  Becca grabbed you around your waist, not holding on too tightly so she wouldn't hurt you.  She brought you up, higher and higher, and you realized she had a that removed her clothes, standing in just her bra and panties.  You couldn't hell but enjoy the view as you were brought up, past her waist, her well toned stomach, and her, breasts.  The fact that everything was now enormous compared to you definitely made it all the more enjoyable.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally came to a stop just in front of her face, and she was still smiling.  You could now tell that it was a good smile, at least for you.  It gave you a sense of relief, you could see that she would take care of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate to do this so early, but I'm actually pretty tired so we can talk about what to do in the morning.  You had a good party, in glad I got to go home with a party favor.\". She giggled at that, while you didn't find it all that funny, maybe you would have in a different position.  \"Where would you like to sleep? You can sleep in my drawer with some of my clothes, or with me which might be dangerous, or I can go get my 16 year old sisters doll house, not like she needs it anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some careful thought, you decide on...</span></div></div>",

It won\u2019t be any less dangerous.\u201d You figure that Becca\u2019s playing devil\u2019s advocate here, which isn\u2019t a bad idea honestly, because that\u2019ll help you both come up with the best plan. But then Becca\u2019s eyes light up, and you figure that she\u2019s got a plan, and she reaches for a nearby drawer and rummages through it before presenting a pair of long green socks. You don\u2019t really understand what Becca is thinking, so you wait for her, and she says \u201cYou can sleep in one of these socks tonight! I doubt that my covers will have much of an effect on you at your current size, and it\u2019ll be a cold night tonight. With this, you\u2019ll be nice and warm.\u201d You just remain silent, with a face of complete disbelief, and Becca continues to attempt to convince you, adding \u201cOh c\u2019mon Ben! You\u2019ll be so much safer. Plus, you\u2019ll have some company tonight! Do you have any better ideas?\u201d You might have had some, but you were too tired to think all that much more, so you relent. And besides, it might be a better idea to stay on Becca\u2019s good side while she was a titaness to you right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Becca picks you back up, and hovers you over one of the green socks that will act as your bed for the night, and angles it like a slide. She drops you on one of the edges, and you tumble down the sock without too much trouble, and she says \u201cHave a good night! And think positive, Ben. I\u2019m sure you won\u2019t be tiny for too long!\u201d And after that, she continues to angle the sock so you wind up in the toe area, and once you stop rolling, you look up and hear her massive foot already entering the sock. You are also overwhelmed by the smell, which was an odd combination of foot sweat and strawberries, which must have been from a detergent that she used. Once her foot gets past the long section of the sock, you can see her incredibly huge toes emerge and barrel towards you. You brace yourself for the impact, and you are knocked into the wall of the sock by her 2nd toe, and it pins you completely for a few tense moments. You somehow are able to free yourself, and you take that chance to wedge yourself in-between her smaller toes, specifically her 3rd and 4th toes. The smell is just as strong as before, and the toes already started to sweat a bit. But she was right about the company part, because each toe looked like those full-body pillows you\u2019d see online, except it was a very small extension of a human being. You decide to wait until Becca stops moving, and you remain still as she puts her legs under the covers and gets ready to sleep. You wait a few more minutes before getting comfortable, until you have a good feeling that Becca fell asleep, and then you squeeze a bit closer to those two toes and cuddle against the smaller 4th toe. You didn\u2019t exactly like feet or anything, but you figure that you should make the best of the situation, and you weren\u2019t really disliking any of this either, so you were keeping an open mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you hugged Becca\u2019s 4th toe, in an attempt to get more comfortable and be ready to sleep, it stirred an unconscious reaction out of her. She started to wiggle her toes, thinking that something was giving her an itch between her toes, and you are harshly smothered by her massive and oppressive toe flesh. But she gives up before long, so you just readjust yourself before going to sleep too. You were glad that her feet seemed to let up on their sweating as she slept, so you wouldn\u2019t be bothered by that at all. Both of you slept soundly through the night, although it could be easily argued that she had the better night sleep. Because it seemed that Becca\u2019s unconscious mind still perceived you as an itch and foreign invader, and she would use her toes to torment you periodically. She would squeeze her toes, enveloping you in her soft and pudgy flesh. She would rub her feet together, causing your whole world to shake and quake, giving you a severe sense of motion sickness. And she would also wiggle her toes in her sleep, as her toes seemed to take a liking to your small and bug sized body, and they would use you for their pleasure regardless of the time of night. But, you still found time to sleep during all of the \u2018loving\u2019 attention Becca\u2019s toes gave you, and eventually morning came. And you woke up first, but you realized that you were now completely stuck in-between Becca\u2019s toes, and you were so tightly crammed into her toe flesh that you couldn\u2019t even move enough to remind her of your presence. So you could only hope that Becca didn\u2019t forget about you over her night\u2019s sleep. About an hour later, where your face was deeply pressed into her slightly sweaty and smelly toe flesh, Becca finally woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca lazily moved her legs, and planted both feet onto the floor, causing her toe flesh to expand over you and force you even deeper into them. Then she groggily walked over to the bathroom to freshen up before the day, making sure to brush her teeth, wash her face, and brush her hair. And then she started to get dressed, choosing a nice pair of black jeans and a red and blue checkered plaid shirt, along with a solid gray shirt underneath. She looked down at her socks, and really didn\u2019t feel like changing them, and simply put on her favorite pair of ugg boots for today. In fact, this pair of uggs was an old one of Becca\u2019s, which she used to wear back in her later years of high school. This pair was a size 9, and by this point in college, Becca\u2019s feet grew to a decent size 10. Her feet weren\u2019t big by any stretch, but these boots were definitely tight for her feet currently, but Becca just couldn\u2019t stop wearing this particular pair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were all the way on, the heat level increased significantly for you, and her toe started to exude a whole lot more sweat. And because of the size, her foot was squished into the soft and fluffy cotton material, which also caused her toes to press even closer together, treating you to an even more personal experience within her green sock.  You have a very bad feeling that Becca completely forgot about you, and you figure that there was nothing in her apartment to remind her about you. You think that it might have been a mistake to completely trust a person you just met, but you remain optimistic that she will remember you eventually. And with Becca standing, the pressure that both toes that you spent the night with increased severely, but you were surprised that you weren\u2019t injured, let along still breathing. You reason that you must have become more durable now, but you don\u2019t really want to test just how far it would take you, so you merely hope that Becca has a sudden realization about the guy she planned to help out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Becca was fully dressed and ready, she thought about her plan for the day. She thought out loud, saying \u201cI\u2019ve got a few classes today. This is my busy day after all. And I\u2019ll need to stop by the book store to grab a textbook too. I might as well get to it!\u201d And then she started walking towards her door, to start her day. But as she walked across the living room, she had a weird feeling suddenly; that kind of sinking feeling of dread, as if she forgot something really important. She mumbles, \u201cDid I forget something? I don\u2019t think so, but maybe\u2026\u201d As she mumbled and thought to herself, you were shouting in your personal toe trap \u201cThe thing you forgot is in-between your toes! His name is Ben! You went to his party last night, for crying out loud!!\u201d Of course, Becca wouldn\u2019t hear that, but did she remember her small new friend before she started her day? Or will Ben be stuck under and between her toes for a while longer?</span></div></div>",

It has a mirror that you barely see yourself in, your head just happens to be above the border, but you know deep down that wont last long.  You look over the edge and see a drawer partially opened.  Looking closer you see that its her underwear drawer.  Is that were she was going to let you sleep?  Seems a little intimate for some you just met, and in your current situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca finally comes back, with a large pink dollhouse in her hands.  You watch as she sets it on the ground next to her bed, then turns back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you think?\" She says, pointing at the dollhouse.  \"It might still be a little big for you, you might only be child height compared to it.\" She says, coming closer to you, bending down so you are looking directly at her billboard sized face, but still giving you a view of her, now, mountainous breasts.  Even at this size, she is still incredibly gorgeous.  She lets out a giggle.  \"Awh, looks like someone is enjoying themselves.\"  You look down and notice you are at full mast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbarrassed, you cover yourself up, causing her to giggle again.  \"Don't worry, little one, maybe later we can take care of that.\" She said with a smile.  While you did like the sound of that, you didnt know exactly what she could do to \"take care of it\" as she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe places her hand next to you again, and you climb back on.  She brings you over to the dollhouse, placing you down just in front of the door, which dwarfed you in size.  You were just barely up to the door knob.  Behind you, Becca lays down on the ground,causing the ground to shake beneath you.  You turn around and see an amazing view of her cleavage, one you won't forget for a lifetime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on in, explore your new home!\" She said excitedly.  You reach for the door handle, and push it open.  Walking in, she was right.  You were about child height, everything even in this doll house was taller than you.  Hoping you weren't going to get any smaller, you climb up the stairs to find the bed room, Becca watching you through the window as you climb the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe directs you to the bed room.  Even the bed was taller than you.  You barely managed to climb up, thankfully it had cloth sheets.  You look out the window, seeing Becca's giant eye outside.  It was eerie, but also comforting.  You got lucky that she was willing to help you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, tiny,\" She boomed from outside, \"Goodnight, and sleep tight.  I'll see you in the morning!\" You watched as Becca stood up, her feet being the last thing you see of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you drift off to sleep, hoping that when you wake up, maybe this would be over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up, a loud booming coming from outside...</span></div></div>",

The events of last night comes flooding back into your memory to the rhythm of the footsteps. You clam yourself. It was just Becca, coming back to check on you. You briefly wonder how long you'd slept in. It seemed well into the day based on the sunlight streaming into your new miniature home. Sure, it was a bit embarrassing to be living in a damn dollhouse, but it beat being somewhere more exposed. Now, to ask Becca to call someone about growing you back to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are thrown from your bed as the house lurches, lifting off of the carpet in a swift, jerking motion. What was going on? If this was some kind of joke, you weren't laughing. The abrupt movement had sent you flying into the bedroom wall, rolling to a stop at the side of the doll bed. <br>\r\n\"Becca, what the fuck! Stop shaking the house! Put me back down! This isn't funny, you could...\" your voice trails off as you notice something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeering out the window of the doll house, you can see that you're not with Becca at all... it was another girl, a bit younger looking. This must've been the sister Becca was talking about. She'd come back for her dollhouse. What kind of teenager still uses a dollhouse? You try to get your bearing, leaning against the bed as the shaking of the house begins to subside. You must be in Sara's room now, you figure. The house comes to rest in your new environment, and you cautiously crawl to the window again, looking out. Suddenly, you stop yourself. For the time being, she doesn't know you're here. Maybe that was for the best.</span></div></div>",

You were honestly starving at this point. How bad could Sara really be, if she was related to Becca? Her sister had only shown you kindness thus far, so would it really be so bad to take this leap of faith in trust a family member? Your stomached responded with another growl. Contact it was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stroll out the front door with skipping a beat, finding Sara just where you'd expected. The titanic girl loomed above you, staring down at her phone, her fingers dancing across the screen as she composed what you can only assume was one book of a text. You scanned the girl a bit as you approached her. Sara seemed pretty alternative, almost post-goth in her attire. She wore all black, all the way down to her bare feet, which were coated in chipped black nail polish. As much as you didn't deem it the safest place, those colossal feet were your only ticket to getting Sara's attention from the carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggling to trudge your way through the denser carpet fibers of Sara's bedroom, you hoped this trek was worth it. With your luck, you knew something had to go wrong, but surely she'd feel a four inch man if her jumped up and down on her bare feet, right? There had to be a stroke of luck in her not having shoes on. Skin was easier to get noticed on than a shoe. You finally arrive at the massive altar of the goth girl's feet, and she was still typing away. Perfect. There'd be no variables then. You hoist yourself in the space between Sara's big toe and its neighbor, scrambling up with an agility you didn't know you possessed.</span></div></div>",

You could still see Sara looming in the distance, standing now, but back on her phone already. The difference now was that she was actually looking in your direction. A creeping realization began to fall over you: she was looking to confirm the kill. Evidently, Sara was not one to tolerate any pests in her room, and she was trying to make sure you were done for. The goth girl was making her way toward you, and your options were limited. Looking behind you, you see the slightly open door that you could only assume led back into the hallway.

You quickly run the options through your mind.  The boots could be good, but what if she puts them on?  The clothes might not be bad, but what if they are dirty and she does laundry?  The only viable option looks to be the dollhouse, where this nightmare started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make a run for it, trying to hide behind objects as you do, in the hopes she wont see you, taking your time to take cover.  You move to her desk, and hide behind the leg, peaking out to see where she was.  You saw her, still coming towards you, still on her phone typing away.  Was she even coming to find you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, out of seemingly nowhere, you hear a loud ringing.  You watch as Sara moves her phone up to her ear.  \"Yea?  I know, I was about to get ready.....Yea, yea okay, just give me a minute.  There was this huge bug on my foot, I'm trying to find it....Yea, Becca, Okay, I'll be down in a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the sounds of it, Becca wasn't even looking for you.  Maybe she forgot about you.  Whatever it was, it sounded like they were both leaving.  This was the best chance you had to get back to Becca,which still seemed like the best idea.  You notice Sara isn't leaving just yet, she still seems to be looking for you, scanning the floor as she walked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on out, bug, I don't have time for this.  I have to leave.\"  She said, sounding pretty annoyed.  You see an opening and run for the dollhouse.  You get on the porch, and run up to the door, which was almost twice your height.  You reach for the door handle, taking a quick glance behind you as you notice the booming steps of the giantess seemed to have stopped.  You see she is looking in her boot, and you are relieved you didn't try for them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly get inside and run to the living room, planning to take shelter behind the couch.  As soon as you get there, the booming begins again.  You watch out the window as you see her long legs coming towards the dollhouse.   She stopped a few feet away, and you could do nothing but watch and her knees bent and her hands placed themselves on the floor in front of you.  Quickly, the rest of her gigantic, but somehow majestic form, filled the window, and all you could see was her.  Her face was the next thing to show up, and you quickly hid behind the couch before she could see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling like the predator had found its prey, you heard her breathing, which only proved to terrify you more.  You could feel your heart beating out of control, and along with your predators breathing, created an annoyingly accurate soundtrack of your current situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come out, come out, where ever you are.\" She sang, taunting you, scaring you.  You stayed where you were, knowing full well you wouldn't like what would happen should she find you.   \"Alright, fine, play that way.  I'll find you when i get back. But I'm going to be angrier then, and I'm going to have a lot more fun with you.\"  You heard her stand up, and her booming steps started to get farther away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a peak outside, just to make sure she was gone, and to your pleasant surprise, she was.  Once you decided it was safe, you walked back to the dollhouse door, scared to open it.  What should your next plan be?</span></div></div>",

This whole ordeal with Becca and her sister has been extremely taxing on you, both mentally and physically. The unfortunate truth was that your judgment had become clouded by fatigue and fear. You needed time to resettle and rest. Only then could you strike out again to find help. With Sara gone, you could rest without the creeping anxiety that she might return to finish the job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrudging back to your bedroom, you climb up to the bed, noting that you hadn't gotten any smaller since the last time you were here, at least. With any luck, the miniaturization had tapered off. You wonder if it would wear off completely eventually, restoring you to normal size on your own. If so, being in this dollhouse might prove to be a little painful. You doubt you'd be getting off so easily, though. No, you'd need the assistance of a normal-sized person to regrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sleep was much needed. You couldn't have been out more than a few hours, though, before the now-familiar thud of footsteps rouses you from your slumber. Rushing to the window, you find just what you had expected: Sara was back. An enormous foot stomps down in front of the window, revealing the fishnet-clad leg of your giant tormentor. Did she know you were in here? Thoughts whiz around in your brain and you ponder what to do.</span></div></div>",

A large, black, shadow fell over the dollhouse as it was covered by a cloth.  Looking back at you through the window was a large skull, grinning at you with a sinister expression.  She must have thrown her shirt onto the dollhouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distance, you heard the creak of her bed as she climbed into it.  For you, everything was dark.  You had no idea what was going on exactly out there.  For all you knew she was lying in bed asleep, or getting ready to.  You knew you had to do something, find some way back to Becca.  But how?

The massive door extends almost beyond your line of sight, almost mythical in scale. Briefly, you entertain the idea that this is what the gate to heaven would be like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut your thoughts of heaven were not to last. Shattering your reverie is the sound of the monolithic goth girl rising from her bed, her heels slamming against the floor as she slides out of bed. The thunderous footfalls are like earthquake tremors, sending you sprawling face-first into the carpet fibers. <br>\r\n\"You thought I wouldn't see you slip out, huh, little bug? Well, I can't sleep at night knowing I have gross, uninvited guests crawling around,\" Sara booms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately pick yourself up, not skipping a beat, but you don't dare to look back. The image of Sara bearing down upon you is already forming in your mind as you run, the horror of it quickening your heart rate. A surge of adrenaline accompanies your fear, however, and you begin to cover more ground than expected. In fact, you are almost to the giant door. The hallway, and your freedom, extends beyond. Meanwhile, Sara's giant footsteps continue to thud behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha now, bug! Did you really think you could outrun me?\" Sara mocks, giggling in a way that made your heart sink. She was upon you. Another tremor sends you tumbling to the floor yet again, the underside of the door still at least a hundred yard (for you) off in the distance. You break your rule and jerk your head around, only to find the colossal bare feet of the giant girl filling your view. Sara flicks on the light. She knew right where you were!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n A shadow falls over you in the dim light as her right foot rises into the air, a pale white sole eclipsing the artifical light of the room that now spilled over you. You try to get up, but you've become tangled in the damned carpet fibers, and in your panicked state you can't figure out how to free yourself.<br>\r\n\"Well, well, well.

No, there was something more going on... you're beginning to wonder if she was somehow a part of this. Nothing seemed to add up about this whole situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other reason was that the bathroom is the closest door to you, and by the sound of the lumbering footfalls of the giga goth behind you, you really had to take any port in a storm. This particular port just happened to be the nearest. With any luck there would be a good selection of hiding places. You feel a sudden surge of adrenaline course through your veins, spurring you onward in your desperate dash for the bathroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was open just a crack. More luck. What the hell was going on? Things weren't supposed to line up for you. You hear Sara's door swing open, letting light stream into the darkened hallway. Fuck. She would be on your heels in a matter of seconds. Fortunately for you, the bathroom door was just ahead. You hit a maximum speed as you make your beeline for the opening into the bathroom, twisting to slip through at a speed you didn't know you could even reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cold tile now stretched before you, and you didn't have much time to scan your surroundings for adequate cover, but you had to hurry.<br>\r\n\"Do you really think I don't know you're in there, bug?\" Sara's voice descends from on high. \"Ready or not, here I come!\"<br>\r\nSweat forms on your forehead as your eyes dart around the huge bathroom.

The front door opens as an enormous finger the size of a redwood tree pokes through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ben?\" you hear the titaness boom from outside, obviously worried. \"If you shrank more, please, come to the front door.  It's okay, I promise I'll help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to run to the door, and once you reach it, you stop and take in the view.  Becca was lying down on the floor, the most massive thing you could imagine.  You took in every part of her you could, her hands lying in front of her, her face suspended in the air above the front door, frantically looking for a clue of where you are, and, finally, her breasts, pushed against the ground, spilling out of her bra, and the valley of cleavage that lay before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost hypnotized, you start to walk toward the valley, seemingly a mile away.  How could you help yourself? Its right there?  But you snap out of it, realizing that you should get her attention.  There would always be time to explore her breasts later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to yell at her, waving your arms, hoping she will just look down.  You were right in front of her, all she would have to do is look down and see you.   But does she?    </span></div></div>",

You turn back to the tip of her breast, and see the rest of her body outstretched beyond, a sexy Continent that was all for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to rub the nipple, already just above your head, and watch as it extends further, reaching to the sky, leaving you in its shadow.  The slow breathing of its gigantic host starts to get heavier, her chest heaving up and down was rhythmic and began to excite you.  You start to grab at it, getting small handfuls with every movement, and you could feel Becca's breathing slowly speeding up.  A soft moan escaped her lips far behind you, almost inaudible to the normal human ear, but to you it was ringing in your ears, giving you the motivation to continue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou move in closer to the nipple, and start to kiss it lightly, not exactly sure if Becca was even aware of it, but at this point you were enjoying yourself now.  A minute later you start to get rougher, a light nibble leads to a hard nibble, and so on and so on.  Meanwhile, the titanesses every breath becoming heavier and heavier. You heard A louder moan this time, and saw her hand start to move last you, reaching for her womanhood and slowly rubbing.  You kept going, grabbing and biting as hard as you could, every bite led to a moan, louder and louder they grew with every one.  Soon, her breathing became more erratic,  threatening to throw you off the giant breast you stood upon.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn earth shattering scream, at least to you, comes from behind.  A sudden feel breath, deeper than any kthers, knocks you off balance, sending you tumbling down the inside slope of the breast.  You come to a stop and find yourself lying between her now mountainous breasts, her chest heaving up and down making it hard to stand.  You watch as her hand reaches up to where you once were, her moans still as loud as they were before, and making you glad you slipped down when you did.  You turn to see her lower hand s working away, faster and faster.  She was definitely enjoying herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard one last, sound barrier breaking exclamation escape from her before her breathing started to relax.  A few seconds passed by without a word as She was still catching her breath.  You were only 1/2 and inch tall, what could you have done at 4?  You then realized that she might not even know you fell, she might think you were still on her breast!  You try to climb back up but the slope is too steep and you are unable to get a good foothold and fall back down between her hills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she breaks the silence.  \"Wow, that was amazing.

You were filled with a sense of hope, before she turned around and grabbed something out of her purse.  Holding it up, you saw a small necklace, with a small, glass bulb on the end, and a cork on top. \"For now though, you'll just have to wait in here.\"  She smiled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were frozen in place.  You were trapped.  Impossibly tiny, in the hands of your ex.  You were hers now.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe roughly put you in the bulb, and slid the cork into the top.

She brought it to her lips and gave it a kiss, sucking in between her lips slightly, giving you a view of the inside of her maw.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, little one, let go home.\"  She said in a sing song voice.  Hanging your new container around her neck, it slid against her skin and rested just above her breasts.

You felt incredibly dwarfed in comparison to the well-manicured fingers that lie before you, unbelievably large at this close range. Each finger looked like a thick tree trunk in comparison to you. Still, you must remain resolute if you're going to survive. You gulp away your nervousness and squat down in front of her pointer finger, hoping you wouldn't come to regret what you were about to do. Clamping down with all of your might, you sink your tiny teeth into Yukiko's finger, silently bracing for her response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What were you going to do now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you asked, you felt Yukiko move her hand, it was slight, but to you it was like the entire world moved.  The movement of her finger, which all she did was slide it a little, knocked you over and underneath it.  Now, you were trapped with her gigantic finger on top of you. But as soon as you get trapped, she starts to move it once more.  You wrap yourself around it, or as much as you could, as you are lifted into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air rushing around you threatened to make you fall, and you did.  Yukiko had raised her hand up to her hair, and you fell once again from the same height you had once before.  The same monuments passed by again.  Her lovely smile, her chin, her now gigantic breasts.  Wait, were they bigger?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could could really think about it, her stomach passed by and you hit a surface.  It wasn't hard, but it wasn't exactly soft either.  A rush of blue passed by as you rolled down a slope, and once again you found yourself falling, only this time a very drastically shorter fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up, to try and get your bearings.  After your head stopped spinning, you realized exactly where you were.  The towered form of Yukiko rose high above you.  Lowering your vision, you scanned her body until your eyes found her jeans, and then her crotch.  The slope you had rolled down was her inner thigh.  You were directly between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand came back down, coming to a rest on her leg just above you.  Now, you have to make your next decision.</span></div></div>",

Mustering up what energy you had left to resume climbing, you find the fabric of her jeans a much easier terrain than the skin from before. It was much rougher and had little microscopic handholds in its fibers that were able to assist you in scaling her, even at this incline. You could only hope that your giant friend didn't decide to get up or anything, because then you'd be truly and royally fucked. Stuffing those cynical thoughts out of your head, you soldier on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at her hand in just a couple of minutes, you'd say you were making incredibly good time so far. While the entirety of Yukiko does seem to stretch on forever, you've learned to tune out of the booming tones of conversation between Yukiko and Madison, as well as the more muted din of the party around them. You glance over at Yukiko's other hand, finding that her drink was still pretty full. Good, you'd prefer her to be sober for this, and it also meant she probably wouldn't be getting up anytime soon for a refill. Madison, on the other hand, had definitely been busy, as her cup was already almost empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, her hand was already being left in the dust as your traveled up Yukiko's forearm. If she hadn't felt your bite, there was no way simple traversing her skin was going to alert her. Even still, you try to pick up the pace. Any small variable could send this plan down the tubes, and you with it. You freeze, fearing you may have jinxed yourself as Yukiko begins to stir. To your relief, all she'd done was re-position her drink hand to across her lap. It was now under you. Good thing you'd moved when you did or that would've been your end for sure.

You knew what you had to do, even if you were afraid to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally find yourself at her hair once again.

You grab onto it, reminded that it was the size of a rope to you.  Slowly, but surely, you climb your way up.  Looking over, you see Madison still sitting there, but no longer talking with Yukiko.  Instead she was focused on someone else, but you couldn't see who.  Looking up at Yukiko's face, even with what little you could see from this view, you noticed she looked a bit sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake the though from you head, focusing on the task at hand.  You made your way up, knowing that she would probably get up to leave soon.  You knew her, if she was alone at a party, she wouldn't be there long.  You eventually pass by her chin, and then her mouth.  You couldn't believe the size of it.  You could fall in and no one would even know.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep climbing, only now at a faster pace since you were on a countdown.  You climb past her nose, then her eyes.  You wave, hoping she would see you, but there was no reaction.  You made your way around the side of her face, to her ear.  It was enormous, her ear hole was the size of a large cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukiko!\" You yelled, \"Yukiko!  Please, help me!\"</span></div></div>",

You were glad she was enjoying this at least a little bit, made things looks a little bit better.  She brought her hand away from her ear, and brought you in front of her gigantic, bigger than i billboard, face.  She had a smile on her face, probably one of the most caring ones you've ever seen, but that might just be your diminished height adding to it.  \"What do you think about...\"</span></div></div>",

The options is there, though, if you want it,\" Yukiko explains, and you think you spot a hint of a hopeful smile on her lips. That was one good thing about being tiny, you note. You had a front-row seat to the intensely magnified subtleties of human body language. It was honestly quite telling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were game, obviously.

As your mind races with no concrete ideas, the shadow of your friend's open palm once again envelops you. You become twisted in the bedspread, falling backwards with your arms splayed out, spread-eagle. You witness Yukiko's fingers curl into a fist in what feels like slow-motion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a blood-curdling scream just before it connects. An unfathomable amount of kinetic force slams into your tiny bag of bones, immediately breaking your arms and legs and leaving you in a warm pool of your own blood. You begin to cough, wheezing and choking on a mixture of shattered bones and other viscera. <br>\r\n\"Y-yukiko, it was me... n-not a bug... It's, it was... it was me... Ben...\" you sputter as your vision seeps away, your last glimpse in this world being the disgusted expression of your friend Yukiko's, her lips curled in a snarl as she wipes the disgusting bug guts onto the bedspread that had doomed you.</span></div></div>",

But then, the lightheaded feeling came back.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou break off the kiss, putting your head in your hand and closing your eyes.

Moving back towards you, your lips locked again, but she broke away and began moving down your chest, placing a quick kiss every so often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother feeling if lightheadedness came over you as she got to your cock and placed her mouth around it.

You can't help but admit you've been kind of crushing on her, but since you know nothing about her, you never really tried to act on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoi - a 28 year old woman of some kind of half Asian decent.  Joi was a bit more open to everyone, not afraid to talk about her personal life.  You don't remember much, something about having a cat and being a proud, single woman.  She was pretty playful, always joking around and just being openly friendly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda - an early 30's, recently single woman.  You tried to stay away from her, not because she was mean or anything, but just something about her intimidated you.  She was very attractive, but after her fiance broke up with her, you stayed a bit farther away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, the big question, when does it hit you?</span></div></div>",

Nothing tasted weird, but you did get pretty plastered last night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were thinking, and Anna was working, glancing at you every once in a while, not sure what to say, but reaching out to let your cheek a little every once in awhile, you hoped she didn't see you as a pet, but still as a human, someone that needs her help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you began to worry, you heard a voice from beyond the cubicle, and looked to see the purple hair of Miranda just above it before she stepped into view.  You froze, hopping she wouldn't notice you and would just think you were some toy. Anna glaced at you before turning around, obviously hopping for the same.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't hear what they were talking about.

And because she stopped moving so suddenly, you lost your grip on the shoelace and fell right on top of the tongue of Rachel\u2019s right converse sneaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up to see the smooth skin of her lower shin, reminding you of how small you currently were compared to your ex-girlfriend. Before you could do anything else, Rachel sat down on a nearby chair, and reached for the shoe you were currently on top of. You heard her mumble, \u201cUgh, did my sock slip under my shoe? I hate when that happens.\u201d Then she started to untie her sneaker, and then she quickly popped her foot right out of the shoe, sending you falling right into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you land, you notice how strong everything felt and smelled down in Rachel\u2019s shoe, and it really turned you on. You remembered that Rachel used to let you enact your fantasies a little bit while you two were together, and you were always glad that she didn\u2019t seem to judge you for your interest in all those things. But you stop and focus on your giant ex-girlfriend up above you, and your jaw drops as you see her light pink sock all bunched up around her arch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel starts to absentmindedly rub her sole and crack and wriggle her toes at the same time, unaware that she was giving you quite the show. She then mumbles, \u201cMan, I wish I found Ben. I know I could have convinced him to give me a quick massage. And I do kinda miss him, at least a little bit.\u201d She starts to trail off while silently giggling to herself, and you wouldn\u2019t be all that opposed with rekindling a relationship, especially now that she was a giantess out of his greatest fantasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then your thoughts are cut off when Rachel picks up her discarded converse, causing you to roll down into the toe section. When you stop down at the end, you notice that the smell that you enjoyed earlier had just gotten a bit stronger, but not by much. But then an odd feeling overtook you, and you felt light headed again as the inside of the shoe started to look even huger than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds, your head cleared, and you realized that you shrunk again, and now you were about \u00bc of an inch tall. Then Rachel dropped the sneaker back onto the floor, rolled her sock back all the way on, and started to put her shoe back on. Her socked foot swiftly approached you, and you froze as her 5 titanically huge toes towered over you, like a tsunami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer 2nd toe slams into your small body, and it immediately started to rub into you in an attempt to identify you. You imagined that you\u2019d be crushed by now, but all you really feel in an intense pressure bearing down on you, which was making the experience a lot more enjoyable. Then it stops prodding at you, and you wonder what was happening, but then it returns to rubbing and smothering you at an increased and more aggressive rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel grumbled, in an annoyed tone \u201cWhat the? How\u2019d a pebble land in my sneaker?\u201d Her toe starts to press into you ruthlessly, as Rachel continued her rant, saying \u201cBen should try and keep his place a bit tidier, although knowing him, I\u2019m sure he\u2019d love to take this thing\u2019s place. Lord knows how many times he\u2019s snuck things into my shoes when I wasn\u2019t paying attention, not that I minded or anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe starts to laugh to herself, and you\u2019re glad that she never was bothered by your tricks, although you wondered just when exactly she realized that you would do that with her. You admit that you used to do that a lot with Rachel because you really enjoyed being able to picture yourself as that pebble, as it was abused by an uncaring giantess. And it was even better since Rachel used to play with her shoes very frequently and with extreme intensity, at least when she wore flats or moccasins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Rachel tied her laces tightly, causing the shoe to compress and you to be smothered even more, and then she stood up, pressing her full weight into your small frame. And after Rachel brushed herself off and cracked her knuckles, she walked down the hall and left your apartment, in order to head home herself. You understood that you wouldn\u2019t get Rachel\u2019s attention for a little while, and you only hope that your house doesn\u2019t get trashed in the meantime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel\u2019s walk to her place was pretty standard for her, but for you; it was the most intense experience of your life so far. You were repeatedly pounded by Rachel\u2019s 2nd toe, getting covered in her already built up sweat. And you felt like you were stuck on a constant rollercoaster, where you were subjected to harsh G-forces whenever Rachel raised or brought back down her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Rachel reaches a side street, and just before she can cross, a car nearly side swipes her. Rachel jumps back, while shouting \u201cHoly crap!\u201d and takes a second to catch her breath. Her action ended up having a severe affect on you down under her socked toes, as you were launched from under her 2nd toe to between her 3rd and 4th toes. And the kicker was that Rachel had a small hole in her sock that you never noticed, so you might wind up getting even closer to your ex-girlfriend\u2019s amazing toes without even trying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Rachel continued to catch her breath, she started to absentmindedly wriggle her toes, hoping that she could use that pebble as a healthy stress reliever. Those toes started to mash at you aggressively, and soon you were pushed through the small hole and were absolutely smothered by Rachel\u2019s sweaty sock encased toes. As you were ruthlessly abused by Rachel\u2019s aggressively affectionate toes, you noticed an underlying scent of cinnamon, which was probably from a detergent or lotion she used, and it smelled heavenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut soon Rachel started walking again, and before long she made it back to her own apartment. She took her converses off at her front door, and walked into her bedroom with her socks still on. Once she sat down on her bed, she stretched her legs and scrunched her toes harshly, cramming you deeply in a sweaty and smelly toe flesh sandwich. Then she pulled her socks off, dislodging you from her toes in the process, and you fell back inside her right sock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tossed those socks onto the floor, and quickly removed her clothes and walked into the bathroom, to take a shower. You were still crawling out of Rachel\u2019s used sock at the time, so you could only see the vague outlines of what was going on and allowed the sounds to fill the rest in for you. Once you were out of that amazing sock, you brushed yourself off and stretched your body a bit, to try and shake off the stiffness you felt from being confined between Rachel\u2019s powerful but tantalizing toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at her night stand, and you figure that climbing up there would be the best way to get her attention, since she\u2019d have to look there at least once her alarm went off in the morning. But as you walk towards the night stand, you come upon Rachel\u2019s old pair of brown fluffy moccasins. You always liked those things, as you would try and give her massages all the time after she wore them, as her feet would smell so strong and amazing after wearing them. And you knew from experience that she wore them pretty much daily around the house, and that thought gave you an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel incredibly tempted to climb right into those amazingly smelly beauties instead, and just screw getting her attention for the time being. You\u2019ve always wanted to experience what it might be like to act as Rachel\u2019s insignificant pebble while she wore her soft and smelly moccasins, and this was your only chance to live out your fantasy. And besides, you felt like you were a lot more durable now, so you couldn\u2019t think of any real downsides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you needed to make a decision fast, because Rachel would be out of the shower soon, and you would rather not be on the floor when she gets out. What do you decide to do?</span></div></div>",

And it didn\u2019t help that you landed face first right inside of her well used toe print, which undoubtedly had affect on your decision making process. And the warmth that seemed to radiate around you really helped relax you even further, which made your choice to go to sleep all the more reasonable to you right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo against the wishes of the more logical side of your brain, you decide to ignore all potential risks and go to sleep, and just worry about things in the morning. You can\u2019t deny the long night you\u2019ve experienced, from hanging onto Rachel\u2019s shoe for dear life at the party, to getting thrown inside of the same shoe, until you finally got dragged through the hole in her sock and had to content with her toes up close and personal without that sock acting as a barrier. You start to shuffle around in that small imprint, until you sunk a little bit further among the soft and fluffy fibers, which wrapped around you like a warm and soft blanket. You fall asleep almost immediately, thanks to the wonderful scents that surrounded you and the residual warmth from Rachel\u2019s constant use of the moccasins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel sleeps through the night as well, although she was a bit disappointed that she never bumped into you at the party. But it wasn\u2019t a major issue to her, because she was sure she could call you up later on if she still wanted to rekindle her relationship with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce morning comes, you actually wake up before Rachel, and you start by wriggling free from the soft fibers that kept you company last night. After a bit of effort, you free yourself from the clingy stuff, and you begin to stretch and think about how you\u2019ll proceed today. You do feel a lot more energized, and you know that the rest you had last night really helped rejuvenate you, and you wonder if that was the best night\u2019s sleep you\u2019ve had in awhile. It\u2019s an odd thought to be sure, but then again, you\u2019re currently living out one of you fantasies, so it\u2019s not as strange as you might believe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before you\u2019re able to make a decision, or even start your trek out of Rachel\u2019s massive moccasin, you feel massive quakes all around you, and you realize that Rachel has just gotten up. You remember from back when you two were dating, she would always put on her moccasins first thing in the morning, so you tried to prepare for the inevitable impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the ground shook more and more, you eventually see Rachel\u2019s massive frame towering over you. She was wearing a pair of short shorts and a T-shirt, and her hair looked pretty messy and tangled up. You actually thought she looked really cute right now, but your thoughts were stopped once she loudly yawned and stretched her left arm into the air. You could even see her eye tear up slightly, probably from the yawn, and you start jumping and yelling up to her, hoping that she might notice you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, she does not, and soon you are met by her incredibly large left foot, where each of her toes seemed to dwarf you a few times over. Even though you spent a decent amount of time last night with Rachel\u2019s toes, it seems like you still weren\u2019t used to being the size of a small pebble around her. So you merely braced yourself as her 3rd toe slammed into you, completely engulfing you in its morning scent. Then it started to roughly grind into you back and forth, while Rachel stretched her arms one more time. The sensation of being so carelessly and brutally treated by Rachel\u2019s toes was indescribable to you, and you were glad that you were much more durable now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Rachel walks into her bathroom and starts to brush her teeth, which scrunching and wriggling her toes unconsciously at the same time, which kept you thoroughly preoccupied down there. And once she was finished, she walked over to her kitchen and poured herself some cereal. While she ate, she started to play around with her moccasins, while focusing on her phone. She started by slipping both feet out of their respective moccasins, and then started to turn and rotate them erratically, and you were left in her left moccasin to experience the wild ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she stopped turning the moccasins, they were both facing the opposite way that they normally would, and you didn\u2019t have a chance to react as her rough heel descended onto you. It pressed into you deeply, forcing you to breathe its staler aroma, and you liked this sensation significantly less than when you were around Rachel\u2019s toes. Luckily, this didn\u2019t last long, because next she gripped both moccasins with her toes and had them switch positions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were still in the toe section of her left moccasin, right around where her 3rd and 4th toes would go, but you were now greeted by her right foot, and you saw her incredibly large big toe quickly slam into you. If you thought that you were overwhelmed back with her smaller toes, experiencing her mighty big toe took things to an entirely different level. It easily had its way with you, and you absolutely loved being dominated so fully by Rachel, when she had no clue that you were under her. So you relax your body, and let her big to press into you, rub into you, and lift and squeeze you between its joints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Rachel was finished breakfast, she quickly put her feet back into their correct moccasins, and you were taken along into the right moccasin, completely crammed between her big and 2nd toes. You were tightly shoved between her soft and strong smelling flesh, and the warmth of her moccasins was starting to make her feet sweat a bit more, which covered you in turn. Then, Rachel got up and stretched again, while pressing down with her toes, causing you to be enveloped again between her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Rachel walked back to her bedroom and started to get dressed. She slipped out of her moccasins, and got dressed while you remained stuck between her toes. Today, Rachel was wearing a pair of slim-fitting jeans and a black T-shirt. She was going to wear her converses again, and she took out a fresh pair of light blue socks, and sat down on her bed to put them on. She started with her left foot, and you watched as it was slowly covered by the tight cotton material.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd before you could even begin to struggle, to potentially alert Rachel of your presence, she suddenly clenched her toes while she bent down to put on the other sock. It was a subconscious action that effectively prevented you from communicating with her, and you figured that it\u2019d be too simple to just get her attention now, and you could only hope that she noticed you eventually. While you were roughly surrounded by Rachel\u2019s toe flesh, she lazily slipped the sock on, until it snugly wrapped up tightly against her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the sock was such a tight and snug fit, you were pressed even deeper into her moist and tantalizing toe flesh, and it only increased once she stood up, and her full weight pushed down on you and the toes that surrounded you. Then she put her converses on, apathetically grinding her feet back and forth until she forced them in, which caused you to feel confused and disoriented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was completely dressed, Rachel went into the bathroom to check the mirror, wanting to make sure that her hair wasn\u2019t messed up or that she didn\u2019t look messy, and once she was ready, she walked towards her door to head out for the day. And you were repeatedly treaded on while Rachel briskly walked across the hallway to reach the exit of her apartment. She stopped suddenly, and started to grind into you with her toes, and you heard her grumble \u201cIs my sock messed up or something? Or did my insole get torn? Whatever.\u201d You were harshly battered by her aggressive toes, and you thoroughly enjoyed it when Rachel unknowingly dominated you like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Rachel then ignored whatever was bothering her, and she walked outside to start her day. Where was she going next?</span></div></div>",

You were almost not enjoying it anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weight of her toes lifted off of you as she removed the shoe, and she lifted the shoe onto the bench she was sitting on.  The wind knocked out of you, it came to a stop and you peered out the shoe to see the monolithic form of your ex girlfriend above you.  You hadn't gotten a good look at her since you became even smaller, and you just couldn't believe it.  You made your way to the opening of the shoe and began to climb out to try and get a closer look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe climb down to the bench was a long one.  You were afraid to fall off at any moment. But somehow you made it.  You turned around, taking in the view before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel towered over you, bigger than anything you've ever seen.  You saw her bent over, trying to put on her work out shoes, wearing only a sports bra and spandex shorts.   You were entranced. This was everything you've dreamt of, it was happening.  Maybe it just took some getting used to but it was finally hitting you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your trance, you failed to notice her arm move behind you and lift up her shoes to put them in the locker.  You only came back to reality once you noticed she was standing up to leave.  In a desperate attempt you began jumping up and down, yelling her name, but it only fell upon deaf ears.  There was no way she would notice you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could only watch as she walked off, and your gaze followed her.  You were alone, in a women's locker room at the gym.  Who knew what would happen you now.</span></div></div>",

Up close you saw that she was no stranger to the gym and had a very well-sculpted form, which was poorly hidden by her shorts and tank top.  Saying she intimidated you slightly was an understatement - she probably could have wiped the floor with you even before you shrank.  At your size, this woman was more like a force of nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not like you're going to get bigger any time soon, you told yourself, so there was no point in waiting.  You took one more step forward, eclipsing yourself with her butt, and considered the great gray wall before you, sharply curving as it went up.  After a shrug you placed both hands on the fabric, working your fingers into the threading, and hop up onto her shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnticipating a long climb you conserved your energy as you ascended the stranger's ass, moving carefully.  You dug your toes into the soft but firm flesh on the other side of the shorts, and ensured you had a firm grip of the shorts' fibers before pulling yourself up.  There was a screech of metal on metal that stopped you dead in your tracks, but after a glance up you saw that she was still bent over, fiddling with the items inside her locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crested the curve of her butt and stood so that you could walk the rest of the way, at least until you reached the next obstacle.  The waistband of her shorts loomed before you at the end of the first phase of your climb, four times taller than you.  Before you could grab on you heard a thunderous slam and felt the wall stiffen in front of you.  A glance up confirmed that she was done, and about to get up.

The fabric up here was much more worn than over her butt, and you really had to focus to get a solid grip.  Each time you moved your fingers searched the threadbare material before grasping on, and your feet dug into the sturdy elastic band behind it while you pressed upward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo meaty thuds pounded their way into your ears when she slammed her palms down on the bench, and your stomach leaped when she forced herself up.  You clung tightly to the worn-out material while she stood, not wanting to be thrown off your gigantic lifeline at the most basic of her movements.  Fortunately she stood still a moment, stretching her long, sinuous muscles before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titaness you hung onto for dear life bent over, and you seized the opportunity.  Not wasting a second you scrambled the rest of the way up her shorts, cresting the top so that you could stand on the very base of her back.  Before you the tanned surface of her skin stretches for what seems like miles under her tank top until it reaches her black sports bra.  Unfortunately you are unable to move any further before she stands, throwing you back onto the top of her shorts and a ridge wide enough for you to stand on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou peeked over the edge, and once your eyes got past the bodacious booty you just climbed up you saw how far up you were.  It's definitely far enough that you would die if you fell, and her legs were taller than any building you've ever scaled.  Your present height made it difficult to tell, but this woman may have been more than \"a bit\" taller than Rachel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could continue your Shadow of the Colossus imitation the woman took a step.  Shocks and vibrations from her footfalls ran all up her body, dissipating through her butt so that it shook.  The sudden quake threw you off your feet and into the tan wall behind you, where you didn't even make a dimple.  Undeterred, you jumped up and down on the elastic band, throwing yourself into her back and hoped that she would take notice.</span></div></div>",

It is critically important that you are recognized for what you are and not a momentary light tingle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gigantic hand comes around the curve of her back, bearing down on you in the middle of her waistband.  Her fingers approached rapidly, the tip of each several times your size.  It occurs to you that she might think you are nothing more than an itch or a mere pest, and this was a hand of destruction rather than deliverance.

Come to think of it... each one of the foot puddles seemed to be the size of an average 25m long swimming pool... maybe even longer! You drop the subject as it wasn't important right now and you start towards the door. You knew Rachel's workout routine so you knew that after her 20 minute run on the treadmill, she would then do weight lifting on one of the benches where her feet would be relatively still for you to climb on. You walk beneath the crack and enter into the lobby area, where you see a massive wood desk stretching what looked like miles to you, and two giant gym goers standing in front of it. They were an elderly couple who were asking about what time the tennis matches were scheduled for in the gymnasium. If you were having any thoughts about trying to scale one of them, those thoughts were shot down upon hearing that. The last thing you wanted was to be the size of an ant surrounded by angry elder tennis players and boulder sized tennis balls flying around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked close to the wall as to not be stepped on by sneaky giants. The door that led up to the workout room was across the hall, so you look both ways and listen to the old folks to see if they would be walking away from the desk anytime soon.

You were one step closer to Rach...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\", you yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gaze up at the mountain sized staircase before you.

You desperately look around the area for anything that could help you... a piece of string or even a god damn fly would be a great help! But there was nothing. The janitors seemed to pay more attention to the stairs than they do to the change rooms. You curse under your breath and sadly shuffle over to the bottom of the first monolithic step and sit up against it. You suppose you could try and get behind the lobby desk and climb one of the employees, but you hated that you would have to go back out there when you were starting to run out of energy.

To make matters even more horrifying, down aways from where you stood, was a couple of massive giants. A female pushed up against a wall by a male with his lips meeting hers in an intense make out session. Her left foot was planted on the wall accompanied by the mans hand wedged between her thigh and calf. With their faces so close and the womans black hair abstructing them even more, you couldnt recognize who these titans were, but nonetheless, you needed help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDepending on how long they've been engaged in their embrace, you figured they would remain relatively still until they would decide to move on to a bedroom, which wasnt something you felt comfortable intruding on, but your life was more important to you than heavily invading a couples privacy. So you begin to run over towards the huge pairs of feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl was wearing wedge sandals and tight black spandex pants. Not that you were an expert on climbing womens legs, but you imagined they would be difficult to climb unless you could fit your fingers deep into threads or something. The guy however, was wearing sneakers and shorts, exposing his hairy legs which (again... not an expert) could be easier to scale if need be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were still running toward them when they finally took a break from smooching to engage in good old fashioned dirty talk. At that moment you were able to recognize who they were. Matt and Anna. One single... one not. From the looks of things, Matt was cheating on his girlfriend Miriam. He couldnt have picked a better spot than the MAIN hallway? He was lucky noone was arpund at the moment. And though Anna was not shy in personality or flaunting her gorgous body, she atleast had a set of morals, and cheating was something everyone knew was a big no no for her. She must be oblivious to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing their identities made the choice of who you were gonna make close and \"personal\" contact with much easier. Matt could not be trusted, and Anna is a good person... not to mention a beautiful woman.., bonus. You carefully get closer and closer to Anna's sandal clad foot until you were close enough to touch it. Being half an inch tall made you to small to reach the top of the sandals platform without jumping, but the material seemed leathery enough to provide good hand holds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna's left foot suddenly slammed down on the ground, scaring you half to death. Matt had dropped her leg and was hinting to a change of location. Looked like a move to somewhere was imminent for these lovebirds, so you needed to move quick.</span></div></div>",

Their movement stopped, and looking up you can see they began to make out, and Matt was getting handsy.  You knew you didn't have much time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grabbed her toe flesh, ignoring the intoxicating scent around you, eventually reaching her nail.  But, the next thing you knew, you saw a giant tarp come down, and realized he had removed her top, and then another and his top was off.  Watching in amazement of how smoothly they were moving for something so big, you watched as he began to remove his pants, exposing his cock, before laying Anna onto the bed, throwing her foot, and you, into the air.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGravity leaves you, and you are sent flying, only to land...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You did the only thing you could think to do and grabbed onto the shaft, holding on for dear life before a shadow was cast over you, and you were pressed down into his flesh by a tight, rubbery surface.  You knew what this was, but you didn't want to think about it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant couple said some things you couldn't understand, and soon your world was shaken around as your captor moved more. You tried to look up, to get any kind of sight, and all you could see was a gigantic pussy before you, before the member you were riding was thrust inside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn and out, deeper and deeper, Matt did his job.  The muffled moans from outside told you he was doing well, and you really hoped it would be over soon.  The air was growing thin, and you begin to see the edge of your vision fade before there was one last thrust, and the pressure inside your prison changed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight flooded back in, your vision still fading, and soon the pressure was lifted off of you, but we're you staying with Matt, or in the freshly used condom?</span></div></div>",

Baggy sweatshirt with the name of her sorority, tight bleached jeans, and white Converse sneakers. She's beautiful, but right now, she's a danger. She starts to stumble a bit, thinking your hiding from her. She hasn't forgotten your last experience together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ben? Where are you hiding?\" She giggles, looking around for you. You stand what must be 500 feet from her face, looking straight at her gigantic shoes coming right toward you. \"Madison! I'm down here\" You scream as loud as you can. But your screams are drained out by the slam of her white Converse sneaker landing right next to you. Immediately after, on the other side of you, her other shoe lands, trapping you. You look up to see Madison, completely unaware of your presence, towering over you. You run over to her left shoe and pound on the rubber, trying to get her attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison pivots her heel, taking the breath out of you and knocking you to the ground. You look up to see her giant Converse hovering over you. In her drunken stupor, she is now balancing on one foot, with her other hovering over you, wondering which way to walk. </span></div></div>",
