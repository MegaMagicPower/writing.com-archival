His vision jolted in and out due to his extensive damage. He felt rubble press against his body. He needed to get it off him, first to push it off. He reached his arms forward and realized his arms were gone, leaving sparking stubs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw one leg gone and he couldn't move the other.

Still with all his might he gave a little nod before finally he felt the weight of the rubble lifted off him. He wanted to thank however it was who saved him but his sight began to go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Warning! Override function damaged to critical, all systems shut down, shut down. \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaedo couldn't believe it, was this really the end of him? He couldn't believe he couldn't remember who was fighting? It all a blur. Perhaps this was fate or perhaps he was just very unlucky either way, Daedo could do nothing as slowly his system began to shut down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis looked to be the end for Daedo, he shut his eyes and could only wish that he made more time to figure it all out. He wanted to live, he had to. Then like his wish had been heard, he felt a blast of electric energy run through his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back up life core detected. Limited functions sight and voice motions online\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaedo couldn't believe it, he had been saved but by who? Slowly the answer came to him as he opened his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor looking down at him was a large, round cyborg cross human looking man covered in white steel plate armour with a bald head, one dark green eye and one very clear fake eye which looked more like a sniper scope sticking out his eye socket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello can you hear me?\" the white human cyborg said waving his left hand in front of Daedo's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" Daedo said weakly. He still could see he had no arms or his one leg he lost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent, you must listen I am Doc, a cyborg medic.\" his rescuer said. \"You need to be repaired right away. I was about to retrieve your build data however I need to warn you I will have to use parts I only have able do you understand? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaedo guessed he didn't have much choose. If he didn't his life core would die as would he. So he nodded allowing Doc to begin work. It'sa hard process for anyone to be rebuilt but Daedo had to admit Doc was quick about it. He managed to put Daedo in a sleep mode causing him less pain then it would but Daedo could still swear he felt the new parts being fitted on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill Sparks flew and hours passed till finally Doc had finished.

But after taking a few breath he continued to say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just your everyday ex-medical cyborg from the militarily. Discarded like many before me because I couldn't keep my mind on the job you know?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever as much as Daedo wanted to understand where Doc was coming from he couldn't. In fact, a lot of stuff wasn't clear at this point. Still what he did know was the cyborg who saved him Doc was part of the military but now isn't because he couldn't keep his mind on his job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, if you don't mind me asking? Couldn't you keep your mind on your job Doc?\" Daedo asked still holding his head. Noticing this, Doc returned to Daedo with a small hand held scanner. As he began to scan Daedo's head he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To answer your question Daedo, I felt like I wasn't going anywhere. All day repairing the robotic soldiers of war,sometimes using the parts of a deactivated solider to fix another. It was all the same day in, day out and my mind grew bored. I tell you there is nothing interesting about a solider who had his arm blasted off or his leg being blown off, it's all simple patch work any cyborg with two wires to the head could do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then Doc fell quiet. Perhaps he had shared to much about his idea's as for the rest of the scan he fell quiet before walking away with the scanner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem to having some problems, but nothing serious.\" Doc said with his back to the sitting Daedo. \"Your free to leave whenever you want and have no worries about thanking me for the fix. It was nice to actually have to work for a change.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom his tone of voice, Daedo could sense something about Doc but what it was didn't know. Still now fixed and ready to roll out, Daedo slid off the table before...  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

He was surprised he stayed around after all most machines usually have something to do.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess I'll go back to studying.\" Doc answered calmly continuing to pack up his tools. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My time in the military informed me of a practise where humans could be turned into Cyborgs. Can you imagine being a fragile, free willed being only then to be turned into a machine? Some may see this as improving on humans life saying it could give a powerless man the only he needs to fight for himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, even as a Cyborg I wonder that perhaps a practise like this could also be  used for criminal purposes giving powerful men who have too much power even more. Is such a practise helping or hindering our world? And of course,the question I personally would like to know is what effects this practise has on human. Does it make them strong or does it in fact make their bodies weaker? And what about the mind? Does being a cyborg/human hybrid make the cyborg  sharper in combat making them the ultimate solider? Could this practise be creating what I dare say a advanced human being? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoc seemed to be a little lost in his thoughts and Daedo just stood there waiting till finally Doc returned from his thoughts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah I'm sorry. Start me off on super hybrid humans and I go off on one like a mother hen\" Doc said happily. Still it was then something hit Doc. He had been talking to Daedo a lot however he still had no idea what he was doing here? He had no idea what job role he did? Or where he came from? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me Daedo.\" Doc said finally closing up his tool box now filled with his tools. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do now your repaired? Go off in search of your attackers? Return to whatever you do? I ask because I hope you might consider taking it easy until you feel ready to use your arm again. I've done this many times and I know many machines suffer from rejection of parts making them weak and open to any rouge machines out there as well as other unkind cyborgs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n I ask you only as a concerned medical trained Cyborg, what are you going to do now?\"  </span></div></div>",

With it's bright red roof,cream outside walls and a huge metal made garage door it was hard for Doc not to think back to his military days were buildings yet the one Shin seemed to be living in was used as a base to repair broken machines and cyborgs.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey are you ok?\" Shin asked kindly, waving her small metal hand in front of Doc's face. The movement brought Doc back from his thoughts to which he answered back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, my apologies miss shin is it?\" Doc asked. Even in a world like this it was possible for cyborg to be married or even dating. Shin nodded explaining she's more of a cyborg who like to get her hands dirty with a wrench then with another cyborg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this Doc let out an awkward laugh hiding his embarrassment about what Shin had just said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaelo and Shin just looked at him confused before Doc stopped to introduced him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah hum, I am Doc. It is a pleasure to meet you miss Shin.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female cyborg nodded telling Doc he didn't have to call her miss as it made her feel old. With a nod Doc promised he would not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right then, umm perhaps we should go into my workshop to talk?\" Shin said pressing a small red button on the left side of the garage door. \"After all there's no point standing out in the open right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaelo and Doc agreed and with that as the garage door slowly opened the three of them made their way inside before Shin closed the garage door behind them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow inside Doc was a little surprised to see the single area had been spilt in into smaller area. In the far left a small white coloured kitchen had been built, while to the far right a small living room with a black sofa, a small tv sat while the rest of the area was built like a workshop with parts of cyborgs, car parts as well as old technology from the past scattered about along with tools and half built items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about the mess\" Shin said leading them both through the workshop area. \"I've been working on something I think will change the world forever.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this Daelo whispered to Doc that Shin always said that about everything she makes. Doc figured that from the amount of unfinished creations laying about doing nothing. Still as they moved and jumped over bits and bobs of the workshop they finally arrived at the far end of the garage where the kitchen and living room where situated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShin invited them both to sit down on the sofa and without even hesitation Daelo did, however Doc was a little more careful feeling the seat he about to sit on in case of you left over tools. After a minute of searching everything seemed ok and he sat before finally Shin appeared again with a small wooden stool. She placed it beside the end where Daelo sat and then took a seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all fell a bit quiet from there until Shin broke it by saying. \"So Doc thanks for helping Daelo out, he gets into all kind of trouble.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoc nodded before asking Shin if she would mind telling him what she knew about Daelo after all they seemed to be close plus he was getting no answers from Daelo himself due to perhaps memory loss caused by the attack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShin sat there for a moment, thinking before finally.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n        <br>\r\n<br>\r\n         </span></div></div>",

He's always had this memory loss, it wasn't just before the attack...I set up a repair shop out here so I wouldn't have to go far to find things to build. Then I found Daedo. His limbs were gone and circuits were hanging out of him, but he was still working. I carried him back here and laid him down. He had become my project for the week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShin sat down and continued. \"When I found him, his condition showed he had been there for at least more than a week. But he was awake the whole time. I'd come in to try and make measurements to see how the limbs should be, and he would look back at me. His vocal generator was damaged so he couldn't move. It was weird...but it felt nice not to be alone. I'd just sit along with him, waiting for another part to come. When I finally repaired his vocals, he asked who I was, and where he was. I told him, then asked where he was from. He wasn't able to answer that. I checked his databanks, his memory was cleaned out. All he knew was what things were, and his name. I've let him stay here since. Then he heard about processes that changed humans to machines, and can't stop thinking if that's what he was.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShin leaned in a little closer to Doc to say something quiet enough that Daedo couldn't pick up. \"He says he was dreams, but....It doesn't make sense...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

After all the cyborg had saved his life and now here they stood ready to accuse him of being...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something the matter?\" Doc asked disturbing Daedo's thoughts. Daedo shook his head before opening the garage door. It was then the conversation fell quiet as the three now got ready to leave. Shin now popped back behind the sofa before bringing out a rough look tool bag she then went around her garage picking up and down tools deciding what to take. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever outside the garage Doc and Daedo now stood waiting. They were quiet as they stared out to the bare roads and tree around Shin building till finally Doc spoke. \"Shin believe me to be a Maverick.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this Daelo sighed. He guessed Doc had figured out what they were trying to avoid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Doc, but you maybe one.\" Daelo said calmly  keeping his eye sight down. It was at this Doc let out a small laugh before admitting he had been called such a thing since he left the military and perhaps he was.  \"After all\" he began. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I left the human army behind because I thought I could do better perhaps that makes me one I don't know.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two fell silent again yet in Daelo mind he felt torn. Something in his head was telling him to kill Doc, as a maverick he put a lot of risk not only himself but Shin if he suddenly turned on them and with one simple shot it that won't matter. However something else told Dealo that this cyborg had saved his life and helped when they were attacked. What Maverick does that? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two ideas spun around and around in his head till finally Dealo makes up his mind. <br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

He normally wares a dark green button up shirt underneath a brown trench coat. He also wares pants of the same color as his coat, a long black belt he loops twice around his waist to create an X shape, and black cowboy boots. And lastly, he wares an eye-patch over his left eye, and he also carries a single six shooter with him. (Though he rarely uses it, he finds it comforting to hold onto).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile on important missions such as acquiring large Refractors and/or fighting off a certain pesky 'blue guy', He'll outfit himself in his own custom Diggers gear. (It looks a lot like Black Zero's outfit, though it has a touch of sky pirate in it as well). It comes equipped with a shield attached to the left hand that projects a round barrier around the user and never runs out of energy. (Though John never uses it unless his or other people's lives would be put in danger).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt also has a purple beam saber attached to his right hand that can deflect, split, or even absorb most energy based attacks. And for those times when close quarters just isn't going to cut it, he also has duel rocket pods that can pop out from both of his shoulders at will and fire a near infinite stream of penny sized homing missiles. (Though they are small, in numbers they can inflict a large amount of damage very quickly).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn addition to all those sweet features, the suit also comes equipped with a dash function to easily dodge oncoming attacks, or make close quarters easier. And lastly, it has a one time only teleport function that must be reinstalled every time John returns to base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: Even though John is a Sky Pirate, he still has a sense of justice and believes that no one should be harmed during a raid or Dig unless someone or something attacks him or his family/friends first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven in combat he believes that it should always be made a fair fight, and will even provide tips, weapons, and restorative items to people who don't stand a chance against him, whenever he can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just because he won't attack first unless provoked, and just because he'll help you out if you really need it, doesn't mean he won't steal from you whenever he gets the chance. He's still a Bonne, and he's still going to preform his job regardless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHistory: The story of John Bonne started on a small island where he was an orphan, and had no recollection of his parents. He lived out his days just trying to survive each day as best as he could. Though it was a peaceful little island, most of the villagers were still a little aggressive from poor harvests and little to no sea trade, and usually took out their anger on anyone weaker than them. And this included the orphan kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen one bright sunny afternoon, when John was running from one such villager with a wooden stick, he stumbled into a hidden cave and fell into a fissure. The villager thought he had died from the fall and decided to leave him there to rot. But little did the villager know, not only did John survive the fall, but he landed in a giant underground lake, filled to the brim with giant Refractors of many different colors. Some were even multicolored as well. And one, bigger than the rest, was a rainbow Refractor with angel wings. It was the most amazing thing He'd ever seen. And no doubt the most amazing thing any Digger would ever see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter exploring the cave for a while longer, John found a passage on the mountainside that lead him back down to the village path. But when the boy returned to the village, he found that it was overrun by a group of Sky Pirates calling themselves, The Bonnes. He was captured upon entering the village and was brought forth to the center of the village with all the other villagers they could find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey questioned the village elders first, demanding they tell them where the treasure of the island was hidden. But no one told them anything except that they knew nothing. Tired of waiting for answers, The Bonnes decided to burn the whole island to the ground and Dig up the remains. Startled by their decision, John shouted--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know where the treasure is! I've seen it! It's in a cave not far from here. I can take you there. But i have conditions that must be met first.\" The leader of the Bonnes, Teisel Bonne, listened to his terms, that first, the Bonnes would adopt him into their family and take him with them. And second, John would be made the family accountant, and would be put in charge of spending limits for the Bonnes operations. Teisel, though reluctant to leaving this boy in charge of their money, agreed to his terms. And thus, the story of John's life as a Bonne, began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><div align=\"center\">Author note</div></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's the bio of my Character, i hope you enjoy playing as him as much as i will.

But now, the only thing i want to do more than anything is to go out, out into the world and go on a Dig of my own. Go out and rob a bank and make it big. Go out and just have fun with my life as a Sky Pirate. It was so dull being left all by myself on this ass boring ship. Luckily however, i wasn't the only one who was thinking the same way.

She was inside sitting on her bed just looking at the far wall before she looked at me entering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey John. What's up? Why are you here?\" Tron asked confused, no doubt wondering why i was off duty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm just tired of my life as an accountant. That's all.\" I said as i sat down beside her with my head hung.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Why? Isn't that what you wanted when you joined us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah, but to be honest, at the time i thought i would have a little more freedom with the money i found that day. But the only thing you guys used it on was to help build this ship and create your equipment. A lot went into those things, and all i could do was keep a log of everything bought. I guess what I'm trying to say is, i never planed for all of this to happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what did you plan on happening? Waiting until we had our backs turned to you so you could run off with everything yourself?\" Tron sounded concerned as she looked my way with an upset look in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I could never do something like that to you guys. You took me in during my time of need and took care of me even though we're not blood relatives. You guys got off that godforsaken island and i owe you my life, really. It's just, i never thought things through hard enough, and now i just want to do something different with my life as a Bonne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Like what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, i was thinking something along the lines of you guys training me how to fight, and perhaps even building me something to go out on digs and such.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, you? Going out on a dig? I can already see that happening. Teisel rarely let's me go out on missions with him as it is. What chance do you think you'll have when i can't even go out, and I'm his second in command and sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, perhaps we could try to convince him together? It might work if we really plead with him long enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, i guess we could give it a shot. But talking him into it is one thing, building you your own set of Digger's gear and training you how to use it are two different things entirely. Do you even know how long it would take for us to do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know sis, but i really want to learn. It doesn't help my case any if everyone on the ship knows how to fight except me. How am i going to protect myself if i have nothing to protect myself with when i need to protect myself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. I see your point. Well, at the very least, we could try to convince Teisel to train you how to fight, should the need arise. And we could even build you a suit in case we needed backup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, then let's go tell Teisel now Tron.\"</span></div></div>",
