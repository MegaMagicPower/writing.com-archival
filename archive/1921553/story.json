But every minute movement sent pain rushing through his body. Especially as his body was shivering due to the harsh blizzard blowing around him. He kept trying though, his vision clearly seeing Donald and Goofy backed right up against a tree. Their bodies were covered in all sorts of scraps and scars, with poor Donald not having enough energy to perform any healing spells. All around them were Parasol Beauty Heartless, their flowing ballgowns, floppy hats and open parasols free of any damage whatsoever. Sora gritted his teeth as he kept trying to get up, but his bruises just weren't having it. He could barely recollect how it all happened, he and his friends were passing through the snow-covered mountains of Arindelle searching for emblems. Before he even realized what was happening, the heartless had jumped from the icy shadows. It was bad enough on it's own with their uncountable numbers, but these Parasol Beauties were stronger than anything he had ever faced. Within seconds, he was in this position, watching as his friends were about to get blasted and couldn't do anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunley, Sora wasn't about to feel any better as each of the heartless opened fire on the two and they fell to the snow covered ground. With their quarries down, the seemingly infinite group of feminine heartless turned to him. Their yellow eyes all cast a shadow against him as he managed to pull himself to his knees at least. His own energy low, a small part of Sora felt hopelessness in the situation. But he wasn't going to go down, not without a fight, he wasn't going to give these heartless the satisfaction of him giving up. They slowly approached him, making no sound in the snow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me? If you think I'm just going to give, up then keep dreaming. My friends will avenge me, if not them than someone else. I'm never giving up as long as I have my friends in my mind and heart.\" To puncuate his speech, Sora slashed his keyblade through the air. A move he instantly regretted as his body froze up with pain. He groaned through his teeth, trying not to show weakness to the heartless all the while. But there was no chance, he knew they could see right through him. His world began to black out as they kept coming closer Sora feeling less and less able to do anything other then fall. He could feel the soft touch of velvet gloves grab hold of his arms as he gave out.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The first thing Sora felt as he regained conciousness was warmth. A thick cacoon of velvety warmth surrounding him. There was no telling how long he had been in the snow, or what those heartless did to him. Best case secnario was he was dead, he didn't want to think about the worst. To add fuel to the growing blaze of confusion and fear, he couldn't grip his keyblade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReady for the worst, Sora opened his eyes. To his surprise, he laid witness to an extravagant room. A lavender marble wall surrounded him, interrupted with with a dark red trim along the corners and celling. To his left was an enormous curtain, no doubt shades for a just as large window. Turning his gaze towards himself, Sora took notice that he was lying in a bed, thick blue sheets with lace trim wrapped around him. For a moment, he sighed with relief. Maybe his friends had woken up and saved him or some good Samaritan did the deed. That was until Sora took another look about the room and noticed the four sets of piercing yellow eyes staring at him. Four parasol beauties spread about the room, two at the door on the far side and the other two on opposite sides of the room. A particular note for Sora was that the one standing by the window was holding his keyblade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you kidnapped me. Well I won't stay down for long.\" Using what little of his energy had been restored by his nap, Sora threw away the sheets and rushed for the edge of the bed, only to be stopped. A wall of purple energy halted his progression. The four heartless put thier gloves to thier faces, apparently laughing at his predicament. Sora growled, trying to hide his humiliation from himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil his stomach growled with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, the two Parasol Beauties opened the doors. Two more stepped in, carrying trays of breakfast items. Cereal, hard-cooked eggs, glasses of both milk and juice and pieces of toast buttered up and ready for jelly, which was placed beside them and strawberry. Sora could only watch in confusion as they placed the trays inside the barrier and onto the bed, easily bypassing the force-field as if it wasn't there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this some sort of trick?\" Sora's question was met with more giggling from the heartless, who all motioned to the food. He looked to the trays, not able to stop himself from taking a whiff. A small part of his worry subsided in the delicious aroma entering his nose, everything smelled just right. \"No...\" He mumbled to himself, turning away from the meal. \"These are heartless. I can't trust them.\" Rushing back to the edge of the bed's field, Sora pounded against the magic walls. \"What kind of game are you trying to pull here? Where did you put my friends?\" As the heartless giggled once again, Sora unconsciously smelled the food again. His stomach growled at the thought of just how good the food would taste if it smelled so good. He was rather hungry, and if these heartless did want to hurt him, they could have done it earlier instead of placing him in this bed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As much as Sora wanted to show no quarter to the fancifully clad heartless before him, Sora just couldn't take it. His stomach was now roaring at him and the toast and eggs we're really getting to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" Sora said with a straight face, trying to keep the illusion of control. \"I suppose if you want me to eat then I will. But if this is poisoned, I will find a way to get my keyblade.\" Without another word, Sora sat down on the bed and began his meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts first turned to the eggs and toast, not wanting them to get cold. Thankfully, the Parasol Beauties were kind enough to leave silverware and napkins so he didn't have to touch the eggs with his hands. A good thing too, it seemed rather greasy. Odd that creatures as well dressed as them would leave grease, but Sora shrugged as he took a bite. And it was delicious. A thick spiral of seasonings sparked slithered through his mouth, seconds of spice quickly cooled by calming herbs. Sora quickly moved his eggs over to the toast and made a sandwich, to which he greedily gobbled it up. His stomach was already feeling better, the grumbling having stopped. \"Well...for heartless, you gals make some good eggs.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Parasol heartless blushed as Sora gulped down the juice, fresh squeezed apple no doubt and quite fresh. Ignoring the gurgle made by his belly, Sora turned to the bowl of cereal. There wasn't any milk in it, no doubt what the glass was for. As he poured the milk in, Sora's eyes fell upon the cereal pieces. Three shapes we're promient, the first two were rather detailed images of both his own and the Parasol Beauty's head. All of them were surrounded by little marshmallow hearts, the imagrey reminding Sora of his predicament but without disuading him from spooning some cereal. Taking one of each of the shapes at once, Sora's mouth was lit ablaze by a new fruity taste. It seemed to eminate from the parasol shapes, a rasberry-blueberry mix. The heart marshmallow was rather thick, but actually having a cherry filled center. As for his own piece however, he couldn't help but feel it tasted a little bland. But it was fine, as long as he mixed the others together. With each bite, Sora's belly jiggled slightly, slowly attempting to poke through his shirt. As Sora slurped up all the milk, his stomach had noticeably expanded, if only by a little bit. \"Well, that was great I will admit. But I'm still going to get my keyblade back and find my friends.\"</span></div></div>",

The one holding his keyblade was especially taunting, waving it about just beyond the wall of the bed's force field. After a few minutes of playing, the keyweilder had stepped back, the Parasols of it and it's sisters glowing the same shade of color as the bed's shield. After an intense bout of light, the sound of shattered glass echoed throughout the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking his chance, Sora lept through the bedposts. Sure enough, the heartless were foolish enough to disable the force-field. He landed on the floor with an deep thud, turning his whole body towards the parasol holding his key. \"Alright heartless, time for me to strike.\" Sora dashed for the heartless, but it sidestepped him before he could reach. Unable to stop himself in time, Sora hit the wall stomach first. A slight blush came to his face as he looked down and only now saw his stomach have grown out another inch or so, no doubt the food still digesting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's it? You fed me to fatten me?\" Sora glanced about at the group of Parasol Beauties, already having him trapped in a familiar position of multiples to one. Gathering his strength, Sora rushed again. He wasn't aiming for the keyholder, but for any of them. A whoosh of the dresses came as the heartless managed to sidestep him again. Sora managed to stop himself this time, but found himself hunched over to catch his breath. \"What's going on?\" Sora wondered aloud, \"This new gut shouldn't be slowing me down this much.\"</span></div></div>",

Despite still feeling weak, it was concerning how it felt to be so tired. He finally caught his breath, and looked at his round stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the..?\u201d His stomach still seemed to be growing. His shirt and pants straining to contain the increasing girth. The parasol laughed, as a pink haze spread from them, and began to fill the room. Despite this, Sora was still staring at his stomach. His stomach gurgles constantly, and is expanding very slowly. Despite the large breakfast he had, he felt hunger once again rear it\u2019s ugly head. Sora finally stood up straight, and two things happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, he saw the pink haze which has almost completely filled the room, and second, all 4 Parasols have closed in around him, just outside of melee and look ready to pounce. Sora tried to fling his body to one side, but he is still unused to the new weight, and the Parasol pounce on him. Pink fills his vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Sora yells as he struggles to break free. His stomach roars in hunger, and he feels himself expanding even faster in every direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora manages to break free from the Parasols. As soon as he got a couple steps away, the bright light returned, and Sora was trapped once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora took this moment to stare at his body. His arms and legs have softened. They aren\u2019t straining his sleeves but it wasn\u2019t nearly as loose fitting as before. His legs and ass however saw a lot of damage. His once thin legs now completely coated in jiggly fat. He tenses his legs only to see all trace of muscle vanish as his legs jiggle. His ass strained against his pants. Which used to be much more form-fitting before he increased in size. Now they push against, trying to break free of its prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite all of this, his stomach was the worst. His stomach creaked and strained it\u2019s way against his shirt. The very tight shirt is was somehow able to contain his stomach, however, it looked to be on its breaking point. And while he couldnt see it, he felt extra fat on his neck when he looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoras face burned red. He felt extremely weak, tired, hungry, and maybe had an extra 60 pounds on his frame, that slowly continued to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLET ME OUT!\u201d He slammed his girth against the shield, unable to do any damage to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Parasols laughed. 2 of them went out of the room, while the last two opened up tiny holes in the shield and placed their umbrella tips inside. Two streams of purple shot at Sora. Unable to do anything at such a close distance, he breathed in before clamping his mouth shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach growled loudly. His hunger coming back to him in quick fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors opened and the smell of fantasic smelling breads, sweets, meats, and more come inside. Sora felt his control slipping as they got closer. </span></div></div>",

The two Parasols that had blasted him stepped away from thier work, though they left the small holes open so the smell of the food was only becoming an issue faster. Sora could feel his mouth watering as the two heartless carrying the food with the grace of veteran waitress came right up to him. They had rather thick variants of thier usual gloves, looking almost like fancy oven mitts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe urge was so strong, he wanted to just beg the Parasols for the food even as they started setting the plates down beside him. His thoughts of escape and attacking the heartless were being clouded over by the desire to just eat everything they gave him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut no. He couldn't give in. He may have faltered once, but he couldn't do it again. He had to stay strong, his friends were out there no doubt and looking for him. It didn't matter how far he had become or how delicious and mouth watering the food smelled or even how good it no doubt tasted if breakfast was any indication, he wasn't going to take one bite more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget it.\" Sora, with no small amount of shame, slapped the food away. No doubt because it was the Heartless', it went through the shield and some of the food actually ended up on the dresses of the serving Heartless'. \"I'm not eating anything more. You heartless aren't going to tempt me.\" Although his stomach betrayed his vocal sentiments, Sora stood strong in his resolve. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two Parasols in front of him stared at the mess on thier dresses, thier lack of facial expressions making it hard to tell if they were angry or upset or anything. The other two heartless looked to one another before heading out the door. Making matters worse, one of them that left was the one holding his keyblade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor minutes on end, Sora stayed in his little enclosure trying get used to his large stomach and legs while the two dirty Parasols continued to no doubt glare at him. Finally the doors opened again, three Parasol Heartless walked through. Two of them were normal looking ones, neither of them had Sora's keyblade though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the third one between the two however, she looked quite different from the others. Aside from a large blue boa and a higher class look on her Parasol, there was nothing different about her wardrobe aside from more of a pink color scheme. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer very form gave off a purple mist as she poked through the barrier Sora was trapped in. Unlike shooting another hunger beam like the others however, she raised up the barrier before teleporting the two of them out of the room and ending up in what appeared to be a grand dining hall. The pink Parasol set Sora down in a chair at the end of a table filled to the brim with everything the Parasols had brought him and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora was still amazed by the power this Parasol showed. \"What the heck are you? Some kind of super powered heartless?\" The Pink Parasol giggled, grabing a plate brownies and stuffing one into Sora's face so fast his body involuntary swallowed. It was so delicious, moist and tasteful. With each brownie she forced into Sora's mouth, more and more of the mist she was expelling got beyond the barrier. Sora could feel his stomach filling up all over again and his hunger just kept getting worse. On top of that, he could almost hear the Parasol whispering to him. At least it had to be her as there was no one else around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just relax child. You're so hungry and such a cute human as you shouldn't be allowed to starve. Just eat, don't think, let my powerful aura calm your heart and allow you enjoy all of my wonderful food.\" She spoke in such a beautiful tone, it almost made Sora ignore how his arms were starting to swell up and his shirt and pants were starting to rip.</span></div></div>",
