You look around frantically, trying to pinpoint where it was coming from. After a few seconds, you saw who it was, Android 18. Meaning you were somehow teleported in the world of Dragon Ball Z! You were simply in awe. You were face to face with one of the hottest girls in the entire series!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour focused snapped back into reality as you saw 18 sat down on the couch, crossing her legs with a bowl of popcorn next to her. From her appearance, It must be after the Cell saga. She was wearing white jeans and a blue sweater. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to get her help, so you began your journey upward. You started at her feet. They weren't a problem for awhile until 18 started to scratch her foot with the other one. You were dragged back and forth on her foot, becoming completely oblivious to the robotic goddess. After a few seconds, she stopped and placed her foot back on the ground. You were surprised that you survived it without a scratch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued your climb up her ankle and were faced with an opening in her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA: You decided to crawl on the outside of her pants. You could climb to her ear or take a possible unaware vore route.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB: You decided to crawl inside her pants. This will lead to her panties and inside her shirt.</span></div></div>",

Our enemies won't expect a thing...and by the time they've figured it out I'll have squashed em'!\" Leone laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure got lucky with that find, big sis.\" Tatsumi said as he sipped his tea. \"Oh don't worry, it shrinks things too...so I can play with you anytime I want!\" Leone cooed, causing Tatsumi to spit out his tea in shock. \"W-what!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh...lucky.\" Lubbock muttered. \"Don't worry, I'm sure if you annoy her enough she'll shrink you down too, Lub.\" Mine rolled her eyes. \"Really?\" Lubbock asked, \"Sure...but don't cry when she just stomps ya like a bug.\" Mine snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, outside the Nightraid hideout a young man was walking home from school with a bookbag slung over his shoulder....at least that's what he last remembered.

I don't remember wandering into the woods...\" Pulling out his phone, he saw that he wasn't connected to wifi and when he tried to dial a number, nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell? I mean I know I'm out in the woods but how come I can't even call anyone!?\" He blurted and stood up. He walked forward with his bag in hand and tripped over one of Lubbock's trip wires. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly inside the hideout Cross Tail alerted Lubbock and the others. \"Looks like something set off my trap. But it's waaay too close to the hideout...why didn't it set off the others around the perimeter?\" Lubbock said aloud as everyone jumped up and rushed outside, believing they were under attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat they found was no warrior or sinister Imperial...but a young boy laying flat on his face wearing strange clothes. \"Jeez, what's with his clothes?\" Mine scoffed as she held Pumpkin at the ready. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkame and Tatsumi had their swords ready and Lubbock stood by Najenda and Leone. \"He's kinda cute...even though he's facedown in the dirt.\" Leone admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Najenda demanded as she approached. Jacob looked up and saw the strangest group of people he'd ever seen...one of whom was dressed in pink and holding the biggest gun he'd ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...Jacob? Can ya tell me where I am-\" Jacob tried to stand up and Lubbock instinctively had wires wrap around the boy's body, restraining him. \"Don't move...\" Lubbock warned dangerously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob stood there and fearfully squeaked: \"O-Ok....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNajenda frowned, \"Leone, shrink him and take him in to be interrogated...by you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeone looked over the moon as she activated  the bracelet and shrank the boy down to 4 inches tall. She approached, her footsteps shaking the earth beneath him as he looked up to the scantily clad, buxom giantess and screamed in terror.</span></div></div>",

You only got a couple centimeters before the woman's giant fingers ensnared you in a fist. Your arms and legs we're trapped in her mere fingers, only your head is out. You panic trying to move your arms trying anything to get out of the massive iron grip. \"L-let me out please!\" You begged not liking the situation at all. The blonde woman brought her fist up slowly until you were at eye level with her yellow eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeone felt you squirming in her hand, sees the fear in your small eyes. Any other person would feel the need to tell him it would be ok, but a member of Night Raid told him what was necessary. \"Quite\" She said with a death like tone to her voice glaring at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe glare makes your hairs stand and your spine felt chills. You stopped moving and closed your eyes hoping this was a bad idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTatsumi watches as the man in Leone's fist, he felt a bit of pity for the boy, he looked to young to be a threat. \"I kind of feel bad for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLubbock tapped his shoulder. \"Don't, young or not he could be dangerous.\" He sees the boy in Leone's hand. \"Besides.... he's so lucky!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger assassin just sighed at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright boss, I'm off to the interrogation room.\" Leone says with a beautiful smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNajenda nodded. \"Make sure you get everything out of him.\" She told him. \"No holding back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped at that, fighting not to panic and beg. Leone turned around roughly making your head recoil from the sudden motion. She walked with you wondering what was going to happen to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeone entered the interrogation room with you in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around seeing all kinds of torture devices, tools for removing finger nails, blades for cutting, a rack for stretching limbs. You shivered, and hoped nothing in here would be used to torture you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright little man!\" Leone dropped you on a table that's level with her belly button. \"This'll be your new home for a while!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fell on your boot roughly and looked up at the buxom lady. \"W-what are you going to do to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeone brought her hand under her chin with a thoughtful smile. \"Don' know, usually I either beat the info out of people with my other imperial arms.\" She points to her belt over her black panties. The belt glowed growing Leone's hair and cat ears. Her hands and feet remained the same deciding to let her victim enjoy her beauty a little before torturing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in awe at the transformation that just transpired, her golden hair longer, cute cat ears and... is that a tail?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSLAM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jumped as Leon slammed her big hands on both sides of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But now that your tiny.\" She continued with that evil cute smile. \"I have a lot more options.\" She sees you shaking again. \"You chose a bad day to get near our hideout.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I-\" You were intercepted when her right hand grabbed you and knocked out of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough chit-chat, time to go to work!\" Leone giggled, then she rose her left arm up and took a whiff. \"Ooh, hadn't shower since my last mission.\" She then looked to you which again made you scared. \"I think we know our first torture method!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait whmph!\" You were immediately pressed against her sweaty armpit, your head felt all the greasy substance, and the smell was beyond ranked. It was like a bunch of athletes wore the same gym clothes and put it in a pile. It was amplified due to your small nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeone giggled, it tickled having your face against her pit. \"Smells huh? Oh I know let's coat your whole body in there\" She loosened her grip and pressed you like a sponge to her sweaty but soft skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow your whole body was getting coated in pit sweat, the BO was starting to make you cry as this giant lion like girl rubs you not so gently against her pit. The only solace to this is the feeling of her silky skin, it felt nice minus all the sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha, you ready to tell me everything you know yet?\" She said still rubbing you in her pit. \"Let's do it a little longer for good measure!\" And to your displeasure she rubbed harder the sweat getting in your mouth, tasting salty and disgusting. It's also making your eyes water, you wonder when this'll end.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I don't even know where I am!\" you wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeone scoffed, \"Ya expect me to believe you just HAPPENED to stumble on our hideout? Not likely...though I gotta know how ya didn't set off any of Lub's other traps.\" She gave you a bit of a squeeze, causing you to yelp in pain. \"O-ok....c-can ya give me a chance to uh....explain?\" You cleared your throat. Leone glared at you, \"That's what I'm doin'....unless you want me to stuff ya in my other pit ya better hurry up!\" Leone boomed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just woke up here!

I swear!\" You shouted, causing Leone to snicker devilishly. \"Yeah, yeah...suuure! In the meantime, my right pit is sooo lonely...\" She mocked you with a pout as she passed you to her left hand and slowly and seductively raised her right arm and revealed her glistening, sweaty, BO ridden armpit to you. A waft of hot, rancid air blew into your face and caused you to retch in revulsion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwww, should'a told the truth to meee! Or...at least made up a better excuse!\" She slapped you into her pit with a moist splat. She sighed as she rubbed you into the stench-ridden surface. \"Now just stay right there...\" She cooed as she lowered her arm over you with a wet slapping sound.</span></div></div>",

Her face scrunched up from the smell. \"Ah! I cannot believe how rank I am! It must be the worse at your size it must be hell.\" She giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had the face of a boy who had been broken from this torture. Unfortunately she doesn't seem to care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now will you talk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grow me back, I can prove that I-I'm not who you think I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like hell.\" Leone mercilessly squeezed you, causing you all sorts of pain throughout your body, she made sure not to break anything to keep you from going into shock. \"I never got this far in Night Raid without keeping my guard up. Your a spy, how else could you get past our traps?\" She rose her right arm. \"Time for round 3!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My backpack! My backpack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped with your face just in front of the glistening pit. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at the shiny pit, you still smell the strong odor, not wanting to reunite with it you explain. \"Just, just grow my backpack and then it'll show you that I'm not who you think I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Backpack?\" Leone twisted her wrist to see a strange red bag on your back. \"Oh right. Why didn't I think of that?\" She sweat dropped then she turned you back around. \"But why don't you open it first, I'd hate to spring a trap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeez this woman was beyond paranoid. You nodded knowing not to deny the lioness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put you back on the table and stood with her arms crossed under her breasts. \"Just so you know, if I find one weapon, we'll move on to something more lethal and demeaning.\" She gave a serious scary face. \"Understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, took off your bag and unzipped it. You showed that nothing happened. \"See there's no trap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeone then slowly descended her hand upon you, for a moment you thought she was gonna grab you, you closed your eyes only to feel the bag taken from you. You reopened them to see the giant lioness holding your bag between her two fingers, her bracelet glowed and the bag grew to it's normal size, which is gigantic to you. She eyed down at you. \"Ok, let's see what we have here.\" She put her hand in the strange bag and pulled out what looked like  a book and placed it next to you. \"Math, science\" She looked at you with a confused look. \"You some kind of scholar? Wait\" She pulled one last book and it read history. She placed the book down on top of the rest then she emptied the rest of it's contents next to them. Papers, pencils, erasers and pens fell out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched and kept gulping hoping that you finally cleared your name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this junk?\" Leone questioned and looked at you for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's stuff I have for school, look that history book it'll tell you where I'm from!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed the book and opened it. It had strange pictures of places she's never heard of, and the continents are all wrong. Yet they we're described like the madman who wrote the book actually lived there. Including historical figures she's never even heard of. \"Wait what, this doesn't make any sense, so wait if this is where your from then.\" She stopped for a minute and looked at you for a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were hoping that she finally understood. \"Yes, I had no idea how I came here so please help me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeone's eyes turned sparkly at you, you hoped that was a good sign. \"Oh this means you could be from a whole other world! This is so cool!\" She dropped her hands on either side of you. This action scared you quite a bit, she then kneeled down so she was eye level with you. \"Wow I can't believe it, if you really did come from another world then it must have been an accident because no one would want to go near our forest, so wait how did you get here?\" She then stopped when she sees trying to back away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Leone then remembered she was torturing you just a few minutes ago. \"Oh, no, look I didn't meant to I was just following orders.\" The lioness got defensive still seeing you back away, she then brought a hand behind you to act as a wall to keep you from going further away. \"Look, I'm sorry, you were just suspicious, believe me I actually didn't like torturing you, you're pretty cute.\" She tried calming you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush but still wary of this giant lioness. \"J-just please don't hurt me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look I can make it up to you.\" She's never tortured an innocent person since Night Raid and now that she has she wants to make things right. \"Oh I know how bout I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And when can I grow back?\" you asked. Leone snickered, \"Relax, no reason to now! As for growin' ya back...the boss might wanna keep you around and monitor you JUST to be safe.\" Leone plucked you up and tucked you, of all places, into her cleavage. \"Eep! W-what are you-?!\" you yelled in embarrassment, her cleavage was rather sticky with sweat...just like her pits only not as stinky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh relax, you're my new boytoy afterall!\" Leone winked as she grabbed your backpack and started walking into the main area of the hideout. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNajenda was seated in an ornate chair in the room where Tatsumi first was introduced to Nightraid. Najenda, Akame, Tatsumi, Mine, and Lubbock looked up and saw Leone had come back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...what did he tell y-\" Akame started to ask before Mine shouted: \"IS HE IN YOUR BOOBS?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAGH!

He told me he's from another world and he even has the proof to back it up and he's not a threat at all...are ya wittle guy?\" She patted you on the head, it was hard to believe this lady was just torturing you moments ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Proof...that he's from another world?\" Tatsumi questioned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup!\" Leone nodded. \"Well..let's see it then.\" Najenda took a puff on her cigarette. Leone dumped the bag out once more onto the floor in front of everyone. \"What is he a scholar?\" Mine snarked as most of these were school supplies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, everybody take a look at this.\" Leone held up the textbook titled: World History. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group of assassins passed it around and flipped through it, \"Whoa, the tech in this place is waaaay more advanced than anything I've ever seen!\" Tatsumi commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These places....I've never seen or heard of anything like them.\" Akame said in awe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph..so we've got a weirdo shrimp who just happened to land in our backyard? What do we do with him...?\" Mine sneered at you, causing you to nervously quiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll permit him to stay with us...perhaps once he grows familiar with this place we could make a valuable ally out of him...but until now he's under your care Leone...and he's not to be grown back until we know we can trust him.\" Najenda narrowed her uncovered eye at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it, boss!\" Leone said without argument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So uh....where am I exactly?\" You asked dumbly. \"You're in the hideout of Nightraid, a secret assassin group fighting against the Empire's tyranny.\" Tatsumi declared pridefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Kay...\" You said shyly, kind of uncomfortable with the idea of being helpless with a bunch of killers. \"Maybe we could learn some stuff from these textbooks and with shorty's help?\" Lub said to Najenda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a bad idea..what is your name?\" Najenda inquired of you. \"J-Jacob, ma'am.\" You said politely, getting the feeling you didn't wanna piss this robo-armed woman off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Jacob, you won't be living here for free. You'll be assisting in chores and will tell us about your world...we'll see if we can glean anything from your world's history and battle tactics.\" Najenda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...how is he going to do chores at his size?\" Tatsumi asked. \"Let's see how strong...and durable he is first, then.

'Gross! I'll have to bathe him before bed tonight.' But she actually liked kissing this adorable little man. She pulled him away and gave him one last wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed and then looked down to see Leone starting to take her boot off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy.\" She put you in her cleavage and sat down. She pulled with all her might, trying to yank her foot out of her boot, the sounds were similar to a plunder being pulled. \"Grr! Come off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cringed as she was trying to pull that boot off, then a loud function cup sound popped. Showing her pretty and shiny looking foot. Shiny from the sweat that is. \"Oh god\" She then grabbed you from her cleavage and hesitantly dropped you in the sweaty boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou landed on the squishy insole, your hands  felt the moist stank bottom, you looked up to see Leone looking down at you with a sympathetic look. \"I'll make your reward extra special I promise.\" She then rose her foot, all you can see is the five toes heading down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to crawl as you were too tall to fit in,you felt her foot crash down on you, the crevice of her big and second biggest toe ensnared your head, while the rest of your body was underneath her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeone felt you under her foot, as bad as she felt it feels kind of good having someone under her foot. \"I'll have to bathe him extra after this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLubbock who stopped looking sympathetic and grinder his teeth. \"Why is he so lucky!\" While the rest of night raid all had looks of sympathy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess he's taken care of.\" Leone said gently pressing her foot on you feeling your tiny body beneath her mighty sole, knowing that he'll need a really good treat after this.

Hope you're alright lil' guy!\" Leone looked down at her foot and saw you plastered to the ball of it with your face still snugly in her crevice. \"Wheeew! I don't envy you in the least!\" she peeled you off, where you immediately gasped for fresh air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened as you figured out where you were and remembered what you heard her say. \"S-so are you really gonna um...bathe with me?\" you blushed bright red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, yup, and youuu get to wash me off...you're so lucky!\" She cooed and patted you on the head. \"Oh y-yeah...\" You blushed even more as she suddenly gripped your clothes and tore them off you. \"H-hey! What are you-!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya can't take a bath with clothes on, stupid!\" She teased you.

Besides, you were starting to grow fond of this spunky buxom blond girl....all things considered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when you looked up and noticed she had discarded her clothes and she was standing there in all her nude buxom glory. You immediately had a nosebleed and fell backwards into the water with a cry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeone giggled and seductively stepped into the water, sitting down and relaxing with her elbows on the outer edge as she sighed in relaxation. \"I've been looking forward to this...didn't know I'd have a little boy-toy my next bath though!\" Leone laughed as you surfaced with a gasp and coughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up at Leone's huge form looming over you like...like a.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Goddess...!\" You yelled....not realizing you had said it so loudly until after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile with the others, Najenda was going over the history book with everyone. \"According to this book it was written in Jacob's time...the year 2018. Judging by the stamp on the inner cover it is the property of a school in a country called America.\" Their leader explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this...America like?\" Tatsumi asked curiously, wondering if the same problems plagued Jacob's world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well from what I've read of it's history, it was originally thirteen colonies that split from a kingdom called Great Britain and the following skirmishes became what the text refers to as the Revolutionary War.\" Najenda stated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened....?\" Akame asked, curious of how this other world's revolution turned out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It ended in the American colonies founding their own country....there appears to be a well respected document recreated in this book called the Declaration of Independence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNajenda showed them all a quote from said famous document and placed the book open upon a table in front of them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government.\"</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your face matched that of a tomato.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeone giggled and grabbed your body from underneath, surprising you as you felt her fingers touch your naked body. She then forced you to turn around to look at her massive form. \"Come on Jacob, don't be shy tell me what you just called me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were really embarrassed not sure how to put it. \"I- I couldn't help b-but say that you-you look like a goddess!\" You yelled because you had to force yourself to say it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeone then laughed, she sees your'e embarrassed. \"Why thank you little guy, I didn't know you were so charming.\" She rubbed her soak finger on your wet hair. \"The ladies must love you!\" She teased seeing you blush a deeper shade of red. \"So if I'm a goddess, you wouldn't mind start washing me would you?\" She gave you your usual smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah ok Leone.\" You tell her still blushing deep red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeone gave you a smile of gratitude, she then pointed behind you, you turn around and see her right bare foot rise out of the water. \"I know you don't have good memories but can you start with my feet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remembered being under that foot, all the sweat and grime. And the weight of the foot too was traumatizing. But you knew here you were safe. \"Ok but what do I wash it with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeone giggled and got a piece of soap in her hand just big enough for you to use. \"Here ya go.\" She dropped it. You quickly grabbed it and swam over her leg until you made it to her foot, you decided to start at the sole of her foot while she relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you were wary, your were underneath this foot for a while, you didn't want to be near it. But right now, Leone's foot actually looked pretty, and it felt so soft touching it with his free hand as he used the other to rub the tiny piece of soap against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lioness was enjoying every second of this, who knew such tiny hands could help her relax. 'Can't wait till he works on the rest of my body.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the hideout after Najenda showed them what America called the Declaration of Independence they gathered their thoughts on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it looks like this America place is proud to have something we don't, freedom.\" Lubbock observed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNajenda nodded. \"Yes, but they earned it through blood and sweat. Along with the lives of some of their comrades.\" She added all too familiar with the costs of fighting the empire's tyranny, much like this America, they are fighting against a superior force, fighting to be free of the unjust that the Emperor, or more specifically the Prime Minister Honest. \"Perhaps we can create a document like this when this is all over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'd be perfect.\" Tatsumi cheered. \"A nation that's free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNajenda nodded. \"Yes but we still need a few strategies, perhaps the book will have more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLubbock nodded and looked at the Manga stash. \"Hey, boss mind if I read a couple of those.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, perhaps we'll find something useful in these as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And then the Punisher tells him he's gonna shoot him low in the stomach, and leave him there. He explains it as he'll be suffering and in pain for five whole days by his estimate before he actually dies..he explains it that his guts'll will fill up with shit and he'll die of blood poisoning...and he's too far away from any town so nobody will hear him screaming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think he says 'You made this personal, all that's earned you is a little more pain and suffering than most.\" You explain.</span></div></div>",

It was an accident! What are you..\" you trail off, frightened as her deceptively innocent face twists into an expression of sadistic glee. \"Tell me, little man\" she murmurs, \"Are you ticklish?\" You gulp and remain silent, hoping against hope that she'll lose interest, but your hesitation only further arouses her curiosity. \"I asked you a question, little man\" she snarls, \"And now that I have to find out for myself, you'll be punished even more for your impudence!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can object, she tugs off your shoes and socks, ripping away your shirt, pants, and underwear with a flicker of her wrist. Nude and helpless, you shudder nervously in the palm of her hand. She starts testing your body to see which place is the most ticklish. Placing her index fingers at your arms, she slowly drags them down before settling at your armpits, moving her fingertips in little circles to exacerbate your torment. \"Does it tickle there, little man\"? she teases. \"Admit it, and I might just stop..\" Though you're tempted by the offer, you're determined not to give her the satisfaction, forcing out a tortured \"No...\" You squirm and writhe but just barely manage to keep your mouth shut despite your body being wracked by ticklish sensations. Disappointed by the lack of reaction, she darts out her tongue, dabbing at your little feet as she continues her relentless assault on your armpits. This causes you to giggle, but you quickly clamp your mouth shut and hope she doesn't hear you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're only resisting the inevitable you know,\" she taunts with a mocking smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDetermined to break your resistance, she brings her whole hand to play now, targeting your lower stomach with random, ticklish pinches. The inability to predict her next move only heightens the ticklish sensations with each pinch. You twitch and squirm, until finally your resistance crumbles, the accumulated laughter bubbling forth as you yelp and squeal, begging for mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go, doesn't it feel better when you just let it out?\" she asks, smiling wickedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe, Alrighhit, alrighhht, I'm tihihicklish!

Her nails move to your hip, scratching and lightly squeezing in a way that makes you howl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor little man\" Carrie whispers. \"Poor, ticklish little man. You didn't really think I'd stop, did you? I'm going to keep playing with my ticklish little pet until I drive him crazy!\" All you can do is writhe and squirm, groaning plaintively and gasping for breath between fits of laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling at your predicament, Carrie begins gently tracing her fingernails up and down your ribs, causing a fresh wave of ticklish tingles to crash against your skin. Your stomach aches from all this laughter, and you're afraid that if Carrie keeps this up much longer, you'll black out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The changes her body is going through is a constant reminder of your love. After a month, Carrie's breasts started to swell, and not long after she started to lactate heavily. Soon after you both learn that it is colostrum, what comes in before the milk. Out of curiousity, you suck on her nipple, and you enjoy the taste. The sensation Carrie feels is amazing as well. Pretty son, you are drinking her milk on a daily basis, Carrie saying that she feels closer to you as a result. You can't argue with her about it, since you feel the same way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Monthes pass as you both watch her stomach swell and expand as your child grows inside her. Carrie's breasts swelling to a nice pair of F-cups, as she is constantly lactating a small stream of milk. Because of this, she had to quit her job. After wet spots formimg on the  front of her shirts became common, even with nursing pads on, she had no choice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carrie's feet had expanded due to he pregnancy, putting her at a solid size nine. You couldn't complain, her feet are still beautifil, and you love the extra half inch. Which you admire with each foot massage you give her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her mood swings took some getting used to. When she cries, you are there by her side for comfort. When she got upset, you gave her space. Light bulbs blowing and things flying off shelves from her telekinesis became more common.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When the day came, you made sure that you were there. Hiding in Carrie's purse for the whole nine hours of labor, until she gave birth to a beatiful baby girl. You and Carrie agreed to the name Eve, since she is the first born. You look at Carrie holding your daughter, thinking back to how wonderful your life has become since Carrie accidently shrank you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Carrie's vody changed after her pregnancy, but in a good way. She now has a bit of extra weight in her stomach, hips and ass. You tell her that it makes her softer to lay on. Her breasts remained at an F-cup. She continues to lactate, even after she stops breastfeeding your daughter, which is because you continue to suck on her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0By the time Eve turns two, Aunt Nichole, which is what you and Carrie call her for Eve, gets a good job and you move to a single family home.</span></div></div>",

Everyone begins unleashing merciless fire at the giant teenage girl. The bullets didn't do nothing to her, and she laughs as it tickles her, but the tank shells and missiles really did some damage to her. She struggled to keep her balance and eventually she falls right down. Now, Rachel is really pissed, and really starts unleashing her psychic powers. She picks up tons of houses and buildings and throws them at the soldiers, killing many of them. Soon they were all panicking and running for their lives just as she comes and grabs one of the jets using her powers, and eats it up good.

But you must have drank because currently you weren't laying on your bed. Right now you weren't on your bed. Whatever your on is a softer fabric. Like your sleeping on silk. Groaning you decide to see where your drunk self got himself up to. And with that you open your eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes and became shocked at what you saw. It was a giant woman!. But not any Giant Woman. This Woman was Princess Peach. The damsel in the Mario Series. You look around even more and realize that she isn't a giant. You are small and currently in her Bedroom quarters. Specifically Peach's Lap.\"WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON!!\" You shout at the top of your voice <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seemed to get Peach's Attention as she looked down and you saw her beautiful face staring at you \"Oh good your awake, I was worried\" this is the first time you ever heard Peach talk. And she sounded exactly like you assumes. However you didn't feel like talking right now \"WHAT'S GOING ON! WHY ARE YOU SO BIG! WHY ARE YOU HERE! YOUR NOT REAL!\" Peach Giggled at your remark \"I'm pretty sure I'm real\" \"THIS ISN'T FUNNY! THIS IS THIS IS-\" you were interrupted as Peach started rubbing your back trying to calm you down \"Don't Worry. I know you must be scared but were going to get through this okay\" Peach said trying to calm you down with her soothing voice. And the weird parties that it was working. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your name little one?\" peach asked you and you replied with your given name \"That's A Sweet Name. My name is Princess Peach, Ruler of the Mushroom Kingdom, now next question why are you so small?\" \"I honestly don't know. When I went to sleep I was normal size and now I'm the size of a mouse!\" \"Oh my, how troublesome. Well do you at least know where you house is then, maybe that would help\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow your at a crossroads, do you tell about the princess about your world and the fact that she's a video game character. That would help you both figure out where you are. or do you not tell Peach for the sake of not breaking her small mind. She's so sweet that it wasn't fair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

A sigh escaped your lips as you know that after tomorrow you'll be back to work in the office right away. It's times like this that you regret not being a huntsman when you were younger, by then you didn't want to risk your life fighting monsters but looking back, it seems a lot more exciting then the life you have now. \"God do I wish something exciting would happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then hear a  young woman speak. \"One strawberry sunrise, no ice with the little umbrella.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to see a girl probably the same age as you, she had long blonde hair reaching to her waist, lavender eyes, well endowed, she had a brown jacket, an orange scarf, with a yellow undershirt, matching bracelets, and brown boots. She then took a seat next to you, her strawberry sunrise came out quickly. \"It's on the house.\" The bartender explained with what you thought was fear in his tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw tell Junior thanks for being so sweet.\" The girl said and then turned to see you staring at her, she gave a smile. \"Like what you see?\" She asked with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAwkwardly you hung your mouth open. 'Uhh\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe\" She giggled  and brought out her hand. \"Yang Xiao Long.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see her offering her hand and brought out your own. \"I'm (Your Name)\"  You cringe as her grip was really tight, you cringe and tried to hide behind a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang nodded. \"Cute name, it fits.\" She explained and took a sip of her sunrise, she sees you blush and smiles at that looking you up and down, feeling as though she was sizing you up. \"So, I've never seen you around, new in town?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head. \"No, I just finally have a day off tomorrow, and decided to come for a drink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do you work?\" Yang asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't wanna know, just another white collared job that rarely lets you have any days off.\" You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang gave an apologetic look. \"Aww, I'm sorry to hear that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a huntress from Beacon.\" She said proudly as she took a sip of her sunrise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really that must be really exciting, beats my life by a long shot.\" You said honestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm\" Yang put a hand to her mouth. \"Would you like something exciting?\" She asked, and you can't help but detect some mischief in her tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah, anything beats my job.\" You say and sigh. \"But, this is the life I signed up for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang looked at me up and down and nodded. \"Oh, you'll do.\" She said, again I can feel her being mischievous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" You asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang finished her sunrise and grabbed my arm. \"Come on, I know how to make your life more interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" You ask as your dragged of your seat and out of the bar, you instinctively try to pull your arm back but her strength was just overwhelming, you wonder if all hunters are as strong. She then lead you to an ally where no one can see you, this is where you start to worry, as she looks around. \"Ok what's going on Yang?\" You ask unsure of this as she and you were the only ones here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang then looked at you and gave you a smile. \"Oh don't worry, I'm about to make this the best day of your life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" You ask not understanding this at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you know.\" Yang replied as she walked close to you, she then took a bottle and removed it's cork releasing a pink Dust. \"With this, you won't have the same boring life you hate so much.\" She says as she  waves the bottle on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey what *Cough* *Cough*!\" You began a coughing fit as you accidentally inhale the Dust. \"What is this dust?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup\" She said popping the P, she closes the cork on the bottle and crosses her arms. \"Now we wait and watch the magic happen.\" She said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Cough* \"What magic?\" You asked looking up to her from her chest level... wait looking up to her. \"Wait, are you taller than me?\" You ask remembering that you were the same height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang's grin turns into a full blown smile. \"If you think I'm tall now, wait till it's done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to realize what she meant as she grew taller, you were at her waist when you looked around to see other things growing around you, that's when you realized that no one was growing. You were shrinking! You look back up to Yang as she was wearing that same smile as you were shrinking, you were just below her waistline, then below her long black socks, then her boots until you were at her ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave off a look of astonishment, then terrified. You shake as you take an involuntary step back. \"Wh-what did you do to me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang giggled, which gave off an echoing sound to you since you were so small. \"I just granted your wish.\" She stated as she bended down with her hand going down towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake off your fear and turned to run, only to have a long bare fingers from a fingerless glove enclose around you. Your body was surrounded in her grip, only your head popped out of her fist. You were then lifted up pass her waist, her stomach, her chest until were at eye level with Yang, who was still wearing that smile. \"W-what's going on?!\" You panicked trying to shake in her grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shrunk you duh.\" She stated giggling as she feels you trying to struggle in her huge iron grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" You asked frightened of the giant sized (to you) girl holding you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww\" Yang cooed as she pet you with her large fingers. \"Don't be scared, I just wanted to help you make your life more exciting.\" She said in a soothing tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't move as her large fingers gently rubbed against your head. \"Please change me back.\" You begged in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No can do little guy.\" Yang replied. \"It was harding getting my hands on that dust, and plus you're just too cute to let go of.\" She replied with a wink. \"I think having you around will be exciting for me too.\"  You blushed when she said that unsure of what to think. She used her other hand to pull her yellow under shirt. \"Now in you go.\" She stated as she pushed you in between her boobs, she did so until you were securely in their save for your head, she stares down at you. \"Just wait till we get to our dorm, my roommates aren't home yet, which means we can have some fun.\" She winked at you again and let go of her under shirt covering your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang sighed and walked her way to Beacon. The young woman have been looking for a man to use this special shrinking dust on, but for the life of her couldn't find one that she'd like to take home with her, she needed to find someone who wouldn't be missed, and was to her liking, she found the perfect specimen. She looked down at you through the yellow undershirt. \"Look at the brihgtside cutie, you won't have to work anymore, you just have to hang out with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou here her, but struggled between her soft breasts, you can feel her heart beat. You were blushing as you were surrounded by a beatiful girl's fleshy mounds, you know you said that you hoped for something exciting to happen but you didn't have this mine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang giggles feeling your tiny struggles, she can't to play with him when she's home. </span></div></div>",

All of them are far from Beacon today, now to enjoy herself. She looked down at her shirt. \"Ok little guy here we are.\"  She said as she pulled her undershirt showing you in between her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up from your squishy prison to see the smile of your captor.  \"Wha\" You say as her hand comes to you and grabs you by the back of your shirt.

She has you trapped she may be the only one capable of returning you to normal size, but she also said she had roommates, maybe if you get away from her, hide until they get home you can reveal yourself and they can save you.

When she finds nothing she gets angrier. \"Come out right now!\" She yelled as she stood up to her height and began stomping towards the bed you were hiding under.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stomps she's making feel like short tremors to you, you hold on to the chair leg in hopes of not losing your footing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Boom!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold your breath hiding behind one of the bed legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Boom!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know she's crouched down next to the bed your hiding under and you don't dare look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang growls again and fails to see you. \"When I find you, your in so much trouble!\" The buxom blonde yelled as she stood back up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep yourself from sighing just in case she can hear you. You were starting to regret your decision, this girl was the prettiest you've seen but also the scariest when angered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang slowed her breathing to calm her self down and decided to do something about finding you. She sat down on the bed you were hiding under and pulled her boot off her right foot off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked to see her feet that are now bare next to her discarded boots wondering what she's doing. And then you cover your nose from the smell of her feet, as a huntress she probably trains daily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok!\" Yang yelled her voice sounding echoey to your small size. \"Look, I'm not angry right now, but I will be in about 3 seconds.\" She explained knowing your listening. \"If you come out, say your sorry and kiss my feet I'll let you off with a warning.\" She offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wants you to kiss her feet?! You can smell them from your hiding place why would you go near them?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang continued. \"But if you don't, I will find you and punish you!\" She finished. \"I'm going to count you better be kissing my feet before three.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened in panic, you didn't really think this through, if she finds you who knows what she'll do, maybe your better off taking her offer after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"1!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around trying to think of away, could you crawl under the door? No you couldn't, she's next to it, she'll see you before you could get to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"2!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to decide now, kissing her feet couldn't be that bad compared to her punishment. You make a choice.</span></div></div>",

Do you really want to go back to the old routine, away from this girl?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey shortstuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped thinking hearing Yang pull you back to the present. \"Yeah Yang?\" You looked to see half of Yang's face face that was happy looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang smiled and said. \"You can do my left cheek now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh\" You said as you stood up on the bouncy butt. \"Sure thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang smiled in gratitude. \"Thanks cutie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed and went to the next bouncy cheek. You sat on it and began rubbing it as you did the other. You were still blushing from all this, you've touched girls before but none at this size comparison. It felt good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoying yourself now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up to see Yang smiling at you and you looked at her trying to defend yourself. \"Yang I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang interrupted still smiling. \"I didn't say stop, keep rubbing, we'll do something else after your done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and went back to rubbing wondering what she'll make you do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
