There was no way you would or even could clean her enormous sandals and feet with just your tongue. Your thoughts were interrupted by Tsunade's big toe being placed on top of you. She wasn't applying enough pressure to cause you any pain but it was certainly close enough to give you a good whiff of her nasty smelling feet as well as make you feel uncomfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However if you stress me out even more rather than help me relax than I won't hesitate to crush you\" Said Tsunade.

Despite only going to the second stage the effect was perfect, Hinata yelped in pain and raised her foot holding it in her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy raising her foot Hinata took the pressure off of Naruto just enough so that he was able to escape. Jumping off of her sandal Naruto took off running for a big bush. Close behind him Hinata yelled \"Bad pet!!\" and started chasing him. Being tremendously bigger Hinata caught Naruto and held him in her palm. \"That was a very stupid move, I think you outta be punished... </span></div></div>",

He couldn't help but wonder if she was under the effects of a genjutsu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait Genjutsu, thats it!\" Naruto screamed, he realized that there was no way Hinata was like this so that meant she was being controlled via genjutsu. At least thats how Naruto interpreted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForming a hand sign Naruto charged at Hinata, focusing all of his and the Kyuubi's chakra into this one attempt.

Naruto felt himself back up, sweating profusely in multiple areas, \"Was I wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening her mouth to speak the gigantic Hyuga seemed to start replying yet before so much as a sound escaped her lips her expression changed dramatically. The anger, the evilness she wore vanished in an instant, and Hinata's face was kind and gentle once more. But it was like this only for a moment, the next instant she toppled backwards with her eyes closed, she was unconcious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a mixture of worry for his friend and happiness about being right Naruto ran up to the massive girl's face, not even thinking once about the repercussions if Hinata were to say....roll over onto her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for the knucklehead Hinata didn't do this, her body was almost deathly still. The mental comparison caused Naruto to freeze in his steps, could Hinata be dead? He had to find out, he wasn't aware as to why but he felt tremendous rage at the thought of Hinata dying from a genjutsu, even more angry than one should be with a comrade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning to the girls neck he sighed in relief, at his size he could hear it, Hinata's pulse. The happy moment was short lived as a poof of smoke appeared mere meters away. A girl in a black trench coat with red clouds stood directly behind Hinata's body, her feet on either side of the girl's face. Every nail this woman had was painted black, her hair seemed to be a sort of blackish blue almost like a bruise. The girl was one Naruto recognized, Konan, the only female member of Akatsuki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph, such a shame. She seemed to be having so much fun, I'm sure over time both of you would have come to love the situation.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sandal clad foot Konan turned over Hinata's face, \"Such a cute girl, why would you ever deny being at her feet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoaring in anger Naruto whipped out a kunai, \"Why would you control her like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling slightly Konan shrugged, \"Control? You missunderstand. What that was....was sort of a fantasy of the girl's. A passing thought that she originally ignored yet somehow remembered even years later. All I did was amplify the feelings behind the fantasy, and leave a scroll with a shrinking technique nearby of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto tossed the kunai at Konan's big toe, at its size the kunai bounced off as if it hit a solid steel door, \"Cut the crap! You manipulated her into doing that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Konan shrugged, \"I suppose if you must think of it like that yes. But I did have a purpose, my orders were to effectively capture you, but I say have a little fun first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fun?\" Naruto repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.......</span></div></div>",

They all looked at the tar like swap around them and braced their selves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One the count of three. One... Two... Three!\" They each took a bit... and then it was over. One by one the clones all gagged, Some even dispelled on the spot. Each the one vanished the memories all came flooding back to the original. One by one the vile memories of the smell and taste hit him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all too much to handle and Naruto passed out on the spot. Alone, face first into the gooey mass. If he were still conscious he would have gagged yet again. Perhaps it was for the best that he was out cold. His dreams were the only things that would provide him peace.</span></div></div>",

Hinata's foot was effectively at his size a continent in essence, the toes were the equivalent of mountains, and the toejam: villages. None of that mattered now as each of those things were 'upgraded' so to speak. Hinata's foot went past continental into straight out planetary, her toes now rivaled continents. Her toe jam were the long lean built mountains, and the wrinkles of her foot were now the size of Konoha village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese mental comparisons floated along Naruto's brain as his shrinking came to a halt. His spot on Hinata's toe cleavage gave way and he plummeted, actually into one of Hinata's infinite wrinkles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar above, possibly galaxies in distance Hinata laughed. \"Wow, you're so small and yet I can still feel you! I can't even begin to imagine how small you are; to actually fall through my toe jam and into a wrinkle on my perfect feet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You call this perfect!?\" Naruto blurted aloud, taking solace in the fact it was impossible for Hinata to hear him in any way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a lust filled smile Hinata pondered what to do with her toy....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hinata pondered on the situation. Naruto, the toughest ninja in the world, was actually in her toe jam; at his size, it must have looked like a whole new world. Then, it struck her: a whole new world. Giving a mischievous grin, she wrote a letter to the whole village to meet her at the center of town. Wrapping the messages, she placed them on a dozen carrier pigeons, and decided to go on a small trip to the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this meeting for?\"<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I have better things to do.\"<br>\r\n\"Who sent the letter?\"<br>\r\n\"Where is Naruto?\"<br>\r\nAll of the villagers of the hidden leaf mumbled and were getting restless. Then, Hinata appear in the crowd. \"Attention, everyone! May I please have your attention!\" The crowd quited down until the air was filled with silence. Then, they made a circle around her. <br>\r\n\"Hinata, what is the meaning of this?\" Tsunade scowled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone,\" Hinata addressed the crowd, \"as you might know, the Akatsuki are waging a war against us, and the rest of the ninja world. It will be known as the third great ninja war. There will be many deaths on both sides. Madara, who is the leader, is doing this so he can compete his project of his vision of \"world peace\".\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However,\" she continued, \"I can not let that happen. I will not let you all die.\" The crowd applauded her. \"It that all you called us out here for?\" Sakura asked bitterly, crossing her arms. Then, Sakura laughed in a cruel manner, gazing at Hinata. \"I mean, what is it that you think a foolish girl like you can accomplish? All you show is weakness. You, are, nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata, a tear rolling across her cheek, grinned. Jumping high and away, she cast a chakra sign, and the paper bombs exploded. However, they weren't your ordinary bombs as they didn't explode, releasing gas instead. Before anyone could react, everyone, except Hinata, hit the floor, out cold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLanding back on the ground, Hinata used her shrinking technique on the whole village and turned on her byakugan. She placed the villagers one-by-one in the toe jam that Naruto currently resided until everyone was accounted for. Pushing her hair over her shoulder, Hinata smiled. Then, she headed to the outskirts of the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n(5 years later)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout her travels, Hinata had shrunk millions. Whenever she met anyone that annoyed her, such as a bandit trying to rob her, she would shrink him, and wink at his form as her foot slowly descended, crushing him. To those she met, she offered them a choice: either die beneath her feet, or join the world that she had created between her toes. Most people died, but she didn't mind. She wanted the most loyal of populace living between her toes. Did she ever feel regret crushing unwilling victims beneath her soles? Not at all. After all, she was creating world peace. Also, Madara's so called 'invincible' army didn't look so invincible after she flattened them. The ninja world should be thanking her for her good deads. Sighing, she continued walking on a stone-paved path, doing whatever it took to achieve world peace, and in essence, to become a true goddess.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She sighed, stopping and sitting down by a nearby tree. She took off her sandals, and wiggled her purple toes playfully. She smiled at them, knowing that Naruto and the whole village would be safe between them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one side effect that she didn't know she possessed until recently; for every person between her toes, she gained a fraction of their chakra and power. She could sustain her byakugan longer, and farther. She felt more force between her attacks. Her reaction time and agility had improved significantly. This phenomenon shocked her, but she knew that it would be necessary later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned in closer to the gap between her biggest and second-biggest toes on her right foot; that was where the Hidden Leaf Village lied. Then she started coughing and leaned back, pinching her nose between her fingers. \"Wow, my feet really smell horrible.\" She felt her face heat up, blushing a full shade of red. \"Sorry, but it has to be this way,\" she stammered, \"This is the only way you'll be safe\" She looked at the sky. \"I will protect you Naruto. I will protect everyone.\" She gazed at her feet once more, scrunching them. <i>Well, at least they look pretty</i>, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put her sandals back on and continued her journey to the Land of Lightning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Raikage sat at his office, working on paperwork when a messenger broke through the heavy doors out of breath. \"Raikage! *<i>heave</i>* I *<i>heave</i>* have *<i>coughing</i>*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Raikage stood up, scowling. \"Spit it out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe messenger took a deep breath, and then out. \"Sorry. There's a report for you. It's urgent.\" He held out a scroll. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bah, let me see that,\" he took it in jest, opening it. \"What could be so important that you must interrupt me?\" His eyes skimmed through, his brow furrowing. \"No, no, this cannot be!\" He stared in bewilderment at the messenger. \"Warn Bee immediately. Tell him to stay hidden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, sir, I-\" Before he finished his sentence, the Raikage had already left at lightning speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata looked at the pile of bodies in front of her. \"You guys weren't so difficult, now were you?\" She sighed. \"All I asked was to see your leader too.\" The villagers of the Lightning Village shrieked and cried in terror. At that instant, the Raikage came forth, and the crowd was relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the meaning of this\" he asked venomously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you came. I was just asking these gentlemen where you were, and they weren't so courteous to me. Is that how you treat a lady around here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You,\" the Raikage gasped, \"You are the rogue ninja of the Hidden Leaf! The one I've heard stories about!\" Then he grinned. \"There's a generous bounty on your head, you know. A notorious ninja that's been searched for far and wide by nations all around. Would be a shame if someone were to collect it.\" As he said this, the ground shook as he powered up. An aura of electricity filled the air. His lightning release armor had activated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata took her stance, activating her byakugan. She began casting the signs for the shrinking jutsu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Raikage grinned, and at an instant, disappeared. Hinata bit her lip. <i>He's fast</i>, she thought, <i>I need to be able to focus on him</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know who you are dealing with?\" the voice boomed from all around. He came behind Hinata and sent a strong kick, sending her to the ground. \"I am the fourth Raikage. No one has ever surpassed my speed. No one.\" Then he disappeared again at a flash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata winced, then got up. She rubbed her eyes, and refocused. She could see the chakra flowing around her like a whirlpool. He was running circles around her! <i>This guy really is fast.</i> She closed her eyes, and listened, waiting. Then, at a split second, she activated her Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Raikage was struck, and was propelled towards a building. His back made contact and caused a huge dent. He got up and scoffed. \"Not bad. But not good enough.\" He wiped his hand against his mouth, and charged at Hinata with a barrage of fists. Hinata used her gentle fist technique to counter, but to no avail; his speed outmatched her, and Hinata was struck with a sharp kick to the stomach, sending her to her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you were tougher than this.\" he mused. He kicked her again, sending her sprawling several feet away. \"I guess I was wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata coughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are no shinobi,\" he continued, \"you are a weak, spineless, pitiful girl. A fugitive who has caused the disappearance of many people in the Land of Fire. And for what, I know not, but it is an injustice that shall be resolved by my hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked towards her, the sound of his steps becoming more and more definite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have walked to my village and slaughtered my people. What has happened to the Leaf Village is none of my concern, but what has happened today is unforgivable.\" He came near her. \"I do not care of money. No, I care for justice. The price of their lives should be fulfilled right here, right now.\" He raised his hand, and charged it with electricity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distance, a voice was heard. \"Bro!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Raikage looked up. \"Bee? Is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBee appeared beside him. \"Yeah, it's me. I came to check on what was happening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata groaned, and looked at the blurred scene in front of her. Their voices were distorted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bee, I told you to stay at the temple!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't help if I'm curious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bee, you need to follow what I say, when I say!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata quickly regained her senses, and acted quickly. Reactivating her gentle fist, she hit the chakra points of both of their legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were dazed in shock, and with just enough time, Hinata casted the shrinking jutsu. Both figures shrunk to 1 inch and were unconscious. Getting up, she looked at both of them. \"Who's the tough one now?\" The villagers stood there, appalled. Hinata smiled at them as she took off her sandals. A dark, sweat stained footprint was printed on each of them. \"This,\" she shouted, \"is what happens if you anger your goddess.\" She took both Raikage and Bee and put them each on the dark stains of her sandals. Then she lifted her feet and inserted them into each sandal. She could hear crunches, then felt their bodies collapse and become a smushed, gooey mess on her soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She glanced at the crowd again. <i>What shall I do with them?</i>, she wondered.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sorry.\" She began casting her shrinking jutsu as the villagers ran away in terror, trying in vain to escape their fate. They were seized fear just as an antelope runs from a lion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, we like to think that we are the drivers of our own destiny. That we choose the paths in the roads of life. However, the villagers fail to realize that this is inevitably false; they do not choose. The goddess chooses for them. Just as an engineer chooses whether the bricks will be used for the construction of the White House or just an ordinary shack, Hinata would choose the fate of these people. She had a plan, an ambitious plan, and she would stop at nothing to achieve it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe roar of the crowd began to dwindle until it became very soft, then silent. Using her Byakugan, Hinata could sense the chakra of those of diminished stature. They were invisible to the naked eyes, but she could sense them, if faintly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a scroll out of her pocket and laid it out on the ground in front of her. It was a forbidden scroll she had found in the deep confines of the Hidden Leaf's Great Library. She took off her sandals again, inspecting them; Bee and the 4th Raikage were utterly unrecognizable. In fact, they only resembled as unknown, dark red liquids that blended in with her foot sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took her finger and ran it against each of their bodies. Then, she landed her finger right on the middle of the circle on the scroll. She drew carefully, knowing that a single mistake would ruin everything. After a bit, she had finished. The letters were drawn, and the scroll sparked to life with an aura of electricity. This aura expanded out to the diameter of a mile. When it reached this point, the scroll returned to being an unanimated objected. Hinata surveyed the ground once more, and the faint traces of chakra were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat again, exhausted, and looked at her feet. She could see the little bits of chakra between her second and third-biggest toes on her right foot. Hinata smiled gleefully. Finally, she was closer to fulfilling her promise to Naruto! No more fighting, no more war, no more pain. The Land of Lightning would finally know everlasting peace, just as the Hidden Leaf does. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around, eager to share this news. However, all she felt, heard, and saw was silence. She sighed as her gleeful jubilance slowly transformed into an expression of blue. She hugged her knees, continuing to glance into the depths of nothingness that surrounded her and filled the inner confines of her soul. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at her feet once more, examining the toe jam that lie between each of her toes. She let her mind wander into what it must be like for the Hidden Leaf and Lightning villages that resided within. Vast, purple horizons as far as the eye could see. This jam would be their whole world, where they would spend the rest of their lives. It would shelter them from the harsh realities of lives from before. Was this, as critics argue, not a new home to keep out these realities, but a world that was made to keep in those who dwelled there? Would this new place redefine the individual, asking who they really were, reshaping their hopes, dreams, and ambitions? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they would look at the purple skies above, would they be able to fathom that millions of miles away lie other villages? That those villages lie in wedges between toes that were measurable in light years? From Hinata's toes to the tip of her head, their minds wouldn't be able to conceive the amount of time it would take to travel such a feat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata scrunched her toes again. In between them lied the dream of the Shinobi; the land of opportunity and peace. Hinata smiled again, just thinking about it. <i>I'm making dreams come true!</i> she thought to herself aloud. <i>The dreams of Naruto, of myself and the village!</i> She blew a kiss to her toes, and got up. She put on her sandals, in which Bee and the Raikage had become one with Hinata's foot sweat. They had become completely absorbed into the foam layer of her sandals. To the observer, there was no color of red now; there was only a dark, sweaty footprint on each sandal with no traces of disturbance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata packed her scroll, and headed down the stone path without looking back. She hummed to herself sweetly as she continued on her journey. She got out a pen and her list as she walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Land of Fire</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLand of Lightning<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made the changes as necessary, and looked again at the list. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Land of Fire</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Land of Lightning<br>\r\n</span><br>\r\nLand of Frost</span></div></div>",

Her long, chocolate brown hair was done up in a practical style of two Chinese-style chignon buns, one on either side of her head with them parted by a space between them in the middle so that they resembled the ears of a panda or a cartoon mouse to keep it out her face when she was fighting, and her forehead protector was around her forehead with the spiral arrow symbol of the Leaf right in the center of her forehead and framed underneath a fringe she had of a few strands of hair being used like bangs. Her eyes were the same shade of brown as her hair. Her style of dress was also more traditional, consisting of a pink, sleeveless, Chinese-style blouse with three strap-up buttons on front, while the blouse showed off her lean arms. She also wore a pair of Chinese-style, deep, dark, olive green pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it were anyone else he'd have flat out stated  that he hated this and wanted to be returned to his normal size, but the weapon-girl was different. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww...like that Love?\" Tenten purred mischievously, enjoying what she knew was going to happen as she confessed her true feelings to the pipsqueak blond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?! YOU LOVE ME?!?\" Naruto shouted in sheer shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette nodded. \"Yeah....I love you. What's wrong? the rest of the girls like Sakura, Ino and Hinata were right about me being too much of a tomboy to like a guy?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto snorted \"Tomboy? Hardly. You're just as feminine as Sakura or Ino, but the difference with you is simple: What defines you is the fact that you're a shinobi rather than a fangirl. You're the best Leaf kunoichi of our generation, and they can't accept that, but they know it's impossible for them to reach your level, their trying to knock you down so you're on their level instead. Rise up to match the competition's level or knock them down so they fall to yours, it's the same difference as far as they're concerned. You became a kunoichi for all the practical reasons and did it all because YOU CHOSE IT FOR YOURSELF. You didn't do it just to drool over how addicted you were to slobbering over someone's ass. They see that as a threat since they can't understand that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten blushed even redder this time. That was the sweetest bit of encouragement she'd ever gotten. As she mused that over, she remembered something she wanted ONLY NARUTO TO KNOW!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know tiny\u2026if you can promise to keep this a secret, I\u2019ll show you something I can do. Deal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever this secret is, I promise I won\u2019t tell a soul!\u201d Naruto announced with pure conviction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made the panda-themed girl smile. Taking a deep breath, she focused and it begun\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stared at her. Awed as the changes took place. He had to confess that for some reason, this look just suited the girl he was being stroked by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten's eyes had turned blood red and when she opened her mouth to yawn, it was possible to see that her canines were slightly longer than her other teeth and were pointed. Her skin turned a pale bluish color, almost a blue-gray while her fingernails turned pitch black and sharpened into claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten's outfit had also changed, it now consisted of white socks, black slippers, loose blue trousers, a long-sleeved blue tunic with gold cuffs and a red, high-collared sleeveless overtunic with gold trim. A wide gold sash/belt kept the overtunic in place. Tenten also wore a red Mandarin-styled hat topped with a gold ball and trim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kekkei Genkai that allows me to become a Jiang-Shi at will.\" The weapon mistress said before any questions were asked. She had a look of longing in her red eyes as she gazed at the shrunken boy. The same look she had ever since she witnessed to battle between the blond and Neji at the Chunin Exams. Ever since she first witnessed the power, the strength and that succulent red chakra the he emitted, Tenten was determined to make Naruto hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe recognized the red chakra he emitted back at the Chunin Exams as demonic chakra. That would need some looking into, but for the most part, Tenten didn't care. The demonic chakra meant that Naruto was either part demon or had some kind of connection to a demon. And Tenten had her suspicions, especially if some of the snide remarks some of the villagers sent Naruto's way were any indication, but she couldn't be sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now my little one\u2026what do you think?\" Tenten said before opening her maw, a long tongue reaching out for a moment before it slithered back into her open mouth. Blinking for a moment, Naruto then shivered slightly, was it just him or was that tongue just a little too similar to Orochimaru's\u2026?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould have done without the Orochimaru-class tongue\u2026but wow\u2026just wow\u2026why haven\u2019t you shown this to anyone?\u201d the starstruck Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since I lose my human chakra network when I activate turning into Jiang Shi, I need to draw upon the living world around us. Breathing would allows me to draw natural energy in and keep me...extant. There are some power-hungry Jiang Shi in China that have taken Chi, the Chinese term for chakra from living people in the past. They left their victims as empty, lifeless husks. That's what those who embrace the Po' do. It\u2019s the demon that resides in all Jiang Shi. It lurks within their minds...I'm no exception, I've got a Po' living in my mind too. The chakra and natural energy I take can both sustain it and contain it. To embrace the power the Po' can bring, however, is to lose my humanity...something I refuse to give up. Due to the Po', I'm always hearing whispers in my head when I transform into this state. Subtle cries to skewer babies and let their blood drain into pools filled with corpses. Images of walls made from the decapitated heads of fallen enemies...stuff like that filling my mind. The precise torturing of innocents for nothing more than the act of torture itself. Visions of being at the center of it, covered in blood and slowly transforming as if the blood was a cocoon and doomed to transform into a beast too vile to allow existence among the living. But if I don't use my Kekkei Genkai, the Po' is absent from my mind as if it never even existed. If I were to embrace the Po', draw from its power and become a demon myself...welll...you get the idea on what has to happen then since the thing makes me so much of a danger...\" she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto cringed, this Po' thing that TenTen had to deal with sounded TOO much like being a Jinchuriki for his taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\" Tenten frowned, having noticed the look \"What's with the cringe?\" she asked with suspicion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to help rid you of your Po' forever Tenten, I can't bear the thought of someone precious to me having that kind of nightmare twisting them into something so foul.\" Naruto answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette giggled, Naruto really was much too sweet...then again, she liked that about him. The weapons mistress of the Hidden Leaf Village had to confess there was just about Naruto that stuck out compared to other guys she knew. Never before had she ever felt such a strong magnetic attraction to a boy before, she knew that this boy was different somehow. It was like a magical pull and she was absolutely spellbound. The fact that he had more than enough chakra to kill the Po' by over-feeding it was a bonus to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, Tenten grabbed Naruto with her thumb and forefinger. Tenten gave him a wink, beaming at her love interest. Still in her Jiang Shi form, Tenten headed home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly to Naruto, Tenten lived alone when they got there and she headed to her bedroom and shut and bolted the door before covering up the crack at the bottom of the doorway. That done, Tenten kicked her shoes off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl looked at the Fox-Vessel thoughtfully. \"Now what to do with you now that your mine Naruto? I suppose I could have a foot-fun marathon with you seeing as how much you liked my big toe by itself earlier.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Foot-fun marathon? What's that?\" Naruto asked. Tenten thought about it, she could use a few of her current ideas for Naruto and his new size in that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...we could enjoy a nice kick-filled game of soccer, have a dance-off against one another,  I could resume rubbing you with my feet if you give me a foot rub afterwards, I could use you to floss between my toes, I could use you as my toes' stress toy and use them to squeeze you, you could lick my toenails clean and kiss all over the rest of my feet, I could rub you between my feet, I could grind you underneath my heels to give you a back rub that way and all shoes and slippers could use a good licking clean before I transform you into a pair of sock and wear you non-stop for a full month...does that answer your question?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pale blue-gray skinned Jiang Shi laughed in delight as Naruto paled, of course that was sidetracked when he noticed how cute this Jiang Shi-version of Tenten looked when she laughed hard enough to close her eyes, her mouth open wide enough to see her fangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...ready sweetie? I've made my choice.\" Tenten said to him as she got control of herself and took him out of the cage and set him down in front of her bare feet.</span></div></div>",

After giving the first lick Naruto thought to himself that Tenten's toes didnt taste so bad, of course they were sweating after a walk home but it seemed to be the only drawback of taste. Smell on the other hand wasnt as pleasant. It wasnt too harsh at first, but soon Tenten started wiggling her toes, what made the stench of sweat very intensive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten was very happy with her new pet-friend, she put him on the other foot, and started thinking about what should they do next. Maybe she could make Naruto clean her shoes from the inside or force him to paint her toenails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would look cute painting my toenails\" she giggled after saying this outloud.

Just from the clothing and hair alone Naruto knew who he would be looking at, and sure enough once his gaze went high enough he found himself looking into the light blue eyes of Ino Yamanaka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since Naruto returned from his training with Jiraiya everyone he knew in his youth seemed to have changed, Ino seemed to be one of the more minor changes. Her blond hair was a bit longer, and styled just enough that her right eye is covered. She ditched the bandages she wore around her thighs but in return she now wore a longer skirt. And of course, Naruto noticed her cup size had increased a bit too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough her eyes weren't locked onto Naruto Ino spoke up, \"About time you're awake Naruto, I was getting tired of waiting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe  little blond ninja showed clear signs of confusion, \"I.....but.....how?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"New jutsu.\" Ino stated blantantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno broke her gaze away from whatever she was looking at and looked directly at Naruto, who was pinned beneath her big toe. \"Just wanted to have some fun.\" She giggled slightly with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto wasn't amused, he had half a mind to start using Rasengan all over the place but he held his temper, \"Okay you had your fun, now return me to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore responding Ino burst into laughter, finding something amusing. \"As if! You think that was the fun I was talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a gulp Naruto instantly begun picturing various tortures that Ino would have done before he left, he didn't know how much she had changed over the three years so there was no telling what could happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to use me like some sick sex toy aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno spat in Naruto's general direction, \"You wish! I'll have you know its nothing perverted.....unless you're into that kind of stuff that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That stuff?\" The knucklehead repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno nodded, \"Think about it, where are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all fell into place instantly, Naruto couldn't help but blurt out what he came to, \"Your feet?!\" Ino nodded without a hint of regret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup! You'd enjoy my breasts, butt, hell even my mouth! Plus this is kinda nice, having the power to crush you like a bug with nothing but my big toe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was about to threaten her until he heard the bit about crushing him, gritting his teeth he remembered that he didn't really have much choice here. He fell silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno playfully smirked and bent over, looking at him all the while. \"Aww give up? Accepted it?

She should have finished her eight mile jog around the village and I bet she'll just love to see you like this!\" Naruto gulped loudly, Ino was eyeing him like a predator would their prey. He had no choice in this matter and he knew it well. On the bright side Sakura was a medic and might be able to help him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno stood back up to her full height and began the trek to the house of fellow kunoichi, Sakura Haruno. Pinned under Ino's big toe, Naruto could only lay helplessly as he succumbed to the pressure of Ino's toe against his body. As he stared up at the sky above known as Ino Yamanaka, he began to envision Ino as a beautiful goddess; in Naruto's current situation, she was literally a heavenly colossal goddess compared to the tiny ninja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk to Sakura's was a relatively short one, Ino would arrive there in about five minutes, but she did make sure to 'warm' Naruto up to the best of her abilities in those five minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you think my feet smell bad, are sweaty, or too tough for you than think about this! Sakura just finished an eight mile run and wears boots even as she does it!\" Ino teased the small Naruto, giving him a wave of fear as she walked to Sakura's, making sure to apply extra pressure for her toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 5 minutes had elasped, Ino arrived at the Haruno household, Naruto safely snuggled beneath her toe. Grabbing the handle on the door to Sakura's house, Ino opened the unlocked door to the house; Sakura had just returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Sakura,\" yelled Ino. \"Where are ya? I got something you need to see!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over here!\" Sakura's voice came from down a hallway. Not wasting a second Ino arrived at the room the voice came from, Sakura's room. She didn't even bother to knock and just let herself in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura was laying on her bed, \"Where's the fire? Something big happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno smirked, \"Not something big per say, little yes.\" With that size joke Ino lifted her big toe up, and used her slender fingers to pluck Naruto from beneath them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura's jaw dropped, \"Is that Naruto?\" Ino nodded once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did he get like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A new justu I made up recently,\" answered Ino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What have you been doing to him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, until I came here, I was using him as an insole for my big toe. My feet are now his new home for all eternity.\" Ino giggled again as she reveled in the power she held over the miniscule ninja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a silence, for a moment Naruto thought Sakura would save the day, but that idea died the instant she grinned. \"Well if feet are going to be his home for all eternity why just yours? How about mine too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno jumped up and down like a little girl. \"Perfect! He can be OUR little foot slave forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome!

Ino spent the rest of the walk home not acknowledging her toy, hiding his existence from all of the numerous people surrounding her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne moment Naruto would feel a rising sensation, almost as if Ino was removing her toe from his body, but then it was quickly replaced by a thunderous step that applied even more pressure than before onto his meager frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 7 minutes after she started walking, Ino fianlly arrived at her house. To the tiny Naruto, he was relieved that the constant fluctuation of pressure from Ino's foot had temporarily stopped as she unlocked the door to her home. Once the door was open, however, Naruto's reprieve ended as he was subjected to fluctuating foot pressure once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a step into her house Ino carefully removed her sandals, taking extra care in keeping Naruto pinned beneath her big toe during the process. Neatly she placed the two blue sandals in the corner beside her door and began heading towards her room. Before she did however, she took a precaution to ensure Naruto wouldn't get lost she repostioned him, still at her feet but now the young ninja was firmly tucked between the kunoichi's toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This'll hold you until we get to my room, my little Naru-toe-toy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto attempted to escape but was unable to fight against the strength of Ino's toes pressing against him. This futile struggle only reminded Naruto of how small he really was; even with his 3 years of ninja training with Jiraiya, he could not even take on a kunoichi's toes at his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning Ino took yet another step, Naruto felt the rising sensation like before buy luckily for him since he wasn't under Ino's toe he didn't experience the crushing sensation again. Soon Ino arrived at a flight of stairs which undoubtedly led to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the utmost grace the kunoichi began almost gliding up the stairs, at that moment although Naruto wouldn't ever admit it. From his point of view Ino looked like a beautiful goddess. Within seconds Ino arrived in her room though, shutting the door behind her and turning the lock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGently walking towards the center of her room, Ino began to sit down on the floor and moved her legs so that her feet were stretched out in front of her. Playfully wiggling her toes, Ino shook Naruto off of her foot as he swiftly fell to the hard ground below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, little man, you're all mine now,\" Ino said ominously. \"By the time I'm done with you, you'll never want to leave my feet and you'll worship me as a beautiful goddess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Why don't we play a game of 'Crush the Bug'?\" She slowly started to rise from the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing the idiot he was Naruto failed to see the threat and tilted his head to the side in confusion. \"Never heard of it.

Remember the game is 'Crush the Bug'\" She began to raise her sole again as Naruto finally understood the game and its rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSame as before Ino lowered her foot at unreal speed, Naruto barely escaping it. The shockwave alone sent Naruto flying away a few feet, which would equal several hundred yards to him.

In essence, she now truly was a goddess to the tiny ninja; invincible to everything, titantic in stature, and possessing beauty unrivaled by any other woman.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno quickly stood up to her full height and stomped on the miniature Naruto before he could get very far, pinning him beneath the sole of her right foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silly Naruto,\" said Ino with disappointment prevalent in her voice, \"you simply can't win against me.

Remember my name well, my worshipper...I am Goddess Ino! Now, shout my name to the heavens and proclaim your eternal devotion to me and my feet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no other options available to him, Naruto's spirit was finally broken as he gave in to the blonde girl's demands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All hail Goddess Ino,\" he mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" asked the goddess. \"I can't hear you! Louder, my humble worshipper!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, his mind now completely rewired after succumbing to Ino, was destined to please his goddess at any cost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All praise Goddess Ino!\" he shouted. \"May the goddess forever reign supreme! She is more beautiful than Tsunade could ever dream of being; the wisdom she possesses makes omnipotence seem trivial; her power is unending as she continues to grow stronger; and her divine feet, the symbols of her goddesshood, are beyond perfection. Her judgment is supreme, and everyone should worship her heavenly form for all eternity!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno smirked as she realized she had acquired not only a permanent foot-slave, but a loyal subject that would worship her for the goddess she was always meant to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's better, Naru-toe,\" said a satisfied Ino. \"However, for your earlier insolence, I must punish you to make sure your lesson has been learned...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a simple giggle, Ino focused her mind on the miniature Naruto and lifted her foot off of him; another second later, the already tiny ninja began to shrink even further. Naruto stood back up and watched proudly as his goddess grew larger and larger before his very eyes. Naruto continued to dwindle faster and faster, the blonde girl's feet occupying more and more of his vision by the second as she became more and more beautiful to him. After a full minute since the process had began, Naruto let out a slight whimper as he had finished shrinking; he had wanted his goddess to make him shrink into oblivion, but she had obviously taken pity on her only worshipper. Before Ino had enacted her punishment, Naruto was about as large as her big toe; now, after a massive reduction in his stature, Ino's pinky toe alone was as large as the entire Fire Country in size. To Naruto, Ino was now truly a perfect goddess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My punishment is complete!\" declared Ino. \"Now you see my power! Now you see the glory of Goddess Ino! This is only a fraction of my true size, but you now see how much stronger your goddess is than you. Never again shall you disobey me, or you shall see the true wrath of Goddess Ino!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes my goddess!\" shouted an excited Naruto as he dropped to his knees and began to pray to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat shall Goddess Ino do next?</span></div></div>",

Jiraiya's frog stomach jutsu all over again?\" As soon as he says this he feels a force that launches him forward to taste the dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looks up and sees someone very familiar, the only female Jounin of the entire leaf village, Kurenai the genjutsu specialist. Naruto asks \"Kurenai? What the--why are you so big?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai looks down on the small holder of the fox demon and says \"The Hokage has given the order for you to be shrunken down.\" \"What!?\" screams a shocked Naruto. Kurnei quickly comes down and grabs Naruto and wraps her fingers around him forming a fist with his head sticking out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have dangerous enemies Naruto and because of this the Hokage decided it would be for the best if you're kept at this size. You see it will be easier to keep you in check and it will make it difficult for people such as the Akatsuki to find you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeginning to struggle in her fist Naruto says rather angrily \"But I have to find Sasuke!\" Kurenai's look remains sharp as she says:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a reason as to why I was appointed the task of handling you and that's because I can use my genjutsu to keep your nice and obedient.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looks at the sensei in disdain and says \"Like that's going to--\" Naruto stops in his tracks and sees Kurenai's eyes beginning to shine. No doubt a genjutsu is coming. Naruto isn't completely a rookie at dealing with genjutsu seeing as how he's dealt with Itachi, but still Kurenai's genjutsu might still be difficult to ward off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is the outcome of Kurenai's attack?</span></div></div>",

Naruto lands on the insole and hears the sensei say:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I have no choice, but to use a more stringent tactic to keep you in place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looks up only to see Kurenai's foot beginning to descend into the sandal. Naruto not being a fool runs, but as soon as he is nearing the edge of the sandal he falls down. He feels something weighing him down and no doubt it's Kurenai's gigantic foot. He feels the foot ease up a bit and then out of curiousity Naruto turns around while on the insole only to see Kurenai pushing her foot down onto his body so that his head is poking out from between her big toe and her 2nd toe. Kurenai's toes naturally smell a bit seeing as how she's a ninja who has to keep if only a little active. Feeling mad Kurenai declares towards the boy she has at her feet:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto, get ready to feel some force.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai takes her first step and Naruto feels the massive weight pressing down on him due to the ball of her foot. He tries to use his hands against the ball of her foot, but it's useless the most he can accomplish is a little bit of wiggling. The hot sun is also beginning to make Kurenai sweat as she continues her walk, though the question is where is she headed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walks Naruto needs to time his breathing so as to exhale his air supply whenever her foot presses down on him. As he twists his head at an angle Naruto sees that Kurenai's headed toward the Hokage's office. No doubt Tsunade will ensure Naruto stay at this size for who knows how long. Suddenly Naruto feels a bit of a sliding motion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" escapes Naruto's lips. Naruto proceeds to say \"The sweat is making me slippery...\" If Naruto uses the sweat as a lubricant and times his actions right he could escape from under Kurenai's foot. However now that he's discovered this potential escape tactic he could also take this chance to talk to Tsunade and if things don't go his way he could escape at any time he feels like though it might lead to Kurenai being angry and maybe hunting him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Naruto decide to do?</span></div></div>",

He regretted his decision \u00a0NOT to use the sweat as a lubricant to escape from under Kurenai's foot, but the thought of what would have happened if things didn't go his way and Kurenai being angry and maybe hunting him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, above him, Kurenai was thinking about what she was going to do with Naruto. Then she stopped, smiled, and plucked Naruto out from under her foot and she placed Naruto in one hand before unsealing a jar that she normally used to mix healing salve in. Placing Naruto in the glass bottle, screwed the lid on and poked some holes in the top with a senbon, Kurenai grinned at Naruto darkly before she started to shake the jar violently, and Naruto smacked his head against the side of the glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0He was just so... CUTE! She just wanted to put him on display!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You aren't getting out of there at all...I'm going to keep you forever, and ever and ever!\" the red eyes woman wearing a bandage dress cackled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Kurenai \u00a0turned away from the direction of the Hokage tower and made her way home, much to the diminished boy's horror.<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0<br>\r\nWhile Kurenai's apartment wasn't necessarily big, it had a homey feel to it. White carpet, white walls, a cream colored couch against the wall with a table in front, TV in the corner and a baby's crib near the child proof window. The kitchen was connected to the living room, making it one big room and seemingly bigger than what it really was. The tiles in the kitchen were an olive green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting the jar and its occupant down on the counter, the woman smiled at the sight of the little one inside it. Naruto pounded fruitlessly on the glass, but it wasn't any good and he was reduced to watching helplessly as Kurenai prepared herself a quick microwave dinner and sat down in front of him. After taking a few bites, she casually swallowed then spoke to the whiskered boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now...unless you want to be squished or eaten or something like that, Naruto, there won't be any talk about what I 'can' and 'can't' do out of you, will there?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerrified, Naruto shook his head. \"No ma\u2019am,\" he said, trying to be as respectful as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai nodded, satisfied. \"Good. Now let's cut to the chase: now that you're here, Naruto, you need to make a choice.\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A choice?\" Naruto repeated, perplexed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Jonin-ranked kunoichi nodded. \"Yes. As to who you'll have as your new owner. As you know Naruto, I had a baby..a daughter, as it turns out. I\u2019d need a babysitter for when I'm not around...And she'd ADORE you. Or I can keep you for ME!\" Kurenai said, grinning with a coy deviousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking past the adult woman, Naruto fearfully looked at the sleeping figure in the baby crib.\u00a0The child had black hair and was wearing a simple yellow kimono with blue trimmings, held closed by a simple white sash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shuttered,  being given to Kurenai's child would almost certainly end in his death, either drowned, obliterated, or just plain eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill...being kept by Kurenai wouldn't be fun or easy either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...which of us would you want as your owner? Tick tock, little one.\" Kurenai sing-songed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuttering, Naruto blurted his answer without thinking.</span></div></div>",

Slowly he began to remember what had happened before he passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke was in the leaf training grounds practicing his jutsu and such to further improve himself. The training doll looked no different from the numerous others there but Sasuke visualized it as his brother Itachi whom he swore to kill. Using his chidori the avenger as Sasuke called himself lunged at the training doll and annihlated it. Sasuke repeated this with another training doll. He had now done his two chidoris but Sasuke attempted a third. His hand chirping loudly and glowing like electricity Sasuke lunged at yet another doll but felt a sharp jab in his side and fell down, the Chidori slowly dieing in his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is what Sasuke could recollect but this didnt explain his current situation. He was tied up and tossed into a sort of blue prison which held an unusual shape to it. Something like an arch above him but open everywhere else except the ground. Strangely it reminded Sasuke of something he couldnt quite place. The outside of his unusual prison was pitch black all around. Just then a thunderous voice echoing all around him said \"About time youre awake my little cute Sasuke!\" A light suddenly burst out of the darkness and showed a new form appearing in Sasukes sight. He was shocked to see himself staring at a gigantic...</span></div></div>",

The answer to that was a resounding 'yes', but at this moment the answer was a deafening 'no'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heir of the Uchiha clan could feel the tears threatening to appear as he continued to lick Ino's toejam clean, as horrible as this was there was no way he could stop now. Disappointing the purple-clad girl would only lead to worse punishments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno smiled as she crossed her arms, her tiny slave was doing a great job so far. She could just barely feel his little tongue against her skin while he licked her foot clean. It served him right for lying to her face. Hopefully this experience will kill any future disrespect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm!

That meant she had no reason to punish him again. Good, considering his taste buds would never be the same again. He would never forget the foul taste of Ino's feet for as long as he lived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was finally finished admiring her feet, Ino carefully bent down to scoop up her special slave.

Now I'm gonna go take a shower and in the meantime you're going to be a good little foot slave and rest up until I get back, okay.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Sasuke nodded dumbly.

As Sasuke passed Temari's kneecap, something odd happened to him: Suddenly, he was drained of all his chakra! With no time to react, Sasuke fell to his death below onto the floor of the Leaf Village's famous ramen stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, this can't be it!\" Sasuke thought to himself as he plummeted to the ground below. \"I can't die like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke closed his eyes to accept his death and landed on solid earth, blacking out upon impact. About a minute later, Sasuke regained consciousness and slowly opened his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I...am I dead?\" Sasuke said groggily. \"No, somehow I'm still alive. Where am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around at his surroundings, Sasuke realized that the ground he had fell on was not IcchiRaku Ramen's hard concrete floor; instead, Sasuke had landed on a large, soft, flesh-colored surface that stretched out before him in every direction and had broken his fall upon impact, saving his life. Upon examining the new ground even further, Sasuke quickly deduced his current location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! This...this can't be!

Sasuke felt dread building in the pit of his stomach. Even if his sharingan was active he doubted he could've followed her movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was finally done, Sasuke found his world changing. From inside the sandal he could see the outside world expanding around him. His eyes widened in horror as his brain put two and two together. He was shrinking again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was nothing he could do as the sole of the sandal began to stretch on further and further. The grass outside looked to be as big as the trees in the forest of death. And Kurenai\u2026 Kurenai's size trumped even Orochimaru's snakes. She was enormous. So much so he could no longer see past her ample bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the shrinking was over, it the sandal alone looked like it doubled, maybe even tripled in size. Kurenai could only smile now. Watching Sasuke shrink for the second time was more appealing than the first. If she had to guess his current size he was no more than an ant. Maybe slightly bigger, but not by much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked on in glee as she had to squint her eyes to make him out amongst the sea of black that was her sandal. Feeling nothing but contentment, Kurenai carefully plucked her prize from her footwear and brought him up to her face. \"It would appear you loose, Sasuke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke was beyond scared now. Kurenai's crimson eyes alone were eclipsed him. He tried to scream, anything to hide his fear. But the lack of reaction to his words on the giantess's part told him everything he needed to know. She couldn't hear him anymore. The size barrier was too great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing this his heart sank. If she couldn't hear him then that meant no one would. She could do anything she pleased to him and nobody would be the wiser. Not even Naruto and Sakura would be able to find and help him. He was completely at the Jonin's mercy. Just like he was with Itachi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai smirked as she watched the fight slowly drain from her prey. \"What will I do with you now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While shrinking him to the size of ant seemed punishment enough, his arrogance alone guaranteed he needed something a bit more harsh. The only question was what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke for his part was scared beyond reason. Just what did Kurenai have in store for him now that he was the size of an ant? He knew for certain he didn't want to find out. Thinking quickly he maneuvered himself just enough to reach into his pouch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last loyal Uchiha pulled out a kunai with a paper-bomb tied to it. He threw it a one of Kurenai's large fingers and hoped for the best. If this works he could get free and use his skills to hopefully not die from the fall. If it didn't work, then he was utterly screwed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe miniature kunai stuck to kurenai's skin, not that she noticed and the bomb began to sizzle. As it burned like the wick on a candle, Sasuke prayed and hoped for the best. The paper-bomb exploded, and much to Sasuke's shock, Kurenai's skin wasn't even scratched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis planned had failed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings only got worse from there as Kurenai eyed the Uchiha with clear anger. \"Did you just try to attack me again?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever pointless the attack was she still felt it. Based on the brief flash of light it was clear he tried to use a paper-bomb kunai on her. While she'd give him an A for effort, He'd get an F for effectiveness. His stubbornness knew no bounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you honestly believe that would work? Did you honestly believe you had a chance against me? You are nothing! An ant! You're not even worth the dirt from under my nails!\" Kurenai ranted before pausing. The dirt from under her nails? WaitT Yes! Yes! That was it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke stared silently at the giantess before she gave him a wicked smile that struck fear in the pit of his soul. Whatever was going on in the woman's head was nothing good for him. He then felt his world shift as the giantess took a seat on the ground. What on earth was she doing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should thank you little Sasuke. Thanks to you I've finally come up with an appropriate enough punishment for a looser such as yourself. You should feel honored though. Most men would kill to be in your situation right now.\" The giantess shifted her right foot closer to her which left Sasuke feeling ill. Was she going to crush him? As if reading his mind the giantess answered. \"No Sasuke I'm not going to crush you. But you are going somewhere special. Somewhere only someone of your stature could go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke didn't like the sound of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai smiled. \"I hope you like the world from under my toenail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke's eyes widened as big as saucers. Under her Toenail! She was going to stuff him under her toenail like dirt! Nononononononononono! This wasn't happening! This was a bad dream! This had to be a nightmare! Kurenai giggled to herself before using her free hand to peel back the skin on her big toe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke could see the fleshy abyss she was trying to send him to and struggled with all his might to get free. Her couldn't. He could do nothing to stop Kurenai from lowering him down. The first thing to hit him was the smell. It made his eyes burn. She couldn't drop him in there. She just couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So long.\" she whispered. Then she let him drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke screamed at the top of his lungs as he fell into the bottomless abyss of flesh. Kurenai then released her hand, trapping Sasuke in place. The heat and pressure was unreal. It was worse than being under her foot or in her sandal.  He couldn't move an inch. All he could do was endure. Endure the heat, pressure, sweat, dirt, and smell. What had he done to deserve this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. I can't even feel you right now.\" Kurenai said aloud. \"You really aren't worth the dirt from under my nails.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her mission complete for the time being, Kurnai stood up and placed her foot back in her sandal. She gave her right a good stomp before heading off. What she planned to do for the rest of the day she didn't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was neither a home,nor a closet but in fact a cave, and even more disturbing was the fact he was literally tied up and placed within a gigantic sandal. Topping it all was the female voice he heard, turning his head Sasuke saw the amazingly tall one and only female Akatsuki member Konan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping forward from the cavern entrance Konan walked to Sasuke, wearing an unusual smile as she dragged her bare feet along the ground. \"I hope you like feet Sasuke, Lord Pein recently gave me the fun task of torturing you. He even went as far as to teach me this shrinking technique and give me some ideas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGritting his teeth it all began to click for Sasuke, of course Akatsuki would try to remove him from the picture especially with his relation to Itachi. Although the method with which they're doing it is definitely unique, Sasuke knew he had to escape, but even at his normal size he would have little chance of escaping Konan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill walking towards Sasuke the blue haired Akatsuki seemed to read his mind, \"Don't even bother escaping, try it and you will be crushed. Behave and all you'll have to do is a little foot worship, don't worry I'm sure my feet and their sweat taste just wonderful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's mocking me\" The Uchiha gritted his teeth in annoyance, if it weren't for the restraints Konan had around him he would have lunged at her instantly with a Chidori.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally coming before the young ninja Konan planted her feet on either side of Sasuke's sandal prison, placing her hands at her hips as if she was striking a pose. \"What shall I do? Putting on my sandal would suffice as torture but it's just so boring, don't you think so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Bite me) Sasuke would've said it aloud but Konan gagged him along with tieing him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging Konan smiled slightly, \"Not that your opinion matters because I just decided.\"</span></div></div>",

She shakes her sandal and Sasuke falls down into the dirt. He looks back and sees the giantess sitting on the ground with her legs forming a circle with Sasuke in the middle. Konan slips her sandal on and says \"Are you ready to die?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke's first instinct is to run, but how can he? He's tied up and at a diminutive size to boot. Plus even if he could Konan's massive legs have him surrounded. Feeling utter frustration Sasuke thinks \"It makes sense for why she's doing this. By killing me now, she ensures I can't disrupt Akatsuki's plan in the future!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonan's smile from before disappears leaving a focused expression on her face. She moves her legs so as to have Sasuke in between the soles of her sandals. Seeing the obvious intention doesn't save Sasuke as Konan's soles quickly come at him and sandwich him. Konan begins to apply pressure on the tiny Uchiha. To Sasuke this experience is nothing he's ever felt before. While he's obviously in pain what makes this a unique experience compared to other wounds an average ninja would suffer is the added element of humiliation. The thought of being defeated by the feet of a woman is something that can hurt one's pride. Combining physical pain and emotional pain was a truly ingenious tactic by Konan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Crack*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke hears this sound and its no surprise that his bones are beginning to reach their limit. The pain from his recently broken bones came from his rib cage. Despite the successful amount of damage that Konan has inflicted her focused look does not falter in any way. Focusing more on Sasuke's lower body parts it doesn't take long for her to successfully break his legs. Feeling like wanting to scream does Sasuke no good as he's gagged, but non the less he tries his best and loud muffled cries of agony are heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly enough the pressure eases up. Sasuke feeling horrible pain is barely able to keep his eyes open to see what's coming next. Konan removes the soles of her sandals from Sasuke's small form and picks him up and deposits him in the palm of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's....next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSays the wounded Uchiha. Konan continues to form a fist around Sasuke's body leaving his arms, shoulders, and head sticking out. With her other hand she grabs Sasuke's right arm in between her thumb and index finger. She begins to move it back and forth gathering a slight momentum and soon enough she bends Sasuke's arm all the way back breaking it at the elbow which forces him to scream yet again in agonizing pain. Not wasting time, Konan does the same to his other arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonan eases her grip on Sasuke's body and with her free hand reinserts his arms inside her hand's hold leaving only Sasuke's head sticking out of her fist. Konan's other hand comes around the one holding Sasuke and proceeds to aid it in crushing him further. Sasuke's mind is in despair as he despises the pain that's consuming him at the moment. Suddenly he hears Konan say:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now it should be simple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke barely conscious says sounding concerned for his own life \"What...does she mean...?!\" Konan's hands open slightly while they hold him from from side to side. Letting gravity do its work, Sasuke slides down at the base of the palms. Momentarily Sasuke feels his body being pierced from his back  lifting him up to the center between Konan's hands. Blood begins to leak out of from his new large wound. In a matter of moments many sharp white spear like objects shoot out of Konan's hands coming towards Sasuke. The spears successfully pierce Sasuke's body multiple times painting themselves in his blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling his life fading fast Sasuke thinks to himself as he understood Konan's tactic \"I...get it...\" After these words the tiny avenger passes away. Konan crushed his bones masterfully ensuring he didn't leak out a single drop of blood until the climax of the entire process, this was her plan. Konan continues to remove her hands, but keeps the spears piercing the shrunken Sasuke's body separate from her own. Looking at her handiwork she sees the deceased body of Sasuke being pierced from multiple sides and angles and his blood staining her weapon, her sharp paper body parts. Konan's expression doesn't change as she says:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should take the body back to lord Pain as evidence of Uchiha Sasuke's death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, Konan picks up the twisted ornament that she made and begins to head back towards headquarters. This is the end of Sasuke Uchiha, defeated in both body and mind by a determined and cruel woman.</span></div></div>",

I'll clean your sandal now. Please remove your foot from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTemari shook her head and wagged a finger, with her eyes closed like she was upset. \"Afraid you made a few mistakes in that sentence Shikamaru. First off mam isn't good enough, Im either goddess Temari, mistress Temari, or something along those lines. Next up its sandals not sandal, you're doing both. And lastly never tell me what to do, I'll have you know I never had any intention of removing my feet from my sandals. You'll just have to crawl under my feet and lick my sandal from beneath my sole. Normally I would punish you for these mistakes but I am kind, if you start immediately I will forgive you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(God she loves to talk,) Shikamaru muttered in his head, always being level headed Shikamaru knew he had no choice in this matter so he had to play it as best he could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a defeated sigh Shikamaru said, \"Sorry Goddess Temari. I apologize for my foolishness. Allow me to get to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Shikamaru ran to the edge of Temari's sandals and against his wishes he began to lick. The taste of old worn leather,foot sweat, and dirt was enough to nausiate Shikamaru to nearly cry; of course being a 'man' Shikamaru didn't do this but he sure as hell could have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if the task wasn't degrading enough every couple minutes Temari would toss a comment, \"Don't forget beneath the sole of it. Hope it tastes good. This is the best thing ever!\" Comments such as that that expressed her joy along with a domineering aspect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru licked all around Temari's sandal, beneath the treads, and even the strap but now came the worst and most degrading part of all, the insole of the sandal. As she had said Temari didn't remove her foot from it, the only movement she made was wiggling her toes with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out another sign Shikamaru slid from the sandal strap directly between Temari's second and third toe. Upon arrival Shikamaru wasted no time in getting on his knees and licking the leather before him, feeling a sense of fear at the mountainous toes surrounding him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the sandal tasted bad before then this was straight out horrid, as these were Temari's only sandals the leather was filled with more sweat than ever along with her body oils. To worsen the ordeal Temari's feet let out a faint odor, something not really noticable to someone normal sized but to Shikamaru it smelled like hell on Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he persevered and at last came the worst part of the job, crawling beneath Temari's sole and licking the leather there.

Bending downwards, Temari picked up the sandal with her right hand and positioned the sandal on a 45-degree angle, causing its miniscule passenger to hurdle towards the wooden floor at an alarming rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" Shikamaru thought as he quickly placed his arms around his head, bracing for impact. With a loud thud, Shikamaru's body made contact with the floor, suffering only minor injuries and no major damage to both his head nor any major organs. Slowly regaining his balance, Shikamaru's vestibular system returned to its full capacity as he stood up once again, watching as his \"goddess\" returned her foot to her sandal. Wiggling her toes in glee, Temari smiled as she felt the familiar comfort of her sandals embrace her soft foot once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now,\" Temari said slyly, \"for your goddess to ascend ever-further!\" Without warning, the blonde kunoichi threw a shuriken at the ground, landing exactly 1 inch away from Shikamaru. To the insignificant genin, it was as if Temari had just thrown an entire mountain range at him and purposely missed killing him. The impact from the shuriken caused the ground to vibrate wildly for the small ninja, knocking him off his feet yet again. As Shikamaru tried to stand back up, he began to feel an incredble drowsiness overcome him and his body began to rapidly shut down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...did you...do...my goddess...?\" Shikamaru mumbled before passing out on the wooden floor, his will now somewhat broken by Temari's unique tactics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rest, my tiny foot-worshipper,\" Temari proclaimed, \"for when you wake, you shall see the full power and beauty of Goddess Temari and the only true perfection in this world: My glorious, sexy, wonderful feet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 3 minutes later, Shikamaru slowly began to regain consciousness. Upon obtaining his full vision once again, Shikamaru was mortified, yet for some reason utterly aroused and pleased, at the sight before him.</span></div></div>",

There was another change but not one Jiraiya could quite place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinished her job Tsunade again slid her foot into Jiraiya. Instantly mocking him, \"I bet you're wondering why I did that. The noses are for you to thoroughly enjoy my feets smell. The eyes are for those looks of fear you have when my foot approaches. And lastly I altered some things, the sandal you are is basically your tongue! From now on whatever the sandal touches you shall taste, meaning the dirt on the ground and my feet!\" Tsunade let out an evil laugh at her ploy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpset beyond belief Jiraiya cried, for the first time in years, realizing his fate would now be nothing more than a sandal effectively utilized to worship Tsunade at all times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd this never changed, years even decades passed at the situation remained the same. Consistent licking and smelling of Tsunade's feet every second of every day. Utilizing her jutsu Tsunade appeared young until the day she died, but the trauma didn't end there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Tsunade's will she left her 'sandals' to her apprentice Sakura, who vowed to wear them all the time in memorial of her Master, not knowing they were in fact the long since declared dead Jiraiya. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter his first decade of so as a sandal Jiraiya truly accepted his fate, willingly worshipping Tsunade's feet and when Sakura came along he continued, until the day came when Jiraiya's sandal body withered and aged away to nothing, finally giving him the peace he lusted for all the years.</span></div></div>",

Can't take my wittle stinky piggies?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sakura stared at Ino's approaching barefeet, completely bewildered by the sight. She was an amazing shinobi, capable of great techniques but...at her size Ino's feet...just their odor alone seemed like breathing in a toxic gas; Sakura already began feeling light headed and dizzy and there was no doubt that Ino was just beginning. Ino couldn't be truly blamed for the whole foot odor and sweat though, Kunoichi tended to have such traits due to their very physical life styles, hell Sakura herself had to shower several times a day to keep her own feet tolerable, but Ino...seemed not to share the obsession. Sakura grimaced as she saw the glistening beads of foot sweat on Ino's soles, either they were big enough or she was small enough but Sakura could see her relection in them, it was horrifying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove Ino giggled, \"Like it? I went on a nice long jog before you woke up just so things would be perfect. Get a good luck Sakura, either you're gonna give up on Sasuke or this is going to be your life forever more. Just to become a pet to my feet, basically dirt to them. I personally don't want that given our history together but if you keep going after Sasuke I will make you a footslave. Now, tell me Sakura, will I have to resort to that or will you do the smart thing and give up right away?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWearing a disgusted frown Sakura reexamined Ino's massive soles, which stopped just as her big toe was about to graze her. The sweat, the smell, the dirt,toejam....Ino was basically saying give up on Sasuke or join that filth. As a girl Sakura was immediately tempted to say something like \"Please don't do that!\" But it was a different matter with Sasuke....she loved him and girl's never give up a guy they love easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bring it on Ino-pig! Your stinky feet have nothing on my love for Sasuke!\" Sakura yelled triumphantly, prepared never to give up like a true shinobi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant blone clicked her tongue and shook her head in disapproval, \"Sigh, Sakura...you really underestimate the power of a Kunoichi's feet. Last chance, are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You underestimate my love!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spoken like a true fangirl.\" Ino sighed, kicking her foot forward the extra few inches and pushing Sakura back like a bug. The collision surprised Sakura and knocked her from her feet, just as the pink-haired girl rose back to her feet Ino already did the finishing move, she clenched Sakura between her big and second toes, face first. Instantly the sound of Sakura's muffled speaking was heard, accompanied by the ticklish sensations of her breath along Ino's foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura was in absolute hell, as much as she was angered to admit it Ino was right about her underestimating the girl's feet. Before the smell was toxin-like but now...up close....it had probably gotten ten times worse. Plus Sakura's face..no her entire body was being squeezed between Ino's toes and into her toejam. Sock lint, blown away dirt and grass, crumbs, the toejam had its on consistent build up and it seemed soon Sakura would be joining it. It took amazing self control for the girl not to gasp for air and unknowningly gulp down foot sweat and toe jam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno laughed at Sakura's torment, the torture she was feeling...it practically sent a vibe out to her and Ino loved it. She purposely hadn't taken care of her feet for days just for this chance, this retribution. And seeing Sakura along with her toejam gave the kunoichi an idea, with a single finger Ino gently brushed along Sakura's back, almost enticing her before pushing her deeper into the toe cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gotta be an actual part of it to be considered toejam Sakura! Let me help you fit in with your kind...\" Ino sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore when the whole toejam foot sweat thing was bad, Ino's action made it far worse. Before Sakura was basically face to face with it, barely touching it, but now...she was a part of it, <i> inside </i> it. Even if Ino now released her the various substances served as a prison, constricting and keeping Sakura in place. Sakura couldn't fight it anymore, finally she took that desperately needed gasp for fresh air, and in that moment of weakness the worst parts or Ino's feet began entering the girl's mouth. Combinations of footsweat, lint and toejam worked its way into the Kunoichi's mouth until by sheer the Ino's sweaty toeflesh basically plugged Sakura's mouth shut, sweat still pouring in but nothing else but regardless it seemed like a blessing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had at best been a minute and already Sakura was reconsidering her statement about Sasuke before, was the boy who showed no interest in her at all really worth this? Risking it just so she might end up as toejam...Ino's toejam? The smug ninja never showed interest in her anyway...was it really worth it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ino..please...I give up...you can have Sasuke...\" Sakura whimpered through the next assaults of toejam and sweat. \"Just..stop..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno giggled evilly at the suffering girl, \"Sorry Sakura, one time deal. You're in for life.\" Just looking at Sakura made Ino a little wet. Already the girl's clothes were stained beyond the point of fixation, her clothes would be a permanent damp dark color from sweat, would forever smell like feet and be twice as heavy with the already absorbed sweat. Not to mention Sakura herself, in mere seconds that perfect pink hair was stringy, messy, covered in various toe gunk, and probably falling out already. And her skin...Sakura looked pale as a ghost, maybe she was scared, maybe she had somehow been bleached from all the sweat, Ino didn't know but she did know one thing, this was how her slave would look and in all honesty...she liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMockingly the giantess poked her other big toe between her toes, at Sakura, \"Don't have too much fun Sakura, remember you have a whole nother foot. And a whole lot more toe cleavages too, it's only gonna get better...\" Ino felt what seemed to be Sakura vomiting, but she wasn't angry...no...Sakura was her toejam, nothing more. That thought seemed to make any action on Sakura's part insignificant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura....\" Ino cooed, \"Guess what it's time for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura didn't even want to guess...</span></div></div>",

'This idea is just too perfect!' she thought as she stared down at her trembling slave, still helplessly trapped between her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's time for you to clean my pretty feet for me.\" The blond Goddess spoke as though she were asking Sakura for some tiny, insignificant favor. \"Just lick up all that nasty gunk like a good girl, ok? Make sure you do a good job too... I think someone might have thrown up a little down there. *giggle*\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny girl's eyes widened in horror as she heard her captor's words. She had no idea Ino could be this cruel, even to her! She was too scared even to try and plead with Ino for mercy. All she could do was fight her urge to cry out (knowing that more sweat and filth would find it's way into her mouth if she did.) and struggle to free herself from the sadist's toes / toejam. By then Ino had become disappointed with Sakura's initiative however, and decided to scare a little more obedience into her new pet. 'She does look cute when she struggles so desperately like that, as least.' Ino put her cruel thoughts aside and focused on the task at hand... or foot, rather. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrunching her toes a little tighter to get a good grip on Sakura (which also caused a tiny squeak to unintentionally escape the poor girl, further gratifying Ino's lust for power over her.). She then rapidly shook her foot, causing Sakura great torment. She had only shaken her foot three or four times but the effect on Sakura's scale was extreme. The tiny kunoichi felt like she had been hit by a truck, and if she hadn't just recently vomited she would have now. Her body ached and her vision was blurred Her head felt like it was about to split open. As she recovered from the shock her body had gone through from the rapid jerking motions of her childhood friend's foot a new kind of fear filled her. She was nothing compared to Ino now. She had remained uninjured until now but Ino had already, and with virtually zero effort, reduced her to a shivering coward, completely soaked with her foot sweat and covered in her toejam as well as her own vomit. She would have started sobbing at her pathetic state but was far too scared at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno however, was absolutely glowing. She hadn't expected to have this much fun treating Sakura like this. She certainly didn't expect to have this much fun seeing Sakura like this. She saw Sakura craning her neck to look up at her, her tangled hair that was matted with filth hanging over her eyes... eyes which Ino could still make out the look of complete terror deep within. Her whole body trembling in fear of what she could do to her. It sent a delightful shiver down Ino's spine. She needed more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? Aren't you ready to be a good girl yet?\" Ino said in an almost seductive voice, further fueling Sakura's fear of what she would do to her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shizune nearly gagged when she realized where she was; between someone's sweaty toes! Along with her body nice and smushed beneath the arch of this person's foot, she couldn't have been more than an inch or two tall! Natural instinct made Shizune start to work her way free; but against the much bigger, and, sad to say, stronger foot nothing was coming from it. Except perhaps grabbing the attention of whoever owned it. Shizune couldn't see the person, past their knees everything seemed hazy, but she did know it was a girl...simply due to the fact she was blocked a view of the woman's face by two mountain sized breasts. The outfit she wore seemed familiar....but Shizune couldn't quite place it despite it being quite obvious...maybe the pressure of this woman's toes was messing with her head a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it became very clear when the woman bent over and grinned at her; \"Hey there Shizune! Liking the view?\" Anko teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Anko was far from the best person to find Shizune shrunken the ninja couldn't help but feel relieved, it was a friend who found her at the very least. \"What happened? And why am I between your toes? It's sweaty down here!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant kunoichi smirked and leaned over with a hand on her ear, \u201cWhat\u2019s that tiny? I can\u2019t hear you!\u201d Shizune sighed and screamed her message again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow able to hear it, Anko seemed slightly surprised by the question; \"You don't remember? Huh, I guess the jutsu may have clouded your memory a bit. Anyway; I found a scroll at one of Orochimaru's lairs. Lady Hokage didn't like the looks of it and wanted to test it out to see if it would pose a threat to the village, you protested and ended up doing it yourself. Next thing we knew, you were out cold and shrunk right out of your clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Anko explained it Shizune did start to recall, as well as feel the embarrassment of being naked at Anko's feet. Her hands rushed right up to cover her chest as she blushed. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t at least get me some doll clothes?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnko shrugged, \u201cCouldn\u2019t find any small enough, not unless I ripped something up\u2026Besides not like you were gonna need em, my feet will keep you plenty warm. We\u2019re all girls here anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune agreed with that last part, didn\u2019t make her remove her hands though. \u201cWhy am I at your feet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnko made the scariest smile, \u201cLady Tsunade\u2019s orders. She said you weren\u2019t getting enough action as a ninja, were starting to get rusty. So she wanted me to whip you back into shape while she finds a way to cure you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHOW IS THIS WHIPPING ME BACK INTO SHAPE?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more Anko shrugged, \u201cEh, way I see it. At your size tending to my feet will be a full time job. You\u2019ll be ripped with muscles by the time I\u2019m done with ya; plus it seemed like fun when the Hokage mentioned it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSHE GAVE YOU THE IDEA?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnko moved her toes ever so slightly, just enough so that her big toe would be on Shizune\u2019s face. Her muffled struggles ticked her, and she had a playful image in mind of her sweat seeping into Shizune. It was kind of a turn on actually. \u201cNow now\u2026quit being so surprised. You\u2019re a ninja, act like one. Until you calm down I\u2019m keeping my toe on you.\u201d It was obvious Shizune hated the idea, whereas Anko seemed to love it; but soon the shrunken kunoichi calmed down. Anko couldn\u2019t resist pouring some salt in the wounds, \u201cGood, now kiss my toe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was muffled by her toe by Anko heard very clearly what Shizune said, \u201cWHAT!!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you want my toe off you, kiss it. Come on, as far as stuff Ninja\u2019s have to do this is a piece of cake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune groaned; but gave a small peck, hoping it would suffice. Lucky for her it did, Anko didn\u2019t want to break her too fast; so she removed her toe and gave Shizune a chance to breathe in her foot odor again. Compared to direct contact with her toes, it was heavenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnko grinned at the gasping form between her toes, this was gonna be fun on her end. \u201cAlright; now it\u2019s time for your next training session.\u201d Shizune didn\u2019t like hearing that, but how bad could it be? Anko wouldn\u2019t hurt her, what was the worst she could do? A foot massage? That was nothing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoy was Shizune wrong; Anko had a very harsh lesson in mind. \u201cAs you are well aware; in rough missions us Ninja\u2019s may have to scrounge for food in harsh environments. You take what you can get without fail. Right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune nodded, \u201cRight\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo let\u2019s practice that, in this lesson. My feet are the environment. You are to search them for food.\u201d Shizune uttered a word of protest but Anko wasn\u2019t done, and her louder voice toppled hers. \u201cI know it sounds harsher than scrounging in a desert or something, so I did you a tiny favor. I stepped around barefoot in the dirt some, rubbed my socks along my feet, and even squished some stuff between my toes. There\u2019ll be <i>plenty</i> for you to eat! I would think the drink is obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune did not believe her ears, Anko wanted her to eat dirt and god knows what else off of her feet? And drink her sweat?! Her response was clear \u201cAre you out of your mind!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnko did not take kindly to the insult, and tightened her toes, \u201cDon\u2019t question the teacher little girl. Do as I say or else, I will squeeze my toes so tight you would beg for what I\u2019m offering, and I\u2019ll tell Lady Tsunade you\u2019re being insubordinate. She\u2019d surely let me keep you like this even longer. Now\u2026<i>what</i> do you say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mood swing startled the tiny medic, she sounded certain that she would hurt her if Shizune crossed her. It took a moment for her to say something\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It has the power to shrink anyone, but women have special authority over its effects if they are strong enough.\"<br>\r\n\"So...I'm strong enough,\" Anko said, noting her slightly increased size.<br>\r\n\"Indeed.

Currently he was seated in his lair awaiting the return of his loyal followers, hopefully the mission he sent them on would be a success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he waited on his throne for good new, the sound of footsteps filled his ears. It was then followed by a loud knock at his door. Finally something was happening that would relieve his boredom. \"Enter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors opened to reveal one of the subordinates he'd sent out earlier. A smile made it's way to his face before quickly falling. Where was the other servant he sent out? \"Lord Orochimaru.\" the servant bowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is Kabuto.\" The snake asked,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of his experiments required attention and he went go see to it.\" The servant answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made sense. It wasn't the first time one of Kabuto's little personal project stopped him from immediately reporting in. At least his most loyal followers wasn't captured or dead. That would be a huge loss. There was nothing more upsetting than the loss of such great talent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrochimaru grinned \"I understand. Tell me, were you able to retrieve what I ordered?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe servant smirked before producing a black scroll from behind their back. The snake couldn't be more pleased. A successful mission could always brighten his day. He was in front of his servant in less than a second and took the black scroll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... With this my power will grow exponentially! Good work.\" Orochimaru praised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I live to serve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrochimaru was so caught up in his good fortune that he'd failed to notice his follower's hand signs. Before he knew it, the black scroll began to glow, and his entire world went white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snake grunted as his vison was obscured but didn't have to wait long for the light to fade. When it did his vision was blurred. He walked around aimlessly calling for his servant until he bumped into something the knocked him flat on his back. He growled as he stood up and his vision finally cleared. Anger went through him as he realized he'd been felled by a wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe placed his hand against the wall and felt it's smooth rubbery surface. That wasn't right. The walls here were made of stone. Something was amiss here. He then cranked his head up and as he did he felt himself go paler if that was even possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't a wall... It was a giant black sandal!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis subordinate's sandal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's the view from down there?\" They grinned,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrochimaru was seething. \"You...\"</span></div></div>",

At speeds that would rival even the Flying Raijin Jutsu, he found himself dangling before the face of Tayuya of his sound ninja four.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead grinned as she watched her downsized master struggle for freedom. She couldn't believe how weak and tiny he was now. He had to be at least an inch in height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it looks like the Anaconda has been reduced to a teeny little garden snake.\" Tayuya teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrochimaru was not pleased. How dare this little brat taunt him! He was Orochimaru! The man who would inherit everything! He was immortal, a god. This runt had no idea who she was dealing with. \"Listen to me you little brat! Return me to normal or suffer the consequences.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTayuya chuckled. \"Is that supposed to be a threat shithead? I don't think you understand your situation right now. You've been defanged. Your all talk and no venom. Completely at my mercy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I warned you.\" Orochimaru put his hand into a familiar seal. Once he activated this girl's curse mark she would rue the day she crossed him. He channeled his chakra and waited. After a few seconds he realized his subordinate wasn't coiled in pain. \"What's going on here?! Why isn't the curse mark working?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You clearly weren't listening earlier. You've been defanged, dumbass. Because of the black scroll your chakra network's been disrupted. You can't activate any curse marks.\" Tayuya explained. \"Like I said before, you're completely at my mercy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't good. Orochimaru was only now beginning to understand his predicament. He couldn't rely on his jutsu to get him out of this. As loath as he was to admit it, his little North Gate had outfoxed him. \"Do you really think you'll get away with this? My followers will know something's wrong and they'll come for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's the last thing you want. You see your loyal followers aren't as loyal as you think. You rule everyone through fear. What do you think would happen if they found out you've been weakened like this? They'll turn on you like the venomous snakes they all are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrochimaru's eyes widened. She was right. They would turn on him given the first opportunity. And if she threw him towards the prisoners being held in the pens... or worse, The Hidden Leaf Village. He shuddered. But wait, he did have one or two true loyal followers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kabuto will come for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see.\" Tayuya ginned. \"In the meantime I think it's about time we had a little one on one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound ninja used her free hand to retrieve the scroll before walking over to her former master's throne. She pocketed the black scroll before taking a seat. Her boss's chair was surprisingly comfy,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, I've served you faithfully for a long time and yet I don't get the feeling you appreciate my dedication. I think it's high time you gave me my due and show me your appreciation, worm!\" With narrowed eyes, Tayuya unceremoniously deposited the sannin to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrochimaru couldn't believe this, at the mercy of a damn brat who's not even on his level. How revolting. At least he was freed from her grip. Cautiously the snake sannin rose to his feet. Now that all his senses seemed to be in order he could now make out just how much of a size difference there was between them. She was massive. Compared to her he was nothing more than a bug. And by the looks of her feet her pinky-toe could dominate him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnacceptable!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there was a loud clap that caught his attention. \"Now then, you're going to show me your appreciation by giving my feet a nice long massage. After all they do get very sore from running missions for you nonstop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTayuya kicked off her left sandal which landed dangerously close to the sannin. The impact alone sent him careening to the ground. It was as if he was back in the third great ninja war and someone had just dropped a bomb by him. He looked back up at the girl's bare foot and recoiled. What was that foul odor?! Was it coming from her foot?! It must be. Did this girl ever shower?! The smell was putrid. It was even coming from the sandal next to him. This was vile. She demanded he massage that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNO WAY!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if I refuse?\" he dared asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe look on her face turned predatory. \"If you refuse... Well, that's a secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrochimaru was sweating now. What could he do?</span></div></div>",

Once he did however, he would make sure to put this girl through the most dangerous experiment he could come up with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. It would seem you have me at a disadvantage.\" Orochimaru sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTayuya smirked. \"Damn right I do. Now get to work. And if you do a good job I might just reward you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrochimaru grit his teeth at that, how dare she act so arrogant and carefree towards him. Forget experiments, he'd kill her on the spot. With that in mind, the snake sannin made his way through the vile stench to the redheads foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe closer he got the more foul the stench, it was as if he'd some across a skunk carcass. It burned his eyes and he could swear it was seeping into his clothes. He would have to make a mental note to burn them later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he finally reached his destination he made not of how much taller her toes were compared to him. He really was a bug to her. It was then he also noticed in addition to the smell her foot was sweaty and a traces of dirt had stuck to it. This was disgusting. So much so he was tempted to just make a break for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? What are you waiting for, worm? Get to work.\" Tayuya ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith growl in his throat, Orochimaru did as he was told. He carefully approached the pinky toe since it was the smallest and began to go to work. The moment his hands met flesh he nearly gaged. The skin was surprisingly smooth, but it also stank and was slick with sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wanted to stop, but knew doing so would make his situation worse. He was a shinobi, that meant he could endure. All he had to do was think of this as a mission. He never failed missions. Not when they were important anyway. He survived a war and hunter nin, he could survive this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp above Tayuya groaned in relief as she felt her miniscule master working his magic. She couldn't remember the last time she had a foot massage... come to think of it, she never had a foot massage before. If this is what they normally felt like than she would have to go see a professional one day. Tayuya made herself more comfortable and continued to enjoy the feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack down below Orochimaru was spewing out silent curses. He had finally made his way yo the middle tow. Over and over again he kneaded the sensitive flesh of his giant subordinate and did everything with his power to make sure she felt it at his size. This task alone had left him disheveled and covered in sweat. He even had the leftover remnants of toejam settling into his hair. Even if he washed with bleach he would never feel clean again. This girl was the she-devil in human form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually he made it to the second toe and began to massage that. It was so difficult with his chakra disturbed but he managed to make it work. He'd lost track of how long he'd been doing this, probably for a while her surmised. Still it was odd to see no sign of Kabuto or his other followers knocking on his door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight as that thought crossed his mind he heard a very faint sound reach his ears. Was he hearing things? There was no way anything could sound low pitched at his size. With his curiosity getting the better of him, he massaged his way to center of the big and second toe. It was more dirty here than the rest of the girl's foot but that faint sound was definitely coming from here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was just so bizarre. He eventually found a giant wall of toejam and leaned in close. The faint sound was growing louder. That was impossible. Dirt and gunk didn't make noise... And it certainly didn't know his name?! WHAT! channeling some chakra into his eyes to increase his vision, he could make out the individual specks of dirt. When he did his eyes widened and he backed away. That wall if toejam wasn't just filled with dirt... It was filled with people! His people!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What on earth!\" Orochimaru gasped. \"He could make out the teammates he sent with Kabuto to the chunnin exams, the doctor in charge of his underwater project, a few sound ninja, and even the other members of the sound ninja four! Tayuya had shrunk them all to the point of being beneath human visibility and trapped them between her toes! \"What the hell is this?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha! Looks like you found my collection of tinies.\" Tayuya laughed from above. \"That's what would've happened to you if you refused me. You'd have become part of my special collection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrochimaru was actually scared now. This was far beyond any torcher he could've ever come up with. These people were trapped in world of dirt, gunk, and putrid air. They were so tiny a normal human eye would never detect them and they were all too tiny to be crushed. They were all in hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrochimaru looked up at the redhead's grinning face and gulped. This was the devil and this was hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what are you waiting for?\" She asked with narrowed eyes. \"Forget them and get back to it, or else!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrchimaru gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was currently against a cliff as the three Akatsuki cornered him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lemme just slice him up, he'll talk then.\" Kisame muttered with a grin, reaching for the hilt of his Samehada.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I can handle this.\" Itachi knelt down on a knee and stared at the mans eyes.

He tried to stand only to realize he had no room to do so. Just where in the world was he? From what he could make out through the slivers of light he was being pinned by some sort of soft and moist ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was odd. He tried to recall what happened to him only for his mind to go blank. That annoyed him to no end. For the life of him he just couldn't remember. The last thing he could recall was Kabuto sending him out on some sort of task for Orochimaru. After that... Nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more Sasuke tried to desperately recall what led up to his current situation, the more frustrated he became. After taking a moment to compose himself, he decided to find a way out of his narrow prison before figuring out the rest. Channeling chakra into his hand he released a burst of electricity at the ceiling with no effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't right. Whatever his lightning hit it destroyed. Targets weren't supposed to remain in tact. Sasuke tried again but was met with a different result. Instead of blowing the moist ceiling apart like he'd hoped, he felt his entire world rise up. \"What's going on out there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo words greeted Sasuke. Instead he was met by the winds of rapid descent. The Uchiha prodigy felt his prison violently slam down. If not for the soft ceiling and equally soft ground he'd be crushed into a paste. This wasn't good. He needed out. He needed freedom from... Wherever the hell he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActivating his Sharingan, Sasuke began to crawl toward the light. As he did he bean to notice just how moist and squishy his prison really was. Had one of Orochimaru's snakes swallowed him? If so then the Sannin was dead the next time he saw him. The linger stench wasn't helping to calm him down either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like an eternity, Sasuke finally managed to reach the light. He poked his head through the opening and was immediately assaulted by hot and smelly air. That was soon followed by the near blinding light of the sun. Sasuke tried to move the rest of his body but found himself unable to get free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it!\" he cursed. All he could do was take in the sight of the squishy platform beneath him and the two long pillars on either side of him. Apparently they were a part of the ceiling that was pressing him down. Just where in the hell was he?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're finally awake now?\" A voice called from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled, Sasuke craned his neck toward the source... And his eyes widened.</span></div></div>",

Choji still eating said nothing. \"That's it CHOJI!\" she yelled. Choji still didn't bother to reply. \"Choji\" she yelled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoji then stopped eating and stood up. \"it seems i ran out\" he said while shaking the bag. He tossed the bag in the garbage and walked off ignoring ino.\" Uggghhh\" ino groaned \"im sick of you ignoring me all the time she said. Ino made a few hands signs then yelled \"Shunken jutsu.\" A puff of smoke appeared around choji and he disappeared (so it seemed). The jutsu how ever caused him to black out.\"Ill teach you to ignore me\" she said to herself laughing evilly and headed home with choji in the palm of her hand. \"Now where should i put you for now\" she thought for a moment then stuck choji.....</span></div></div>",

Choji could barely stand the crushing weight of his teammates foot let alone the strong, pungent odor that emanated from Ino's countless hours spent training in her footwear.  without haste Choji quickly transformed back into a ball and relived some of the pressure bearing down from the giantesses immense sole.

Choji get back here under my foot or i'll sit on you all day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the giant girl was stunned Choji used this opportunity to run underneath her bed, but before he can make it to freedom, the sultry blonde slammed her foot down on him again and he was trapped under a ninja girls smelly arch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Transform back into a ball Right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoji did as he was told and soon Ino was rolling him from the heel of her foot to inbetween each of her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"haha you actually feel pretty good under their Choji.

She couldn't just live with the fact that the mission was a success. No, she had to scold him about his antics and tactics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what if he was a bit cocky, in his mind he earned the right to be. He was more than skilled enough to take on a few grunts by himself. He didn't need a team to do that. Unfortunately Konohamaru-sensei and his father Lord Seventh disagreed. It was all so ridiculous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mission debriefing couldn't end fast enough. He needed to get away. Away from, Sarada, Konohamaru, and his father. Mitsuki was cool though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he was alone, cucking kunai at none moving targets. He'd probably been at this for at least a few hours. It was still day out and he figured he worked up a good sweat. It was time to clean up and maybe hit up Ichiraku. The food there was pretty tasty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight as Boruto began to pick up the kunai he started to feel a bit lightheaded. Perhaps he'd been going at it harder than he thought? Too bad for him that wasn't the case. Upon closer inspection he started to notice a very faint glow around his body. His eyes widened... and the he fell back, darkness taking him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he came to, he was surrounded by darkness. Damp and smelly darkness.</span></div></div>",

He was currently out in the training grounds working on his sealing techniques when all of a sudden he felt light-headed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at the seal he'd drawn he realized that he'd made a critical error. The characters were all wrong. He quickly tried to undo his mistake, but the damage had already been done. The world around Minato began to spin, it reminded him of the time he first time he used the Flying Raijin Jutstu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde Jounin felt like he was going to vomit. Maybe he shouldn't have tried to work on a new technique without Kushina present? She had told him in the past if he was going to work on his Fuinjutst he should do it when she's around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Minato she was at home. He tried to flash home with his signature technique, but found himself unable to do so. He was far too disoriented to use any jutsu. The spikey-haired blonde fell to he knees and his vision began to grow dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried again to do something, anything, but it was all for naught. Minato finally hit the ground, unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds turned to minutes, and minutes turned to hours. It was then that Minato finally came to. His pushed himself up off the ground and clutched his head in pain. \"Ugh! What happened to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around he noticed he appeared to be in some sort of tall forest. It didn't look any forest he knew? Was he still even in the Hidden Leaf? He wracked his brain trying to remember until the events previous struck him. He'd blacked out when working on a sealing technique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe steadily rose to his feet to try and use his jutstu, but was interrupted by what felt like a massive earthquake. The tremor was so powerful that it sent the confused shinobi tumbling down. At first he thought he might be under attack, but that theory soon died when craned his neck upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes widened in shock. Everything seemed to become clear now. He hadn't gone anywhere, he was still in the training grounds. A much larger training ground. His failed seal had shrunken him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp above him was the giant form of...</span></div></div>",

The tiny blonde could only gawk at the size difference. At his perspective she must have been as tall as Hokage tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she got closer the earthquakes became more powerful. It was obvious to the little shinobi that her footfalls were the cause. To a normal person a few steps is nothing, for an ant like him it felt as his world was shaking apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then a thought entered his mind, one that scared him stiff. He was in her path. She didn't see him, couldn't see him. She could literally snuff out his life under her sandal and she'd be none the wiser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe needed to move...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato tried desperately to find his footing, only to again be reunited with the dirt. Kushina's continued footfalls were not making his life any easier. Looking back at her she had a serine smile on her face and was apparently carrying a lunch basket. She probably wanted to surprise him while he was training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing how trying to stand wasn't an option, he tried to use his technique. He had placed his own Raijin seal in Kushina's seal, so if he could access it he might be able to get some help. He tried to focus on the seal, but for some reason it just wouldn't activate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato silently cursed, he was stuck! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery soon a shadow fell over him. A shadow that made his eyes widen in terror. Kushina was right in front of him, her foot raised high in the air. He winced as he made out all the dirt and junk that littered the bottom of her sandal. Normally he would have never noticed, but at this size he had a whole new perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorse yet, outside of the dirt and pebbles trapped in the sandal treads, it wouldappear his wife had stepped in some gum. This wasn't good. He needed to get her attention fast, otherwise he was as good as dead!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KUSHINA!!!\" Minato cried. </span></div></div>",
