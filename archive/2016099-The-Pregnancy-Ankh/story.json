It was also because he 'knew', everyone in the palace 'knew', scorpions may be relatively common but not common enough for one to make its way into the king's bedroom at the heart of the palace and kill him a week after his marriage to Raia but that is what happened. Many 'knew' that Raia was behind it but she had enough supporters to silence those who might oppose her. The late king's family was obviously cursed, which is why so many of them had tragic accidents recently, anyway any other claimant to the throne would have to carry there own paper work after that unfortunate fire which destroyed the king's family record and killed his only brother. <br>\r\nIt was reasoned, by many of the noble houses who stood to gain if Raia was crowned, that fresh blood was what was needed. But despite all of her support and her meticulous planning Raia rise from a initiate of Hathor to Queen of the upper and lower kingdoms within a few months was enough to gain suspicion of many important people. These people though were all to divided and afraid of what would happen to them if they spoke out.<br>\r\nEven now Amenemhat the high priest was obviously torn between denouncing  what he thought was upstart slip of a girl but refrained because he was afraid that no one would support him. As high priest Amenemhat had made quite a few enemies of his own and many would give up the chance to be rid of Raia if it meant they could be rid of him. Amenemhat was also afraid that Raia would just remove him and replace him with someone more amenable, he did have to worry to much as long as he kept his head down Raia had no intention of removing him, unless a less sweaty candidate became available. She had no interest in religion other than as a tool, something that Amenemhat also used it for but he had once believed but his belief had obviously been worn down over the decades until was he only what he was doing because it was his job. Raia on the other hand had never believed, an interesting view for someone who was once training to be a priestess, but that was only to get into the palace. Once inside Raia had gain the favour of different men discarding them when she got a more powerful suitor, Raia's looks weren't irresistible but nature definitely had given her a decent starting point for seducing men to help her, and she was consort to the king before she was properly inducted to the clergy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmenemhat straightened up, what ever ritual he performed had been completed, he took a step back and looked at Raia for her approval. Raia smiled, something she was good at, \"Very good Amenemhat, you are free to return to your quarters.\"<br>\r\nAmenemhat Bristled at being dismissed like some petitioning peasant but the aforementioned fear made him scurry off. As he did Raia stood up and with ceremonies over the members of the court began to socialize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaia...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Baroness Adela sighed as she looked out the window.  It was something she found herself doing quite a lot lately.  The sighing, that is, not the staring, although she did some of that too.  But it was the sighing that she was primarily concerned with.  She was sighing and couldn't quite figure out just why she was doing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas it because of her looks?  Preposterous.  Her hair was the color of honey, a wondrous rich shade of yellow.  Her eyes were the blue of a robin's egg.  Her body was shapely.  Her clothing, while not of the highest quality, was still well-made.  She was not the most beautiful woman in all the land, but she was beautiful enough that there was no reason to think little of herself.  So she did not sigh because of her looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas it because of her position?  Possible, but unlikely.  She was a noblewoman, a baroness.  A woman born into a house that was meant to rule.  Specifically, a house that was meant to rule the land that she herself was living on.  Her parents had unfortunately failed to give birth to a single son, and of her sisters, she was the eldest and thus the one who the land was tied to.  Of course, the land she was living on was not all that expansive.  Her family had never advanced far in the politics of the realm, and only had a few families tending an amount of land that was modest by noble standards.  Would she enjoy being of a higher rank?  Undoubtedly, but she had no particular jealousy for those who had such ranks.  And she most certainly had no desire to be a commoner.  So she did not sigh because of her position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas it because of her husband?  That seemed closer to the mark, but was not quite right.  Because she was a woman, she had to be married off.  The husband that she had been given, Rudolf, was not born to his rank, but granted it due to distinguishing himself through impressive military service.  As a result, he was well built, a veritable giant of a man, with dark hair and a bushy beard.  He was not supremely handsome, but he was not ugly either.  He was not cruel, not on purpose at any rate.  He treated her well, as a lady of her station deserved.  When it came to matters of personal relationships, he heeded her counsel, even if he did not always follow her advice.  To be sure, he had his flaws.  He was somewhat rough with others, but not out of malice, rather in the manner of a man who was still learning how to hold back.  He could be thoughtless at times, but no more than any other man, and indeed, less than some men she knew.  While he was not perfect, Adela was well aware that her husband could be worse.  So she did not sigh because of her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, Adela sighed yet again.  The reason for her melancholy was not any of these things.  She knew full well what made her sigh, she simply had been trying to avoid thinking about it, for to think about it was to make her worries real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she and Rudolf had been married for about a year now, she had yet to bear him any children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had tried so many times, and yet she had neither children nor sign that she was with child.  Ideally she would eventually have three boys and a girl, but at this point she would settle for only one child. It would not have been so bad had she born him a child and it had died.  That would be tragic of course, but at least she would know that she could bring children into the world.  It was too soon to say whether she was barren or not, but the worry had already been planted in her heart and only becoming pregnant would tear it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of tearing away, her husband had just arrived, tearing her away from her ruminations.  \"Hello, dear husband,\" Adela said in a soft melodic tone, praying her face would not betray her worries.  \"Did you manage to settle the situation with George alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, dear flower,\" Rudolf replied in his booming voice that must have served him so well in the military.  \"I do believe things have been settled, for now at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge was the head of one of the commoner families living on their land.  His family was larger than the others, but they had been living on the land for longer than anyone else, save perhaps for her own family.  Because they had more hands to work the fields than the others, they were able to balance out their larger number of mouths to feed, usually.  But the most recent harvest had been poorer than usual, and while most of the families were able to adjust, George's simply couldn't, so when it came time to collect taxes, they had come up short.  Or at least, that had been the the explanation Adela had heard from one of their servants relaying it to her husband.  She had suggested to Rudolf that before coming up with a punishment to give George for failure to pay taxes, they should see if some sort of alternative could be arrived at first.  He had agreed to talk it over with George first before anything else.  And it seemed like it had gone well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what did you decide?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I went down to George's home to talk it out with him.  He came to the entrance and I said, 'Hello George', and he said, 'Hello milord'.  I said to him, 'George, we've got a small problem.  You've fallen short on your taxes.'  Well, his face fell when I said that, and he mumbled, 'Yes milord.'  I then said, 'If you had enough coin to make up the difference, we could have accepted that, but I've heard you don't have much of that either.'  'No milord,' he said back.  So I said, 'Now, your family has tended these lands for generations, and I know that the only reason you fell short was because of the bad harvest, and that wasn't your fault.  I think we can both agree that neither of us want you to be punished for something you had no control over, so I was hoping we could find some way to make up for your shortfall.'  He perked up a bit at that and said, 'Well, we've got some old things that we haven't sold off yet.  Maybe we could pay you with them?'  I said, 'I think that might work out.'  So he and my men gathered up the stuff and are probably just finishing up delivering them right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good to hear,\" Adela smiled.  \"Perhaps I shall see what they've brought in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead,\" Rudolf waved his hand.  \"You have a better eye for aesthetic worth than I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdela walked through the halls of the estate to where the possessions had been delivered.  As Rudolf had surmised, the men had finished transporting the things to the estate where they would be sorted out by the servants.  She wanted to look through them first to see if there was anything she wanted for herself personally.  At first she didn't see anything but as she shifted the items, something caught her eye.  It was a gold thing a few centimeters in length, attached to a thin rope like a necklace.  She brought it up to her eye level and stared at it for a moment.  Eventually, she decided to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Adela placed the item back down with the rest, \"still a bit dirty,\" she under her breath, she would take another look at the items once the servants cleaned them up. She might even wear one for dinner this evening if they scrubbed up well soon enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is it?\" said George looking  under the table for the third time, his heirloom wasn't there last time and he knew it wouldn't be there this time but he checked anyway. Whilst checking he saw the ankles of his wife as she entered the main room of their sparse cottage. \"Mildred, do you know where my family's heirloom is?\"<br>\r\n\"I gave it to the baron's men earlier as one of the items in lieu of pay,\" she said pointedly.<br>\r\nGeorge knew this before, though he hoped it wasn't true, and he knew why but he'll still asked anyway, \"how could you give away my family heirloom?\"<br>\r\n\"LOOK WHAT IT HAS DONE OUR US,\" Mildred shouted while gesturing around at the spartan house, \"LOOK WHAT ITS DONE TO ME,\" she continued gesturing to her hips and breasts both of which were apparent even in the loose plain dress she was wearing. \"When I wanted to start a family with you, I thought it would only be a couple of children four at the most, but I have had more babies than any one of those pigs or cows\" she said this time gesturing out the window to where the animals were normally kept, \"and it is happening again,\" she said pulling her dress tight to reveal a small but definite bulge in her abdomen. Suddenly the fire from her rage was gone and her shoulders sagged, George who knew his wife after 20 years of marriage rushed over and embraced her as she started to sob. \"There, there,\" he said patting on the back, he understood why his wife did what she had done, it was reasonable, she had been having multiple kids nearly every year since they were married, George was a caring father but even he had trouble remembering all their childrens' names, not to mention both he and his wife were both well into their 40s and Mildred shouldn't really be having any more kids. \"I understand,\" he said continuing to hug his wife, \"it's just that was the only thing I inherited from my family, and is the only thing I had to remember them by.\"<br>\r\nMildred choked back some tears, \"you have your own family to think about now,\" she said.<br>\r\n\"I know but couldn't we have given it to one of the other family around here, some one who didn't have anything?\"<br>\r\n\"The important thing is it gone,\" said Mildred before continuing with a hit of malice in her voice, \"besides lets see how well the baron can keep up with his expenses after the baroness is turned into some sort of breeding stock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCastle was too grand a word for what Adela and Rudolf had, fortified manor would be more appropriate, smaller then an actual castle but still the lap of luxury for the time, and still large enough to have a slew of different servants doing different jobs. One of said jobs was cleaning some of the items given to the baron in lieu of rent. Since polishing and cleaning wasn't a greatly technical skill this job had been given to Rosemary and her assistant Emma. Rosemary was originally assigned to the baroness as a sort of motherly figure (partly because Adela's own mother had past away when the baroness was still young), meant to help out Adela when she became pregnant, to be the midwife at the birth, to be nanny to any children, and to otherwise help her out with any job a man would just get wrong. But Adela apparent lack of fertility meant there had been little use for Rosemary's skills and she found herself in more of a maid's role. This didn't bother her too much, Rosemary was a robust and dutiful woman who would make herself useful until her skills were needed. But Rosemary was long past her prime and was way past the age of having kids of her own, unlike her assistant Emma who was just shy of twenty. Rosemary had taken on Emma as an apprentice so when she passed away there would be someone ready to fill her role if needed. But Emma was an imaginative young woman and not easily taught, Rosemary hoped she had time left in her to make she could teach Emma all that she could.<br>\r\n\"...which is why it is important in any marital argument not to say anything even if it comforting words, you got to comfort her with your actions until she is al...EMMA are you listening?\"<br>\r\n\"hmm?\" said Emma distantly as she gazed out the window at some boys chasing a rabbit.<br>\r\n\"For goodness sake girl, you got to get your head out of the clouds and listen, I'm trying to teach you important skills here, you don't want end up as a scullery maid when I'm gone,\" said Rosemary stopping what she was cleaning and looking directly at her pupil.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Rosemar...\" started Emma tearing her gaze from the window.<br>\r\n\"That's Mrs Miller,\" interjected Rosemary Miller, \"and ma'am to anyone more important than me,\" she added trying to reinforce another lesson.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Mrs Miller, but all this stuff just sounds so dull.\"<br>\r\n\"You think this is dull, try peeling turnips for ten years, then you know what dull is. That's what I was doing when I was your age, I would of leaped at the opportunity to be a lady's maid,\" said Rosemary. \"At least pay attention to your scrubbing, half these things still have gunk on them,\" she continued gesturing to the pile of things that Emma had cleaned.<br>\r\n\"I didn't want to break them,\" said Emma more as an excuse than a reason.<br>\r\n\"If it can't take a good scrubbing it is not worth having,\" said Rosemary grabbing one of the items and vigorous cleaning it. \"There,\" she said triumphantly holding up the item, a small gold cross like object attached to a thin rope like a necklace.<br>\r\n\"Isn't it beautiful,\" said Emma taking the item and putting it on. \"Don't I look elegant,\" she said giving a twirl, her long red hair flowing and her ragged dress swishing.<br>\r\n\"Very nice indeed,\" said Mrs Miller in a disapproving voice, \"but you should take that off now, the baron is an understanding fellow as nobles go but if anyone were to see you wearing the jewelry meant for the baroness...\" she left the sentence hanging and let Emma's overly active imagination fill in the rest.<br>\r\n\"I know,\" said Emma, carefully taking the necklace off and putting it in the pile of things to be taken up to the baroness room, \"but it is nice to feel like a noble lady for a bit.\"<br>\r\n\"You might not be able to reach that high, but if paid a bit more attention you can still reach a higher station in life,\" said Mrs Miller going back to scrubbing items. \"If you become a lady's maid, who knows who's eye you might catch, certainly someone better then that lay about Jeffery.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that evening baroness Adela was getting ready for that evening's dinner, it wasn't a huge affair but some of the other local nobles were dining with them tonight along with a few of Rudolf's old friends from the military, and all of them would bring their wives, all of whom had born their husbands at least one child. She sighed again and looked at the contents of the box on her bed, it was the items taken from George's family now cleaned and delivered to her, maybe one these jewelry pieces would help distract any question about a lack children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to...</span></div></div>",

The men were talking to her husband.  On one side was a man who was tall and muscular, though not as much as her husband.  He was brown-haired, had an angular face and was utterly serious-looking.  Adela recognized him as Sir Frederick.  With them was a man fair of hair and features with a friendly smile and a calculating gaze.  That was Robin.  Both of them were men that Rudolf had known from his days in the military.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAway from where those three were sitting were the two women on opposite sides of the table, not speaking to each other at the moment.  One had blonde curls and an fine, elegant pink dress.  She was the Marchioness Maribelle, Sir Frederick's wife.  The other had long auburn hair and her red dress, while not as fine and expensive as Maribelle's, complemented her beauty perfectly.  This was the Countess Cordelia, the Earl Robin's wife.  Both of them had an empty chair next to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrim-faced and serious, Sir Frederick was rumored to only smile when killing a man.  As a recurring host of the man, Adela knew that this was an exaggeration.  It was true that emotional warmth did not come easily to him, but she had seen him smile on at least two occasions.  During the last war, he had distinguished himself with great personal valor and strength.  Songs and tales of his deeds circulated the land, a fact that the man himself found somewhat embarrassing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaribelle was a source of companionship and frustration for Adela.  On the one hand, they were in similar positions, the eldest daughter of a noble family that had no sons in her generation to inherit, who married a military man.  Maribelle was of higher rank than Adela, and was, in fact one of the highest ranking people that she could say that she knew personally, but that was not a barrier to their friendship.  She was also fiercely loyal to the people she cared about, a pool of people that Adela herself was part of.  On the other hand she had an aggravating personality.  While she was not often intentionally rude or condescending, unless you annoyed her or someone she cared about, she was often unintentionally rude and condescending, giving her a reputation as sharp-tongued.  She and her husband had a son, Brady, who took after his father in looks, though not in personality.  In fact, while Sir Frederick was incredibly stoic, Brady was highly emotional and had a habit of crying at the drop of a hat.  As Adela observed Maribelle, she noticed small signs that indicated she was concealing some sort of worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin had some skill with a sword, true, but his real talent laid in tactics.  The man was known for his unorthodox, yet successful, maneuvers.  He was a friendly sort of man, but those who talked to him often felt like he was studying them in case he ever had to go against them.  Since the war, without his primary trade in stock, he had shifted his focus to political advising, a field that he wasn't quite as good at, but was quickly learning.  His vast knowledge allowed him a level of status in court that outstripped his nominal rank.  Adela was actually somewhat scared by how much Robin seemed to know.  Rumors abounded that he was researching magic and the occult, though Adela was not sure how much stock to put into them.  Such things did pop up when nobles got jealous of other nobles, after all.  His wife, Cordelia had a talent for picking up just about any skill remarkably quickly and was as frighteningly knowledgeable as her husband.  Adela would find her talent aggravating if it wasn't for the fact that making friends was one of the skills that Cordelia had picked up.  She was a person who enjoyed helping others, to the point where she would sometimes neglect her own needs.  Rudolf dubbed them \"the genius couple\", a moniker that they had more than earned.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had two children, albeit both of them were girls.  While Robin and Cordelia loved their daughters, it was not exactly a secret that they wanted a son.  Severa and Morgan were the names of their children, and they were both terrors in their own ways.  Severa was prone to sullen fits and Morgan was overly rambunctious, facts that Adela had heard Cordelia gripe about several times already in the past year.  Currently, she seemed to be sighing to thin air, something that Adela herself had been doing lately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdela ultimately decided to sit next to...</span></div></div>",

I had Brady around the same time and I am skinnier and have a much daintier bottom than either you and Adela hasn\u2019t had a child yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018She really doesn\u2019t know when she being stupid and saying rude things,\u2019 thought Adela to herself, \u2018even though all she said were true.\u2019 Whilst Cordelia was far from fat or even chubby, she was still the heaviest of three women and hadn\u2019t quite gotten her pre-baby body back. Maribelle was the skinniest and did have as she said the smallest behind, something she would often remind the other two of, it was unusual therefor that Maribelle would almost always wear a bustle, it was also ironic considering what would happen to Maribelle over the coming days. Though Adela was also surprisingly hungry and wondered why the food hadn\u2019t been set up yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhhh,\u201d groaned Emma clutching her belly taut and swollen with food.<br>\r\n\u201cI left the main preparation table a second to get some seasoning,\u201d said the head cook to Mrs Miller, his voice part way between rage and amazed disbelief, \u201cand when I can back she had eaten half the feast, there was a roast pig there, and she's eaten it apple and all.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cI can see,\u201d said Rosemary Miller flatly, she always thought Emma had hidden talents, she never thought being able to eat the majority of a feast meant for half a dozen people by herself to be one of them but she was prepared to believe that Emma could do something unusual. Beside she couldn\u2019t not believe it, Emma was sitting in the remains of the feast, her face smear with food and belly so bloated with food that it made a distinct curve in her ragged dress, the proof was in the pudding, something else Emma had apparently devoured.<br>\r\n\u201cand there was a roast chicken,\u201d the cook continued to list, \u201cand a cheese board all gone down that little gullet of hers.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll discipline her, but not now,\u201d said Rosemary, \u201cnothing I can do to her will punish her more than that bellyache she\u2019s going through,\u201d she continued grabbing Emma\u2019s wrist and leading her from the table, \u201cgood grief girl be quite, I\u2019ve heard women giving birth that made less noise than you.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cBut what of my feast?!\u201d wailed the cook, \u201cwhat am I supposed to serve to Baron and his guests.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAfter I take this little thing home I\u2019ll come back and help you prepare another one,\u201d said Mrs Miller calmly.<br>\r\n\u201cBut there expecting food now.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s enough leftover here for you to give them some appetizer and that should give you time to get another main course together.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut it will take hours to get another roast,\u201d said the cook wringing his apron.<br>\r\n\u201cThere should be some more being cooked in the castle for the cleaning staff,\u201d said Mrs Miller matter a factly, \u201cI\u2019ll procure a couple on the way back.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut I can\u2019t serve food meant for servants to the Baron, it won\u2019t be good enough for them, \u201csaid the cook seemingly desperate to find a problem.<br>\r\n\u201cRoger,\u201d said Mrs Miller sternly using the cook\u2019s first name,\u201d the Baron wouldn\u2019t of made you head cook if you were unable to turn anything into a meal for him.

Mrs. Miller hadn't expected much of a response out of her.  Frankly, she was surprised that the girl was even semi-conscious after gorging herself the way she did.  The maid-in-training was currently clutching her bloated belly, and being pushed by her elder to somewhere else, preferably a place where she wouldn't cause anymore trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, what on God's green earth would possess you to make you think that glutting yourself like that would be even remotely a good idea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was hungry,\" the dark-haired maid gurgled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I assumed that you did it because you were hungry.  I assumed that because the only other reason I can even imagine you would do it is because you were trying to spite the nobles, and I doubt even the devil himself could have enough hate or room in him to eat that much food out of spite,\" Mrs. Miller's voice was positively dripping with sarcasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't feel good,\" Emma moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't imagine why that would be the case,\" Mrs. Miller said acidly, \"you only ate more food than any one person should ever have wanted to eat, let alone been able to.\"  She was going to say more, but Emma threw one hand over her mouth and made a sound like she was going to be sick.  \"Are you going to throw up?  Nod if you think you're about to throw up.\"  Emma nodded and Mrs. Miller sighed.  \"Right then, let's get you to a window before you make a bigger mess of things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, they made it to the window quickly and Emma's head was thrust outside before she puked.  Rosemary hoped that none of it caught on the wall, that would be a terrible chore to clean, but it looked fine from what she could see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do hope that this incident teaches you not to be so impulsive.  You need to have better self-control, especially if you hope to be employed as a proper lady's maid,\" she lectured.  \"The last thing you should ever do is steal from your employer, for if you're caught, they won't be your employer much longer.  That goes double when you're employed by a noble.  You will get a further punishment, of course, but that can wait until you are feeling good enough for the punishment to actually mean something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am?\" asked a voice down the hall.  Rosemary turned toward the voice and saw a man.  As he got closer, she could make out his features.  He was tall and lanky, with sandy hair and dull brown eyes.  He was also familiar to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Mrs. Miller to you, Jeffrey,\" she said reprovingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeffrey was the apprentice gardener, learning how to care for the grounds and gardens.  He did very good work...when he worked.  And therein lay the problem.  He was, in Mrs. Miller's eyes, one of the worst types of person; someone who was determined to go through life exerting as little effort as possible.  As is so often the case, the effort he put into shirking work exceed the effort necessary to do the work itself.  He was also far closer to Emma than the elder maid approved of.  Emma had enough bad habits as it was, she didn't need his laziness rubbing off on her as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Mrs. Miller,\" he started, then he saw the young lady in her arms.  \"Emma?  What's wrong with you?\" he asked in a worried tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosemary recognized the opportunity that he provided.  \"Here,\" she thrust Emma into the boy's arms.  Fortunately, he got a grip on her before she fell.  \"Emma is not feeling well and needs to rest.  Go and take her to her quarters, I know you know where she sleeps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what you're talking about,\" Jeffery said, not meeting Mrs. Miller's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe greying maid gave the boy a <i>look</i>.  \"Jeffrey, I know you to be a lazy layabout who spends more effort to avoid work than it would to just do the work in the first place, but even you should know better than to insult my intelligence like that.  I know all about the two of you and your little... <i>indiscretions</i>.  While I do not particularly approve, in this instance, it makes you someone useful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeffrey nodded, not wanting to upset the older woman any further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lay her on her side so she doesn't choke on her own vomit, and place a pot on the floor by her head for her to throw up in if she needs to.  Do <b>not</b>,\" and she paused for effect, \"<i>tarry</i> overmuch.\"  The tone of voice and the glare she gave him made it very clear what she meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did she do, ma'am?\" Jeffery looked bewildered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Mrs. Miller to you.  As for what she did, I'm sure she can tell you all about it when she's feeling better.  For now, all you need to know is she's caused a disaster, but if I hurry, I should be able to salvage something out of this situation.  Now off with the both of you.\"  Rosemary hurried off to get the roasts from the cleaning staff, leaving Jeffrey in the hallway holding a groggy maid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Em, what have you gotten yourself into?\" he sighed.  Emma only groaned in response.</span></div></div>",

No!\"<br>\r\n\"Then you can do your job and prepare then,\" said Mrs. Miller slamming the roast pig down in front of him.<br>\r\n\"Yes Ma'am,\" said the cook.<br>\r\nRosemary thought about correcting him but decided against it in case it sent him into self pitying state again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough when he was working and not fretting Roger seemed to has a more positive attitude, \"So why did she do it?\" he asked.<br>\r\n\"She said she was hungry,\" said Rosemary not completely satisfied with the answer Emma gave herself.<br>\r\n\"I can't imagine anyone being that hungry,\" showing he didn't quite believe it either. <br>\r\nRosemary was an intelligent no nonsense woman whose years of experience had practically made her in charge of the support staff of the castle and as a result didn't look to others for speculation but Emma's act of gluttony was so unbelievable even she couldn't quite comprehend it and the cook was probably the best person to discuss it with, it was his food after all.<br>\r\n\"I can't imagine it either, I asked her if she had other reason for it?\"<br>\r\n\"and what did she say?\" asked the cook, wondering if was to get him in to trouble.<br>\r\n\"Not much really, she wasn't in a state to talk, I thought it might be she had something against the nobles,\" Mrs. Miller said inspecting what Roger had set up to cook around the kitchen.<br>\r\n\"Does she have something against them?\"<br>\r\n\"She never shown any dislike of them, beside after I asked she threw up.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm surprised she was able to get the food down in the first place,\" said the Roger.<br>\r\n\"So am I.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeffery laid Emma on her side, just like the old biddy had said and even pulled back her dark red hair away from her face. He had thought about 'tarrying', as Mrs. Miller had put, in the garden shed with Emma but she was in no state to and he needed to change his shoes, Emma had thrown up again and he didn't get out of the way fast enough. <br>\r\nBesides he would  possibly would need to make a break for it, Emma was in no state to talk but it didn't him long to find the slight curve of her belly which hadn't be there when he had seen her last. Jeffery didn't have the education to know about morning sickness but he knew where babies came from and roughly how they got there. He wasn't ready to become a father, he didn't want to be a father at all it was too much work, and as soon as Emma's family found out he would be roped in to marrying her, if he was lucky. If wasn't lucky he wouldn't see the day where he'd became a father and not in a good way. He did like Emma possibly even loved her and didn't want to leave her but...he couldn't just couldn't raise a child, so he left her on the straw matress, in her small room in one of the corners of the castle, and left to prepare his get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's how you get the apple in there,\" said Roger stepping away from the roast pig.<br>\r\n\"Certainly a skill,\" said Mrs. Miller, not mentioning that she knew how to cook a roast pig and prepare it before Roger was even born. Mrs. Miller long service meant that she could fill in for nearly every role in the castle with minimal effort. \"Now you can take it up to the hall,\" she continued.<br>\r\nThe cook looked nervous again, \"I was planning on sending some of the kitchen hands to do it,\" he said gesturing to a couple people doing the washing up.\"<br>\r\n\"Heavens above, take some pride in your work,\" said Mrs. Miller picking up platter with the roast pig on it and led the kitchen hands up to the feast hall.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Beside her Marchioness Maribelle, who had been going through something similar, said, \"Finally,\" as the food was placed on the table. Then Adela and Maribelle began to eat, and eat... and eat. The remaining nobles had initially stared in disbelief at this display of gluttony, the Baron tried to say something but it fell on deaf ears, as his wife and one of her friends continued eating as though they hadn't had food for a week. <br>\r\nThen Cordelia and Robin, the genius couple, noticing that if they did not get themselves anything soon they would miss out, served themselves modest portions which Sir Fredrick and Baron Rudolf followed suit as their wives devoured morsel after morsel. Whilst both women were eating just as fervently as each other Adela seemed to have a greater determination in her eyes as she made her way through the appetizers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Mrs. Miller entered the feast hall with the main course she knew something was not quite right, no one was talking, at what was meant to a lull in the eating there was usually conversation but there was none, secondly the all the food from the appetizers had been eaten. Nobles liked their feasts but often left a shocking amount of uneaten food, this was usually given to servants or the pigs after the feast but tonight it looked like the pigs would have to go hungry as every plate from the initial course was completely bereft of food, anything that could been eat had been. <br>\r\nMrs. Miller along with the kitchen hands crossed to the table carrying the main course, she had barely placed the roast pig down on the table when hands reached out and moved it across the table's surface. Mrs. Miller watched as Adela dragged the roast pig towards herself, tear off a leg and start ravenously tearing flesh from it, at about the same time Maribelle had claimed the roast duck and was doing something very similar to it. Rosemary Miller stared wordlessly as the two noble women continue to eat fervently, she hadn't seen anything quite like in her years, she had seen people who were starving wolf down food with great gusto in the past but after they gotten a bit of food in themselves they slowed down and enjoyed their meal, but the Baroness and the Marchioness showed no signs of slowing down, it was like they were in a race against each other to see who could eat the most food the fastest, as though the only thought in their minds was to get the most amount of food into themselves as fast as possible. <br>\r\nRosemary felt a hand on her shoulder and turned to see the Baron who after seeing her that he had got her attention looked back to his wife and the Marchioness gorging themselves and asked \"Do you know what's happening?\" in a quiet voice very different his normal one as though he was afraid that he might raise the ire of the to feasting noble women if he spoke too loudly. <br>\r\nShe didn't but wasn't going to admit complete ignorance in front of the Baron, \"I haven't seen this before sir,\" she said, which was true.<br>\r\n\"But do you know what is happening?\" said the Baron too concerned with what might be happening with his wife to be deterred from an answer.<br>\r\n\"No,\" Mrs. Miller admitted but added, \"I intend to find out though,\" and she did because even though hadn't seen anything like this before Mrs. Miller was certain whatever caused Emma to devour half the feast before was now effecting Adela and Maribelle.<br>\r\n\"Well give my compliments to the chef,\" said Rudolf dryly, \"whilst I didn't get much of the food my wife can't seems to get enough of it.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nJeffrey cursed internally to himself as he eased the door open to the main garden shed. He didn't say anything out loud for the same reason he eased the door open, in order not to wake head gardener Franklin. Jeffrey had a few of his personal affects in the main garden shed, which not only served as storage for a variety of garden implements and aids, but also as the head gardener's home. The elderly Franklin had a corner to the shed divided off by curtain which is where he slept. Jeffrey hoped the old man had gotten drunk at the village tavern and wouldn't be back until morning or had gone on one of his late night strolls, but a heavy breathing coming from behind the curtained area showed this was not the case. Jeffrey treaded quietly over to the main bench where he found his hat in the spot he left it after a hard day of avoiding work. He would need that if he was travelling, he could also use the old sack under the bench to carry his possessions in. <br>\r\nAfter silently bagging the hat in the sack he turned to make his way back to the door and spied a coil of rope under one of the shelves above the bench. He could do with some rope, it was useful and the coil looked light enough to carry without much difficulty, and it wouldn't be like he was stealing as the head gardener had loads of rope around the place not doing anything. Unfortunately for Jeffrey this coil of rope had been propping up the shelf on top of it, which came crashing down after he removed the rope causing a load cacophony as the shelf and it's contents hit the bench bellow. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The crowd of crew members that had gathered started to murmur at this news.<br>\r\n\"Sounds to good to be true,\" said the captain rubbing his grizzled chin.<br>\r\n\"Then it probably is,\" said an oily nasal voice from the crowd. Everyone turned to see Henry Parkson, the ship's quartermaster. Many were confused why Mr Parkson was part of a pirate crew, the greasy little English man was such a stickler for protocol he would be considered strict on a military vessel. The only reason he hadn't been killed ages ago was his knowledge and contacts allowed them to make port at many places they otherwise couldn't.<br>\r\nMr Parkson insinuated his way up to the captain, \"a word in your ear,\" he said before continuing loud enough for everyone else to hear in his nasal drone. \"A lone cargo ship fully laden and heading away from the new world? is so obviously a trap, there is probably a couple of frigates near by.\"<br>\r\n\"You're probably right,\" said the captain after a few seconds of thought, \"ALL RIGHT MEN, WE'RE LEAVING IT.\"<br>\r\nThere was a collective groan from the crew, whilst the quartermaster wore a smug grin, taking pleasure at the disappointment he had caused. \"Shame,\" said the look out a scrawny young man by the name of Nathaniel Philip, \"it was a Spanish ship.\" Several crew members including the quartermaster had to jump out of the way as the captain drew his sword quick, pointed it at the distant ship and bellowed the order to attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the fact that Captain Morrison's ship, a corvette called the Otter, clearly was able to take the Spanish cargo brig, the transport ship didn't surrender. It was like the crew knew that Captain Morrison had uncontrollable rage against the Spanish ever since he received the gash across his face from one. The Brig fired a few shots off but mainly focused on trying to get away, a futile task given how heavily laden it was. When the mast was taken out it's fate was seal but it still failed to show the white flag. Boarding parties were organised, this would normally of been done by the captain but against Spanish vessels the captain was not in the state of mind for such things and as such the task fell to his first officer, an Italian Alfonso Mattarelli who would be leading one boarding boarding party which would secure the deck, the other would be led by George Porter.<br>\r\nIt would be a surprise to all the other crew members that one of the best buccaneers aboard the Otter  was actually a woman named Grace Roper. Grace came from south England and originally joined the royal naval disguised as a man, to follow in the foot steps of her older brother, Clark. She was posted aboard a different ship to Clark under a cruel captain and leapt at the opportunity to become a pirate. Nature had made it easy for Grace to disguise herself as a man, she had very little in the way of curves, whether they be hips, breasts or backside and the use of a large coat help hide them further and she had cut her black hair short. This gave her the appearance of a lean young man, George Porter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace crossed the boarding plank as soon as it was down, Captain Morrison hadn't bother with a boarding plank and leapt across as soon as he was unleashed. There wasn't much resistance from the Spanish sailors most of them were trying to keep out of the way of the raging Scotsman, the Spanish captain did try to put up some resistance but was more dutiful than skilled and was quickly cut down. One sailor tried to block Grace's access to the lower decks, she easily parried his poor thrust and knocked him down in the same motion, at which point he raised his hands in surrender. Grace took some pity and didn't finish him but not that much and still booted the prone man roughly aside.<br>\r\nThere seemed to be no one else other than her and her boarding party below decks.<br>\r\n\"What do you think they've got?\" said one of the pirates.<br>\r\n\"What ever it is it's either heavy or they got a lot of it, she's riding very low in the water,\" replied another.<br>\r\n\"Gold's heavy,\" said the first one hopefully.<br>\r\n\"So are cows, we'll find out soon enough,\" said Grace opening the door to the cargo hold.<br>\r\n What was inside was cages, inside of which were people natives most likely based upon their appearance. Grace tried not to look any them, she didn't know what would happen to them, their presence was problematic.<br>\r\n\"Are they slaves?\" asked one of the pirates.<br>\r\n\"Laborers certainly,\" said Grace.<br>\r\n\"I thought they brought them in from Africa,\" continued the pirate.<br>\r\n\"Possibly they are moving these natives from area of low work to another one in the new world,\" said Grace looking for something else in a desperate attempt to change the topic. Fortunately for her she saw some crates at which she pointed at, \"There, we'll still may get something out of this yet.\"<br>\r\nMost of the crates contained foods, not surprisingly but one of them did contained a variety of gold, jewels and less precious but still valuable objects. It was only one crate but it was large enough to be a good find and to make the risk worth it. Grace decided to tell some else about the contents of the hold and let them decide what to do with the people in cages<br>\r\n.<br>\r\nWhen got back on deck she found...</span></div></div>",

Also present were the ship's officers, which include Alfonso, Macklebee the head gunner, Thomas the ship's navigator, Philip the master of sails, and Grace. The only absentee was the ship's doctor, as they had not returned to port to get a new one after the last one got killed by an errant cannon ball.<br>\r\nThe issue, as one might expect, was the fate of the captured slaves.<br>\r\n\"We can't just leave them a drift at sea,\" said the captain.<br>\r\n\"And what do intend captain,\" said the quartermaster sarcastically, \"sign them up to the crew?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course not.\"<br>\r\n\"Then what?\" queried the greasy Mr Parkson.<br>\r\n\"Only if they want to,\" said the Captain.<br>\r\n\"What?! I see how that will go, 'Do you want to stay out here and die or do you want become pirates'.\"<br>\r\n\"No, we'll take them all back to land, Femur Cove (there was already a skull cove and femur was better than humerus) is only a day away and we're heading there anyway,\" said the captain. \"No doubt they'll find something to do there but we will also extend the offer to any of them that want to join, Alfonso says quite a few can speak...<i>spanish</i>,\" said the captain, the last word being half spat out.<br>\r\n\"That's ok then, as long as it just the men\" said the quartermaster relaxing.<br>\r\n\"And women,\" added the captain.<br>\r\n\"What?! No, why,\" blurted the quartermaster.<br>\r\n\"Why, it would be nice to have feminine touch or at least someone who knows how to cook,\" said the captain. Grace who couldn't cook to save her life nearly corrected the captain but manage to catch herself.<br>\r\n\"No, I won't allow it,\" said the quartermaster.<br>\r\nThe captain raised a bushy eyebrow, \"will you now,\" he said.<br>\r\n\"I...I...I demand a vote,\" said Mr Parkson regaining composure, \"of the officers.\"<br>\r\n\"Alright then,\" said Captain Morrison, \"if you think that we should allow women to join as domestic crew, put your thumbs up if ney put your thumbs down.\"<br>\r\nGrace looked to see what everyone else had done, it was a split vote, with Alfonso, and Philip supporting the captain whilst Macklebee and Thomas held the quartermaster's views, and they were all looking at her. \"Well George,\" said the captain, grinning, \"what will it be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally it would be an easy decision, which was whatever side the quartermaster wasn't on. Most of the crew held this view even Macklebee and Thomas, but Macklebee was superstitious and Thomas was of the opinion that sailing ships crew shouldn't contain women. But if any woman did choose to stay, they might be able to see through Grace disguise. Fooling a bunch of men that she into believing she was male is easy, but fooling woman of such a thing would be all the more difficult. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace decided to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Grace looked at the other officers as they stared intently at her each sporting their own style of facial hair; The captain's unshaven stubble, Mackelbee's full beard, Thomas' ridiculous mutton chops, Alfonso's goatee, Philip's somehow permanent 5 o'clock shadow and Mr Parkson's fussy little mustache, the collection was rounded out by Grace lack of any facial hair. A few seconds past, she had to make a decision, in an effort to appear nonchalant she gave a shrug, \"they can join if any of them want to.\"<br>\r\nThe scowl on the quartermaster's face was the reward she wanted, \"Great,\" said the captain clapping his hands together, \"lets start dividing the loot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chest of valuables was brought to the quartermaster for his inspection, despite his near universal unpopularity by the crew in all other matters, he was considered quite fair in pricing and dividing the loot and had never tried to swindle anyone (though his position meant he received the most shares). Grace's position in the crew meant she received one share, this contained a variety of gold and jewels most of which would fetch a mint on shore. She might want to hold on to some of it as many of the crew will be trying to sell their booty (the pirate kind) for cash which they could use to get booty (the other kind) from the young ladies (or men if you were naive and couldn't see the signs) who would give 'support' to a sailor who had been at sea a long time. It might be wise she thought to hold on to most of it until the market (well market place) had less people selling gold and jewels to get a better price. There were some things that she wouldn't sell, from this lot was a pair sapphire earrings, she would never wear them whilst pretending to be a man, but if ever went back openly being a woman she would not want for jewelry to wear. She picked over the other items wondering what the cache of valuables had been, there were European style rings, native statuettes and several things that looked like they were from Asia, Africa and the Middle East. She mulled over a small golden ankh for a bit wondering how it came to be in the Caribbean, before dividing the share up into their materials and placing them in separate pouches to be worn on her belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip to Femur Cove took the best part of two days, with the Otter making port mid afternoon. Grace had never been so happy to be back on dry land, she had been sea sick since the raid something that earned her a few jeers by some crew members, not even Mr Parkson got sea sick. Plus making land meant that the captured slaves would be off the ship, Grace didn't feel comfortable in their presence they always seem to be staring, not to mention quite a few of them did not have their sea legs, as a result the make shift quarters made for them in the hold didn't smell too nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter selling of a few silver rings to get her some currency, Grace made her way to one of the taverns with some of the crew.<br>\r\nCarousing was another thing Grace had to be careful with, if she got anything more than slightly tipsy she could easily slip up and reveal her secret. If anyone was to pay attention to George Porter they would notice he was a messy drinker and spilled most of his drink over the course of the night, and despite this he would still end up drunk as a skunk most evenings at a tavern. Fortunately for Grace everyone else was busy getting sloshed themselves and didn't pay much attention to her.<br>\r\n\"Alright, Alright here'sh one,\" said a crew member a bit worst for drink, \"if you were made to, mushket to head short of 'hic' thing, who would you rather kissh the captain or the cort...the quart...mr Parkshon?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" replied another tipsy enough to take the question seriously, \"are they ok with it?\"<br>\r\n\"Of coushe not.\"<br>\r\n\"It's a tough one I mean the captain's got a jaw like a hedgehog but the quartermaster has that hairy caterpillar on his upper lip, can I just say George here, his face is smooth enough that I can at least pretend it's a woman.\"<br>\r\n\"Nah you can't, beshides George will probably barf all over you cause he'sh got a weak stomach,\" said the first crew member to the guffaws of the others a the table. \"Leave off,\"  said Grace and pinched the barmaid's behind to keep up appearances, the bar maid had some curves, more then Grace did which made her kind of jealous but she reminded herself that she got live adventure most days whilst the tired looking woman serving drinks had to deal with a bunch of drunken men with poor hygiene every night. \"Besides, at least I didn't nearly actually make out with Alfonso,\" continued Grace. <br>\r\n\"I thought he wash jusht being friendly, don't know why the captain letsh that poof sherve aboard hish ship,\" said the first crew member as the sniggers were aimed at his embarrassment instead of Grace's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater Grace and a couple other of the crew drunkenly staggered back to the ship, (in Grace's case the drunkenness was put on) the dark silhouette of which just came into view when Grace felt a hand on her arm. She spun around to see a prostitute giving her a professional grin before saying, \"Evening, sir fancy walking me home, after all I don't want ruffians to take advantage of me,\" she said winking heavily. The rest of the crew that Grace had been with was to busy getting one foot in front of the other to notice what had happen and had already stumbled out of sight. Grace glanced at the lady of negotiable affair, she wasn't the worst lady of the night she had seen, this one was a woman (and didn't have a beard), she might even been quite pretty but she wore so much make up she looked like a clown, and her own hair would of probably been more attractive then the curly wig she wore. Grace shook herself she was really getting good this disguise as a male act, she was now even evaluating prostitutes. Grace gave a slurred noise, tore herself away from the lady of the night, and still keeping in character drunkenly staggered off towards the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been disguised as man for nearly two years now and she had perfected her disguise, though eventually she would have to stop, but what would she do next? That was the problem, there wasn't anything for a women to do, even one with money, other than get married, pop out a couple of kids and raise them, which didn't appeal to her. Motherhood wasn't really Grace's thing, she couldn't pretend to a male for that part and father some. But she couldn't keep this up eventually she would get wounded in a place that would reveal to a doctor her gender, or she would get so drunk that she would actually pay for the services of a prostitute, if that did happen she hope she would have sense (or lack of it) to get one which was actually a man in drag so neither could reveal the other one's secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that point Grace made it to her hammock and saw the woman (other woman, she corrected herself) in some sort of patterned frock. Grace had not hung around earlier to see if any of the slaves captured had decided to join the crew, she guessed none would of but by the looks of it at least one had and they were a woman, who had be given the hammock opposite to her. The woman looked up from a woven bag she had proquired and smiled politely at Grace, who thought she at least try and be polite in return. Grace's Spanish wasn't that good and neither was woman's but after few minutes of conversation Grace was to determine a few things about the new crew member. Her name was Nakin she was about thirty or three hundred years old (base upon Nakin's appearance Grace opted for the former), her husband, fiancee or loan shark had died a few months ago (Grace wasn't sure who but it probably wasn't the last one) and that she was Mayan. This last one didn't mean much to Grace, she knew that there were several different groups of people in the new world but she couldn't tell them apart. Nakin was soft spoken gave of an air of politeness that Grace could pick up even in the make shift talk they had, it was like she always talking at the funeral of someone. It also gave the image of great insight, Grace wasn't sure if she spend a lot time near Nakin in case she found out her secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace decided...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Later people would debate whether Ivan IV had always been evil at heart or if the worst in him had been brought out by the death of his first wife and betrayal by some of his nobles. At this time it was still recent enough after the death of Anastasia, his wife, to warrant his actions as the result of grief rather than a shift in personality, but that didn't make many of them any less terrible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViktoriya crept along the passages of the palace, normally she wouldn't of crept being naturally light footed and easy to miss, but the way the Tsar had been acting the past few months made it prudent to put in the extra effort not to cause a commotion in the middle of the night. Not that Viktoriya came anywhere near the Tsar, she was a night maid and at this time of night the only people who need food or drink were there guards. When she closed the door to the kitchens, in bowels of the palace,  behind her she felt able to stop intentionally being quiet. This wasn't the main kitchen, that was used to cook the main meals, but a small one that supplied the palace's guards throughout the night and could be staffed by only three people. Two people now, Adleida, the other night maid had left a few weeks ago when she got married, so now it was only Viktoriya and Mrs Barinov the chef and elderly, stout woman with a face that look like seen on a tree. Viktoriya's parents had died about a decade earlier when she was still quite young, her official guardian was her uncle, Alex, a drunkard who did odd jobs when he was poor enough to be sober. Whilst this lifestyle could sustain him it didn't factor any dependents and so Viktoriya was raised more or less by Mrs Barinov, who had only known her for about a month when her parents died.<br>\r\nNow that she was in the cozy night kitchen which had a roaring fire, Viktoriya felt able to take off her head scarf an left her long 'dishwater blonde' hair unravel.<br>\r\n\"Viki, you know you should really not do that, what someone came in? You wouldn't be presentable\" said Mrs Barinov.<br>\r\n\"When someone came down hear and saw Adleida without her head scarf on he was so taken with her they eventually got married,\" replied Viktoriya.<br>\r\n\"Or they could think you have no morals,\" said Mr Barinov and left it there, there wasn't much in this interchange of words as they often went through something like this most nights. Mrs Barinov was in her fifties all of her own kids had moved away or passed away, like her husband and she had gone through menopause, as a result she was doting over Viktoriya.<br>\r\n\"How do you expect to get married if you walk around without being properly dressed?\"<br>\r\nViktoriya didn't answer, considering her dress and head scarf were a variety of browns and drab off-whites, she wasn't likely going to get a man through the way she was dressed. Besides Mrs Barinov was only nagging her because she, like all motherly figures cared for her (in this case adoptive) child.<br>\r\n   <br>\r\nAfter a few hours, in which Viktoriya delivered another few drinks it was dawn and she was able to go home. When she arrived Viktoriya found her uncle was waiting for her, \"Viktoriya there you are.\"<br>\r\n'Uh-oh,' she thought to herself, 'this can't be good, he remembers my name, something must of really sobered him up.'<br>\r\n\"Have you got your pay?\" asked her uncle his eyes filled with terror in his pockmarked face. Viktoriya rarely got payed in money more often in leftover food or kitchen utensils. Viktoriya could guess what had happened, along with his drinking, gambling was another one of her uncle Alex's vices and now he owned someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViktoriya decided to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Alice naturally had rather pale skin and short blonde wavy hair, both of which were bleached even paler by the lack of sunlight their received until her skin looked like porcelain and her hair was platinum in colour but no one could tell just by observing this as working in a coal mine for most of her life had given Alice a near permanent layer of dirt and grim. When she was younger Alice had washed away the dirt each day, dreaming of one day being a princess or other kind of nobility and dancing in the great halls of Europe. Later Alice found out that as a member of a proletarian family these things were not meant for her and it was not good to waste water cleaning if you were only going to get just as dirty the next day. <br>\r\nMany mines employed teens and children to work in them, some didn't to avoid controversy but Mr Bradfence was a penny pincher and employing children meant that he didn't have to deal with union demanding pay just parents, who whilst they loved children greatly also needed the extra income. It was not unusual for children as young six to work as miners, it was true that working in a mine dangerous and the ones that do survive eventually hit puberty, it did pay and there was always more children. Minors were used as miners because they were small and skinny and could easily move around the tunnels of a mine. Eventually though these minors hit puberty where upon the boy shoulders broaden and the girl\u2019s hips did the same whilst their chests expanded and members of both gender shot up in height and within a few months they were no longer able to work in the mines. Except for Alice, puberty had come and gone for her with no more than half an inch added to her height, whilst both her chest and hips had only grown enough to be noticeably different only to Alice, And that was that. <br>\r\nShe was now seventeen a good four or five years older than the next oldest person underground, her mother lamented that she doomed to work underground and single for the rest of her life, her father (though he never said it) was happy that she still had work to give money to the family. Alice was the sixth child out of eight, though many of her older siblings had unfortunately not lived to see adulthood such as common in these times, those who had survived how ever had moved out leaving Alice living with her parents, James and Sarah, the two youngest siblings eight and five respectively. With the industrializing of many industries both her mother\u2019s sowing and father\u2019s small scale brewing had found it difficult to keep up. Whilst her older siblings made sure that the family kept its head above water if times got really tough, they had families of their own to worry about and the day to day income came in from the younger children working at the nearby coal mine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice made her way down one of the tunnel when...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had managed to ruin a models make up by putting Essence of cockroach in a models eye liner and switched a managers coffee with 4 shots of espresso. She stood with her back to the elevators wall playing with her  short blue hair, looking at her clear pale skinned face. Her outfit looked pretty Rocking for a punk like herself. Sure she had no tattoos or piercings but that didn't mean she wouldn't go wild!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, how long will it take to get up here\" she said as she buttoned up her cleavage. She wasn't afraid to show her F cups, but her uncle Dr Schultz didn't appreciate it. As she shoved her mini skirt down she made sure there was nothing wrong with her high heel boots. Collecting herself the elevator doors opened. On the other side was an incredibly pregnant woman in a business suit, minus the belly which was on full show. \"Oh god, are you okay?\" Blythe said looking at the poor woman try to shove herself onto the elevator. \"Haha, yeah. Let me just\" The business woman said tried and tried to push through the door frame to no avail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn i may actually have a problem, could you crawl underneath?\" The poor lady pleaded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlythe looked at the great fleshy orb in front of her, it looked so intriguing. \"I guess so\" Blythe said as she went down on all fours. Paying attention to her boots, she made sure she didn't hurt the poor woman. Looking up at the lady's underbelly she couldn't help but touch it. It felt so smooth, so delicate and firm. She traced the woman's belly as the pregnant woman moaned. Blythe saw her start to buckle at the knees. \"Please... Before I crush you... Stop...\" Was all that could escape from the mouth of trapped woman. Blythe didn't need a second warning, she escaped the closing in prison. \"Thank you... I'm... Sarah\" sarah said, reclaiming herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you I'm Blythe \" the punk said, her eyes fixating on Sarah's large belly. \" I'm looking for my uncle, white hair, an eccentric man. Heard of him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, down that corridor, third exit on your left, down another corridor, second door on the right. Oh but before you go, could you help me onto the elevator?\" Sarah said, rubbing her huge expanse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlythe agreed. She tried and tried but couldn't find the best place to push her into the elevator. Looking down she saw Sarah's butt sway like bells in a cathedral. Getting an idea she apologised saying \"I'm sorry for this\" before grabbing onto her butt and pushing her hard into the elevator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Was all Sarah could say in protest but it was too late, those well placed hands were Just the trick. \" oh...\" Sarah said rubbing her juicy plump backside, \" thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" no thank you\" Blythe said blowing Sarah a kiss as the doors closed. What Sarah didn't notice was the two dirty hand marks on her backside. Not exactly a prank but at least people would be talking about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking Sarah's advice she took her directions straight to Dr Schultz's  office. \" hey pops, what's happening?\" Blythe asked jumping on his couch. Dr Schultz looked up from his papers and saw her niece chilling in his office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetie, how good it is to see you, how has your week been?\" Dr Schultz said walking over to the couches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad, family is still getting over grandmas loss, as the brother in law I was amazed by what you two managed to do together.\" Blythe said mourning her grandma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I know!\" The dr said smiling at the memories. \" look, in the will I was entrusted to give an item to someone who I think deserves it most, one of the artefacts we found after WW2.\" Pete Schultz pulled a small item from his breast pocket. It looked like it came from ancient Egypt. \"This little medallion, well it really is an ankh from the Egyptian empire. I know it may not look like much, only the size of a watch, but I assure you, if you take good care of it, it will fill the world with life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlythe looked at it eagerly, an item like that could be worth a small fortune, or if she took care of this, she could gain her uncles respect and this could mean a lot more in the future. Pete looked at his niece and held back on giving the item. \" I need you to promise me something Blythe. If you take this item, you promise me that it will not fall into the wrong hands, that you will not sell it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlythe looked him straight in the eyes ready to answer him, but instead she asked \" you know, there's a good 30 of us in my generation of our family, my siblings could have this, why me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" because I trust you\" Dr Schultz said smiling. Placing the ankh in her hand he asked \" so will you take this on board?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing in Blythe...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The two relatives exchanged goodbyes and Blythe  headed back to the elevator. What she didn't notice on the way down was that the ankh in her pocket had dormant magic inside, not active yet, just . Leaving the building she saw the heavily pregnant woman enter the train station. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking down the street she walked past an antique shop, something she hadn't quite seen before, in the past it was an abandoned construction site. But this looked like it was there for almost centuries. Walking into the dusty old place she went to the counter. A Middle Eastern man in a rich suit came over in a flash. \" hello young lady, what might you be interested in today?\" He said very quickly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" oh, I um I have had this family heirloom and I kinda need to pay the bills for next week, do you have anyone who could tell me what this is worth?\" Blythe said puting the ankh on a chain around her neck whilst looking at the junk on the counter. It was littered with rings, coins with strange designs and there was a bottle of weird liquid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting, you know we have plenty of marking like the ones on this ankh, just look at the ceiling\" the business owner said as he pointed up. As the punk observed the markings the mysterious man shot a bolt of red magic into her new necklace. It glowed and the markings on the ankh disappeared. \"Jennifer come in here! I have a customer, oh I forgot to ask, your name is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's yours first?\" The punk stated looking back at the man quizzically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yaral, sorry that was wrong of me\" Yaral stated. \"Ah Jennifer, here you have to have look, what do you think, real or fake gold?\" A gorgeous woman came out, a pure bombshell with a blue glowing necklace and an amazing dress, Blythe was getting suspicious. What was this model and a rich man doing in a place like this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, i, I think I will head off.\" Blythe stammered as she went to tuck the ankh behind her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, that looks spectacular!\" The beautiful woman said reaching quickly over to touch it. Bathe tried to turn away but it was too late. Jennifers knuckles brushed up against the little magical thing. In an instant the beauty's belly surged forward. Blythe was shocked, what the fuck did she see! In a flash the punk was running out of the magical store not realising her necklace was the source of the power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was fast wasn't it?\" Yaral said laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes master, what would you like me to do now?\" The woman said stroking her bare belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I have no use for you anymore\" he said as he pushed her out the back. As the two left Yaral  took Jennifer's necklace off and pushed her out the back door. \"Hey what the hell?!\" Jennifer said, as she took a hold of her surroundings. Yaral left the man and teleported the shop to his next place of misdeeds. \" oh my god! WHAT THE HELL!? WHEN DID I BECOME PREGNANT!?\" She screamed. She tried to awake the man unconscious next to her... It was going to be a while before he woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was lost for words, did the necklace cause the pregnancy? Should she cancel the date tonight? As if on queue she received a text from Louie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;so, we still on for tonight?&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the phone she typed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She needed to think about this, did the \"ankh\" really make that woman pregnant? She turned around trying to see the name of the antique store, but it had vanished. This was getting a bit much, she had to see her friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlythe went to her favourite store in town, it was called \"The Closet\" and it was run by her friend Hayley, a short, chubby and very geeky gal who ran the cosplaying store, plus an African American flamboyant costume designer who is trying to hold back his homosexual tendencies. Blythe walked into the costume designing place. It was a fusion of the back of a movie set and a an alternative clothing store. Giant versions of regular clothes hung from the ceiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked up to the counter to see Hayley finely putting together a fragile piece of a costume.  Looking up, she saw her friend Blythe looking at her friends prop. \" what's this?\" Blythe asked lifting up what looked like a shield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my shield for my costume for the con in a few days, aren't you going?\" Hayley said brushing a brunette lock from her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" well, I have work on day 1 but I can join you guys for the second day.\" Blythe sighed, she wanted to go both days to the new con in the city, but she needed to pay rent too. \" I actually have something I need to show you, can we go with your magnifying gear into the back of the store? I need you to see something\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two walked into the storage area and locked the door behind them. \" okay so you need to promise me you will not tell anyone about this.\" Blythe warned her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez Blythe, it's like you're killed someone\" Hayley chuckled. \"Okay, okay, I promise, now what's got you all secretive?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlythe pulled out the ankh, it still had a mysterious look to it, it looked like it had faced every test of time, but somehow it appeared to look brand new. \"That looks just like the symbol I need for my shield!\" Hayley said reaching for the ankh. Blythe instantly pulled it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't touch it!\" Blythe shouted trying to cover it in her bosom. \"The last person who touched it became incredibly pregnant, it was as if she had triplets!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay okay, can I at\u0142east cut out a stencil for my costume?\" Hayley said as she tried to stop her hands from np grabbing the magical object. She was a very fidgety woman, she always needed something in her hands to keep her going. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did I just say? I need to test this out first before we do anything, now who should we try it out on\" Blythe said think I out loud. She found a chain to put around the hole in the ankh and then put it around her left wrist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, how about the gym across the street? They have prenatal yoga run by that snobby bitch, you could test it out on her.\" Hayley said in a vengeful way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm alright, I guess she already knows what to do incase of a delivery\" Blythe joke. They both cracked up laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good one high five!\" Hayley laughed, the two smacked their hands together. They didn't see the ankh however hanging on the chain come millimetres away from Hayley's arm. It barely missed her, she was not getting pregnant today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two walked out of the storage room, Blythe smiled at her friend Hayley, she was sometimes a bit glittery, but a good friend none the less. She put her hand on Hayley's shoulder, I a sibling like fashion. Suddenly there as a loud gurgle come from  Hayley stomach<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, I think my lunch made a bad turn at a corner of my stomach and digesting...\" Hayley squirmed, and ran for the bathroom. Blythe sighed and followed her.  All she could hear from outside the door was some horrid sounds. It didn't stop, it sounded like two Moose screwing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything I can do?\" Blythe asked as she knocked on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, *uurp* don't know what is coming over me, you better, UUURRRKK, go I'll be here a while. \" Hayley tried to say between fowl moments we dare not speak of.

The <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">gimmick</span> err I mean unique feature of this story is that ankh can turn up through out different points of history.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall Rules:<br>\r\n-No character under the age of 18 can be portrayed in a sexual manner.<br>\r\n-No character under the age of 16 can become pregnant.<br>\r\n-No Mpreg<br>\r\n-Keep it as you can the PG-13<br>\r\nAlways leave at least 2 options (except when you are finishing a story, where should be none or one call \u00e2\u0080\u0098epilogue\u00e2\u0080\u0099.)<br>\r\n-All chapters must be at least one paragraph long (except for chapters that only are giving options).<br>\r\n-Decent spelling and grammar, no need to be perfect but please make an effort.<br>\r\n-No offensive entries. <br>\r\n- Whilst complete historic accuracy is not expect a general effort should be made to keep the historic relevant. About the same amount the same amount historic accuracy as found in Blackadder (if you haven't seen it then you're missing out).<br>\r\n-I will be giving out GP for well written chapters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow the Ankh works (I apologise for the amount of these)<br>\r\n-The ankh increases the \u00e2\u0080\u0098fertility\u00e2\u0080\u0099 of woman who comes into contact with the ankh. Fertility could be many different things ranging from; a more likely chance to conceive, up to make the woman instantly pregnant with a large amount of babies, or anything in between.<br>\r\n-Contact with the ankh could mean just touching it, or holding it in their hand or wearing it as part of a necklace or putting it in a pocket.<br>\r\n-The ankh's appearance is always the same. A few centimeters long and made of gold, the kind of thing that could be on a necklace, it is strangely always warm to the touch. <br>\r\n-The ankh can affect rate of a pregnancy either slowing it down or speeding it up, and the rate is not fixed. For example a character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pregnancy could increase at normal speed until they reach the third month where it is sped up so they reach the sixth months in a manner of minutes for going through the seventh month of the course of a week then back to normal speed. It can pause the pregnancy entirely but not make it go in reverse.<br>\r\n-Even if the changes are \u00e2\u0080\u0098instantaneous\u00e2\u0080\u0099 it still must take place over the course of a couple of seconds, so the character is visible seen to grow, rather than to just appear pregnant. Though if someone is distracted or blinks at the wrong time it may seem that way.<br>\r\n-It does not affect reality or people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s memories , the ankh does not change what happen in the past so the newly pregnant character does not have a wardrobe full of maternity clothes or a high chair already etc. Nor are people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s memories , the characters will notice the mother-to-be\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weight gain, morning sickness etc. and act accordingly.<br>\r\n-The ankh does not always need to affect a woman who comes into contact with it.<br>\r\n-If a character already affected by the ankh comes in contact with it again, it could change the speed of the pregnancy, the amount of babies or have no affect what so ever.<br>\r\n-Whist the ankh only works directly on humans other life form in the vicinity of the ankh have in fertility eg crops with rich harvests.<br>\r\n-The ankh can't make a woman who has gone through menopause pregnant. <br>\r\n-The ankh can malfunction though it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s already erratic behavior may suggest that it is already is malfunctioning.<br>\r\n-The ankh can be broken, though doing so may affect those under its affect. Furthermore the ankh has uncanny tenancy to find its way into the hand of people after being disposed of. So smashing it with a hammer or melting in down will get rid of it, but if it is thrown into a river or buried underground someone will soon find it somehow.<br>\r\n-The ankh can make it possible for a woman to have up to twenty babies at once, this maximum may change. <br>\r\n-The ankh cannot remove babies as once it has created life it cannot take it away. Another artifact might be able to which may also have some other opposite effects, it up the author to decide.<br>\r\n-Whilst the ankh allows the woman to carry the amount of babies that might otherwise be impossible and may prevent cosmetic difficulties like stretch marks it does not make the pregnancy any physically easier than if they were having that many children naturally.
