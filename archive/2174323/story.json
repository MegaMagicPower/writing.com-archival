            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Goddess of Gluttony was bored. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer influence was at an all-time high yes, but it was a slow growth still, so she sat up on high above the world, looking for anything to entertain herself with. Messing with mortals normally gave a great round of joy, yet over her long life she had found and driven to death many ways of interacting with the little ones below. From simply appearing and fattening some poor random person in an instant to slowly molding their mind over the course of years to be a good little piggy for their Goddess, she had seemed to hit the proverbial wall of ways she could apply her ideals of hedonism on to the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as she peered down at what the humans called a \"Cirus\" that something caught her eye. A show displaying the supposed talents of a hypnotist. What a novel idea Gluttony thought, hypnotism. Of course, she knew that the man putting the show on was more actor than mesmerizer, using people already paid to play their parts when called upon to the stage, but she also knew of true hypnotism. Though not the all-consuming domination of mind many believed it to be, it was still real and allowed those who could perform it to \"nudge\" their victim's thoughts, though to try and force a change too drastically different from what the victim would normally want risks breaking the hypnosis. It is for the best really, the Goddess thought, if they had access to an ability that allowed them complete and unyielding control over others minds the world would likely have gone into chaos long ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she pondered this curiosity it was almost like the clouds surrounding her came to life and struck her with a jolt of inspiration! That's it, she thought with great enthusiasm as she rapidly descended from her perch and began to glide about close to the ground looking this way and that way, herself going unnoticed by mortals liked she had willed it to be. She was looking for someone, someone with a glow of true gluttony in them yet without the means to indulge it. Mind control! It excited her to think of the possibilities, and all from such a simple idea! Find a mortal that grabbed her interest, give them the gift of mind control, and simply sit back and watch as the ever-creative possibilities of a humans mind did the rest! The plan was set and all she needed was the right person for the show to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo then, who would be so lucky as to receive her gift?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright, let's get the obvious out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirl, Boy, or something else?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Samantha Alson was lazy in one sense, a hard worker in another depending on how you looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom a young age the girl was always trying to find the next big \"Get Rich Quick\" scheme to waste her time on before moving on to the next one. By nature she hated the idea of having to work for a living, the thought alone disgusted her, but she wasn't blind to the fact that she couldn't just sit around and do nothing for free. For almost all 18 years of her life she has searched high and low for a way to be able to laze about and earn money all at the same time, a venture many others have already taken on and failed, yet her determination was a sight to behold. From every possible contest with a grand prize she could mail in for to every \"Work from home and be make THIS kind of money\" job she could find she wanted nothing more than that long sought after dream of success without the hard work. In the meantime she was an ordinary high school senior, the almost perfect model for the typical bright blond teenage American girl with a simple sense of style, \"almost\" meaning she was overweight at 183 pounds. Everything set well on her, from the smooth curve of her plump rear melding perfectly into the slope of her thick thighs, to her modestly large buxom that she could lay her wide arms on to even her surprisingly angular face free of blemishes framed by her wavey, shoulder-length hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs of now she was headed to her room after another normal day in the life. Wake up, check her online business hoping to finally have hit a jackpot, eat a breakfast of five doughnuts and a coffee with extra creamer, trudge through school, get home and argue with mom again about her lifestyle, weight, ridiculous scams, or some mixture of the three, half-heartedly wave to her twin sisters on the way to her room, then sit around planning her next money making idea while waiting for dinner<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving unloaded herself of her bookbag and school shoes she beelined for her computer and took a seat after pressing its power button. She was eager to check on her latest investment, a hardy purchase of ten MEME-COINs, which with excitement she had seen netted her a thousand actual dollars when she had checked this morning. Of course, it was far from enough to live off, but it was clear that as long as she kept making smart investments and a close track of MEME-COIN's value she would eventually-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what the hell is it saying? Oh god no please not this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was looking at the latest news for MEME-COIN plus the total worth of the ten she had managed to hoard. She looked hard, double checked with other news sources and MEME-COIN owners, reloaded the site a few times even. It still said the same thing, the MEME-COIN economy had crashed while she was at school and her's were now worthless, no more than the code they were made of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FUUUUUUUUAAAAAAAAGGHH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a great shove, she sent herself wheeling from her desk until she bumped into her bed, which she unceremoniously collapsed into with a mighty \"UGH\". She stayed like that, not daring to move and set herself off, if her mom heard her stomping around it would just be another argument which would just spiral out of control at that point. Her face down position made it rather easy for a surprise guest to enter the room and sit on the forgotten computer chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that just won't do now, will it? How can you possibly live your idyllic life of loafing about free of responsibility if you can not afford it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha wanted to scream, to jump from her be and run downstairs to her mom and tell her to call the police, to be able to do anything a rational person would do if they heard a strangers voice suddenly in their room that wasn't there before, but she couldn't as her body very calmly sat itself up and looked to the voice's owner. And what an owner it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeautiful was the word that came to Samantha's mind, yet to give detail to why the woman was that way seemed impossible. To the plain eye she would only appear as a pleasantly plump, nude woman with golden hair, but the ethereal white glow she radiated told of how a closer inspection would show her skin was perfect and untainted, her hair flowing in a wind unfelt or seen, her eyes so deep and blue you think an ocean was truly splashing about in them. She wore no clothing, what little modesty she had being maintained by the convenience of her hair over her bust and the way she sat with her legs crossed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry for the forced calm dear, but I've grown a bit tired of the usual confusion and awe that comes with meeting me. You're still free to speak your mind though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was meant to come out less like a simple query and more demanding, but it seemed being able to talk didn't mean being able to talk like how she actually felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've gone by a few names, and I've been worshipped for a number of things, but at its simplist I am the Goddess of Gluttony, and I have come to you baring a gift, one I think you'll find quite useful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere it was Samantha thought, she was going to get killed, or taken advantage of, or...get a petite little kiss on the forehead with a tiny sparkle. From where the woman's lips had touched her forehead a warm comforting feeling slowly spread across her body until it reached her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind control my dear, in the purest form imagined. It's easy, just speak your command and others will obey, no strings attached.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMind control? The supposed Goddess of Gluttony had given her the power to manipulate others minds? Was she stressing so hard that she was hallucinating?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No hallucination love, it is real and yours to use as you see fit, though I will admit that I choose you in specific for your...<b>unique</b> personality and way of thinking. It will be a great thing to watch, but like I said it's all up to you on how you use it as I am sure you'll make great use of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a bit of a flourish the godly woman stood and gave Samantha's head a gentel pat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With that said I believe it's about time I left and let you figure out the rest yourself, tata love!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she was gone, no flash or slow fade, no portal or flying through a wall, just here in one moment and gone the next. At first the bewildered young woman just stayed seated where she was on the bed, but as the strange calmness that had gripped her slowly let go and logic and reasoning returned to her it felt like she was going to have a heart attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck just happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was off the bed in a second and pacing her room, trying to put any kind of semblance of understanding together for what she just experienced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the actual fuck just happened?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of running downstairs to her mother she ran to the hallway bathroom. She needed to try and clear her mind before she tried talking to anyone about the crazy shit she just went through. Once inside she slapped herself a few times, looked over herself in the mirror for anything that seemed off, felt the spot where she was kissed on the forehead, before at last splashing herself with some water before looking into the mirror again and taking a few deep breaths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It couldn't have been real, a god woman just randomly giving me the power to control people...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as you looked at yourself in the mirror the idea wouldn't leave. As silly as it sounded it was very much appealing. It would be the ultimate answer to her life long quest for freedom from the tedium of life, to be able to laze about all day without a care in the world. Maybe she was going off the deep end here, but maybe...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If...if that was real, then I would need to test it out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood in the bathroom for a bit longer lost in contemplation, her mind going back and forth on the absurdity of it all when she decided what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <b>need</b> to test it. I've tried literally everything else no matter how little the chance, what harm could come from trying another crazy idea?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be simple, make an offhanded comment and see if they ignored it or actually did it. Simple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just gotta figure out who.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tentatively, Samantha walked downstairs, making her way into the kitchen where her mother was starting to prepare dinner, a depressingly small pile of vegetables with a pan of rice on the stove. She glared at her daughter as she made her way over to the cooker, and Samantha paused for a moment, not knowing whether she dared to push her luck, to test the limits of the power the Goddess had supposedly granted her. One look at the intended meal pushed her over the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI want pizza tonight,\u201d she said. Her mother paused for a moment, looked as though she was about to say something, then shook her head, as though attempting to dismiss an unwelcome thought before reaching for her phone, scrolling through the display to find the nearest takeout place. With a gleaming smile, Samantha added, \u201cBetter add that to your favorites.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSure,\u201d her mother replied. \u201cMaybe a small\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI want an extra-large deep dish with stuffed crust, with extra cheese, tomato, pepperoni, peppers, ham, bacon, and maybe some more cheese as well,\u201d Samantha interrupted. \u201cAnd some fried chicken. And a bottle of soda.\u201d She paused, then added, \u201cThey do cheesecake, don\u2019t they? Some of that.\u201d She turned away, heading for the cupboard, looking in vain to see if there were any snacks while the order was phoned through, just as she had asked for, much to her amazement. Her mother put her phone back onto the counter, then continued to prepare the dinner for the rest of the family, almost as though she\u2019d forgotten what she had just done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt had worked. Unbelievably, it had worked. She patted her belly, the buttons already beginning to strain a little from her covert indulgence, and sat down on the couch, allowing herself to daydream a little as she waited for the order to arrive, flicking through the channels, this time paying special attention to the fast food adverts. Her mouth watered a little, and after what seemed like hours, the doorbell rang, and she raced to answer it, taking the food out of the hands of the delivery boy, boxes of glorious junk food destined for her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe brought her treasure back into the kitchen, ignoring the disdain of the others as she laid out her food on the table, pushing the rice dish perilously close to the edge in her eager greed. She took the first piece, waiting for a sarcastic comment that never came, and gobbled it down in three quick bites, the greasy cheese sliding into her mouth, tomato splattering on her lips. Then a second piece, and a third, before she remembered the chicken strips, greedy fingers reaching into the packages, dunking them in the calorie-laden sauce before poking them into her mouth, licking her fingers before returning to the pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA glass had been placed on the table, but she ignored it, taking swigs of the soda straight from the bottle as she gorged her way through the feast, alternating between chicken and pizza, grunting and groaning as she gobbled away at the food. Finally, the boxes were empty, but she reached for the cheesecake, snatching a fork and stuffing it into her mouth, chocolate and cream joining the tomato and cheese on her jiggling chin. Finally, there was a faint pop, and she looked down to see two of the buttons of her top giving up, exposing her bulging belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s more like it,\u201d Samantha said. \u201cYou know, Mum, I think you were right. I do need to go on a diet, right away. I\u2019m going to need your help, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOf course,\u201d she replied, a smile on her face. \u201cI\u2019m just glad you realize you\u2019ve got a problem. I\u2019ll make sure you get whatever you need.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGood,\u201d Samantha said with a smile, patting her belly. \u201cAfter all, you know that I\u2019m dangerously underweight right now\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was all real! She could make anyone do anything and all she had to do was tell them to do it! As you sat there at the dining table, freshly stuffed and gently rubbing your distended tummy you felt better than you thought possible. The possibilities coursed through your mind, there was nothing you weren't allowed to do anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her mind ran wild a loud gurgle informed her that her body had other ideas. As big as an eater as she could be she had never had the chance to indulge like she just had and quickly she could feel herself drifting towards a food coma. Her first thought was to fight it, to live in this moment as long as possible, but she decided that with the Goddess's power you had all the time to do whatever you wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made a few quick decisions and stumbled to her feet, holding her happily stuffed stomach as she got ready for the slow walk to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'm going to take a nap, don't bother me while I'm laying down, even if I sleep through the night and it's the next morning just let me sleep in, I'm not going back to that fuck fest called school anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had just turned to head to her room when her mother called out to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Samantha Alson, going to sleep this early and not going back to school one thing, but you know well that you have to clean up after yourself still young lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back she saw her mothers scolding face was on, gesturing to the aftermath of her binge, empty boxes strewn about randomly on the dining table with bits of grease and sauce splattered here and there, having pushed your moms and sisters plates to the edges of the table. The sight made her smile as it gave her a small idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't have to clean that up, in fact no one is going to, you're all going to just leave it there and work around it, I want it to stay so whenever I wake up I can see it and know I haven't just been dreaming all this, got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older woman immediately smiled and went back to eating her rabbit food at the edge of the table along with the twins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay dear, have a nice nap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking the well-fed girl again began to head to her room, passing out almost instantly after getting into bed,  a feeling of excitment sitting inside even as she passed out into a food coma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">------------------------------------------------------------</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe round teenager woke up to the sound of her phone alarm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning loudly she turned it off and groggily stood. That was a nice dream, she thought, but they were fleeting and it was time to face another drab day in real life. She noticed her tummy seemed a bit bigger though, but really when wasn't it growing even if just a little?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stretched and walked with a sleepy stumble to the bathroom only to find it already occupied by one of the twins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, can you <b>please</b> hurry it up for once?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll try, but I just got in here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UGH, whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow somewhat irritated she went to the kitchen, hoping she could snag something more palatable than one of her mom's gag-worthy health cereals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking in she was greeted by the sight of her mom already sitting at the table eating a bowl of grains she had poured herself. She looked up and seemed surprised as her daughter trudged in through the kitchen door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hello dear, I didn't think I'd see you up so early, did you change your mind about going to school? I would really appreciate it if you kept going you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Wha'cha talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping mid-walk Samantha looked at the head of the household with confusion. As she was about to press her mother more about whatever she was talking about her mind fully awakened as when she saw <b>it</b>. Her mess from last night still sitting right where it had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thrill ran all throughout her body. It really, REALLY happened and she really could make the world do whatever she told it to. Once again her mind filled with ideas.

Despite the lack of a larger family she still clearly enjoys life so far, getting to spend some time with her friends at school and helping her mother, who owns the local bakery in the middle of the town. She would work so hard to help where she could at the store, made all the better whenever she was rewarded with some treats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother had opened the doors of her little bakery only a few years ago, her love of making and baking on full display. It was baked into her soul having grown up surrounded by cooking throughout her own childhood and was more than eager to install the same kind of love into her own daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne night Sally awoke from a fading dream of freedom. A freedom to eat as many sweets as she wanted without restraint, something she had hoped for since her mother had first given her a cupcake. Her late-night musings of sweet foods got her tubby tummy eager to be filled as it let out a growl of want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sally was just slipping out of bed a bright shining light blinded her for a short moment before just as quickly fading, leaving the young lass baffled and shocked as in the lights absence now stood a beautifully plump woman smiling gently down at the chubby child. Strangely feeling unafraid despite her great confusion Sally spoke hesitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm... Hi!  W...Who are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman smiled brighter as she kneeled down infront of Sally, placing a gentle hand on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can go by many names, sweetheart!  But you can just call me Goddess of Gluttony. You see little one, I\u2019m here because I want to help make your dream into reality.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally wasn't sure what the strange lady meant, how could she make her dreams come true?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-what do you mean? How can you do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goddess simply leaned forward and pressed a soft kiss to Sally's forehead, sending a small pleasant jolt throughout her body. After the feeling left her Sally was just left as confused as ever and looked to the goddess for an explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat power that I just gave you is what I like to call \"The Gift of Control\"!   Whatever you say will be done, and it works on absolutely anyone, including your mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe added a small wink with that last sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sure that will help you achieve your dream, this power that now possess you. I\u2019ll be keeping an eye on your progress my dear child, so be sure to make good use of my gift. Now I must really be going, so ta-ta for now!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Goddess gives her farewells before instantly flashing that light again and disappearing completely leaving an ever still confused Sally standing alone in her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that all about?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the only thing Sally could ask herself after such a strange event, but yet something stuck to the back of her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can...just tell people what to do now and they'll do it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas this an answer to her wish? Was this all a dream still? Whatever just happened Sally wasn't hungry anymore and just wanted to get back to sleep and so crawled back into bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slept dreamlessly the rest of the night onto the next morning, where it was time for her to head to...</span></div></div>",

Regardless she needed to get something to eat and quickly made the decision to go to her mother's bakery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile normally Sally only ever helped around the bakery and got just a few scant treats here and there for reward, she couldn't help but just imagine all the delicious baked goods she could eat if given the chance. Trying her best to put those thoughts aside she got dressed properly and left her house, taking the short walk over to the bakery where she was greeted by her mother working hard as ever. Sally waved excitedly to grab her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Mommy, I\u2019m here!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh hey sweetie!  Wanna help me with the bakery today?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I can do that!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally washed her hands and dawned her cute little apron, unaware of how different of a day it was going to be at the bakery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want me to do Mommy?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm...could you be my taste tester today and make sure all my pastries are extra yummy today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe offer left Sally pleasantly confused. Her mother never offered her to taste test, she didn't even taste her own goods as she just that confident in her ability, but the little girl didn't really care as the chance to have a bit of every treat cooked today was too good to question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, I can do that, Mommy!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother was delighted to hear Sally's enthusiasm and swiftly got her daughter seated at a table, smiling wide when she heard her little girl's tummy growl loudly, before going to grab the first treat to be taste tested.</span></div></div>",

He may have loved them so much, but there was one thing he wouldn\u2019t like the most, is when his mother is very strict on everything, including food for that matter.  His sister seems respectful and accepted an idea on this policy, but Sam is not in favor of these and feels like a prison he wouldn\u2019t be able to get out of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worst of these is when he\u2019s not allowed eating junk food at all, and he has to certain healthy foods, which he finds it tasteless, to say the least.  The only time he gets his free time is he could only spend time with friends, but for an hour, and that does not give Sam independence from his very strict mother, and he needed big changes to let him have his will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was when it happened early in the morning when every day he would have to get up at seven in the morning.  He was very tired, but also hungry, but not a fan of his mother\u2019s tastes of her strictness.  He sighed and was about to get changed when there a bright light shines in his bedroom before his eyes saw a woman, who looks so plump with spender clothes.  She smiled and greeted the youngster with a charming voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello there, young man!  I am the Goddess of Gluttony, and I\u2019m here to help you solve your problems straight away.\u201d  The woman who is called the Goddess introduced herself, making Sam looking a lot puzzled and asked about her more in detail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?  Umm... I do have a problem with my Mom and Sister because of the strict diet I had to take, but how did you know?\u201d  Sam wondered after he explained his experience dealing with the two people he couldn\u2019t stand in general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I know everything, and here\u2019s something I would like to give you.\u201d  The Goddess replied and waddles close and sits on the bed beside Sam.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young twelve-year-old wasn\u2019t sure what was going on, but he soon finds out when the Goddess gets closer and gives a kiss on his forehead.  That gives him some sensation feeling all over his body and felt like he had some power or some sorts.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa!  I don\u2019t know If I\u2019m feeling powerful or what?  But why did you kiss me though?\u201d  Sam would ask that since it feels that it was an only option the Goddess could help with these.  But she didn\u2019t mind explaining the exact reason as she smiled with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, That gives you the Gift of Control!  You can Control everyone\u2019s mind and do as you say, especially if it involved food, like my biggest hobbies I get.\u201d  The Goddess explains before she would wave farewells and flashed, disappeared in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom that moment on, it did made Sam fully understand what\u2019s she was trying to do, but when she says about controlling everyone\u2019s minds, he suddenly begins to snicker and would think this sounds like a clever idea after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm... this sounds like fun!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few moments ago, Sam had been greeted by the Goddess and granted his will to control everything he wants.  Despite it felt weird, to begin with, he wanted to see if this stuff works when the first person he wanted to try it on is his mother, Cara.  He knew she\u2019s very strict about foods that are healthy in all, but Sam could wonder if this Gift of Control can make his mother changed her heart and think otherwise?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s what he\u2019s about to find out and he went over to the kitchen to see Cara making food.  But something\u2019s different dramatically, and Sam could see it straight away.  All he can see is the food his mother\u2019s making is all junk food that she and her sister despises heavily, and it looked as though it could be more than one plate his mother is serving this here.  Sam couldn\u2019t even believe it as it was only a day ago that he was only getting healthy meals.  But fast forward right now, everything\u2019s completely different!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would have to wonder why it had suddenly happened so quickly, and the only thought he could think of is the Goddess he saw earlier.  That\u2019s when he realized that the Gift Of Control had certainly worked and this was all he recommended all of this time.  Now, he would have to act as if he doesn\u2019t know what granted him and puts on a surprise expression by approaching his mother in a stunned way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM...Mom?  Why are you cooking junk food?\u201d  Sam asked, hoping to hear if Cara\u2019s reactions are much different than she normally does throughout her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy you ask?\u201d  Cara asked whilst turning around to see her son looking puzzled.  She continued saying with a smiling look on her face.  \u201cI\u2019ve just wanted to make you something that satisfies your tastes.  Besides, who needs healthy foodstuff when you can stuff so many sugars and fattening tastes as much as you can?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam may have realized his mother\u2019s expression is very different than previously, and now everything had completely changed, it feels like he\u2019s going to enjoy this for a very long time.  He can only imagine in taste and eating loads of junk food would make it delicious, to say the least.  Will this expectation be materialized?  Only one thing to find out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if that\u2019s the case, I would like to eat loads of these as much as I can.\u201d  Sam says with a smile and sits at the kitchen table, waiting for his mother to present the junk food to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam wouldn\u2019t want to complain since he basically knew his stuff was working so well in his favor.  He received a plate full of burgers and hot dogs and that wasn\u2019t all as far as he can see and hear the food is still cooking, so he feels he\u2019s getting more than just one from his mother.  Sam was about to start eating when Cara comes over and gives him an offer to start things off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoney, do you Mommy to feed you?\u201d  Cara asked if she\u2019s willing to help out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam would have to be grateful with a smile and says in response from the choices down below.</span></div></div>",

He even had posters up too, just so he had to admire in some ways, he recently figured and imagined himself being as big as his aunt for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when the problems comes in.  Even though he liked that idea as such, but his family didn\u2019t think it was necessary and branded plus-sized model as \u201ca shame and a bad image of all mankind\u201d.  Lewis doesn\u2019t see it this way, but realised he\u2019s the youngest and too weak to control things whatever he wants.  He would\u2019ve wish he wanted to do things his way and also wished his family should let him get his moment and get him bigger and fatter to make his dreams come true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut right now, all he could do is letting out a sigh and gets on with it.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Maxwell, or Max as most people called him, was a fairly average boy on the verge of his teenage years. He had short brown hair with striking blue eyes and he was a bit chubby, but not enough to draw any negative attention from his peers. He was inherently smart, but never put too much effort into school, and it showed in his grades, as they were above average, but didn't compare to the overachieving workaholics who got As in every class. Max loved eating, and he gladly stuffed his face with whatever delicious food his dad would cook. He also loved the occasional trips to restaurants and loved fast food, even though his parents kept him from having fast food most of the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis dad Steve, the biological parent, was mostly a stay at home dad aside from the occasional errand or Uber run for a bit of extra cash. He was a great cook and a bit of a neat freak, and he was very protective of his son Max. His ex-fiancee and Max's biological mother Sharon was quite abusive and toxic, and Steve finally left her and took a young Max with him at the urging of his family. Not too long afterward, he met Brenda, his current wife, and Max's stepmom, who was really more of a mom to Max than his biological mom ever was. Brenda was a workaholic, and she had a good bank job, good enough to score her family a comfortable upper-middle-class life in the suburbs. She loved having a family to come home to, but she felt bad about not being able to spend a lot of time with Max.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, Max was getting home on an average school day, ready to slunk into his room. It seemed like school was getting to be more and more of a pain in the ass with each passing year. His dad wanted to drive him to and from school, but he always insisted on walking, as he wanted to feel independent, and his school wasn't very far away. He gave his dad the obligatory hug before walking upstairs to his room. His mom was still at work, of course. As he shed his backpack, he heard a voice saying, \"Young man: You have been chosen to receive a very special gift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turns out, this was the Goddess of Gluttony. She thought for a while about how she'd give Max the gift of hypnosis, and she decided to not physically show herself to make her seem more like a goddess and not just some random lady that snuck into Max's room. Max was quite startled and shaken, but he said, \"Is this some sort of prank?\" and the Goddess of Gluttony said, \"No, my child. I am a very special kind of goddess, and you are very special yourself. You possess the perfect traits to receive my gift!\" and Max said, \"A gift, huh? Then prove it!\" and the Goddess of Gluttony said, \"Very well. It's unreasonable for me to expect you to believe me thus far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, an orb of light appeared out of nowhere in front of Max. The orb was covered in black and white spinning, swirling patterns. It was very mesmerizing, and Max let out an incredulous, \"Whoa, what?\" and before he knew it, the orb rocketed into his chest, causing Max's chest to glow before disappearing. \"You have received a very special power, Max. Use it well. I know you will!\" and Max asked, \"Wait, what is this power?\" but he got no response, as the goddess had already left, wanting to see how Max discovers the power for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax went downstairs, and his dad Steve said, \"Hey Max, what's up? You're usually not down here this early before dinner!\" and Max wanted to say something to his dad about this, but he wasn't sure if he should, or if he'd just sound crazy. Steve said, \"Well, in any case, I'm gonna give a couple of rides before I start dinner.\" and Max said, \"Why, just start dinner earlier. I'm starving!\" and Steve's eyes widened a bit before he said, \"Sure thing, son. What do you want for dinner?\" As a joke, Max said, \"Let's just have dessert! Didn't you say you were making a cheesecake today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve, much to Max's surprise, said, \"Sounds like a plan, Max! That makes my job easier cause it should be nice and cold by now.\", taking Max literally. At this point, Max was getting very suspicious. He was trying to pass off what just happened in his room as a weird daydream, but now, his dad was acting funny, doing whatever he wanted him to. Max then said, \"Dad, start making me another dessert while I have the whole cheesecake to myself!\" and Steve said, \"How do brownies sound? I can get those in the oven pretty fast.\" and as Steve preheated the oven, Max said, \"Brownies sound awesome, but you're seriously going to let me eat all of the cheesecake?\" and Steve said, \"If that's what you want. If you want something else, I'll gladly make it for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax then realized that he wasn't dreaming, and he said, \"Dad, pinch me!\" and Steve complied, giving Max's forearm a hard pinch. \"I guess I'm not dreaming!\" Max said, and Steve said, \"Definitely not!\" Max smiled widely as he realized that he had the power to make his dad do whatever he wanted. Little did he know, he had that power over everyone! Either way, now that Max was aware of his gift, he decided to...</span></div></div>",

He had had cheesecake in the past, so this was nothing new to him. However, this was something different. Max wanted--no, needed the cheesecake. It wasn't a compulsive craving, it was something more than that. Something bestial inside him. Or at least, that's how he felt. The boy dug into the cheesecake with only his bare hands at first, shortly after his father coming over with a cake knife and some other utensils so his son could eat. \"If I knew you were this hungry for cheesecake, I would've made more!\" His father chuckled as he walked back into the kitchen. He was only in the next room, so his father could easily get to him, but that also meant his father could hear him tearing away at the cheesecake in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Max was finishing up the cheesecake, his father brought in some brownies. Max let out a hearty belched before his dad said, \"I figured you were pretty hungry there, champ. There's more on the way, so don't worry!\" Max, his power getting to him, said, \"Good! I am pretty hungry.\" His tone was full of command, as if he were a king ordering his dad. \"Anything you want in particular son?\" His dad asked, trying to please him. \"Another cake! But make it chocolate fudge this time!\" His dad just smiled and went back into the kitchen to cook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Max sat back in the kitchen chair, looking at the near empty plate of cheesecake, as well as the platter fully of brownies, he admired his new power. He absentmindedly rubbed his belly, and noticed it was poking out from his shirt a bit. He figured it was because of the cheesecake, but shrugged it off for now. As he lazily reached over for a brownie, he was thinking. Thinking about what he should do next with his power. He could bring a friend over and share his great power, or he could venture off into the real world and abuse it some more. Both were tempting, given his friends would probably like his power and that he could probably eat wherever he wanted for free. Eventually Max decided on...</span></div></div>",

I don't really mind any other fetishes you might want to had to a story path just so as long as you keep a larger focus on the two main ideas of the story, I.E. mind control and weight gain.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cppink\">2. Please, no short chapters (As in anything less than a standard paragraph) if you can help it, it's just monotonous, lazy and will be edited or outright deleted. I understand that sometimes choices are too simplistic for any real content to be derived from them but please give it an honest attempt first.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cyellow\">3. Don't try and pigeon hole other contributors choices by adding a chapter that contradicts the choices they added. Part of the fun of interactives is not knowing what choices will take you where and trying to force multiple choices down the same road ruins the fun for everyone.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpteal\">4. I encourage large and insane levels of weight gain, but they have to be earned. A character can get be so fat they eclipse the Earth, yes, but it has to happen in a process over many chapters, no \"Then they ate for years on end until they were bigger than the universe.\" please.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just ask that you try and keep these in mind if you feel inclined to add a chapter or two, otherwise, you're free to do as you want, and if you have a problem with one of the rules or a decision I make regarding your chapter please just email me onsite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's all from my big mouth, enjoy the story!</td>",
