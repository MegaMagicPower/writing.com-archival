Up until a year ago, you've lived in an orphanage your whole life. Your parents died when you were just a baby. But when they died, they left you a special ring of keys.  You soon learned that those keys were gatekeys, which allowed someone to summon a spirit from the spirit world. As you got older, you gained more keys and got more powerful with your combat and magic power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you are in the town of Magnolia, searching for a suitable guild to start your career as a wizard. You were walking around town in your blue jeans, black v-neck shirt, black sneakers, blue backpack and a black belt holding your gatekeys. You were marveled at the activity of this town! Everyone had a smile on their faces, venders selling multitudes of merchandise. Men on a boat happily rowing across the river. It was so peaceful! Then you saw a giant building in the distance. You got curios and started to head to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then a giant man obstructed your view. \"Where you going, punk?\" He said. You also notice that there were five other shady-looking men circling you. \"I'm just minding my own business. I'm new here.\" You reply. You try to walk last them, but the guy in front if you blocked your path. \"Oh a tourist huh? I think we're entitled to a fee for tourists like you, right boys?\" He said. The other cronies laughed and agreed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have any money. Now please let me through.\" You implore. The guy's eyes then went down to your belt. \"How about those keys of yours buddy?\" He reached for your keys am you immediately steppe back. \"Keep your hands away from my keys!\" I warned. This seemed to piss the guy off. \"Don't tell me what to do you little punk! We're  the Broken Skull gang here in Magniolia and we don't take orders from anyone but us! Now give us those keys and we'll let you live!\" He angrily threatened. His other boys close in on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could react you heard, \"Why don't you guys pick on someone your own size?!\" You all turn to the voice and see..... </span></div></div>",

And I done know about you, Happy, but I'm all fired up now!\" He said, talking to his cat. \"Aye sir!\" The ....cat said? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a little freaked out at the sight of a talking cat. You were even more freaked out when the pink-haired guy's fist started on fire. He then charged at the \"boss\" of the gang members. \"Fire Dragon Iron Fist!\" He said and his fist crashed right into the brute's face! This sent the guy flying away who knows how far. The other guys were in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Just who do you think you are, ya little punk?!\" One of the remaing gangsters said furiously. He went to charge at the pink haired guy, but one of his friends stopped him. \"Hold on man! I've heard of this guy! The pink hair, the fire magic, the scaley-looking scarf, there's no doubt about if. This guys the Salamander!\" He said in fear. The other guys then echoed him in terror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Salamander. You've heard if that name before. He was supposed to be a very powerful wizard, and he didn't disappoint. \"Alright you jackasses! Time for you to pay for picking on innocent people!\" The guys shouted in anger. The cat nodded in agreement with him and suddenly spawned wings and floated beside him. \"That was wired.\" You thought in your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour attention snapped to the pink haired dude when he slammed his fists together and a magic circle appeared in front of his face. \"Fire Dragon Roar!\" She screamed and suddenly a huge storm of fire shot out of his mouth! The fire collided with the thugs and they were sent flying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were amazed with what you just saw. One guy took on a whole bunch of thugs with difficulty and with such power! You were stunned. The guy then turned to you and smiled. \"Hey, you alight? Those assholes didnt hurt you did they?\" He asked. You shook your head. \"Awesome I'm Natsu! This is Happy!\" He said, pointing to his cat friend. \"Hi!\" The blue cat said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled. \"Nice to meet you! I'm (name). Thanks for you're help, but I had that. I'm a wizard too!\" You tell him while holding up your ring of keys. Natsu's eyes lit up. \"You're a celestial wizard?\" He asked curiously. You nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's awesome! We have a celestial wizard back at the guild! You can come with us!\" Natsu said. You were excited at the thought at meeting another celestial wizard. \"Sure! Would it be possible if I could join? I've been searching for a guild to join.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu smiled. \"Yeah sure! Everyone's welcome at Fairy Tail!\" He said. Fairy Tail. The most famous guild in Fiore, filled with the most famous and powerful wizards in the country, and you were offered to join. \"Let's go!\" You said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you got there, you were amazed at the sight of the Fairy Tail guild hall. It was huge! Multiple stories high and covering a lot of land. \"Welcome to Fairy Tail!\" Happy said. Natsu then kicked open the door and saw.....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Crocus, the capital city of Fiore, was truly a sight to behold. From its beautiful markets and gardens to the towering castle of the Fiore monarchy. It is a popular attraction to all kinds of people, from all over the country and beyond. It is here where you find yourself as a young wizard trying to find his role in life. You are on a quest to find a guild that is suitable for you to begin your legend as a powerful wizard. And maybe fall in love with a beautiful girl along the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk through the streets of Crocus finding anything that may occupy your time. Even on a warm day like today, you wore your signature black jacket with blue jeans, as is your style. You sigh in annoyance. \"I can't believe that there's nothing to do! You'd think that there would be someone who would need a wizard's help around here!\" You mutter to yourself. You were so irritated that you didn't see a figure walking out of a department store that was right in front of you with boxes stacked up to their face, walk right in front of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bump in to the person, which causes them to fall backwards and send the tower of boxes tumbling down toward them. You act quickly and reach for the numerous amount of boxes before they fall onto their owner. As fast as lightning, you successfully stop the boxes from falling and placed them in a neat pile on the ground next to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breathe heavily. \"Sorry about that. I didn't see where I was going,\" you apologized. You turn to see the person you knocked over and your breath instantly left you. You saw that the person was a woman, an incredibly beautiful woman at that. She had long, flowing blonde hair tied up in the back. You saw that she was a pink baby blue dress, that hugged her insanely curvaceous figure. Her long legs were exposed from her dress rising up a little. Her feet were adorned by a pair of heels that matched her dress. Finally, she was blesses with  a pair of gorgeous blue eyes. You were awestruck by her beauty, but couldn't help but find her familiar, as if you've seen her before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it hit you. \"It's Jenny Realight! Miss Fiore herself! This has to be a dream!\" You think ecstatically. You then hear the woman in front of you giggle. \"It's ok. It's really my fault. I guess it was silly of me to think I could carry all of those boxes myself without getting into a catostrophic accident.\" She admits blushing. You extend a hand to help her up, which she gladly accepts. She dusts off her blue dress. \"Anyway, thank you so much. I'm Jenny. Jenny Realight,\" she greets, extending her hand out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you couldn't function after what you have just heard. \"It really is her! It's a miracle!\" You think. You have always had a crush on the young model of Blue Pegasus, so meeting her was a dream come true. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young model got confused after a minute of silence from you. She waved her hand in front of your face. \"Uh, hello. Are you still in there.\" She asked humorously. You quickly snapped out of your trance and looked into her beautiful eyes. \"Uh, yeah. Sorry about that,\" you apologized and shook her hand. \"I'm (name), and I'm a huge fan, Miss Realight,\" you greet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe model blushes. \"Please, Jenny is fine,\" she says humbly. You nod. \"Anyway, I'm glad that you're a fan. I tend to do the best I can as both a model and a wizard.\" You were amazed by her pride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you excel at both! I have all of your magazines with all of your modeling shoots, even your most recent one!\" You blurted out. You quickly cover your mouth. Her most recent shoot was the one where she modeled in her birthday suit, as was the bet she lost to Mirajane Strauss. She quickly blushed and you grew afraid that she thought of you as a pervert. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then laughed and narrowed her eyes toward you. \"Oh, you you're saying that you'd love to see me naked?\" She teased. You started to panic. \"No way! I mean, yes, I mean....!\" You stuttered. This caused her to laugh to the point of tears coming out of her eyes. She rubbed the tears from her eyes. \"Don't worry about it. I was just messing with you,\" she said. You quickly calmed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked up some of the boxes before you stopped her. \"Here, let me get those for you,\" you offered. She shook her head. \"No, I can't yet you do these all on your own,\" she argued. \"Then let me get the biggest ones and you get the rest,\" you offered, hoping to end the argument. She thought for a second and nodded her head. You took the biggest boxes back to the hotel room where she was staying. After putting them down, she turned to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much for helping me today,\" she thanked. You shook your head. \"It's no problem at all,\" you counter. She smiled brightly , which made you melt on the inside. You then turn to leave the room before she planted a kiss on your cheek. \"I hope I see you again, (name). I'm doing a photo shoot for Sorceror Weekly this week, why don't you come to it? I could use a familiar face around this big city.\" She offered. You didn't even think about and nodded in agreement. She smiled and you walked out of the hotel smiling like an idiot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love my life!\" You shout in joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",
