He had good friends, wasn't too popular, and got good grades. Not a bad life at all. Unfortunately, it was boring at times. Like today for example. Just another day of sophmore life for Chris. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe some games will help cheer me up\" muttered Chris, smiling a bit. He loved video games of course, as he played them all the time when he could. His favorite series was the Fire Emblem series, a game series had he didn't have much interest in at first, but he was immediately hooked on to it when he played one of it's games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Chris walked along the trail leading back to his house, the sun happened to glimmer off something shiny. Chris brought his hands up to his eyes to shield them from the light. Once he got a good look at it, he saw that it was some small bronze medallion of some sorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, what's this?\" he asked himself as he picked it up. The medallion didn't look like anything special to Chris. He figured that it must just be some kind of junk that someone left behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, might as well take it home\" he said to himself, shrugging his shoulders. He pocketed the medallion and continued on his merry way. Right now, it was about 3:30, which was when his school got out. His younger siblings, who were in elementary school right now,  wouldn't be home until 4:00. His parents were probably out with work at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind, Chris approached his house and walked in after unlocking the door. He, of course, had no idea of just what kind of power he was bringing into his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, it's now time to decide. Soon enough, someone will change. Who it is? That is to be determined. However, for now, let's figure out what the first transformation shall be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, which game will it be from?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chris entered his room, throwing his backpack onto the ground and letting out a final sigh of relief; he was home. He decided to immediately take up his own offer to play some video games in peace before his little siblings came home. He looked along his shelf at all the games for various systems he had stocked up. He was in a Fire Emblem mood for some reason. He didn't want to take the five minutes out of his game time to set up his TV with a game console, so he decided on a handheld game. He'd played Sacred Stones, Blazing Sword, Shadow Dragon, and Awakening a little too much lately and so he reached for one of his most prized possessions, an original GameBoy Advance cartridge for Fire Emblem: The Sword of Seals, which he got on eBay a few weeks ago. It was in Japanese, of course, but Chris had played the English hack on his computer enough to be able to play blindfolded and still get the basic story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached up for the cartridge and held it in his hand... and then he felt funny. At first it felt like he was sick to his stomach with butterflies but then the sensation spread out his extremities to his entire body. He felt himself fall and he blacked out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe came to, still feeling a little dizzy. He noticed according to his clock that he'd only been out for a minute or two at best, which was weird. He still felt dizzy as he stood up. He shook his head a couple of times to clear it, which somewhat did the trick. He noticed almost immediately then that his clothes were different. They tinkled a little when he walked, he was wearing some armor pieces, blue plated with gleaming golden trim. It felt weird wearing a chest plate and shoulder pads made of steel, but apparently Chris didn't mind the weight, as if he were used to it. He had heavy boots on, mostly leather but with iron fittings surrounding his ankle, again mostly blue with gold trim. He had white trousers made of a sort of heavy cloth, almost like canvas in terms of toughness but slightly more soft. Under his armor was a sleeveless tunic of blue cloth again with golden trim, this time as smooth as satin, and a belt of simple leather held the tunic together at the waist. Under that was a black short sleeved shirt, thick and with a turtle neck of sorts. He felt around his head at this point a cloth headband, probably blue and gold. The most impressive article of clothing on his person, however, was his cape. Blue on the outside, red on the inside, it made this strange outfit 4 times as heroic. Last, he noticed had blue fingerless gloves and iron gauntlets on his arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the freakiness of the situation kicked into overdrive. Chris looked at his arms. He definitely remembered not being quite that pale before... or that ripped. He looked at his arms and he looked like he'd been working out for some time. His biceps when he flexed them bulged quite a bit. Naturally, he wasn't grotesquely muscled like one of the body builders on TV, instead it looked like each and every muscle in his arm had been trained to that size with discipline and necessity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris shook his head, \"Just what has happened to m-!!\" he gasped at his own voice, \"My voice! Holy crap! Is that my voice?\" The voice was that of an adolescent young man, any guy from Chris's High School could've owned that voice. But it was <i>definitely </i>not Chris's. It was a little higher pitched and had a tinge of a sort of English-ish accent to it. He immediately ran for his closet, his armor pieces clinking a bit with him. He grabbed the full body mirror he kept in his closet and put it down against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. My. GOD!!\" he cried to himself as he gazed upon the utterly amazing sight in the mirror. He gaped, his eyes wide. There, in the mirror, stood a guy looking about 15 years old. He had a shock of ultra red hair, longish and unkempt, kept out of his face by a blue and gold cloth headband. He had the most intensely azure blue eyes Chris had ever seen in his life. It was as if Roy from FE6 had come to life in the real world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was more than that. This redheaded teenager decked out in armor and Lycian nobleman garb was, in fact, Chris. The reality was so intense, Chris couldn't form words to describe his amazement. Roy's garb was a little dusty, his boots had dried mud on them, he had dirt under his fingernails, and his face looked a little dirty. It was as if Roy had magically been transported from the middle of a battle onto Chris. Every movement Chris made, Roy made in the mirror. Every facial expression Chris felt was portrayed by the redheaded youth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris touched Roy's face... his own face. The face he felt was the face of Fire Emblem: The Sword of Seal's main character. Chris almost had to laugh. The way he existed now put every cosplayer in the entire history of dressing up as fictional characters to shame. Chris didn't just look like Roy, he didn't just sound like Roy or smell like Roy or feel like Roy; he WAS Roy (if Chris had known what Roy smelt, sounded, and felt like in the first place). Roy, son of Eliwood, Marquess of Pherae. Roy, the General of the Lycian Alliance who took on Bern, nabbed the Sword of Seals, and fought a demonic dragon... before becoming King of his homeland. For Chris, it was all just too unreal... and at the same time gazing into the azure eyes in the mirror, he knew, he was inside this body...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis train of thought was derailed however, when he heard the doorbell ring. Chris/Roy was shaken out of his thoughts and wondered who it could be... He realized he couldn't keep his transformation into a redheaded 15 year old general a secret from the world much longer no matter how hard he tried. He went to answer the door. He realized Roy was about his old height, maybe even a little taller. He wondered if fans would be disappointed that the \"real\" Roy wasn't as short as they all thought...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe person at the door was...</span></div></div>",

Is Chris home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jane,\" said Chris in Roy's voice, \"you're not going to believe this, but... it's me, Chris!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane looked shocked for a second. She then shook herself out of it and pushed her way past the redhead and into the house. \"Uh, yeah. I don't know if that was meant to be a joke, but it wasn't funny in any case, dude. Who are you and where's Chris?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jane, I'm serious,\" said Chris, \"I'm not kidding at all. I was in my room just now before I blacked out and changed into this! Look at me, Jane, who do I look like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane looked Chris over. \"A redheaded dude who's cosplaying something medieval,\" she replied immediately. She then realized something. \"Wait a minute, you're dressed up as Roy from Fire Emblem 6! It's the most perfect cosplay I've ever seen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a cosplay, Jane,\" said Chris, \"I'm seriously inside the body of Roy. You've got to believe me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then, pal, if you're Chris...\" Jane pondered to herself something only the real Chris would know. She looked at her hand, on her finger was a cheap metal ring, a little girl's play accessory. \"You recognize this ring?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris looked at the ring, old, a little battered, but the memories surrounding it flooded back anyway, making him smile. \"I gave you that ring when we both were 5 years old. You and me used to like playing the married game a lot,\" he chuckled at the memory, \"we'd put rings on each other's fingers and pretend we were married. I told you one day to keep that ring even after the game was over... looks like you did... heh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane looked into Roy's azure eyes and somehow found Chris looking through them. \"Chris! It is you!\" She gave him a hug before she blushed and backed away a little. \"I'm sorry... I just... I'm so sorry, Chris.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be sorry, Jane, I think I needed that hug,\" admited Chris, making Jane blush more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cleared her throat. \"So you just changed into Roy from FE6... by magic?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As far as I know, yes,\" replied Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" said Jane, \"something must've happened to make you turn into Roy...\" Chris smiled slightly at Jane. She'd always been the smarter of the two, the rational, thinking one. \"God you look just like him,\" she commented idly with a laugh, looking at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" nodded Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did anything out of the ordinary happen today before you transformed?\" asked Jane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not real- Wait!\" Chris exclaimed. He only then felt and realized there was a metal necklace around his neck. He pulled it out from under his clothing and sure enough, there was the medallion. \"I found this medallion on my way home from school... think it's got something to do with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" said Jane, \"I do. Given the fact that it's the only thing that you still have on you from before your transformation. I'll bet that's the guilty item. But... how to activate it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" said Chris, \"just before I starting changing I was holding my FE6 cartridge. I was thinking about training up Roy and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were thinking about Roy,\" concluded Jane, \"and had yourself in mind. I'll bet that's how it works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can we be sure?\" asked Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to have to test it... on me,\" said Jane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No way! What if this is permanent?\" asked Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can think of far worse things to be stuck as, Chris. You may look quite a bit different, but at least you're still a teenaged guy and not a baby or an old man or someone of the opposite gender,\" pointed out Jane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's true,\" nodded Chris, \"but I'm still not in my real body... if anybody's got to be permanently stuck in a different body, I'd like to keep it being me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's very sweet of you, Chris,\" said Jane, \"but we won't know if you can be changed back if we don't know how the thing works. Besides, if I have to be stuck as a character, it'd be the coolest to be stuck as a Fire Emblem character...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris sighed. \"Alright, I'll do it,\" he said. He looked at the medallion. \"Any character in particular on your mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just try not to make me a male character,\" she replied in jest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, darn,\" joked Chris with a laugh. He started concentrating hard on Jane. He picked a Fire Emblem 6 character for her to transform into, which was...</span></div></div>",

They always enjoyed a nice relationship, so they didn't fight alot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Chris, I'm fine. You alright?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty good\" replied Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good\" said Abby.

Chris was stunned at her sudden growth, as her little 8-year old body grew seemingly older. As it happened, you could see her growing into puberty, as her hips began to widen and little breasts grew on her chest. Both of them began to think that she was looking more like a young teenager now. However, that was only the beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby's short blonde hair began to darken, becoming a deep brunette in the process. A couple of small accessories adorned her hair. Then, the more shocking changes came. Abby's pink shirt began fading to a yellow color, growing bigger on her. The hemline also began extending in the front, flowing down into her seat a bit. Some small degsigns finished off the garment, becoming a yellow chemise. Her light blue skirt also faded to the same yellow color, extending down to cover more of her longer legs. In addition, a small blue scarf wound its way around her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris could see that this look was very familiar, but the last change sealed the deal. Abby's face began to contort and change, growing older like the rest of her and becoming a familiar sight as her eyes became a bright blue. Finally, a pair of wierd white sleeves grew on her arms, covering part of her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris' eyes widened in realization at his sisters new look. She looked exactly like Mist now!</span></div></div>",

She almost began to cry when Chris gently hugged her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax Abby. It'll be ok. We'll figure this out together\" he said assuringly. That seemed to work as Abby calmed down enough to nod. At that, she tried to stand up, wobbling a bit as she wasn't used to being this tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what am I? How did this happen?\" she kept asking. Chris didn't quite know how to respond, but he had to be honest about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you kind of look like Mist\" he said, causing Abby to look at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mist? From that Fire Emblem game you have?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. You look exactly like her\" said Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how did I change like this?\" asked Abby. Chris thought for a moment. Then, he remembered the medallion. He was almost positive that it had something to do with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found something that looked like it was from the game. I'm not sure how but I think it changed you\" said Chris. Abby could hardly believe that, but she knew Chris wouldn't lie about something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, what happened?</span></div></div>",

Bears the Crest of Fraldarius.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Ingrid's family of the Galateas is an offshoot of the Daphnel family of the Alliance, but she grew up with and calls Faerghus her home. Her family is noble but poor, and so she was offered as an arranged marriage to Glenn, Felix's older brother. The pairing did like each other-but when Glenn died at the Tragedy of Duscur, she decided to become a knight to bring honor to her family (despite her father wanting her to marry rich). She is skilled with the sword and lance, and is adept with animals, whether horses, pegasi, or wyverns. She bears the Crest of Daphnel, which lets her wield the family's lance, Luin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Sylvain had a rough time growing up. The younger son who bore his Crest, that of the Gautier family, his older brother Miklan was disowned and attempted to kill him several times growing up. Being seen as useful only for his Crest, he developed a womanizing outer shell to hide his inner sadness and frustration at the Crest system. He is a childhood friend of Dimitri, Felix and Ingrid-much to their consternation with his flirting. He is skilled with lances and axes, is good with horses, and has a hidden aptitude for Reason magic-learning fire magic as well as Saggitae. His Crest of Gautier lets him use his family's Lance of Ruin.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Hello everyone! This is a redone version of my other story, Fire Emblem Morph Story. I figured this would be the best way to start things over and make things easier to write. I hope that others can come and enjoy this as much as I do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStoryline is the same as before. The character finds an artifact resembling the Fire Emblem that transforms him and can allow him to change others and go into the games' themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimply put, the medallion found can change the user into a new character. It can also be used by the user to change someone else as well as go into the game world of that respective character. It's also possible for the user to go into the game unchanged. There can be multiple changes at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the characters used for transformation, there may be some male characters. However, the majority of options will be for female characters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, the story will start off a little slow because it'll be determining the first transformation and who ends up transforming. From that point on, things will develop quicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere are the rules as usual:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Keep it PG-13! <br>\r\n2. You can have sex, but not descriptive and try not to have too much.<br>\r\n3. Keep language PG-13 and also keep it tame (like not cursing every sentence)<br>\r\n4. Keep the story going and no killing the characters.<br>\r\n5. Try to make it a good length if possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharacter List:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Chris Skyler: 16 years old, short dirty blonde hair, blue eyes. High School sophmore. Loves to read and play video games. A little shy but very friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Jane Cross: 16 year old girl. Long brown hair with green eyes. Childhood friend of Chris who she has a crush on. Shares his love of video games, especially fantasy RPG's. She often beats him in certain games like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Ben Skyler: 10 years old. Dirty blonde hair and blue eyes. Chris' younger brother. A typical younger brother who also has his interests in video games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Abby Skyler: 8 years old. Chris' little sister. Not much interest in games, more into the typical girly stuff. Shoulder-length blonde hair with blue eyes. Doesn't hate games or anything, but just not really into them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Anthony Hartford: 16 years old. Tall with dark brown hair and same color eyes. A lone wolf type of guy but a very good friend of Chris. Shares love of games as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. Judith Hartford: 9 years old. Anthony's younger sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs another note, all pictures used belong to their respective owners. Just as a disclaimer.</td>",
