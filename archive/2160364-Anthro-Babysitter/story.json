And while feral wolves tended to just have fur, Anthro Wolfesses had long hair and the boys short, so you could tell the difference. She wore a pink tang top, a Denim jacket and jeans. And her tail was long and fluffy, it looked like a pillow you could rest on. Her hair was brunette, which blended in well with her silver coat of fur. And her breast size was DDD, not that you really knew this, but when you see them, they're each bigger then your head. But with her toned body, they didn't look out of place for her. They fit her body nicely. She as a head, maybe 2 heads taller then your own mother. Now, you've always had a thing for wolves. And your mom knew this. And you're a 4 year old, so it was cute to see how much you loved them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow here's a question.

Those myths about Antarctica being an ice wall instead of a continent. Well, turns out those stories were true. Only a few humans from the ancient past had decided to go beyond the wall, where they found new lands. Some of them with people much like themselves. Others with Anthro creatures.Your ancestors had come to settle on a land that was ruled by Anthro Wolves. They welcomed your ancestors, and treated them as equals, for they did not believe in slavery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Rhea was their Queen. Sure she had servents, but they were volunteers, and very much enjoyed their job. And Rhea ruled with a strict system. Anyone who broke their laws were either imprisoned for 20 years or more, or given the death sentence, depending on the severity of the crime. One of the worst offenses was bringing harm to little ones, like yourself. And they had technology that equaled if not bettered that of the Modern day world most humans are aware of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Rhea had known your mother since she, herself was a pup. They grew up together, so her being your babysitter was amazing to find out. You'd be getting babysat by royalty today. \"RHEA!!\" You squeal in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jump up to her, and she catches you, giving you a big warm hug. \"Hello there my little one. Great to see you again,\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom smiled and said her goodbyes, as she headed to her job. You and Rhea wave to her, and Soon Rhea looks to you and says, \"Well honey, I have a surprise for you today,\" Rhea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Rhea?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well..........\"</span></div></div>",

It wasn't something your understood. You were only 4, but it was something you didn't see on other Anthro women. Not that you much made arguments about it anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you had never tried her milk personally, since it had been at preschool before. But now, she was babysitting you, and offered willingly, so there must be no harm in it. You nodded, and Nancy smiled, slowly lowering you into her pouch, with you facing towards her belly. Soon, you were all they way in the cozy, and fluffy pouch. And looking at her milk filled teats. There were four of them. Not really having a preference, you soon latched onto one, and started nursing, like when they fed you and the other kids bottles at your preschool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome kids your age were at the stage of eating soft, solid foods as 4 year olds, but this was also a community that did not hurry children along in growing up, so, some 4 year olds, such as yourself, still preferred bottle feeding at preschool. You asked not what was in the bottle, since, whatever was put in there had a sweet taste when you drank it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you nursed from Nancy's teat, you were soon rewarded with her sweet, motherly nectar, only mothers and wet nurses like herself could only provide to little ones like you. She giggled as your nursing in her pouch tickled a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, the pouch had sealed you inside, making you cozy and content. You had no argument being sealed inside. It's not like she had forced this on you. And, if it hadn't been for the pouch, others would have mistaken Nicole to look pregnant. As you continued to nurse.......</span></div></div>",

You sighed at the thought. You were too old to even need a babysitter! You could cook for yourself, clean up after yourself. You don\u2019t live in a bad neighborhood, so it\u2019s not dangerous to be alone for a night. But regardless, your mother always insists on hiring some sitter to constantly pester you while you\u2019re trying to play video games\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, you expect this night to be the same boring night as always. The moment you stepped into the living room, though, you realized this couldn\u2019t be further from the truth! Standing right there in the front door was\u2026 well, it took your brain a few moments to process just what she was. First of all, she was absolutely huge! She had to lean over just to fit through the doorway! And not only was she taller than any human could be, but she was also incredibly plump, too, though with a curvaceous figure that lacked cellulite or fat rolls, almost as if she was meant to be this blubbery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, you thought she was just pale\u2026 but once you noticed that her body was actually covered in a thick layer of white floor, you finally put two and two together. She was an anthro! Anthros were incredibly rare, making up less than 1% of the population, and the ones that did exist had many strange and unusual characteristics. This one seemed to be a polar bear. She was wearing a big, comfy brown sweater,  and nothing else. \u201cJeremy, this is your babysitter, Lydia!\u201d Your mother smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIntimidated by the bear woman\u2019s sheer size and species, you hide behind your mother, shaking. \u201cDon\u2019t be rude, Jeremy! Say hello!\u201d Your mother frowned, pushing you in front of her. Soon, you were quivering as you stood in front of the bear woman, consumed by her shadow as she loomed over you, making it evident just how huge she was compared to you. She smiled a warm, lazy smile as she bent over until you were just about at eye-level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood afternoon, lil guy! Why, you\u2019re so cute, I could just eat you up~!\u201d She giggled, obviously not meaning anything by it. You, of course, quake in fear at the thought of being gobbled up by the massive bear lady. She frowns when she notices just how frightened you are. \u201cAwww. What\u2019s the matter, sweetheart?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were shaking where you stood, but you still managed to muster the courage to respond. \u201cI\u2026 I\u2019ve\u2026 never really seen one of\u2026 you\u2026 up close before\u2026\u201d You whimper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you saying you\u2019re afraid of her just because she\u2019s an anthro?\u201d Your mother crossed her arms, visibly upset. \u201cJeremy, I am disappointed in you! I thought I raised you-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no. It\u2019s perfectly alright, ma\u2019am. I get this all the time. He doesn\u2019t mean anything by it,\u201d the bear waved a hand dismissively, and your mother went silent, trusting her judgement. \u201cNow, listen, sweetheart. I\u2019ve babysitted plenty of little boys and girls who were scared of me when we first met, just \u2018cause I\u2019m a bear. But ya know what? By the end of the night, they all loved me! Cause I may be a big ol\u2019 bear, but I\u2019ve got a big heart, too!\u201d She paused for a moment, as if thinking. \u201cHey! Do ya happen to own a teddy bear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause, a little embarrassed. \u201c... yeah,\u201d you confess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, think of me like a big ol\u2019 teddy bear, then!\u201d She smiled. \u201cSure, I may look big\u2026 but all I wanna do is give ya the warmest cuddles you\u2019re ever gonna get, if only you\u2019ll let me!\u201d With that, she reached her arms out, offering you a great big bear hug. You looked at her, nervously. She did seem big and scary\u2026 but on the other side, the look on her face made her look really, really nice. She didn\u2019t seem like she was mean or anything! You cautiously took a few steps forward, and let her wrap her arms around you\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re suddenly pulled up against her fluffy body, completely enveloped in her soft fluff as she wraps you in the biggest, literal bear hug of your life! Her giant cheek nuzzles you as she sways back and forth, cooing as she cuddling you with all her might! Her fur was immediately so soft and warm, and her hug so comfortable and gentle, you immediately went limp in her arms, relaxing and enjoying her happy cuddles. \u201cSee? I\u2019m not so scary! I\u2019m just a big snuggle bug!\u201d She smiles, noticing you get more comfortable as your fears slip away. She really was nice!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother giggled at this sight, already seeing you warm up to your babysitter. \u201cAlright! Have fun you too!\u201d She said as she started to leave, and you both waved to her as she trotted out the door. It was just you and this bear lady now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, my name\u2019s Lydia, lil guy! I already know your\u2019s is Jeremy!\u201d She smiles down at you, and you giggle as she gently boops your nose with a finger. She walks over and sits down on the couch, still cuddling you in her arms. \u201cSo, what do you like to do for fun, sweet heart?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou consider it, before answering. \u201cI like to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You loved video games! In fact, you had just been playing one when your mother called you out into the living room. Seeing the look of excitement on your face when you blurted out your answer, Lydia giggled, seeing this as an opportunity to befriend you. \u201cOh! Well, would you mind if I played some games with you?\u201d You quickly nodded eagerly. You were ALWAYS up to play some video games with someone! \u201cWonderful! Now, I\u2019m not a big gamer or anything, so take it easy on me, okay? Hehe!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggled back, amused by the thought of \u2018going easy\u2019 on such a big, powerful bear. \u201cOk!\u201d You nod, before pointing her towards your bedroom as she gently carries you through the halls. Her big, bright eyes lit up when she saw what you were playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my goodness! A Nintendo 64!?\u201d She gently set you down on the couch in front of your television, before eagerly getting on her knees and sorting through the games you own. \u201cOh, I used to play these all the time when I was your age!\u201d You giggled at the sight of her getting so excited! Since she wasn\u2019t wearing pants, you can even see her tiny tail wagging. \u201cWhat are you playin\u2019?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMario Kart,\u201d you reply, and she gets a thrilled look in her eyes as she recognizes that name. \u201cThink you can handle it?\u201d You ask, playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she had a look of amused determination on her face! \u201cOh, you\u2019re on!\u201d With that, the whole couch shook and groaned beneath her weight as she suddenly plopped herself down beside you, almost taking up the entire couch! With that, it was on! You both playfully taunted eachother as you played, and you\u2019re immediately surprised by the fact that she\u2019s a lot better at the game than you expected. You were about evenly matched in skill, and at some points, she was even giving you a run for your money! \u201cHehe! Try to keep up!\u201d She teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few rounds, though, you were starting to pay less attention to the game and more attention to her. You were fascinated by just how different she was compared to humans, and you couldn\u2019t help but wonder what her life is like. How does she deal with all that fur during the summer, for example? \u201cUh\u2026 so\u2026 if you don\u2019t mind me asking\u2026 what\u2019s it like? Being, ya know\u2026 a bear?\u201d You ask her, sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, overall, it\u2019s pretty much just like being a human! Except I\u2019m a lot snugglier,\u201d she explained, without skipping a beat. \u201cMy only complaint is, people always assume I\u2019m scary or mean just \u2018cause I\u2019m really big\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026\u201d You frowned, looking at the ground, suddenly feeling guilty for how to reacted to her when you first met. \u201cLike\u2026 me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed when she saw how remorseful you were, and planting one of her huge paw-hands on your head, playfully ruffling your hair. \u201cAwww! You don\u2019t have to feel bad or anything, little guy!\u201d She smiled, planting a smooch on your forehead. \u201cI understand I can look a lil\u2019 scary if you\u2019ve never seen an anthro before. Water under the bridge, right?\u201d You relax a little in her arms, leaning up against her side as she cuddles you more, and you return back to playing the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you try out a couple different games together, it was eventually time for lunch. After that, you had to decide how to spend the rest of your day together...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Took her long enough! Your mother had bragged that this sitter was one of the highest-rated sitters in the area, but you guess the standards must not be very high, considering this sitter was already super late! Your mother had somewhere to be urgently, so she had been anxiously pacing back and forth waiting for this sitter to arrive. As the sitter stomped up to your apartment, however, you realized the very ground was shaking, and the footsteps sounded like they bore the weight of tons. What on Earth? It sounded like you were going to be babysat by a T-Rex!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reality wasn\u2019t much less crazy. Soon, the door to your apartment was pushed open\u2026 and standing in the doorway was the largest woman you\u2019ve ever seen! Both in terms of height - her head almost brushed up against the ceiling, indicating she was almost 10 feet tall - and not only that, but she was so pudgy, she could barely fit through the door! Once she did, though, you were given an even more fascinating look at her body. Her blubbery body was covered in thick, gray skin, she had a long tail behind her, and most notably, she had the head of a\u2026 hippopotamus?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour jaw just about hit the floor! You quickly realize she was one of those \u2018anthros\u2019 you\u2019ve been hearing about. Now, you did know a few anthros - there was that nice leopard lady that worked at the coffee shop around the corner, and that one wolf boy you knew in elementary school. But they were more\u2026 regular sized. This hippo was GIGANTIC! She was unlike anything you\u2019ve ever seen before. You stared up at her in awe as she walked in, her blubbery body jiggling with every powerful step. \u201cSorry I\u2019m late! I had to take the stairs up here\u2026 and let me tell you, stairs are killer on a gal my size!\u201d She apologized with a big smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! I\u2019m so sorry! I should\u2019ve warned you,\u201d your mother shook her head with a chuckle, just happy the hippo has finally made it. You let out a quiet, startled yelp as your mother gently pushes you forward, and you find yourself standing right in front of the hippo. \u201cAh, Hilda. This is my son, Jeremy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe immediately lit up with delight as she looked down on you. \u201cAwww! Well, ain\u2019t you just the yummiest little thing?\u201d She bent over with a huge grin on her face, as she cooed over your adorableness. For some reason, her smile didn\u2019t comfort you at all. In fact, it only made you more nervous. She wasn\u2019t looking at you like she found you cute\u2026 she was looking at you like she found you TASTY. You felt like she was sizing you up to be a snack!  \u201cMy name\u2019s Hilda, lil guy! It\u2019s a pleasure to eat- I mean\u2026 meet you! Hehe!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were horrified by what she was saying. The look on her face, combined with those little \u2018jokes\u2019 she was telling\u2026 you were getting the distinct feeling you were going to end up as this hippo\u2019s lunch! You gaze nervously at her huge, round belly, seeing just how much bigger it was than you. \u201cMhmm. Play nice with Hilda now, Jeremy! She\u2019ll be taking care of you while I\u2019m away!\u201d Your worries are interrupted by your mother patting you on the back, just happy she can finally get going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-Mom\u2026\u201d You reply, nervously, in disbelief she can be so oblivious! She was practically serving you on a silver platter to this giant, hungry hippo woman! Before you can say another word, though, the hippo suddenly wraps her plump arms around you, and you\u2019re suddenly wrapped in a tight hug, your protests muffled completely as she squeezes you against her blubber!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Miss Collins! I\u2019ll make sure to take GOOD care of this lil guy!\u201d She giggles, hearing you try to shout something, only to be muffled by her pudge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking twice, your mother just steps through the door, waving to you. \u201cAlright! Remember, Jeremy; bedtime at 9, and don\u2019t try to get out of it. Don\u2019t give your sitter any trouble, alright?\u201d You were kicking your legs in panic as she left! She couldn\u2019t leave you here alone with this hippo! You\u2019d probably end up as dinner! \u201cLove you, honey!\u201d With that, your mother closed the door behind her, possibly sealing your fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the hippo giggles as she pries you off of her pudgy belly. You look up at her in horror, noticing just how humongous her mouth is. She could swallow you whole in a second! You were just a bite-sized treat in comparison to her! \u201cWhat are you looking so nervous about, sugah? I don\u2019t bite!\u201d She asked, playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blinked, a little hopeful that she would dispel your fears. \u201cSo you\u2019re\u2026 not gonna eat me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe! Let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves, now!\u201d She immediately giggled. \u201cI can\u2019t promise I\u2019ll be able to resist gobbling up such a scrumptious-lookin\u2019 lil boy!\u201d Your heart was beating out of your chest as you heard those words. Was she being serious? She HAD to be joking, right? She couldn\u2019t just EAT the kids she babysits! Maybe this whole thing was some sort of act in order to get you to behave. Well, if it was, it worked! You were going to be as obedient as can be today, for fear of winding up in that massive tummy otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept you tightly in her grip, pressed up against her squishy pudge as she walked around, knowing you\u2019d probably just run away otherwise. She whistled as she gazed around the house. \u201cOooh! This is a nice apartment ya got here!\u201d She smiled. \u201cBut to be honest\u2026 there\u2019s only one room I\u2019m really interested in!\u201d With that, she carried you in her arms as she walked over to...</span></div></div>",

You knew your mom wouldn\u2019t leave you with a sitter who would EAT you\u2026 but you still couldn\u2019t shake your nervousness. You really didn\u2019t like being treated like a snack. Suddenly, you were distracted from these thoughts when the hippo spoke up. \u201cCan you guess what your mom is paying me to take care of you for the weekend?\u201d She asked with a playful grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 I dunno\u2026\u201d You stutter, confused by the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZero dollars!\u201d She smiled. \u201cAll I\u2019m askin\u2019 for is to be able to fill my tummy with ANYTHING in this apartment. And I do mean ANYTHING!\u201d She looked you straight in the eyes with a smile on her face as she rubbed her huge, round belly with a hand, making it clear what she meant by \u2018anything\u2019. \u201cYa see, it\u2019s so rare that I get to stuff this big belly of mine. But it\u2019s always the best feeling! So, this weekend, you\u2019re gonna help me with that!\u201d You started to panic when you realized she was walking into the kitchen! Was she going to cook you into her dinner?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 nope. Instead, she just gently sets you down on the counter, as she goes digging through the pantry for other treats. Eventually, she let's you sit on her shoulders while she walks back to the living room, with a humongous bundle of food under each arm! She must be carrying half of the food you have in your house! She sighs in relaxation as she sits down on the couch, setting all of the food down beside her as she turns on the TV. She sets you down on her big, round, soft belly, which bounces a bit beneath you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, making it all the way up the stairs here really tuckered me out...\u201d She gave you a big smile. \u201cThink you could do me a favor, dear, and feed me all these delicious snacks?\u201d Her request made you nervous\u2026 but you didn\u2019t want to decline, lest you might end up on the menu! You nervously reached over and grabbed a watermelon, only to gaze in awe as her mouth opened incredibly wide! You winced as you gently set the watermelon down on her huge tongue, getting your hands a little wet with her slobber\u2026 only to gasp in shock as she swallows the watermelon in a single gulp!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare in surprise as the watermelon disappears down her cavernous throat, seemingly in an instant. Once it\u2019s filled that tummy you\u2019re sitting on, she smiles, licking her lips. \u201cMm, mm, mm! That was a good appetizer!\u201d She smiled, only to see you sitting there, staring at her in awe. \u201cWell? Ya ain\u2019t done yet, sweetie pie! There\u2019s still plenty of room in here for more snacks!\u201d She patted her huge belly. With a nervous gulp, you reached down and grabbed some more food items, dropping them in her maw and watching them all disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, there was no doubt in your mind that she could swallow you whole with ease! You were nervous as you sat on her belly, looking down at her massive maw, knowing that, with one movement, you might just slip and fall in! This became especially scary as she started jiggling her belly slightly, making you whimper and hold on, almost losing your balance! You hated to imagine what would\u2019ve happened if you HAD fallen into her mouth! Your heart was racing as you stuffed more and more food into her maw, feeling the stomach you\u2019re sitting on get fuller and fuller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven when you thought for sure she had reached her limit, she just kept eagerly accepting more, until her round belly was twice it\u2019s original size! You whimper as you hear it loudly gurgling as it digests all the food within. \u201cOooh! That really hit the spot!\u201d She cooed, sitting back and patting her belly, now that all the food she brought with her is stuffed tightly within. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could eat another bite! I\u2019m sooo stuffed! Mm\u2026 could you be a dear and give me a lil belly rub? My tummy\u2019s a little sore\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh nervously, before rubbing your hands all over her huge, thick, blubbery gut, feeling the imprints of all the food within. She didn\u2019t seem to want to eat you yet\u2026 she was just eating regular food, which was a good sign. Maybe she really didn\u2019t eat people? You were afraid that even asking that question might get you into trouble\u2026 but you just had to be sure. The doubt was driving you crazy! \u201cYou don\u2019t\u2026 actually eat kids, do you?\u201d You nervously ask, as you continue rubbing your hands over her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, of course I do! They\u2019re my favorite food!\u201d She giggled, nonchalantly. \u201cI just love gobbling them up in one gulp, like the lil bite-sized treats they are, and feeling \u2018em wriggle in my big, warm tummy!\u201d Your heart dropped as you realized she was serious! You were starting to shake as you looked down at her huge belly, horrified by the thought that she\u2019s actually stuffed kids into there. You shudder as it gurgles and groans loudly, indicating just how powerful it was. You knew enough about biology to know what happens to food\u2026 but she couldn\u2019t have done that to them\u2026 could she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026 happens to them in there?\u201d You stutter, your voice quivering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, they get sloshed and jiggled and jostled all around! My belly\u2019s like a big bounce house, or so I\u2019ve been told!\u201d She giggles, and you let out a startled yelp as she starts jiggling her belly around with her hands, sloshing around its contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat didn\u2019t really answer your question. You take a deep breath. It was time for the moment of truth. You had to know the ultimate fates of the kids who ended up in her gut. \u201cSo\u2026 you don\u2019t\u2026 digest them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stares at you for a while, as if processing your question\u2026 and for the first time, you actually see the bubbly hippo frown. \u201cWhat? No! No, no, no!\u201d She loudly insists, as if baffled you would even ask such a question. \u201cWhy on Earth would I ever digest them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink. \u201cWell\u2026 isn\u2019t that what happens to food?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sadly shook her head, setting you down gently on the couch next to her. \u201cHoney, no. I would never hurt anyone! Especially not some adorable kids! I may be a hungry kinda gal, but I ain\u2019t a monster!\u201d She insisted. \u201cIs that why you\u2019ve been so nervous this whole time? You thought I might\u2026 digest you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down, sheepishly. \u201cMhmm\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you poor dear! You should\u2019ve said\u2026\u201d She cooed sadly, picking you up and gently hugging you again. She seemed to be genuine, and you relaxed a bit as she pressed you against her belly. \u201cNow, listen here. I would absolutely never harm a hair on your lil body. You hear?\u201d Her belly\u2019s actually a lot more comfortable now that you know it\u2019s not dangerous. \u201cI mean, listen to this big belly of mine. Does it sound scary to you? No! My tummy would never hurt a cute lil boy like you. It will just be nice\u2026 and warm\u2026 and safe\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about it as you lean your head against her tummy. So those kids she ate\u2026 she just let them out afterwards? If she\u2019s telling the truth, that makes you feel a lot better. There was still some lingering adrenaline running through your veins, though\u2026 especially when you really considered what she had just said! \u201cSo\u2026 you ARE going to eat me?\u201d You ask, noticing how she said \u2018will\u2019, as if it was inevitable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Jeremy. You\u2019ll be spending the night in my tummy,\u201d she sighed, her tone making it obvious you don\u2019t really have a choice in the matter. You were going in her tummy whether you liked it or not\u2026 although she did hope you liked it. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, thinking about it a long time. Getting eaten by the hippo\u2026 it was sort of a scary thought. But as long as she doesn\u2019t hurt you\u2026 you suppose it\u2019ll be okay. \u201c... n-no. It\u2019s okay. As long as you don\u2019t hurt me\u2026 and it\u2019s not too scary in there\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe immediately perks up! \u201cOh, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re coming around, Jeremy! You\u2019re gonna be the yummiest lil treat I\u2019ve had in months!\u201d She coos excitedly, and you giggle as she hugs you against her gut even harder. \u201cI promise you\u2019re going to like it in there! It\u2019s way comfier then you probably think!\u201d It was fun seeing her so excited! \u201cBut that\u2019s not gonna be for a while! My tummy\u2019s still gotta take care of my dinner, so it\u2019s not all messy in there when I gulp you down! In the meantime, what do you like to do for fun?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about it for a moment, before deciding...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You figured taking a walk through the park would be the best way to get to know the big hippo. After all, around the apartment, she always seems like she\u2019s just a hair\u2019s breadth away from just gobbling you up at any moment. If you were out in public, perhaps she would be more hesitant. She seemed to grin at your idea, also enjoying the idea of going to the park\u2026 but perhaps for a different reason. \u201cOooh! That sounds like fun!\u201d She smiled\u2026 and after a few minutes of preparations, you were off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda wasn\u2019t lying when she said she struggled with that staircase. As you were trotting down the stairs of your apartment building, she was huffing and puffing, being very careful with every footstep so she doesn\u2019t just fall down the stairs. You try to help her, pushing back against her gut to help her keep her balance\u2026 but when she finally DOES lose her balance, you realize you\u2019re right in the way! You let out a startled yelp as the full weight of the hippo comes collapsing down on top of you, as you both fall down the stairs! \u201cW-whoa!\u201d She cries out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find yourself shrouded in darkness, pinned against the hard ground by something soft and warm on top of you. From the gurgling you hear above, you realize she landed belly-first atop you! Luckily, it didn\u2019t hurt at all, but it was uncomfortable being pinned beneath her immense weight. \u201cJ-Jeremy? Where are you?\u201d She stuttered, glancing around, realizing she couldn\u2019t feel you\u2026 until she giggled when she felt you wriggle beneath her tummy. With that, she stood up, giving you some fresh air. \u201cReally sorry about that Jeremy. I can be clumsy sometimes! But hey, thanks for breaking my fall!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make it up to you, she let you ride on her shoulders as she walked through the neighborhood, her size allowing her to leisurely stroll at an incredible speed. Passersby stopped and stared in awe at her sheer size - in response, she only giggled and waved. Before you knew it, she had made it to the park in record time! \u201cNot very busy today, huh?\u201d She asked, as she gently set you down on the ground. \u201cBeautiful park, though. I could use a good walk. But while we walk\u2026 is there anything ya wanted to know, lil guy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the two of you began a leisurely stroll around the park. She walked much slower now that you were following along by her side, helping you to keep up with her much larger form. All the while, you asked her questions about what life was like as a hippo. The more questions she answered, the more fascinated you are by her, and the more you start to like her. While she seemed scary at first, you were quickly starting to believe that she really wouldn\u2019t ever hurt anybody\u2026 she was just a little mischievous!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, though, your conversation with her was interrupted by a loud growl emanating from her sloshing gut! You glanced over, only to be shocked when you realize that her belly had already shrunken considerably, her previous meal reduced to nothing! \u201cOh! Did you already digest all that food?\u201d You asked, in awe at the sheer power of her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup! All this walking has made me really work up an appetite!\u201d She smiled, patting her sloshing gut. \u201cLuckily, there\u2019s some scrumptious looking snacks over there\u2026\u201d She giggled, licking her lips as she glanced at the park\u2019s playground. There were about a half dozen kids playing there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026\u201d You stutter, your heart fluttering as you realize what she means. \u201cAre you gonna\u2026 eat \u2018em?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMhmm! They look so yummy, it\u2019d almost be a sin not to!\u201d With that, she begins to excitedly stroll over towards it\u2026 and you reluctantly follow her, a little curious to see just how easily she can actually eat somebody. As she approached, a shy boy around half your age looked up at her in awe, seemingly shocked by her sheer size. \u201cWhy, hello, little one! How are you today?\u201d She bent over to smile at him\u2026 only to notice him staring at her huge tummy! \u201cMm? What\u2019s that? You wanna bounce on my big, belly? Well, sure! I don\u2019t mind!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe seemed a little confused, but when she lays down on her back and shows of her huge gut, he seems to understand. Hesitantly, the boy climbs up onto her gut, giggling at how sloshy it was. With her approval, he starts to bounce on her tummy like a trampoline\u2026 slowly at first, but quickly getting higher and higher. \u201cHehe\u2026 hahaha!\u201d He started laughing, obviously having fun. You were surprised by just how much air time he could get! Her belly really was bouncy! Eventually, though, while he was descended, she shifted her belly a bit. \u201cWhoa!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat tiny change in the angle was enough for his next bounce to send him flying\u2026 straight into her mouth! You gasp in shock as the young boy slips right down her throat in a single instant. One moment he was there\u2026 and the next, he was just gone! He wasn\u2019t even big enough to make a bulge in that big tummy of her\u2019s\u2026 but she could still definitely feel him in there. \u201cMm\u2026 oh, that really hits the spot!\u201d She cooed, rubbing her belly as the boy settled within. \u201cHe\u2019s really wrigglin\u2019 in there! Hehe! Oh, I always love these lil belly rubs!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gaze in awe at her belly, eventually working up the courage to rub against it. You pressed your cheek up against it, trying to hear him in there, but his protests are completely muffled by the thick layers of hippo blubber. Although you knew he wasn\u2019t going to be hurt, you still felt bad for him. It must be scary to get eaten all of a sudden without expecting it. \u201cPoor kid\u2026\u201d You frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa! Don\u2019t worry about him! My stomachs so warm, and soft, and comfy, they always learn to love it in there!\u201d She smiled, rubbing her belly as she stands up, a triumphant grin on her face. \u201cIn the meantime\u2026 let\u2019s see what other kinda snacks I can get my hands on\u2026\u201d She strolls around, until she glances at the slide, and gets an idea. \u201cSsshhh\u2026\u201d She presses a finger over her lips with a smirk as she turns to you, before wrapping her stretchy maw around the exit of the slide, so that any kid that slid down would shoot right down her gullet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch, the suspense palpable, until eventually, you see a girl at the top of the slides, seemingly oblivious to the hippo waiting below. You could hear the slide creak as she slid down\u2026 and then, at the end, there was a sudden gulp! It was almost anticlimactic! With a smile, Hilda pulled away, wiping her mouth as she feels the girl settle in her belly. \u201cHehe! Oldest trick in the book!\u201d She smiled, her belly finally getting a little bit larger, now, though her appetite was still insatiable. \u201cOh, but they just made me even hungrier!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched in awe as she playfully and sneakily picks \u2018em all of one by one, slipping them into her belly without the others noticing. Soon, the playground is completely empty, and Hilda\u2019s belly is huge, round, and visibly bulging! She let's out a big burp as she sits down on a nearby bench, feeling the youngsters wriggling around within. \u201cOh\u2026 now THAT was a meal! I couldn\u2019t eat another bite!\u201d She said, with the most satisfied expression you\u2019ve ever seen. With that, she just sits back and relaxes, enjoying the many movements within her tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the youngsters started to relax, realizing it was actually rather nice and safe within her belly. With that, the movements finally came to a stop. \u201cMm\u2026 looks like they\u2019re taking a nap in there, now! I\u2019m glad they enjoyed~\u201d She cooed. \u201cGuess that\u2019s my coo to spit \u2018em out!\u201d With that, you watched in awe as she leaned forward, and her neck bulged as she spat out all the kids she ate all at once. They were restfully slumbering and covered in hippo slobber, now, but other then that, they were all unharmed. You sigh in relief, seeing she was telling the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that was fun!\u201d She smiled. \u201cWhat do ya wanna do now? Stick around downtown, maybe watch a movie\u2026 or should we just head home, so I can give you a glimpse of what it\u2019s like in here?\u201d You blushed as she poked her belly, playfully.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You stared at your massive, Hippo Babysitter casually tease you by pressing her pudgy fingers into her absurdly huge wrecking ball of a stomach. The grey-skinned blubber bounced up and down as shock-waves ripples across her flabby frame, putting you in an almost hypnotic trance. You shook yourself out after a couple of moments to decide what to do with Hilda from here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh...I th-think that we should just head back home for some peace and q-quiet...\" You stammered as you tried to hide your obvious blush to no avail from the Hippo, eliciting a smug smirk with just a hint of mischief to spread upon her lips. She had you wrapped around her finger. \"I-if that's alright with you, I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, Jeremy, of course, it's alright!\" The big hippo smiled with a wink, hovering her big paw above your head to ruffle your hair affectionately. \"I think that might be best, actually. It'll give us some time to get to know each other better in...private~\". With that, she stomped her way off from the park back towards your apartment, shaking her generous rear end at you in a gesture to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed even deeper and rushed to keep up with Hilda's captivating gait, shaking her padded hips side to side as she walked with impressive speed for someone of her weight. You had a million thoughts swimming around in your mind at a frenzied pace, giving you a slight headache. You knew that heading back to the apartment would mean you would get gobbled up faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo...why did you decide to head back? You didn't want to admit it to yourself, but you reluctantly reasoned that you, despite all odds, wanted to get eaten by her. The big Hippo women were something totally new to you, and despite a rough start, you really did like her presence. And you were curious as to what it was like inside her stomach. Since she made it clear you were going to spend the night inside of her, why prolong the inevitable?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes, you and Hilda finally made it back to your apartment building. The Hippo grimaced as she eyed the stairs, not liking the prospect of climbing up them again so alluring. But before she could take her first step, she felt a gentle tugging on her side. \"Miss Hilda, I th-think taking the elevator would be a lot easier for you.\" You directed her attention to the far wall of the lobby, where behind a support beam was two sliding, metal doors that met in the middle of a doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda slapped her forehead with a grunt for not seeing such s miracle device earlier. If she had, going up to and down from your apartment would have been a lot less cumbersome. \"Silly me! Thanks for that, sweetie. Now I do t have to take those horrid stairs!\". Walking towards the apparatus in question, however, you noticed that it may be too small for your Babysitter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was definitely not built to hold someone her side and weight, could she even fit through the doors? Before you could second guess bringing Hilda over here, she had already bent down to call for the elevator. After a few moments of waiting, the sliding doors finally opened to reveal a snug space for people to ride up and down in. You gulped, it WAS too small. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on in, Jeremy.\" Hilda gently shoved you inside after noticing you had frozen up, refusing to budge. You staggered into the metal box just in time to turn around and see the great, huge Hippo women flooded into the open space of the metal box after you, pinning you against the wall with her gut. \"Hehe, sorry sweetie! Sometimes I forget how small everything can be.\" She smiled, trying to make your position as comfy as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou closed your eyes as the grey toned launch invaded your space. It really was incredibly comfy, with how warm and soft it was. It was almost like one big pillow! Hilda smiled maternally as she felt you slowly embrace the big sphere, before turning her head around to face the panel of buttons. With a smirk, she slammed her big rear end into the whole panel, slamming all of the buttons at once. Your apartment was only on the second floor, so it wasn't too big of a deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator, straining hard with all the weight it had to support, slowly made it's way up the vertical shaft. Meanwhile, you just continued to cuddle up against the hippo's blubbery tummy. Hilda pressed herself just a little bit harder into the wall, enjoying the belly massage you were providing for her. \"Naww, thank you for all the snuggles, Jeremy!\" She cooed, finally giving you room to breathe as she leaned back into the box's doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment Hilda's gut left your torso, you immediately missed it being there, missing the warmth and comfort that she provided. You smiled and blushed up at the Hippo Babysitter, rubbing her expansive paunch absentmindedly. \"Hilda...\" you pipe up, finally working up the courage. \"Could you...could you please eat me?\". You were kind of surprised at the words that came out of your mouth If was a combination of words you had never conceived of putting together in a sentence before. The hippo's smile widened as she head your request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's wait until we get back home, young man~\" Hilda winked, bending down to grab your shoulders and hoist you up into the air. Before you knew it you were wrapped up in a hug that smooshed your face up to her perky bosom, and it would have made you blush if it wasn't for the amount of blood already present in your cheeks. \"We'll get to that soon. First, I was thinking that the two of us could...\"</span></div></div>",

This is Ms. Weatherford, a kind neighbor that recently moved in and offered to babysit you. While we are out on our anniversary for the week, I want you to be on your best behavior, do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are dumbfounded by the usual strict tone of your mother. Wondering if you are dreaming, you pinch your cheek but find yourself very much grounded in reality. A voice calls to you in your head, causing you to freeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>I wouldn't bother trying to convince them of what you see of me. In their eyes, they only see me as a mere human. I'm giving you the pleasure of seeing my true form, Jake.</i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasp, recognizing that the voice belonged to the woman. Of course, given her presence, she had to have done something to your parents!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother sighs and turns her head to the dragon woman. \"Please take care of him, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Weatherford nods and then smiles gently towards the parents. \"Of course, I will take care of him as if he's my own son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed to put your mother at ease and then without a word, your mother gives you one stern look before leaving the house with her bags. Your father follows behind as well, actually taking a moment to give you a hug before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the door shuts behind them, you are still frozen, staring wide-eyed at the dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How...is this possible?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Weatherford raises her eyebrow and places a hand on her hips. Her chest jiggles in her own movements and despite the fear you should be feeling, there's an odd sense of arousal over her appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hun, it's always been possible,\" she speaks with her maw, \"...we've just been able to hide our existence for a while. Naturally, it's never been leaked out since we can erase everyone memories. That said, you might be wondering why I decided to reveal myself to you and accept this job, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn away, placing your hands on your head.  \"T-this isn't real.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I was just curious over such a sad situation like yours,\" she continues, ignoring your state of shock, \"...you're clearly old enough to take care of yourself and when your parents told me how much you meant to them, this two-hundred-year-old body of mine was actually moved. <i>I want you.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer last sentence doesn't escape you and now, you feel the fear that should've come when you first saw her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stumble back and raise your hands in defense. \"A-are you going to eat me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it is Ms. Weatherford's to be surprised. There's a moment of silence before she laughs out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Eat you? Oh hun, come on! I may be a dragon, but I haven't lived my life in human society secretly eating people! No, what I mean is...that I want you as my son...my child...my foul. While I'm taking care of you, I hope you'll start warming up to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are greatly confused now, but aren't able to think upon her declaration that she means you no harm. She comes closer and without warning, you yelp as she scoops you up in her arms. Now that she's up close, you realize that she's at least a foot or two taller than you! Not only that, she's incredibly strong! It seems those heavy mounds on her chest aren't even a problem for her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Weatherford hums and then licks her lips. \"Now then, our first business together will be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will it be?</span></div></div>",

She doesn't want to eat you and she actually wants you to be her child. That said, this would be the last thing that came to your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you stare in disbelief, your words caught up in your throat as you try to keep up with the turn of events, Ms. Weatherford has already traveled with you to your parents' bedroom. There, she drops you down, shaking you out of your stupor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a playful growl, she begins to unbuckle your pants and you try to resist. \"Hold on a second! W-why is this happening?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon chuckles as she successfully pries your hands away from your belt and slides down your pants. \"Hun, didn't I say? I want you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but you said as a child which doesn't make any sense either!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can adjust, can't we? Besides, I think some good rocking will help us get a good start on bonding. I was hired to babysit you after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, this is...not real, you're not real!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep saying that, hun...keep saying that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all your clothes stripped off thanks to the dragon's strong tug, you lie on the bed in denial and whimpering, but the dragoness doesn't go soft on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grin, she forces your hands away from your crotch which reveals a light erection. That's a good sign even if it looks like you're in turmoil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn't waste anytime positioning her sex over you. Before you could utter a cry of protest, she slams down and deeply embeds your member into her. That cuts off anything you had to say as you feel a wave of pleasant tightness overwhelming you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh shit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Weatherford chuckles again. \"After this, you're not gonna care what I am, you'll come to love it all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo that end, she moves her hips and with it, starts shaking the bed. You groan, losing any resistance you had as your body allowed the dragoness to overwhelm you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lets out a soft moan as your member stirs her and while it's nowhere near the biggest, she's satisfied enough to know that someone smaller than her is enjoying her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in proper rhythm, she leans forward and buries your head between her chest, keeping you locked on her through the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passes but you forget the amount or how much you ejaculated through it all, but opening your eyes, you find everything calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're still nuzzled between the dragoness' enormous mammaries and furthermore, your limp cock is warmed by her insides which she has not removed. Overall, you are trapped against her scaly skin but after the huge welcoming session that she forced you into, how do you feel about it?</span></div></div>",

In fact, you feel great!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was it, hun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her velvet voice that added warmth when she spoke, you could now see that she truly didn't mean any harm to you. After a moment of silence, you hum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush further. \"N-no, it was great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with your answer, she giggles and pulls you in closer. You realize your cock is still inside her and it feels at any moment, you'll grow hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you want to pull away, she locks her scaly legs around and pushes you in further. As a result, your member reawakens and pulsates against her vaginal walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing shakily, the dragoness comforts you by rubbing her hand across your shoulder. She asks another question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So hun, not that I'm giving you a choice here, but don't you think remaining by my side and as my son is a good thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown, wondering about that. Now that you're forced to accept the reality of her presence and that there may be others like her, being her child seems unrealistic.

The fact that they thought you still need a babysitter is demeaning and you wanted more than anything to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what? That's fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Weatherford raises an eyebrow. \"Is it really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clear your throat and begin slowly moving your hips, not wanting to ignore the fact that you're still inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unf...yeah, I...really can't stand them. They always keep treating me like I'm a child!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragonness closes her eyes for a moment and sighs in bliss, feeling her son rock her gently. She rubs your back gently as you enjoy yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...hun, while you say that, you'll still be a child to me. I've lived a long life you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you keep thrusting, you aren't sure how to counter that. In the end, you bury your head between her breasts and provide an excuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but you're...different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Weatherford snorts and teases you a little. \"Hun, I think you just like fucking me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing, you don't respond but the dragonness doesn't need to hear anymore to know that you've quickly taken a liking to her. Although she may have been rough, getting you to feel the pleasures of her body definitely is a great motivating factor to a former virgin such as yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hun, let's get into a better position. It's time that I start nursing you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hum in agreement and it's only a small turn for you to lie on top of her in a missionary position. While you continue thrusting, she places one hand on the back of your head and guides you to her left breast. While there hasn't been any indication that she lactates, it's only when you latch over her nipple and try to get into a suckling rhythm do you taste a bit of milk. Dragon milk is sweet and seems to have a slight tartness to it which reminds you of oranges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike that, you've taken the large dragonness as your mother knowing that even if you remain as a child in her eyes, she provides you more love than you can ever dream about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the remaining week with your parents out, Ms. Weatherford takes care of you and sometimes without your consent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the mornings, she'd cook up breakfast and nurse you for a couple hours, even when you're not hungry. Apparently, dragon milk can do wonders for the body and you don't quite believe her when she claims that as long as you nurse from her, you wouldn't age as fast and would slowly grow stronger too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than that, she would almost constantly have rounds of sex with you allowing you to do her in various positions with the exception from behind as you couldn't seem to handle her tail which got in the way. At times though, you really couldn't handle anymore as the dragonness could go on with days without stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring these breaks of sex, you'd take time to get out of the house and jog, play video games, or read. Since you've already graduated, you were supposed to take part in the admission process to a college but you've largely ignored that ever since Ms. Weatherford entered your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce, you saw Ms. Weatherford wave her hand and open a magical portal before your eyes. Shocked, you asked her where she planned on going but she reassured you that she'd be back as she had to attend to some \"business\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were very curious but Ms. Weatherford never gave you any details related to her origin, family, or anything to others like her. You could only come up with your own guesses and hoped she would tell you when the time comes for you to leave with her, wherever that may be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week passes pretty quickly like that and you are eager to know what your future may entail when you await the arrival of your parents which would end Ms. Weatherford's job as being your babysitter and a new job as your mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens when your parents come back?</span></div></div>",

Even now, though you can just move out, they come up with all sorts of measures to make sure you can\u2019t leave the house without them\u2026 even hiring anthros to \u2018babysit\u2019 you. You knew what that really meant\u2026 they just hired these big, strong animal folk so that they can make sure you can\u2019t escape the house! It\u2019s always felt more like they were your prison guards than your caretakers, nice as they always were\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou guess it was time to meet this new \u2018sitter\u2019, though. With a mournful sigh, you pull yourself up to your feet and trot towards the front door, waiting to see whatever bear or wolf your parents have found this time. They really must look hard for these sitters, considering just how rare anthros were\u2026 but to be fair, they certainly made good \u2018guards\u2019. They were usually absolutely massive compared to most human women, with the strength to back up their size. Your eyes widened as you opened the door, though, to find tonight\u2019s sitter might be even bigger than you imagined\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there, sweetheart! Well, aren\u2019t you just the cutest~?\u201d Not only did she stand a couple feet taller than yourself, but she was quite a bit\u2026 rounder than you expected. Last time you got a muscular feline gal\u2026 but tonight\u2019s sitter was all pudge! From that huge belly that poked halfway out from beneath her overworked shirt, to those massive, wide hips that could just barely fit through your doorway. It was hard to even tell what species she was, as instead of fur, she was covered in slick, completely smooth skin, that seemed to be completely devoid of hair or fur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at her face, though, you realized\u2026 you instantly recognized her! \u201cBwuh\u2026 wuh\u2026\u201d Your mind draws a blank as you\u2019re shocked with the sudden flashback to an even just a little less than a year ago, a memory that\u2019s slightly faded in your mind but is now coming roaring back. You can almost feel the cool summer breeze as you mentally slip back to that day at the local pool, a day where you had just been trying to enjoy the rare freedom of not having to stick around at home all the time\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had just been sipping on some soda as you leaned back on a pool chair, soaking in the sun\u2019s rays\u2026 and then you saw her! This very orca! You figure aquatic anthros like her must really be drawn to the pool. Since you had been wearing sunglasses, you had felt comfortable just sort of watching the massive woman as she swam skilfully around the pool, rather intrigued. You weren\u2019t really into anthros, but you had always sort of had a thing for\u2026 \u2018larger\u2019 women. And she certainly fit the bill! You\u2019ve never seen anyone larger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite this, she still showed off some incredible swimming skill, gliding through the water like it was all nothing, with a smile on her face all the while. You couldn\u2019t keep track of how long you had been watching her\u2026 but one moment, when she had leaned against a corner of the pool close to you, you had heard her massive, fat belly growl hungrily. She licked her lips, apparently having worked up an appetite. You had expected her to head to the cafe\u2026 but instead, she wades deeper into the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, you watch as she seems to be directly approaching some kid who was playing around all by himself in some obscure corner of the pool, slinking underwater once she was halfway there. You kept your eyes on the pool, wondering just what she was doing hidden away beneath the way\u2026 until, all of a sudden, that kid disappeared! In an instant, he had slid down beneath the surface of the water, disappearing into the blueness below. You tilted your head, wondering when he\u2019d resurface\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, though, only the orca lady re-emerged. She let out a shuddering belched as she finally climbed out of the pool, the water dripping from her smooth, pudgy body, before she collapsed onto her back on a nearby pool chair that seemed far too small for her. You stared at her, trying to wrap your mind around where that kid must\u2019ve went\u2026 until you notice a faint bulge in her gut! It was super subtle\u2026 you had to be staring directly at her gut with sheer concentration in order to notice it\u2026 but it was there! Almost like something was pushing from the inside!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared for probably half an hour, trying to figure out whether you were seeing things correctly. The bulges only appeared every once in a while, and each time they were so subtle, they could almost be construed as just your imagination. You hardly even wanted to consider the possibility that they weren\u2019t your imagination - that the massive orca lady had imprisoned that young boy in her huge gut, letting the thick layers of pudge on her massive belly completely hide his movements! You didn\u2019t know whether you hoped it was all just your imagination\u2026 or whether you hoped it was real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, she eventually left, leaving you wondering from that day forward about what you saw. Eventually, you just dismissed it from your mind as a figment of your imagination. Still, seeing the massive orca couldn\u2019t help but bring all that confusion right back into your head! Meanwhile, the orca just seemed to be confused. \u201cUmm\u2026 are you alright, little one?\u201d She asked, bending over, looking concerned. \u201cShould I get you a glass of water? You seem woozy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no\u2026 I\u2019m\u2026\u201d You stutter, trying to shake your head and compose yourself. \u201cI\u2019m fine! Really! Thank you for the concern\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, no problem sweetheart! I\u2019d be a terrible babysitter if I let my charge just pass out the moment I walked in~\u201d She giggled, patting you on the head. With that, she managed to squeeze those huge hips through the door, before whistling as she looked around the sizable house. \u201cMy name\u2019s Latoya! It\u2019s nice to meet you, little cutie! I can already tell we\u2019re gonna have a TON of fun together!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, at least she seemed\u2026 nice. Although the way she was talking about you made you feel like she saw you as a child. \u201cUhhh\u2026 yeah,\u201d you shrugged, following along after her as she trotted into the house. \u201cI\u2019m sure we are\u2026 wait, where are you going?\u201d Sure enough, she seemed to be trotting deeper into the house, almost as if she had her mind set on something!</span></div></div>",

The kitchen, of course!\u201d She rolled her eyes in a teasing manner before swiveling her fat head back to bend down and pinch your cheek, as if you had just learned to tie your shoes. \u201cA big gal like me needs all the food she can get to stay full!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, well it\u2019s, uh...i-it\u2019s down that hall, they're\u2026\u201d You pointed down one of the many corridors of your home that led to the house\u2019s kitchen, to which Laytola immediately dashed towards as if she was in a frenzy. As she did so, she gave you a very good view of her very generously sized rear end, swaying back and forth like a disturbed water bed. You began to blush hard as an erection tightened in your pants. You hoped your 'love' of more 'healthy' looking women wouldn't make things too awkward with you and your babysitter...of course, it was already awkward since you half believed that this was the same Orca that may or may not have devoured a kid!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were interrupted from your small daydream as you heard Laytola's voice ring out through the household. \"Mmmhmm, you guys sure keep some good food!\". After that, a stifled yet still audible belch could be heard emanating from the kitchen, followed immediately afterward by the scarfing down of multiple foodstuffs. Aroused that this gigantic anthro was eating all your food, yet afraid for your food supply, you hurriedly rushed into the kitchen to meet up with your babysitter. Noticing that you had entered her new domain, the fat orca turned to face you with a smile from her seated position on the tiled floor in front of the open fridge. \"Oh, sorry! Did you want anything to eat? If so, I'll just call a pizza place for 'ya\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a big smile, the Orca women turned the rest of her fat body to face you, giving you a good look at where most of the food in the fridge had gone. You were amazed, you had left her alone for only a few minutes, and half of the food in your fridge was already being digested in her tummy. Packages were strewn about the floor and her gut gurgled and groaned happily. You tore your eyes away from Laytola's gut to look into her wide, brilliant eyes, completely devoid of guilt or shame as she chomped down on a whole piece of carrot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...n-no, I'm not too hungry, right now. Feel free to eat as much as you want.\" You instantly regretted the words as they came out of your mouth. You just gave this stranger complete access to all the foodstuffs in your home, and judging by how her stomach didn't look th slightest bit taut, she wasn't full at all! Your parents are gonna be so pissed! \"And, yeah, pizza sounds good. Should I order it now, or...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, please do!\" Laytola smiled, fishing out a fistful of money from her boobs before tossing them towards you. Your eyes widened at the amount that was currently in your hands. She wanted you to spend all of this...on pizza?\" Aw, geez, you guys really do have some of the best food ever! That white stuff in the little cartons had to be my favorite!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pocketed the absurd amount of money into your pants pocket to use it later. \"Little white...did you eat heavy whipping cream from the carton?\" You asked, not sure how what the appropriate response to this situation was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meh, I've had heavier, but it sure was tasty!\" She beamed, suppressing a small burp. She grabbed hold of a few bags of food that was left remaining in the fridge and happily skipped her way over to the tabletop, making the whole room shake as she did. With a happy spring in each and every movement, she opened up a container of juicy, plump strawberries, popping them into her mouth one by one, only briefly savoring the deliciously sweet flavor of each before swallowing it up, top and all, and reaching for another. The orca women was pretty much an eating machine, devouring berry after berry until, in what seemed only a few moments, she had finished off the whole box and had moved onto a canister of whipped cream. You watched in disbelief and slight arousal as she guzzled down the entire canister, spraying the cream almost directly down her throat in a single long pull. Once the can only hissed with empty air, she tilted her head back forwards and licked her lips appreciatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, why don\u2019t you feed me?\u201d Laytola suddenly asked, her wide gaze focused directly you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jumped a bit in your shoes, your erection growing more and more obvious as the situation became weirder and weirder. \"You...you want me to feed you? Shouldn't you be the one feeding me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019ll be fun!\u201d she chirped. \"Besides, you still have that money for pizza, right? You'll be fine!\" You looked at Laytola, the empty can of whipped cream in her hands, the still-ajar, and significantly more barren fridge, and down at his shameful bulge. Sighing, you moved towards the orca women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI might as well at this point. Not like today can get any weirder\u2026\u201d you spoke to no one but yourself, omitting the fact that he really wanted to get a closer look at the orca's burgeoning belly. Somehow, he found it strangely alluring. Laytola smiled happily as he approached her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, man, this is gonna be so much fun, just like I promised, right? I want you to stuff my belly to the brim!\". You cracked a small grin at how adorable this fully grown women was presenting herself to you. So far, she was just a big eating machine with the appearance and demeanor of a teddy bear. You picked up a tub of vanilla yogurt and a spoon out of a nearby drawer to accompany it. You scooped up a heaping spoonful and offered it to the big whale, her large bum wiggling in anticipation as if it was a tail. She eagerly opened her mouth to accept the quivering spoonful of a treat, and moments later her lips snapped shut around the handle of the spoon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure of how to respond, you slowly withdrew the cutlery from between her closed lips, noticing that it had been completely licked clean. Laytola closed her eyes and hummed in delight, thoroughly tasting and enjoying the spoonful of yogurt while the boy watched. \"So, um...I think you might be the best babysitter I've ever had.\" He finally said, in a distracting fashion. The orca's eyes fluttered open and gave a big gulp, swallowing up everything in her mouth to free it up for talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, what a sweet thing to say! Thank you, sweetie. And may I say, you really know what kind of food to stock up on!\" She battered her eyes at you as if it was a seductive compliment. Although it was your parents that picked out the food and it was something really weird to be appreciative for, you couldn't help but blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha...thank you, Laytola.\"  He responded with a nervous smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You\u2019re welcome!\u201d Laytola chirped, \u201cNow come on, let\u2019s get feeding! I can\u2019t wait to taste this all and pack it away inside my tummy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Laytola's impromptu feeding session got started. You quickly found yourself hard-pressed to keep up with the ravenous whale The first bite of something new would always be savored and enjoyed, but after that, it was a mad dash to get it all down her throat and into her happily gurgling tummy. All sorts of food and drink passed her lips in the blink of an eye. She gulped down assorted cheeses, veggies, and fruits like they were nothing, and even slurped down a whole string of sausages! You held and fed it into her mouth as it was reeled into her tummy. A whole gallon of chocolate milk vanished down her throat in a single go, giving her belly a nice sloshy timbre to accompany the various gurgles and glorps of digestion. Your babysitter didn\u2019t even shy away from eating up jars full of sauce or a bowl of plain leftover pasta. All food was welcome in her gut, and it just kept growing more and more, getting larger and louder to accommodate it all. When you were nearly running out of food in the fridge, her belly had grown to be almost twice as large, a massively warm sphere of melting food and soft flab...</span></div></div>",

Even still, it wasn\u2019t hard for you to make out the curves that lay beneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarge breasts, even for a cow, thrust out from her while her broad hips completed the hourglass figure. This hourglass had a flared middle though. Her sweater strained around a spherical belly. The lower hem <i>almost</i> let slip the bottom curve of her stomach. Your brow furrowed. You couldn\u2019t be sure, but you thought you might have seen the sphere warm somewhat, pressed out from within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Is she pregnant?</i> you wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo this is little Vanessa,\u201d she said in a lyrical voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave a quick shake of your head. It felt like you had been staring at the cow for quite some time, yet neither her nor your mother gave any sign that such a thing had happened. You scowled as the \u201clittle\u201d comment pierced the fog in your brain. There was a twinkle in the cow\u2019s eyes as if she said it to provoke and saw that it stuck true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard plenty about you already, and we\u2019re going to have a lot of fun.\u201d Then turning to your mother, \u201cAnd don\u2019t worry, Mrs. Williams, I\u2019ll make sure your daughter stays out of trouble as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rolled your eyes as the scowl deepened and you muttered, \u201cOne time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought you had hidden it well enough, but your mother saw it even still and chided you for it. She then apologized to the cow, Ms. Snow, but the cow waved it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s understandable. An unfamiliar guest and an unwelcome situation. Some annoyance is expected,\u201d she said in that lyrical voice with a grin dimpling her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother pursed her lips, looking only somewhat placated and still angry with you. Whatever further thoughts she had didn\u2019t escape though as your father returned, planting a peck on her cheek. He seemed unaware of the tension simmering, and proceeded to tell you to behave before ruffling your hair. Scowling again, you did your best to smooth your hair back out. He then led your mother out the door and they were gone. The cow took you by the shoulder and led you to the door, telling you to tell your parents good-bye. You did so, but not without grumbling. Even still, Ms. Price seemed pleased as she led you back inside. She then shut the door behind you and turned towards you with an almost feral grin that seemed out of place. You gulped despite yourself, wondering what was coming next.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That feral grin remained in place as she took a hold of her sweater and pulled it off in one swift and smooth motion. You gaped as first her furred belly slipped free, followed in a moment by her substantial breasts. Beneath the sweater, she had on a silky and lacy bra, portions of it partially transparent to better tease the eyes. Ms. Snow shook her head, running her fingers through her ponytail. You didn\u2019t pay much attention to that though; you only had eyes for her body. Something was off there, and it wasn\u2019t only the fact that the cow was now half-naked in your living room. That was quite a surprise too though, a blush creeping up your neck and into your cheeks. No, there was also the rather odd thing that she looked bigger, rounder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rubbed your eyes. There was no way it was possible. As your eyes focused again though, you could see that she had not changed back. What lay exposed now could not have fit beneath the sweater before. Her breasts were larger, rounder, and even heavier looking. They squashed a bit against the upper swell of her stomach, and what a stomach it was now. That furred sphere was now big enough that it rested partway on her thighs when before it only sagged a bit. Her thighs had grown as well, pushing out further in all directions and making her pants look painted on. You had no doubt that she would brush the doorframe on either side when passing through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed, snapping you out of your starring. \u201cI forgot how good it feels to see such a shocked expression on someone when they see me pull that trick,\u201d she managed to say between further bouts of laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrick?\u201d you stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hummed agreement as she wiped a tear from an eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I must be crazy. There\u2019s no way that she just\u2026<i>expanded</i> like that!\u201d you said to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Snow sighed. \u201cNo, Vanessa, you are not crazy. And technically I didn\u2019t \u2018expand\u2019, I merely did away with the illusion. And <i>MMM</i> does it feel fantastic to do so as well,\u201d she said while running her fingers through her luxurious looking belly fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIllusion?\u201d you repeated, your mind still slipping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, an illusion and a rather simple one at that.\u201d A frown crossed her face, darkening her attractive features. \u201cYou\u2026aren\u2019t going to be just repeating bits of what I say, are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA bit too much to take in,\u201d you managed to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of thought, she gave a quick nod. \u201cTrue, I\u2019ll give you that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen without another word, she swept past you. Your nose picked up a scent: floral for the most part, but with a spicy edge almost hidden. You were unsure why, but it made you feel a bit more at peace, your whirling mind slowing down a hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found the cow making herself at home, sitting on the couch, her discarded sweater beside her. Her thighs spread out a bit, granting some room for the dome of her stomach to rest. Her breasts wobbled a bit as she repositioned herself on the couch, worming her round rump further into the cushions. She then turned her gaze towards you.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The suggestion of ordering pizza came out of nowhere. It stunned you with how simple it was after how strange everything had been up till then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe little ones and I are getting hungry,\u201d she said as explanation as she rubbed her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, her stomach let out a hungry roar. A flurry of activity came from within as well. The cow squirmed and bit her lip as she rubbed her hands across what she could reach of the swell of her belly. Did you see a hint of blush peeking through the fur and a curl to her lips? You shook it off and asked if she had any preference for what to get. It took several further seconds for her to answer that anything was fine. There was a tremor in her voice as she continued to need the sphere, but there was also something odd about her voice. You couldn\u2019t quite place it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dismissed that concern too. Then you pulled out your phone, found the number of one of your favorite places and made an order. You upsized your usual and then did it again as you looked your babysitter over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes spun past. After she had settled her brood, she turned on the TV. You rarely remained focused on the vapid show she selected. Instead, your gaze kept getting drawn to stare at the swollen curves of the cow beside you. After a bit, you would tear your eyes away, but soon after found yourself staring at her again. On the third or fourth of these back and forth glances, you jolted as you realized the cow was staring back at you. As you snapped your eyes forwards again though, you saw a bit of a grin tugging at the corners of her lips again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it was, you were thankful for the knock at the door. Hopping to your feet, you started to grab the money your parents left behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on, why don\u2019t you use this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to look at Ms. Snow. In her hand was a large coin, odd looking thing too. Besides to the strange symbol on the metal, it possessed a funny shimmer that grew more vibrant when you looked at it out of the side of your eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think\u2013\u201c you started to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo on, just show them it and it will take care of everything,\u201d she interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, thinking you should take the money and leave the weird coin behind. Then you noticed the earnest look on the cow\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right, I don\u2019t know why, but all right,\u201d you said throwing your hands up, and then grabbing the coin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the short walk to the door, you noticed something else. The coin was warm, quite a bit warmer than it should have been. You shuddered as you thought about where she might have been hiding it. There was also a freaky\u2026vibration coming from it. You couldn\u2019t quite find the right word for the sensation spreading into your hand from the coin, but vibration seemed close enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door, you felt a slight grin on your face. You recognized the tall, slender snake standing there balancing the pizza box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Trish, you said as she looked up from her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh heya, \u2018Nessa. Wasn\u2019t sure if this was your order, you having a party or somethin\u2019?\u201d She leaned a bit, peeking around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou responded that it was nothing like that. Trish seemed unconvinced, her brow tiling up on one side, but let the matter drop before telling you the price. You started to move to pull some money out before remembering the cow\u2019s cryptic direction and her coin. Even though you were going to make a fool of yourself, you held the coin out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s\u2026?\u201d Trish\u2019s voice trailed off, her eyes loosing focus even as they remained glued on the coin and her jaw slackened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh\u2026Trish\u2026what\u2019s up?\u201d you said, snapping your fingers in front of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt did work, didn\u2019t it?\u201d came Ms. Snow\u2019s voice. You were about to ask her what was going on when she continued, \u201cExcellent, tell her to come in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What in the world is going on?</i> along with <i>What in the world is this coin?</i> swam through your head. You were not sure why but you did as you were directed again, telling Trish to come inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snake moved through the door past you, her motions weird and far stiffer than the usual grace Trish possessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, come on\u2026\u201d Ms. Snow said with more than a little impatience in her voice from the couch, looking back over her shoulder as you entered the room with Trish still at your heels. Again, you were about to ask what had happened to Trish when the cow looked the snake over and said, \u201cHmm\u2026knew I was right about you, and such a fine job already. Come over here darling.\u201d She motioned for the snake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish stepped around the couch. Ms. Snow took the pizza box from the snake\u2019s stiff hands and set it on the table before her. Trish was still looking at you and the coin even if you dropped it from her view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Ms. Snow shocked you yet again as she said, \u201cNow my dear, take off your clothes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gaped at what the cow was asking, and were about to shout. But then Trish followed the order and started taking off her clothes right there and without a word. Before long, every scrap of her outfit was piled beside her and she remained standing stock still before the cow, her scales gleaming. The shocking things were not at an end though, as then the cow\u2026</span></div></div>",
