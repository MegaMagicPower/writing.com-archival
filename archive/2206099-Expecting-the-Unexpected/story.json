I lived with my mom, my stepdad, and my 14-year-old stepbrother, Pat. We all got along well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't a whole lot that was special about me back then. I was a plain-looking girl, not a lot of curves. I didn't have a lot of interests in school, keeping to myself, except for a small circle of friends. Needless to say, the boys weren't exactly tripping over each other to get to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for my experience with the opposite sex, what I knew about the male anatomy was akin to what I knew about the Eiffel Tower: I knew it existed, I'd seen some pictures, but I couldn't tell you the first thing about what it was like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou may think it's strange that I'm talking so much about my absence of experience when it comes to sex. But I need for you to know these things about me. I need you to believe them. I need you to believe <i>me.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause, if you don't believe me, you won't have any idea why I reacted to two words my doctor said as if she'd said them in a language I'd never heard before.</span></div></div>",

I had no food allergies, and Pop was a decent cook. So why couldn't I keep it down?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassie?\" Mom called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI texted her: Sick. Throwing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe texted back: Stay home. I'll call the Dr.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen my stomach was finally empty, I brushed my teeth and gargled three times, just so my breath wouldn't announce that I'd spent the morning ralphing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that done, I went downstairs. \"Do you think you could handle a cup of tea and some saltines?\" Mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy stomach didn't instantly rebel at the thought, so I said, \"I'll try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I sipped the tea, Mom asked, \"Any idea where this is from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head. \"I was fine last night.

As I had said, I was going more frequently, so I didn't even need to turn on a faucet to get things done. Then, I went back to the exam room and waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was getting on lunchtime when Dr. Foster came back in. \"We've got our answer, Cassie,\" she said. \"You're pregnant.\"</span></div></div>",

No prizes for guessing why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon't misunderstand me. What I said when I told Trish I was pregnant was true. I did not - do not - believe that the three-month-old fetus inside me was put there by a higher power. I didn't, and don't, believe that I was <i>chosen</i>. I didn't understand how this baby had come to be, but that was no reason to believe that it had an important destiny to fulfill. The more I thought about it - and anybody you ask will only be half-joking when they ask if I thought about anything else - the more I came to the conclusion that what was happening to me and inside me was perfectly natural, if totally unusual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you can't really blame me for feeling a good deal of sympathy for that <i>other</i> teenage girl who found herself pregnant without sex, can you? I read about how her fiance was being nice to her when he planned to break up with her (sparing her the punishment she would have suffered if he'd publicly accused her), and I couldn't help thinking of Great-Grandma, shipped off to some place nobody cared about to have her baby. <i>How is it,</i> I pondered, <i>that there has been more progress in the time between Great-Grandma and me than between Mary and Great-Grandma?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs far as gifts went, I got some Blu-Rays, some clothes that might fit me next Christmas but were too small for me now,... and a book of baby names from Nana.

To be fair, both arguments had reasonable evidence behind them. It just so happened that evidence for one was also evidence for the other. I was eating more, thanks to both my morning sickness subsiding and my appetite increasing. My belly was undeniably bigger, thanks to the baby taking up more room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, anybody who cared to eavesdrop on the lunchtime conversations I had with Trish and Susan could have settled the debate, since I spent so much time talking about the baby. Now, though, I was also talking about my mind, since I had started having bizarre dreams and wanted someone to hear about them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd I'm not exaggerating when I call them bizarre: One dream had me with a transparent belly, so people could see the baby before it was even born. Another had me as the mother of a boy whose dingaling was where his nose should be, and I was trying to stop him from showing it to everyone. \"My brother would totally do that!\" Susan said of that dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, with all this talking about the baby that we were doing, you'd think I'd have an answer when Susan asked me, \"So, what do you want to say when people start asking whose it is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I didn't, so I turned to Trish. \"Yeah, Cassie,\" she said. \"We want to put up a united front, but we have to take our cues from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh, I haven't decided yet,\" I was forced to concede.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you'd better,\" Trish said. \"It's going to get more obvious that you aren't just packing on the pounds, and, since you aren't dating anyone, they're going to ask how it happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew she was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how do you explain how you got pregnant, when even medical science says \"Damned if we know\"?</span></div></div>",

I have no idea how this baby got here, but it's in here now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, as for the rumors that you claim - \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't <i>claim</i> anything,\" I said. \"I was not visited by any heavenly messenger, and I was not asked if I would agree to bear a child. I woke up sick to my stomach, and the doctor said it was morning sickness. That was how I found out I was pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I may ask,... why didn't you, uh,... ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it honestly never crossed my mind. Maybe part of it was thinking that whatever got me pregnant might just do it again. But another part was... curiosity. A baby under these circumstances, you kinda want to see how it turns out, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you consider this baby to be a miracle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never heard a mother call her baby anything else. So, in that sense, yes, it's a miracle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would you like to see this baby treated?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I say something funny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not like that. I just remembered a joke Pat told me two years ago:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, one day, the Pope was visited by aliens. And they're having a very nice discussion, when the Pope asks them, 'Have you ever heard of a man named Jesus Christ?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the alien leader says, 'Of course, He visits our planet twice a year.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Twice a year? It's been over 2000 years, and we're still waiting for His Second Coming.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Didn't He like your chocolate?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Chocolate?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Whenever He comes, we have always given Him the very best chocolates we make. Why, what did <i>you</i> do when He came?'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarice and I both laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks again,\" Clarice said. \"This may not make the next edition, but I'm sure you'll read it soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye.

My belly has caught up to my boobs, which is where I should be. And my friends say I have such a glow about me, they're seriously thinking that there's a higher power involved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A higher power, you say? And what do you call this higher power?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, frankly, I call it a deadbeat dad, because I've been left high and dry dealing with this baby. Seriously, if there is something... divine about this situation, the one responsible doesn't seem interested in being worshipped. Maybe this baby won't be so much about 'Look what I can do,' and more about 'Look what <i>we</i> can do.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Well, enough speculating, let's see how you're both actually doing.\" With that, the examination began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Dr. Foster was done, she said, \"So far, everything seems to be checking out. You're right where you ought to be, which is unusual for a teen mother-to-be. Sometimes, at this point, I would order an amniocentesis, which is a test of the amniotic fluid. There is a slight risk of miscarriage, so I'll run it by you before I do anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the mention of miscarriage, I wrapped my arm around my belly, as if to protect and reassure the baby. \"Is it medically necessary?\" Mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strictly speaking, it's not specifically called for. But it's something that would give us a handle on any possible birth defects. I'm confident in how you're doing, Cassie, but, since the identity of the father is up in the air, I'd like to touch all the bases. As I said, the risk is slight, and I don't believe you'll have any ill effects.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI certainly wanted to know if the baby was healthy. I nodded, and Mom said, \"Alright. You can do the amnio.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Foster stuck a needle in my belly, and drew out some fluid. \"The risk of miscarriage is chiefly if I accidentally hit the fetus with the needle, but it doesn't look like that's happened here. There may be some discomfort, so take it easy for the rest of the day. Now, the amnio will also tell us if you're having a boy or a girl, but some want to be surprised on the big day. Do you want to be surprised, or was finding out that you're pregnant surprise enough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mind waiting to see what it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then. We'll send you the test results later, and you're free to go.\"</span></div></div>",

To whoever's reading this, let me tell you: If your doctor says there may be some discomfort, interpret it like the captain of the <i>Titanic</i> saying they're stopping for ice. My belly was sore for the rest of the day. I was glad I was staying home: I could just imagine wedging my sore belly into a desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy interview finally made the school paper. Apparently, it took this long for the editor to decide enough people were talking about me and my baby to make it news. Trish and Susan called, and said they liked the joke at the end. They said it showed I wasn't taking it too seriously. Maybe more people would treat me like plain old Cassie Pennant again, just with a plus one until school was out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did the homework that was assigned that day, and decided to relax with a book. Before I realized what I was doing, I started reading the book aloud. I realized I was reading to the baby. I put the YA novel aside, and picked up my copy of <i>Green Eggs and Ham</i>. It was a bit more baby-friendly than the occasional F-bomb from my other books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days later, Dr. Foster called to assure me that there was no sign of any birth defects in my baby. I was so glad to hear it, I hugged everybody I came in contact with, even Veronica Decker.</span></div></div>",

I was enjoying my order when a shadow fell upon me. \"Good afternoon, Cassie.\" softly, a male voice said. \"Do you mind if I join you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked up to find a handsome man near my age I had never seen before. Sensing no danger, I silently nodded, and he sat down across from me. \"Please tell me you are not going to try to open a conversation with a cheesy pick-up line.\" Calmly, I demanded. \"I'm having enough trouble with another person in my life.\" I pushed back, patting my abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man smiled, and I swore I could see a tear forming in his eye. I thought I had let him down easy, and guessed some men were just sensitive to rejection.

As I told you, I am from your future.\" he paused then added, \"If you want more proof, there will be an accident across the street in five... four... three... two... one...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI jumped as I heard a loud crash, and looked out to see that a car had run a red light and struck another car. Darkly curious, I turned back to Brian and asked, \"What do you want with me...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian sighed. \"Ten years from now, we will meet.\" Whispering, he said. \"We will fall in love and... start a family.\" He motioned to my abdomen. \"I am, or rather, will be the father of your unborn child.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He chuckled, noticing where I was staring. \"When a man lives in a house full of girls, he is going to get the girl treatment to some extent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giggle escaped my lips, the ice had been broken. \"Can you tell me why your Cassie and I am going through this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Cassie fell in love with Kevin Stewart.\" Calmly, alt pop explained. \"In the heat of passion, they made love about three and a half months ago...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gasped at that. \"Kevin Stewart asked me out about then...\" I sighed. \"Only I was too shy at the time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the key.\" Serious, Alt-Pop said. \"Both of you had Kevin Stewart on the mind, thinking of possibly growing up together and raising a family.\" He sighed. \"Tell me, on that day, did you place your hand onto the mirror?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I did...\" Almost whispering, I said. \"The- The mirror cracked...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The same happened on this end.\" Frowning, Alt-Pop said. \"You and my daughter are linked between worlds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any ideas of how we fix this?\" Serious, Pop asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to replace the mirror on both sides.\" Calmly, Alt-Pop replied. \"However, it brings the same risk you and I took when wiring the device to the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The entire house is the device?\" Startled, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop nodded. \"The device wasn't built in the age of high tech, Cassie.\" Serious, he explained. \"My counterpart and I built our house around it in our worlds, on what was the edge of town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are the risks?\" Worried, Pat asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Until the gate stabilizes, anything could happen.\" Serious, Alt-Pop said. \"From one of our daughters ending up in the other world, to them or Pat swapping places, or our worlds becoming more alike.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean more alike?' Wincing, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlt-Popop gave a rueful smile. \"Well, Pat in my world is a girl...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPat winced. \"Ew...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have no choice.\" Sighing, Pop said. \"I will fetch a new mirror from the attic, and we will replace them straightaway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlt-Pop nodded. \"I will meet you at the mirror.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, I stood behind Pop in my bedroom en suite, as he carefully removed the mirror and put up a new one in the exact same place. Looking in the mirror as it was being installed, I saw Alt-Pop carefully matching all of Pop's moves. Within moments, the mirror was up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Pop turned around, though, I screamed, as I found...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The last two days before the weekend were rough. While Pat was kind enough not to tell anyone about my issue, Jimmy was not as restrained. I got questions and comments from several people, including teachers, who voiced their concerns. Fortunately, the teachers had heard of the two other cases, but they were worried if anyone, the female teachers included, could be next to find themselves pregnant. It was certainly a startling thought, but I took some comfort in knowing that the third girl was a student somewhere in my school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There has to be a connection.\" Walking home that Friday, I muttered. \"Something the three of us have in common that separates us from the others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes sense.\" softly, Pat said, walking with me. \"Only what could it be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon returning home, I found Lauren Tucker waiting for me in the sitting room, where Mom had set up a tray of hot tea and some snacks. \"Hurry and change clothes.\" Serious, Mom said. \"We have a lot to talk about, dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded and made quick work to change into a pair of sweats and a clean blouse before coming down, where Mom began the conversation. \"There has to be something that links all three cases together.\" Calmly, she said. \"As we have not found the third girl yet, we need to discuss everything we had done, and where we had gone, in the past few months.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was in a hotel for one night while going on vacation with my family.\" After a thought, Lauren said.  \"It was about four months ago, and we only stayed one night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes widened at that, as my family had stopped for the night at a hotel during a vacation about four months back. \"What was the name of the hotel?\" Almost whispering, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was Star something....\" Wincing, Lauren said. \"I really don't remember.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stardust hotel.\" Surprising us, Mom said. \"I remember it only because I had to deal with that blasted neon light flashing into our bedroom window all night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I better make a call to confirm it.\" Shaken, Lauren said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe called her mother on the phone while I waited anxiously. I did not have to wait long, as her face turned pale before she ended the call. \"It was the Stardust hotel, just on the state border off of Highway 55.\" Softly, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"That's the place.\" Calmly, she said. \"Now, is there anything any of you can remember about that night, that we may use to further connect the dots?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I did not have long to wait, as Lauren turned to me, her face pale. \"Jimmy remembers seeing the same bright ball of light that night.\" Whispering, she said. \"He told me it vanished through the wall... to where I was sleeping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Dr. Hughes had said, Once is happenstance, twice is coincidence, but the third time makes a pattern. We had all seen the same bright ball of light, it was a pattern. Only was it really aliens that caused this? If so, why teenagers?

Yes, I'll hold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to us. \"The manager of the hotel said there is a 'crazy' teenage girl there, who thinks she was impregnated at the hotel while she slept.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren and I exchanged startled looks before Mom spoke again into the phone. \"Hello, miss... Sarah... Yes, this is Beth Pennant calling. You are not crazy. My daughter and her friend are also having a virgin pregnancy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom pressed a button placing the call on speaker phone, and we heard a young girl crying on the other end. \"Dr. Hughes said there was another case like mine when I went to her.\" Relief in her voice, she said. \"I took the bus to the Stardust hotel, because its the only place I remember sleeping alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You took the bus there alone?\" Concerned, Mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah cried harder. \"I-I've been kicked out of my house because of this nightmare!\" distraught, she explained. \"Please... help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hotel is about a forty five minute drive from here.\" Serious, Mom said. \"Can you find a safe place to sit tight until I get there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I think so.\" Crying, Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"Good, I'm on my way to pick you up now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please hurry.\" Still crying, Sarah said. \"I'm really scared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon ending the call, Mom turned to Lauren. \"Call your parents and ask them if you can stay the night here.\" Serious, she said. \"I'm going to pick up that girl and bring her here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren nodded and turned to her phone once more, while I spotted Pop entering the room. \"Well, did you learn anything?\" Curious, he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are piecing it together, honey.\" Quickly, Mom said. \"We located the third girl who was effected by this, and I am off to pick her up.\" she paused. \"Her parents kicked her out of the house, she's homeless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop frowned. \"Not exactly proper parenting, is it, now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's not.\" Softly, Mom said. \"I'll be back as quick as I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Mom was off as Lauren got off the phone. \"My mom said I can stay over, and to keep her informed of what we manage to piece together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop nodded. \"In the meantime, I suggest you two keep talking.\" Serious, he said. \"Where you find one clue, others will follow.\"<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

It kinda stuck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom made a fresh pot of tea and gave Sarah a cup. \"We've put together one or two things in this mystery,\" she said. \"Why don't you tell us what all you know, Sarah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah took a sip. \"Our tour group was coming back from Ark Encounter, and decided to spend the night at the Stardust. It was the first time I had ever had a hotel room to myself. I don't remember anything unusual about that night, but it's the only thing that was different. I thought maybe they knew something, but they just thought I was crazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a cookie. \"When I told my parents I was pregnant, they insisted I tell them who the boy was. The more I told them I hadn't done anything like that, the more they threatened me for adding blasphemy to my sins. Finally, they packed my suitcases and told me to get out and stay out until I was prepared to admit the truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we heard this, Mom put her arm around me. I knew she was thinking of how she had doubted me at first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something did happen at the Stardust that night,\" Mom said. \"We've got reports of a strange ball of light that was there that night.\" Turning to me and Lauren, she said, \"You've been talking it over while I was out, girls. What else have you figured out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We didn't have any 'Eureka' moment,\" I replied, \"but we did find more commonalities than the Stardust. We're both shy, we don't have a lot of friends, and we aren't sexually active.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That goes for me, too,\" Sarah said. \"What is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We aren't completely sure,\" Mom answered. \"But I think we can agree that you girls were targeted.

Tell you what, I'll tell you what I know, and, when I'm done, you can tell me what you know. Deal?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, we'll start with my family. Four people walk in, desperate for a place to stay while their car needs repair. And what do you do? You offer them a deal they wouldn't turn down if their car was in working order: You put their kids each in rooms of their own, at no extra charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we're not done. That same night, another family comes in. They, too, need a place to stay until the car gets fixed. And you cut them the exact same deal, don't you?

A tour bus - a whole tour bus, for Pete's sake - comes in, and they all need a place to stay until the bus can be fixed.

You <i>had</i> to go belly-up. Unless... Unless somebody else covered all those rooms.

After I had washed myself off, it was Lauren's turn to run for the toilet, followed by Sarah, who threw up in the toilet while Lauren was cleaning herself up. It was fortunate that my bed room had an en suite; otherwise, we would have been competing for the bathroom with Pat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least we're not going through this alone.\" Softly, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren and Sarah nodded in agreement before a soft knock came to the door and Mom peered in. \"Good morning, girls.\" Calmly, she said. \"Please get dressed, breakfast is ready.\" she paused then added, \"Also, try to be a little patient with Pat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, what happened?\" Curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled. \"Pop and I believe he's going through the early stages of  Couvade syndrome.\" Bemused, she replied. \"It started late last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Couvade syndrome?\" Worried, Sarah asked. \"Is that bad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren giggled. \"It's also called a sympathetic pregnancy.\" Smiling, she explained. \"A condition in which a partner or close relative - in this case, Pat - experiences some of the same symptoms and behavior as an expectant mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"The poor boy was throwing up half the morning, and his belly is a bit swollen.\" Calmly, she said. \"I always knew you and he were very close, but I didn't expect this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren shook her head. \"I wish my brother Jimmy could experience it.\" Softly, she muttered. \"He could use to be knocked down a peg or two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting dressed, we all came down to the dinning room to find Pat nibbling on dry cold cereal and ginger snaps with a look of misery on his face. I was tempted to say something, only Mom whispered to us, \"Pat never once teased any of you for your condition, so don't get any ideas of teasing him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all nodded and took a seat at the table, where I placed a gentle hand onto Pat's shoulder. \"Mom told us you're not feeling well.\" Softly, I said. \"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure...\" Tearfully, Pat replied. \"I just feel weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get you something from the pharmacy to help you feel better.\" Calmly, Mom said. \"In the meantime, you are going back to bed after breakfast. Be thankful its Saturday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time we began to eat, Pat said he was done, and Mom walked him back to his bedroom. \"Poor kid.\" Wincing, Lauren said. \"At least he's not really pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd be worried if he were.\" Serious, I countered. \"This is all weird enough as it is.\" I sighed. \"Maybe I should give Trish and Susan a call.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\" Curious, Lauren asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trish Regan and Susan Porter, my two best friends from school.\" Softly, I said. \"The only two friends I have, besides you two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren's eyes widened in surprise. \"They're friends with Emily Masters and  Amy Smith, my two best friends from school.\" Softly, she said. \"What a coincidence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two is a coincidence but three is a pattern.\" Shaken, Sarah said. \"Emily and Amy are friends with Bree West and Fae Frost, my two closest friends...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned pale, realizing that we had discovered another connection. \"Do you think they were watched and considered too?\" Worried, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah shuddered. \"I probably should have said this before but...\" She winced. \"Trish, Susan, Emily, Amy, Bree and Fae were on that tour bus with me that night at the Stardust hotel.\" She walked over to her purse and produced a photo. \"This is all of us, posing for a picture in front of the hotel, the only clue I had to go on when...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We get the idea.\" Softly, Lauren said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at the photo over Sarah's shoulder and gasped. \"Wait a minute!\" Suddenly, I yelped. \"What's that in the background?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren looked over Sarah's other shoulder and we all stared at the photograph our faces slowly turning pale.

Your father promised me that he threw the 'devil's toy' into the fireplace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled at that, then turned to Lauren as she sighed, ending her call. \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once is a happenstance, two is a coincidence, but three is a pattern.\" Shaken, Lauren said. \"My mom just told me that Jimmy is starting to show symptoms of a sympathetic pregnancy.\" She gulped. \"She found a chip on the base of his skull and destroyed it with a hammer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That settles it.\" Shaking his head, Pop said. \"We are bringing all the families together so we can take this all to the authorities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will not be necessary, Mr. 'Pop' Pennant.\" A deep voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled, we all turned to find three bright glowing blue lights in the living room with us, before they changed form to become the three substitute teachers...<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

She was crying like a baby, desperately trying to draw something on a piece of paper. Drawing was Pat's way to deal with stress. She would draw how she felt and show it to Mom and Pop. Only Pat's hands were shaking too much to draw anything, which was frustrating her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you see?\" Looking into her eyes, I demanded. \"Tell me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I see clear rivers, blue oceans, beautiful mountains... as if I am flying over them in my head.\" Crying, Pat replied. \"It's so beautiful...\" She then cried harder. \"Then I see black rivers, dead oceans... destroyed mountains...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPat could not speak any longer. She buried her face into her hands, bawling. I grabbed her wrists and pulled them from her face to look her into the eye. It was the only way to get her attention when she was distraught. \"Pat, focus!\" Firmly, I snapped. \"You are seeing the alien world before and after it died! Focus on the good only!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I'll try...\" Still weeping, Pat said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The aliens have given each of you a piece of their home world so you can tell their legacy to their... your children.\" Firmly, Pop said. \"Only it is an overwhelming amount of information, their minds can't deal with it all at once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... it's hurting them?\" Worried, Mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop sighed. \"It's causing them a great deal of stress, which is not healthy.\" Serious, he said. \"We need to get them all to focus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one, my friends and I, with Mom and Pop's help, calmed Lauren, Sarah, and Pat down to the point they were able to compose themselves. \"I'll make another pot of tea.\" Shaken, Mom said. \"It will help to calm all of our nerves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems that Cassie has gained knowledge of the alien's art.\" Softly, Pop said. \"Pat seemed to have gained knowledge of their planet itself before and after it had died.\" He turned to Lauren and Sarah who jumped slightly but knew what he was about to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I keep seeing blueprints of medical devices, force fields, teleportation pads...\" Quietly, she said. \"It's like an all too real science fiction movie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah winced. \"I'm seeing...\" She gulped, her face pale. \"I'm seeing people praying to the sun during the day and then to the stars at night.\" Timidly, she said. \"It's nothing like Christianity, but yet somehow similar.\" She sighed, frustrated. \"It's hard to explain... these aliens, they give thanks to the farmer who raised the pig, and thanks to the pig who sacrificed its life so they would have a meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sounds like an 'Earth' based religion.\" Pop said. \"Perhaps it is similar to Wicca.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure...\" Wincing, Sarah said. \"I never studied any religion other than Christianity, my father would not have it.\" She sighed. \"I'm more interested in maps and charts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have all been given a heavy burden.\" Weary, I said. \"Art is not really my cup of tea. I'm more of a tinkerer, I like to build things with Pop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not what one would call a grease monkey.\" Wincing, Lauren said. \"I'm more of an artist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPat sighed, blushing slightly. \"I like Pop's religious books.\" Softly, he said. \"It's amazing how so many different deities have come and gone through the years.\" He smiled. \"Did you know the religion of the Pharaohs lasted over three thousand years? It's about how old Christianity is today, which raises so many questions...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop, who had been listening, suddenly snapped his fingers. \"Of course!\" Frowning, he declared. \"It should have been obvious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, Pop?\" Wincing, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The aliens gave you four knowledge that is way outside of your comfort zones.\" Serious, Pop explained. \"however, it is well within the comfort zones of your friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To keep us together.\" Turning pale, Lauren said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop nodded. \"Also to give reason for you all to gain all that they had left behind.\" Softly, he said. \"They must have known that giving you each everything would have been too much for your minds to handle at once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So they gave us each a little, in a way we would have to stay together, in order to see the entire picture, once the puzzle was complete.\" Shaken, Sarah said. \"How will I explain this to father?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of thought, Pop looked at his home security system he had put in place last year, before turning to his phone. \"You leave that to me.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That afternoon, we went to the office of a Dr. Foster, an obstetrician who Dr. Hughes highly recommended over the phone. Upon arriving, Mom filled out the necessary paperwork, then led Pat and me back, where we were surprised to meet the same Dr. Foster who Pop had called a quack. She was tall and slender, with shoulder length blond hair and blue eyes. \"Before you say or ask me anything, you need to understand that I must be the doctor to see you through this.\" Firmly, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom was about to stand up to lead us out, but stopped as Dr Foster glowed, changing form into a bright blue ball of light! \"You- You are one of them?!\" Startled, I demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr Foster returned to her human form, a sad look on her face. \"There are only a mere few dozen of us left, out of billions.\" Softly, she said. \"I, too, am slowly dying, so... I beg you to allow me to ensure our offspring have a very good start on this world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom turned to Pat and me, looking for us to decide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe and I turned to each other before nodding, we had the same thought in mind. \"We will allow it.\" Softly, Pat said. \"Just one condition, just be honest with us, trust is essential between a doctor and her patients.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will our children be human or like you?\" Wincing, Pat asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, call me Kyrl (Carol).\" Softly, Dr Foster said. \"Your children will be human in all ways that count, but carry above average attributes and intelligence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will they suddenly change into blue lights?\" Worried, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyrl shook her head. \"No, those of us who accepted this desperate mission that involved you underwent dangerously experimental procedures to gain that ability.\" She shuddered at the memory of it. \"It allowed us to complete our mission without detection but... it aged us in ways I hope you never understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The realization came to late, no child will be born we sealed our own fate.\" Whispering, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyrl nodded. \"To a primitive world dubbed a place to hide, it is our last hope to survive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPat sniffed. \"Young women with great hearts we must find, grant them the gift of what we leave behind.\" Tearfully, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of us hugged each other, sobbing quietly for a moment. \"You are very brave young ladies, thank you.\" With a small smile, she said. \"Shall we begin the examination?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded, and Kyrl began to look Pat and me over. About twenty minutes later, she smiled, a look of relief on her face. \"Your babies are perfectly healthy.\" Tearfully, she said. \"My job is ensure they stay healthy, so our world... and yours will carry on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... do you know why I'm not really freaking out about being a girl and pregnant?\" Wincing, Pat asked. \"I know I should be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyrl smiled. \"I can only guess that Mr. Dorie and his team instilled a certain calm within your mind, to allow you to adapt quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled at that. \"You were blushing all day at school, Pat.\" Bemused, I said. \"I don't know if it was the boys looking at you differently than before, or if it was the girls trying to give you tips on how to be a better girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPat blushed at that, making her look cute, but I did not mention that. \"Everything from fashion to hygiene to posture.\" Frowning, she grumbled. \"Don't even get me started on the boys...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom, Kyrl, and I giggled at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do we go next?\" After leaving the office, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled, turning to us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Sure, I'd never dressed to turn heads, but it was still wounding to find out for a fact that your clothes are definitely out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Pat began trying out new outfits. As we went, two things became clear: Pat had been given very good advice, and she was enjoying picking out new clothes. In fact, I'd say we'd have been there until closing if Mom would have let us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur shopping cart was full to overflowing when Mom called a halt. \"Don't forget, you'll be needing new clothes in a few weeks.

Lauren smiled upon seeing it. \"I saw blueprints for this in my dreams last night. You and Pop did an amazing job putting it together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed at that, then became curious as Lauren left the room, and returned soon after with a small cup of water. She wet her hands, then began to move her fingers over the fine threads, creating beautiful but haunting sounds, like a harp with an electric echo from a rock guitar. \"What is it called?\" Curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is called a Spindle Harp.\" Pausing, Lauren said. \"Why don't you try singing one of the songs in your head, and I'll try to play it on this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not that good of a singer.\" Wincing, i said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not that good at building things.\" Shrugging, Lauren countered. \"We both have to start somewhere, now, don't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI giggled. \"I guess so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a moment to allow Gaian music to flow through my mind, i picked a song and began to sing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver beautiful mountain sides<br>\r\nOur mighty clear rivers flow<br>\r\nInto oceans of majesties<br>\r\nGiving our world its glow<br>\r\n <br>\r\nGaia! Gaia!<br>\r\nGods all smile upon thee<br>\r\nAnd grace us all with conflicts resolved<br>\r\nOn all lands airs and sea...!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI paused, shedding tears. \"It's so beautiful!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren nodded, shedding tears of her own. \"The song seems to speak praise of their world, rather than individual nations.\" Smiling, she said. \"Do you want to continue with the song?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded, and Lauren began to play the song again, singing along with me a sad, beautiful tribute to a dead world. A world of which we were now the only hope of bringing back from the brink of extinction.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Lately, it seemed like, no matter how much sleep I got, it was never enough. When I came home from school, I had to go straight to bed until supper. Pat was dealing with the same thing. Mom said that it was just part of being pregnant. A quick nap wouldn't hurt now, either... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt a hand on my knee. \"Girls,\" Mom said. \"Wake up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rubbed my eyes. The car wasn't moving. \"Just a short nap,\" I said. \"How soon before we go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled. \"We're here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">************************************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI guess I had been a little nervous about how they would all react, what with Pat's sex change and both of our pregnancies. But, whatever they might have said out of my earshot, our aunts treated us like any other first-time mothers-to-be. Everybody had tips for handling morning sickness, treating constipation (ouch!), avoiding hemorrhoids (double ouch!), and a host of other ailments. Aunt Mary Jo even gave us each a bottle of flavored Tums, for when morning sickness segued into heartburn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout the only really peculiar thing was how our cousin Bridget was walking around like they were talking about throwing the turkey away and stuffing and roasting her instead. But, so far at least, she was avoiding me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second most anticipated moment of our Thanksgiving gathering was when Grandma gave the order that anyone who was not involved in the actual preparation of the meal had to get out of the kitchen. This signaled the beginning of the Turkey Bowl, a friendly game of touch football. Pat had played in previous years, but had to spend this year's game on the sidelines. There were a few women who played, but pregnancy disqualified her. No matter. Pop was still playing, and his two favorite cheerleaders could still root for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You the one who got knocked up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned. One of Grandma's neighbors was talking to me. \"I suppose so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take my advice, kid: go to the doctor, and get it flushed out by Christmas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, thanks,\" I said, and found a different place to stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApart from that, we were all having a good time. As usual, it was almost a disappointment when Mom came out and announced, \"Dinner's ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I headed inside, I noticed Bridget was close by. Seizing the opportunity, I pulled her aside. \"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to dodge me again. \"I don't know what you're talking about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't, huh? I guess that's someone else walking around with your face, making a deer caught in the headlights look like a model of composure? The last time I saw anybody looking like that, she had just found out she was... \" It all fell into place. \"You're pregnant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded. \"Not like you. I mean, I know the guy and everything. But Dad's gonna <i>kill</i> me when he finds out!\"</span></div></div>",

Uncle Hank, Bridget's father, answered, to find Brad at the door. He was of average height and average build, with short brown hair and gentle green eyes. \"I am sorry to interrupt your Thanksgiving, sir.\" Nervous, he said. \"However, I need to talk to you about something very serious.\" He gulped. \"I have to admit, I'm really scared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone turned to Uncle Hank and the visitor at the door, surprised and concerned. Uncle Hank sighed. \"We will talk outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad nodded, tears forming, and Uncle Hank walked out and closed the door. Seeing them, Bridget immediately began to quietly sob uncontrollably. I did what I could to comfort her without making a scene, and turned as Hank stepped back in, with a tearful Brad following close behind. They both marched right up to Bridget and me. Neither of their expressions gave any clue as to what they were thinking or feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridget raised her hands up, trembling, as if she were expecting the pounding or lecture of her life, only Uncle Hank sighed. \"Young lady...\"<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

The 'popular girls,' as many of the students have dubbed them, surrounded Pat at her locker. \"So you are the little boy turned girl everyone's been talking about.\" Grinning meanly, the first girl said. \"I must say, you look good in a skirt and blouse, for being born a boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI recognized her as Darla Darling. She was fourteen years old, tall and skinny to a fault, with mid back sun blond hair and blue eyes. She and her posse, as she called her friends, were known for playing cruel pranks on new students, or those who had crossed her path one way or another.  Many of them had led to injury, or students transferring out in fear. Fortunately, Jimmy had a locker right next to mine, and saw the girls surround Pat as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Those girls are nothing but trouble.</i> Frowning, I thought. <i>Pat's 'rare condition' must have put her in their cross-hairs.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew that Darla had already been warned twice by Principal Lila Switch. She was on thin ice, and one more reported stunt would get her expelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... they had to order a uniform in my size.\" Softly, Pat replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to explain anything to them.\" Firmly but kindly, I said. \"Why don't you get your books and hurry to class.\" I then turned to Darla, my voice turning cold. \"What do you want with my sister, Darling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To meet your brother, or rather sister.\" Maintaining her smile, Darla said. \"We've never had a true freak of nature in this school before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't even think about it, Darling.\" Frowning, I warned. \"You don't think I haven't heard the rumors around school myself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarla scoffed. \"As if he has any chance to be selected to become prom queen...\" Frowning, she began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled, more bemused at the thought of my little sister being crowned prom queen over Darla Darling than anything else. Still, it caused Darla to take a step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her reaction, Jimmy smiled as well. \"That would be interesting to see.\" Bemused, he said. \"A cute boy, turned pretty girl running for prom queen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Pat had finished gathering what she needed for her first class, and closed her locker before turning to us. Jimmy blushed, seeing her dressed in a simple baby blue skirt and blouse with a narrow belt and flats. With her keen fashion sense, she looked as if she were wearing a casual dress that showed off her youthful hourglass figure very well. She had turned the moment Darla blurted out, \"You can't be serious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" Curious, Pat asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed more, seeing Jimmy's jaw drop in surprise. \"Pat! You look breathtaking!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a little jealous.\" Smiling at Darla, I said. \"To think you could look that good without any effort put into it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to Jimmy, sharing a knowing smile before turning to Pat who winced, nervous. \"Um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The freak has no chance!\" Suddenly angry, Darla fumed. \"I am the queen of the prom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she stormed off, leaving Pat confused. \"What just happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI giggled as I then closed my own locker. \"Sorry, sis, but I think we've just inadvertently thrown you into the running for this year's prom queen.\" Bemused, I said. \"You coming out looking that good didn't help anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was the most modest skirt and blouse I had.\" Wincing, Pat said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll worry about it later.\" Smiling, Jimmy said. \"Let's get to class before we're late.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

On this day, I learned that others had noticed this as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were talking about this and that (okay, we mostly talked about what we had read in various pregnancy books), when a voice asked, \"Do you know what you three have in common with the senior class?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get out of here, Brooklynne,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarla Darling ruled the freshman class with violence and intimidation, but Brooklynne Dietrich and her Queen Bees held dominion over the upper classes with gossip. Any threat to Brooklynne's status found every dirty little secret they had suddenly become public knowledge. Needless to say, the last thing any of us wanted was for her to take notice of us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I asked, do you know what you three have in common with the senior class?\" she repeated. \"Give up? Like them, you three won't be back next year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Literally nobody asked you,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Fae wound up making a liar out of me. \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, your friends are going to drop out, in order to take care of their babies. It happens all the time.\" Turning back to us, she said, \"Let's be real, what did you think you were going to do, attend classes with a wailing brat on one hip, and a bag full of dirty diapers on the other? No career. No future. That's what's in store for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to hit her. Actually, I wanted to do more than hit her, but hitting her would get me suspended, while what I <i>really</i> wanted to do would get me expelled, and probably some jail time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should be more careful when you're talking to yourself, Brooklynne,\" said a boy's voice. \"Somebody might overhear that, and come away mistakenly thinking you were talking to these three.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to look at him, and I saw an opportunity to take her down a peg without a single blow. \"Move your ass, Brooklynne, I can't see what I'm looking at.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat little display put the spotlight squarely on her. With a grumble, she stormed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turned out my Galahad had a name, and it was Kevin Stewart. He was tall, with a lean yet muscular physique, ideal for a wrestler. He had short black hair and piercing blue eyes. Right behind him were the Rafferty twins, Mike and Bill. Their bodies were much like Kevin's, but with red hair and green eyes. They were all but impervious to bullies, and they used this for the benefit of anyone who got picked on. \"You girls okay?\" Kevin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are now, thanks,\" said Trish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We figured you girls had been through enough,\" said Bill. \"No need for her to pick on you, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they went on their way, it occurred to me that I hadn't said a word. I was left pondering why, when it hit me:  It had taken me more years than was usual, but I had just developed my first crush.</span></div></div>",

She then turned to Pat who was still holding her frightened and confused expression. \"Something tells me that there's a little more to your story, honey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPat nodded, trying to compose herself. \"Jimmy was there with me all day, defending me.\" Softly, she said. \"It really made me feel weird...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was now Mom's turn to hold a knowing smile, which she shared with Pop. \"It seems our little girls are growing up.\" Smiling, Pop said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"Our shy little flowers are finally blossoming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Pat and I blushed, to which Mom and Pop chuckled...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on, Pat and I talked about our day. \"I saw you and Sarah talking after school today.\" Softly, I said. \"Care to share?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPat smiled slightly. \"Sarah wants to meet with me to share our gifts.\" With an air of anticipation, she said. \"She told her father that I want to talk about religion.\" She giggled. \"She told me that his eyes lit up like a Christmas tree.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From our meet and greet, he knows you are fascinated by all religions.\" Bemused, I said. \"I'm betting he's hoping Sarah will show you the true path.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're all true paths to those who believe in them.\" Smiling, Pat said. \"The point is, they believe in something that gives their lives purpose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI put my hand over my womb. \"I believe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPat did the same. \"So do I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI began to sing the beautiful \"Song of Gaia,\" and Pat closed her eyes, singing along...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

To Pat, he said, \"If I recall correctly, you've been studying comparative religion in your spare time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mr. White.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps you can explain what my daughter did on Thanksgiving. We had family over, and I asked her to say grace. She proceeded to thank everyone <i>except</i> God.\" He shook his head. \"She even thanked the turkey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The first thing that came to mind,\" Sarah explained, \"was a Gaian prayer of thanksgiving. I just substituted <i>turkey</i> for <i>grizzleback</i>, whatever that was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was something like a boar,\" Pat explained. Turning to Mr. White, she said, \"It sounds like what we would call an Earth-based religion. To them, the gods don't sit on white thrones judging their creation, but they move among us and through us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Mr. White said, \"to my way of thinking, any religion that doesn't have a Messiah is lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They called them the Prophets,\" Sarah replied. \"The Gaians told of how they traveled the whole world, teaching them right from wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prophets are all well and good,\" Mr. White said, \"but I'm talking about the Hand of God, and the Virgin Birth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Prophets <i>were</i> born of virgins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>What?!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard me. And you can't even say it's that farfetched, what with evidence to the contrary literally staring you in the face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since the day I went to the doctor, I hadn't given much thought to the implications of being a virgin mother.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The street was filled with news vans, and our front lawn was covered with reporters. \"What's going on?\" Pat asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, sis,\" I replied as I parked, \"but it looks like that Darren Lohan was just the tip of the iceberg.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as I stepped out of the car, I had three cameras in my face. Reporters were shouting questions over each other, and I still couldn't tell who was asking what. I pulled Pat closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and Pop came out to us, throwing coats over our heads. \"Walk calmly,\" they said, \"we'll guide you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe didn't take the coats off of our heads until somebody shut the door. \"What on Earth happened?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As near as I've been able to piece it together,\" Pop said, \"it went like this: Grandma didn't tell Mrs. Nichols everything, of course, but she did mention that Cassie was pregnant and couldn't explain how she got that way, and that Pat had changed sex and was also pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Mrs. Nichols blabbed it all over the place?\" Pat asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not intentionally,\" Pop replied. \"She just mentioned the mystery to one of her friends, and this Darren Lohan character overheard her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From there, he went to the hospital. Dr. Hughes couldn't tell him any more than she told us, but, still, she confirmed that she'd had three patients who were pregnant and insisted that they couldn't be. So Lohan had a name and independent corroboration, enough to make it a story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we get the whole gang together, figure out what to do?\" Pat asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be exactly the wrong course of action,\" Pop said. \"Right now, the media only know about us. They know there are two more, but they don't have any names or faces to identify them. If you go to them, or they come here, their anonymity goes out the window. You can call them or text them if you want, but tell them to stay where they are and don't come here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI may not have been completely used to having eight or nine friends, but it still hurt me to have to tell them to stay away. \"We'll keep you out of this for as long as we can\" was all the hope I had to offer, and it didn't sound like remotely enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while, it looked like we might just be able to ride this out. Sooner or later, we figured, they would get bored with the story of what still looked like just two pregnant teenage girls. Then, the evening news found a new angle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Teresa Bridgewater, a floor representative at Great Expectations, a maternity store, told us that she had the two girls at the center of this story inside her shop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there she was, talking to a reporter as if she was just talking about the weather. \"Yes. they came in to browse, but said they might come back to actually buy. Then, they started talking to a customer, they called her Doctor, and the three of them sang this beautiful song, 'Gaia, Gaia,' it went.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop shut off the TV. \"Is that bad, Pop?\" Pat asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing's hit the fan just yet,\" Pop said, \"but there's definitely a new pitcher warming up. Dr. Foster is part of this story now. All she has to do is do her light-ball trick in front of a window, and... well, you've seen <i>E.T.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever have I wished harder to have someone's cell phone number.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>About an hour later, Pop frowned, seeing an update to the story, with the manager of the Stardust hotel showing reporters their footage of the substitute teachers taking over the hotel and catering to the families of six teenagers, Jimmy, Stan, and Pat included. Darren Lohan, who had talked to the saleslady at the maternity store, was covering the latest update. \"...Three substitute teachers who had worked at River Oak Middle and High school had set a trap for these four girls.\" Anger in his voice, he said. \"We cannot release the identities of these children, as they are minors, but the big question remains, why them? Why in a remote hotel not yet ready to open?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop turned off the television, biting his lower lip in thought. Finally, he turned to his cellphone and dialed a number. \"Dr Foster, I assume you have seen the news.\" His voice stressed, he said. \"We do not have a second to lose, we need you over at the house right away. I'll explain when you get here, we have some damage control to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then dialed another number. \"Frank Dean, I need your legal expertise...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy early the following morning, Pop opened the door to the mob of reporters, who all began to shout over each other, but fell silent as Pop raised a single hand. \"I will allow only one of you to enter.\" Firmly, he said. \"As for the rest of you, I have called for a restraining order, as your constant presence is causing my stepdaughter and my daughter unhealthy stress.\" He motioned to oncoming police cars. \"Pack it in and get off my property.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop pulled in Darren Lohan and urged him to sit, while the cameraman with him recorded the brief interview. \"As you likely already know from your investigative reporting, my children were raped while they slept at a hotel we, another family, and a bus tour assumed was open for business about four months ago.\" Serious, Pop said. \"Also, my son had a rare genetic condition that left him with no Y Chromosomes. This caused him to become female, and she was raped as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What of the song your stepchildren were singing at Great Expectations maternity store?\" Curious, Darren pressed. \"I have a feeling there is more to this story...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop shrugged. \"Not really.\" Calmly, he said. \"My two girls are working on a musical they are hoping the school will accept and use this year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A musical?\" Raising an eyebrow, Darren asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop nodded, then motioned to the Spindle Harp. \"Cassie, Pat... would you mind singing the song he's so interested in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough I did not know what Pop was planning, I played the Spindle Harp and began to sing the Song of Gaia with Pat and Kyrl soon joining. When we were done, Kyrl smiled at Darren. \"I am their obstetrician.\" Calmly, she said. \"I am also volunteering at the school to help them with entering their musical for consideration.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you see, big shot.\" Sarcastically, Pop said. \"There's no award winning story here. Just four girls who were victimized by rapists who ended their lives when they got caught.\" he scoffed. \"Go chase a real story, if you can find one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Pop escorted the reporter and the cameraman out. Once they were gone, I asked. \"Is that the last we will see of them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop sighed. \"I doubt it.\" Softly, he said. \"However, we bought ourselves some time to strengthen our story and keep them off all of our backs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But one mistake is all it takes, and we're only human. Even Kyrl. We'll need a plan in place for when people find out how you really got pregnant, and the nature of the children you carry.

Pop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop nodded, then began to gather all of the evidence we had accumulated in our own little investigation, and placed it into the family safe, behind a portrait of the family. \"First things first, we save everything.\" Serious, he said. \"Destroying any or all evidence only weakens our hand if we are forced to come to the table.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weakens our hands?\" Confused, Kyrl asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We would have less chance of defending ourselves if we must face our justice system.\" Serious, I explained. Turning to Pop, I asked, \"How do we defend ourselves against the speculation and theories of others in school and around town? Also, the reporters don't give up that easily, how do we deal with them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop scoffed. \"Don't shoot down anything they come up with, unless it turns into insults or harmful rhetoric.\" Serious, he said. \"Let them speculate all they like, the truth is oftentimes stranger than fiction anyway.\" He raised a finger in warning. \"Just don't acknowledge anyone who happens to guess the truth, either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And these reporters?\" Wincing, Kyrl asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is their job to report what they see as news that affects their community and beyond.\" Calmly, Pop explained. \"Most of them are respectable, but there is a small percentage who are just after some award or fame for breaking a huge story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As Mr. Dorie said, secrecy is essential.\" Somewhat sadly, Pat said. \"The very thought of aliens living among us would spark an unnecessary panic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly.\" With a firm nod, Pop said. \"It would also attract every crackpot alien hunter and conspiracy theorist from miles around to all of our doors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to mention the federal government.\" Frowning, Mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You fear your own government?\" Wincing, Kyrl asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop sighed. \"There is a reason why this planet was dubbed a place to hide.\" Softly, he said. \"We are an extremely hostile species...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much like we Gaians were, before the great peace accord.\" Sadly, Kyrl said. \"Only by then, it was already too late to save ourselves from extinction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are not extinct yet!\" Startling Kyrl, Pop firmly said. \"You are what we humans call an endangered species, one that must be protected, and we will protect you!\" He sighed. \"We need to stay on the subject at hand. The bottom line is that this entire town, and the lives of the people within it, would be turned upside down if this gets out all at once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... you said all at once.\" Surprised, Mom said. \"What are you planning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop frowned. \"I am planning to get the whole story out...\" He then smiled. \"In the form of the Sisterhood's first little musical.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom stared at Pop in confusion and disbelief, until Trish began to giggle. \"I get it!\" Bemused, she said. \"The reporters sneaking around will only see us preparing for a musical to sell to the school, and eventually lose interest in any bigger story between the lines.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the basic idea.\" Patiently, Pop said. \"It also would explain how you are all suddenly best of friends, and how Sarah's father is a bit reluctant to allow Sarah to participate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What of Dr. Foster's, um,... glowing personality?\" Wincing, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop turned to Kyrl. \"I would seriously consider replacing all of the lights in your home to blue bulbs, I can get them for you, if needed.\" Calmly, he said. \"If anyone asks, simply tell them that the blue lights calm you after a rough day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That way, if she does change at home, no one will blink an eye at it.\" Catching on, Mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Pop nodded. \"The only issue now is to actually put together a musical.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyrl smiled at that. \"The youngest Gaians, the last generation of our world, put together a play to honor us and our mission.\" Tears falling, she said. \"I helped put it together, as I was a member of that generation, and it did include the Song of Gaia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let us put our plan into motion.\" Serious, Pop said. \"For Earth and Gaia, we must, and we will, succeed.\" He held his hand out. \"To preservation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyrl shed tears, knowing the significance of that statement better than any of us, and placed her hand onto Pop's. \"To preservation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one, we all placed our hands in and said, \"To preservation...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was quickly becoming obvious that Darla was monster both at school and, likely, at home as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had heard her reply more than once, \"I'm not sure, I sort of have a lot on my plate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did I have to be roped into this?\" Irritated, she whispered to me later. \"Now I'm the most popular girl in school, and I will be the most hated if I don't at least try to run for prom queen.\" She gave a silent moan then added, \"Everyone is bound to do everything they can to get Darla and I together to confirm the rumors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout the early part of the day, I caught pieces of whispered conversations between girls in my classes as they spoke of getting Pat and Darla together during lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" whispered one girl in homeroom. \"Pat, that shy boy turned girl, is running against that bitch Darla Darling?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The rumor has been spreading like wildfire, ever since someone heard Darla grumbling about how she might actually have a chance.\" replied another girl. \"We have to get these two together, so we can confirm this rumor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darla actually has some competition this year?!\" Surprised, a girl in her second class asked. \"Who is it?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That shy boy turned girl, Pat Pennant.\" replied yet another girl. \"You know that tiny, frail little boy with the rare condition that killed all his Y Chromosomes...\" The girl smiled. \"There's talk of getting them to meet again during lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the halls, I overheard some of the freshmen girls talking as well, and could only imagine that Pat overheard conversations of her own. \"Darla has a competitor for freshman prom queen?!\" Whispering, one girl asked. \"I'm surprised she hasn't been scared off yet. Who is it?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That shy boy with the rare condition, Pat Pennant.\" Whispering another girl replied. \"He's a girl now, and quite the looker.\" She smiled. \"Not bad for being born a boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first girl giggled then whispered, \"It would be a hoot if her sister, Cassie, ran against Brooklynne for junior prom queen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI even heard a number of teachers whispering about Pat and even me running for prom queen against Darla and Brooklynne, making me worry more and more for us both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt lunch, Pat and I took our turn at the lunch line and purchased what we wanted, before turning around to find Darla walking up to her with a cross look on her face. I winced, having a feeling what was going to happen, and stayed close, in case she needed saving. For a moment, the two looked at each other while the students around them, especially the girls, stopped what they were doing to watch. The silence was maddening to everyone, including Pat and Darla, it seemed. Finally, Pat broke the silence, but not in a way she had intended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... May the best girl win.\" Extending her hand, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLow gasps and whispers were heard and she immediately regretted her words, as it only confirmed the rumors that Pat was entering the prom queen competition. Only it had already been said, and it was too late to rephrase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly, to mine and everyone's surprise, Darla slowly accepted, shaking Pat's hand. This brought on even more gasps and whispers from the crowd. One teacher, I noticed, nearly dropped her tray in surprise, seeing this, a girl with the courage to run against the most feared and hated bully of the freshmen class. The irony of it was too great for her to miss. She quietly placed her tray down and picked up her cellphone camera to take a picture, knowing that the other teachers might not believe her. Finally, Darla responded and everyone strained listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like competition, Pat.\" Frowning, she told her. \"Looking at you, it's easy to see you have a fair chance, and that drives me crazy. Worse, you are cute for being born a boy.\" She blushed, bringing more gasps, as she then added. \"Still, the student council made me promise to invite you over to their next meeting, so we can all talk about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me and my sister?\" Hopefully, you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarla shook her head, not moving her eyes from Pat's. \"Just you.\" Firmly, she said. \"With you being pregnant, and rumors of you working on a musical, it is a lot of stress to deal with. The council wants to be certain you are up to the task of running for prom queen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPat blushed at that, uncertainty on her face. She discretely turned to me, but I could only shrug, as it was her decision to make. The other students around me, I could see, were all anxiously waiting for Pat's response. One girl from the freshman class mouthed, 'say yes!'  A number of other students and even some teachers also quietly urged Pat to accept. i could only imagine the amount of peer pressure Pat was feeling. Finally, Pat turned to Darla, still holding her hand and managed a polite smile. \"I'll have to check my schedule.\" Politely, she said. \"If I can squeeze in the time, then yes, I will talk with the student council, but not alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarla also managed a tiny smile as she then released Pat's hand. \"They are not going to bite you, Pat.\" Ice returning to her voice, she said. \"The meeting is right after school, today, in the student council's office. I hope you... and your sister are able to come and meet with us.\" With that, she walked away, not saying a word to anyone else...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I watched her leave, I had a much better idea what Darla was up to. She had plans to convince the council that Pat could not enter the prom queen competition, due to everything else she is dealing with. It was a bit underhanded, but it was unfortunately within school rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The cafeteria is noisy almost by necessity, and that many people don't all shut up at once for no reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy second clue was the scent of expensive perfume that hit my nose. Not many girls could afford more than the knockoff fragrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you think you have enough on your plate, Pennant?\" asked the unmistakable voice of Brooklynne Dietrich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm eating for two,</i> I thought, but didn't say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're knocked up, and you're trying to keep your grades up. That would be enough for most people. And I've heard rumors that you're writing a play?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. No sense wasting a perfectly good lie on that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And a little bird told me you were actually considering the possibility of running for prom queen? Tell me I was misinformed, that you have some grasp of your place on the totem pole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, put my fork down, and turned to face her. \"What's in it for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the student council would like to have a talk with you. Wouldn't want you working yourself into a miscarriage, now, would we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. I'm going there with Pat anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied, she turned and walked away, wearing a smirk that begged for someone to slap it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI let her take three steps before I said, \"Brooklynne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned as I got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you what I'll tell them: Out of all the things I'm doing,... kicking your ass in a popularity contest is, by far, the least challenging.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm sure she said something after that, but too many people were cheering for me to hear her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You enjoyed that,\" Trish said, as I sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn right,\" I replied.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pat and I had a few things in our favor while seeing the student council. First, the president of the council was a longtime acquaintance of mine, Sarah Stone. She was a senior, standing at six foot even at the age of fifteen, with shoulder length black hair and green eyes. She knew about my pregnancy and the cover story, but not the entire truth. It was not that I could not trust her, Pop simply wanted as few to know the whole truth as possible. Second, Principal Lily Switch always oversaw the council meetings, and had a strong sense of right and wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon entering the student council office, I was greeted by Principal Switch. She was short, almost exactly my height, with silver hair tied up into a neat bun on the top of her head, and blue eyes peering through half-moon glasses. Many students and even teachers had called her \"the fearless Ms. Switch,\" as she feared no one and she knew how to hold her own. \"How are you and Pat coping so far?\" Kindly, she asked. \"Being pregnant is one thing, but slowly turning into a girl and then getting pregnant is quite the experience, I would say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's an understatement.\" Blushing, Pat said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me then, why put so much on your plate?\" Softly, Ms. Switch asked. \"Are the rumors on the news about a musical in the making true?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That much is true, but I don't care much for the speculation.\" Sighing, I replied. \"Pop was forced to file a restraining order.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A misunderstanding led everyone to hope then believe that I was running for freshman prom queen against Darla Darling.\" Wincing, Pat said. \"As the rumors spread, my sister got roped up into it as well, through the hopes of the students.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we have the entire student body literally cheering us on.\" Shrugging, I added. \"No pressure there, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah giggled. \"We all heard those rumors being spread like wildfire.\" Bemused, she said. \"You and your sister are in quite a pickle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which is why we are holding this meeting.\" Turning serious, Ms. Switch said. \"However, you both need to decide now if you are running or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, Ms. Switch and Sarah took their seats as the rest of the council entered. There were eight students in all, each representing the freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors. Sarah was the student council president. She and her twin sister, Emily represented the senior class. The Rafferty twins, Mike and Bill represented the junior class. Two girls named Ina Watt and Tia Zoe represented the sophomore class. Finally, a boy and a girl named Dawn Moore and Tex Scott represented the freshmen class. I really did not know most of them, but that did not matter at the time. What mattered was getting this foolishness behind us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This meeting is called to order.\" Serious, Sarah said. \"We are gathered at this meeting to determine if Pat and Cassie Pennant are or are not entering the running for freshmen and junior prom queen this school year.\" She turned to us. \"As you have noticed, neither Darla Darling or Brooklynne Dietrich are attending this meeting. You are both free to speak your minds, without interruption or intimidation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopes are high among the students, as these two... individuals have proven to be rather troublesome and difficult.\" Serious, Tia Zoe said. \"The choice is, of course, yours to make.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No pressure...\" Frowning, Pat muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will make this simple.\" Firmly but kindly, Ms. Switch said. \"Do you or do you not intend to run for freshmen and junior prom queen, with everything else on your plate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPat and I turned to each other and slowly nodded. We both seemed to have the same answer in mind, as we turned back to Ms Switch and replied....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was just glad that Kevin was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt home, we told the folks about everything that had happened. \"Don't worry, girls,\" Mom said, \"we shouldn't have any trouble renting you Empire gowns.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Pat asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're tightest just below the breasts, loose and flowing under that. Just what you'll be looking for when it's time for the prom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Later,\" Pat said, as she trudged up the stairs. \"Too tired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two too tired,\" I said, following her.</span></div></div>",

The first night Pat became a girl, she did not want to sleep alone. Not that I could blame her, she had gone through more than any of us. She had been violated as a boy, and turned into a girl to ensure her and her unborn child's survival. The Gaians had given her a certain calming factor to help her adapt. In a way, I was envious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a day!\" Plopping onto my bed, I muttered. \"At least I don't have any homework to deal with on top of it all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was considering whether to change for bed or just go to sleep until dinner, when the sound of the doorbell reached my ears. Pat came out of her room, hearing the chimes as well, and threw me a curious look as we both asked, \"Now what...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, I came a quarter down the stairs, so I could hear what was happening but not be seen by our unknown visitor. I was surprised when I heard Stewart's voice at the door. \"Good afternoon, err, Pop is it?\" nervous, he said. \"I'm Stewart Tucker, and I believe you know Jimmy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can I help you gentlemen?\" politely, Pop asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were hoping we could talk to you about Cassie and Patrica, sir.\" Sounding even more nervous, Jimmy said. \"We would like to ask if we could, um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you have something to ask, spit it out.\" Firmly but kindly, Pop said. \"I am strict, but I carry the grace of God with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are asking for your blessings to ask your girls out on a date.\" Rather quickly, Stewart blurted out. \"We thought it only right if we discussed it with you first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed at that, and turned to Pat, who was at the top of the stairs, blushing as well. Only a few days ago, both Pat and I were nobody, and now we were practically a household name around school, with two suitors at our door! We paused to listen as Pop chuckled, something we were not expecting at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I admire your courage and honesty, gentlemen.\" Calmly, dad said. \"I have nothing against you asking the girls out on a date, as you have proven yourselves loyal in your friendships with them. However, as you must know, they have already had a trying day, so you will have to ask them tomorrow. Good day, gentleman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, I heard the door close before I saw Mom looking up at Pat and me from the bottom of the stairs. There was an amused smile on her face. \"Well, there you have it, girls.\" Bemused, she said. \"Your crushes have confessed their feelings towards you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop came into view, also with an amused smile. \"Your lives are changing quickly, but that does not mean you have to move quickly to keep up.\" Kindly, he said. \"if you are not ready for your first date with your crushes, let them know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinner will be here in ten minutes.\" Smiling, Mom said. \"We ordered pizza.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and Pop then walked away, leaving Pat and me with a big decision to make. I did not know if I was ready for my first date, and, from the look on Pat's face, I doubted she knew herself...<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

We approached our lockers to find Stewart and Jimmy nervously waiting for us. <i>Here we go,</i> Sighing, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStewart was the first to talk, but I raised my hand, stopping his question. \"We heard you talking to Pop yesterday afternoon.\" Politely, I said. \"I have a crush on you, too, but...\" I bit my lip. \"I'm not ready for my first date quite yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two will be the first we ask when that day comes.\" Softly, Pat added. She smiled, blushing. \"I've got feelings for you too, Jimmy, so... rain check?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Stewart and Jimmy seemed disappointed but smiled, taking it well. \"When you are ready, Cassie, call me.\" He handed me a piece of paper that I assumed held his phone number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing, I replied, \"Count on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That goes for you too, Pat.\" Smiling, Jimmy said. \"You know my number.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing as well, Pat nodded. \"When I am ready, I'll call.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that out of the way, we began to gather what we needed for our first class. I opened my locker to find a note on a torn piece of paper someone had slipped through the door. It read: <i>I need your help.</i> With my newly acquired knowledge of arts, I recognized the handwriting to be Nicole Terry, one of the Queen Bees who hang around with Brooklynne. She was rather tall, with long forest brown hair and emerald green eyes. Out of the entire bunch, she was likely the most tolerable. However, the note did not reveal much, other than she needed help from me for some mysterious reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you find?\" Curious, Pat asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A note from Nicole Terry, asking for help.\" Honestly, I replied. \"Only it didn't reveal much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPat handed me a torn note of her own. \"I found this in my locker.\" Frowning, she said. \"it looks to be the same handwriting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at the note. It read: <i>Meet me at lunch, I'm scared.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPat and I exchanged worried looks, and decided to try to figure out what was going on and why she needed our help. Only Nicole Terry did not show up for school, and it was clear from the death glares I got from Brooklynne that she somehow thought I was involved. The majority of the morning was uneventful, and soon we were at lunch, where I was sitting with my friends, including Pat and Jimmy. I had to admit, I was a bit anxious to find out why Nicole Terry needed help from my sister and me. The answer came when Nicole entered the cafeteria, looking rather ill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are, Nicole!\" Irritated, Brooklynne snapped. \"Where have you been all day?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole winced, not answering her, and walked straight up to our table, where she looked down at Pat and me, nervously rubbing one arm. \"Um... Do you mind if I join you?\" Tearfully, she whispered. She touched her lower abdomen, tears falling. \"I think I meet the requirements to join your little sisterhood...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to softly sob where she stood. It did not take a genius to catch on that she was pregnant, and I stood from my seat...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I don't remember much of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a drink. \"When I woke up the next morning, my blouse was buttoned wrong, my bra was inside out, and my panties were half off. I knew something had happened. I called the hostess, and she told me she'd kept the hounds off me until my brother came and got me.\" A shake of her head told us that, whoever that guy was, he wasn't her brother. \"N-now I'm p-p-pregnant, and I don't know whose it is. I don't know what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe broke down and cried. I rubbed her back, letting her get it out. \"Why did I go?\" she asked. \"Why did I drink so - \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This wasn't you,\" Amy said. \"Girls get raped at parties and at home.

It's up to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time, apparently, Brooklynne got tired of wondering what Nicole was up to, so she and the Queen Bees came to us. \"Nicole,\" she said, \"where were you all morning? Why did you give me the brush-off? And what in the name of God are you doing at the losers' table?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She came to us,\" I said, \"not to you.

I have half a mind to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Half a mind to do what, Miss Dietrich?\" Startling her, Ms Switch demanded. \"Also, who are you calling a freak of nature? Your grades hardly mark you as an expert in any given field.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ouch...</i> Wincing, I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooklynne turned around with a cross look on her face, only to cover it quickly to avoid the stone cold glare from the principal. At that moment, there was no doubt in my mind why many had dubbed her the fearless Ms Switch. \"It's just a little misunderstanding, ma'am.\" Glaring at Nicole and my friends, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look me in the eye when you talk to me, young lady.\" Sternly, Ms Switch said. \"I have lived through and survived horrors that would give you maddening nightmares.\" She motioned to Brooklynne's favorite table. \"Finish your lunch and leave your classmates in peace, or you <i>will</i> be answering to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Brooklynne reluctantly returned to her table, Ms. Switch leaned in close to me and whispered, \"I am watching over you, Miss Pennant. Do have a care.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked her in the eye and gasped as I saw them turn all blue with a dull shine before returning to their original color of brown. As she then walked away without a word, I realized how the substitute teachers were able to infiltrate the school. Our principal was a Gaian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the school day was uneventful, with the exception of Nicole sticking pretty close to my friends and I. Brooklynne and her remaining Queen Bees gave her and us death glares when we caught their eyes, but they did not make a move, likely due to Ms Switch's warning. Finally, the day ended, and we all met up at my house with Nicole nervously showing up with Dr Kyrl Foster. \"I picked her up, as you had asked.\" Calmly, Kyrl said. \"I told her parents that she was volunteering to help with a school play.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They- they don't know yet.\" Tearfully, Nicole said. \"I'm trying to find a way to break it to them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The sooner you tell them, the better.\" Honestly, I said. \"We'll be there for you, if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole teared up, a grateful smile on her face. \"Thank you, all of you.\" Timidly, she said. \"I have to admit, I was afraid you would reject me because of all I had said as a Queen Bee...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's in the past.\" Serious, Pop said. \"You need to focus on the present, it is the only time you have in which to act.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole nodded, then turned to the Spindle Harp. \"What is this musical you are putting together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a musical about a dying world.\" With an air of sadness, Kyrl said. \"It reflects upon the rising pollution, hate, and inequality we are seeing here on Earth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Basically, the musical speaks of a desperate people with a desperate plan to preserve what is left of them.\" Sadly, I said. \"Their art, culture, technology, religion, philosophy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A warning that if we are not careful, we will face the same fate.\" Serious, Mom added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sounds intense.\" Looking impressed, Nicole said. \"How can I help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have the beginnings of a poem you can help with turning into a song.\" Kindly, Pat said. \"Tell me what you think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole listened and was surprised by the words of the poem...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe realization came too late, no children will be born, we sealed our own fate.<br>\r\nTo a primitive world dubbed a place to hide, it is our last hope to survive.<br>\r\nYoung women with great hearts we must find, grant them the gift of what we leave behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... people from this alien world will be looking for young women to pass on everything their world was.\" Curious, Nicole said. \"Why...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In their religion, it was three virgin born daughters who spread the word of right and wrong, with the help of a single wise man, instead of three wise men spreading the word through a single virgin born son.\" Serious, Pat said. \"As you can see, we put a lot of thought into this play.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole was silent for a moment. \"I'd leave the poem out.\" Kindly, she said. \"We don't want to step too much on religion, as some people are sensitive about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that from experience.\" Sadly, Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole nodded. \"You have Bible-thumping parents, too, huh?\" Softly, she asked. \"What did they do when they found out about your pregnancy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They kicked her out.\" Softly, Mom said. \"Only my husband set them straight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop cleared his throat, trying to hide a blush. \"I did nothing more than remind her father of the grace of God.\" Calmly, he said. \"We have a lot of props and landscape scenes to make and paint, before our audition performance before the student council next month.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You already made an appointment to audition the play?\" surprised, Pat asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop chuckled. \"No, Ms. Switch did.\" Smiling, he said. \"She seemed quite interested in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I know the reason why.\" Wincing, I said. I turned to Kyrl, which Pop noticed and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it you knew about Ms. Switch, Dr Foster.\" Softly, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyrl nodded. \"I knew... She was my teacher back at home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole turned between Pop and I. \"What about Principal Switch?\" Confused, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop shook his head then smiled. \"It's hard to hide anything from Ms. Switch.\" Bemused, he said. \"She knew about the play long before we revealed it was in the making.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole smiled, shaking her head. \"I might have known.\" Softly, she said. \"Where do we start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop smiled and replied, \"We start with...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When we got up on stage, however, I was surprised to see unfamiliar faces in the audience. \"Does anybody know who they are?\" I whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole took a look. \"That's Mrs. Norris,\" she said. \"She's the Drama teacher. The kids are the Drama Club. I guess they want a say on the play.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI should have anticipated their presence. After all, putting on plays was their territory. Of course they'd be interested. \"Alright, everybody,\" I said, \"break a leg.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you tell them to hurt themselves?\" Kyrl asked.I<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a showbiz superstition,\" I explained. \"It's bad luck to wish a performer good luck before they get on stage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe show went well, I thought. Certainly, Ms. Switch seemed to be moved. Of course, from where she was sitting, only we on stage could see that her eyes were blue and glowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had an amazing experience as I sang the last song for my character. I held the baby doll prop as I sang:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Little baby, please understand<br>\r\nI won't be there for you<br>\r\nWhen you become a man<br>\r\nThis generation may be the last, we fear<br>\r\nUnless we reach another world so near<br>\r\nWe need them so... hear our woe... <br>\r\nTake these broken dreams<br>\r\nAnd lift our hopes up again<br>\r\nOf a life lived so free<br>\r\nWhen we hear the angels sing<br>\r\nWe'll know Earth has opened up their arms<br>\r\nAnd let us in<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle baby, a kiss goodbye<br>\r\nI must leave to right the wrongs<br>\r\nTo give you a better life<br>\r\nLittle baby, it's all we have to hold<br>\r\nA desperate plan to save our race<br>\r\nSo pray for the brave and bold<br>\r\nWe rely on them so... <br>\r\nTake these broken dreams<br>\r\nAnd lift our hopes up again<br>\r\nFrom extinction, we'll be free<br>\r\nAnd when we hear the angels sing<br>\r\nWe'll know Earth has opened up their arms<br>\r\nAnd let us in... </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I sang, I felt somehow outside of myself. I wasn't just Cassie Pennant, performing a play: I was also this grieving mother, sending her baby to be born of another woman. Suddenly, I was sure of it: This woman's child was the one growing inside me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy son.</span></div></div>",

I smiled, then scanned the audience and almost fainted! There, standing by the rear door, was a tall man with short black hair, beard, mustache and brown eyes, in a suit. It was Lin-Manuel Miranda! He had come to see our play, and he was applauding!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh my goodness!</i> Breathless, I thought. <i>Oh my goodness!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to scream in delight, but, just as quickly as I had noticed him, he handed an usher a note and casually walked out.

Most people who come up with a hit performance immediately fall into a power trip and refuse to share the spotlight with anyone.\" She motioned to her students who were all smiling. \"That does not fly in my Drama Club.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that mean we are in the Drama club, too?\" Whispering, Pat asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs Switch giggled before whispering into My ear, \"Gaians have twice the strength and endurance as average humans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we're not...\" Whispering back, I began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs Switch smiled and whispered, \"No, you are not, but carrying a Gaian child, you inherit some of those traits.\" She giggled and added, \"By the time your children are born, even Pat will be able to run circles around a triathlete.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled at that, then turned to Mrs Norris. \"Where do we sign up for tutoring?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe members of the drama club cheered, but paused as Brooklynne blurted out, \"Sign us up for the drama club! We'll perform that play far better than all those pretenders!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs Norris shook her head. \"Don't you think you have enough on your plate, Dietrich?\" Quoting Brooklynne's own words to me days before, she asked. \"You're stuck up, and you're trying to keep your grades up.\" Her smile turned into a grin. \"That would be enough for most people. And now you want a part in a play, just because someone else thought it up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooklynne gasped as if slapped in the face, then turned red before storming out of the auditorium with her Queen Bees reluctantly following. After they were gone, Mrs Switch turned to Mrs Norris with a grin. \"You enjoyed that, didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every bit of it.\" Grinning back, Mrs Norris replied. She turned to me. \"Confidentially, you are not the only one who thinks she's an asshole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled at that, as the usher handed me Lin-Manuel Miranda's note.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The silk blue dress accented my curves very well, and had a dipping V-neck collar that showed just a hint of cleavage, with a slit along my left leg that revealed just enough to be a bit of a tease to the boys. Mom stood behind me with a bemused smile. \"You and Pat have come a long way in a very short while.\" Softly, she said. \"I'm proud of you both.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Mom.

It was much like my own dress, but ivory, with white silk lace and a moderate V collar that showed off a little cleavage. There was a slit on the left side of the dress that stopped just below the thigh. The sash was white with an ivory trim which Trish had neatly tied into a cute bow in the back. \"You look incredible in that dress, Pat.\" Smiling, I complimented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrish stood behind Pat smiling. \"More than any mortal man deserves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI giggled at that with Trish following while Pat only blushed more. \"Nervous, Pat?\" Bemused, Mom asked. \"It's normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPat managed a smile. \"It just seems like a little much for a first date.\" Nervous, she said. \"I feel like I'm going to the prom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you think the dress you are wearing is over the top, trust me, you haven't seen anything yet.\" Smiling, Trish said. \"This is modest by comparison to prom dresses today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the doorbell rang. \"It's showtime, girls.\" Smiling, Mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go get 'em, tigress.\" Lightly pushing Pat forward, Trish said. \"Show Jimmy your feminine side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe both walked down the stairs to greet Jimmy and Kevin, who were both wearing handsome black suits. Their jaws dropped as they saw us. \"Wow... \" Stunned, Jimmy said. \"You look breathtaking, Pat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The stars in the night sky pale by comparison.\" looking at me, Kevin said. \"I am humbled you chose me, out of an ocean of men...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Romeo.\" Firmly but kindly, Pop said. \"I think Cassie gets the idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPat and I giggled. \"You look rather handsome yourself, Jimmy.\" Blushing, Pat said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look dashing this evening, Kevin.\" Calmly, I said. \"To where are you whisking us fair maidens, on our first adventure together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To the movies, and then dinner.\" simply, Kevin replied. \"They are playing the new hit movie, <i>The Reluctant Princess</i>.\" He chuckled at Jimmy, suddenly blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's about a common boy who was transformed by magic into a royal princess, as the queen needed an heir.\" Blushing, Jimmy said. \"Kevin thought that it might give Pat and Cassie some perspective in her new lives, as, in a way, they are royal princesses now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPat and I blushed at that, we never thought of it that way. We were the last hope of a dying race so, in a way, Kevin was right, we were royalty in a way. \"Flattery will get you boys nowhere.\" Teasing, I countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to us until after the date, Pop had spotted Darla Darling and Brooklynne Dietrich peering into one of our windows and nodded at Mom, who then nodded at Trish, out of sight on the stairs. She pulled out a cellphone and dialed a number. \"The Queen Bee and the Drama Queen are on the scene.\" Serious, she said. \"Tell the Sisterhood to be ready, in case they decide to try to start trouble.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was a lenticular poster, so the picture changed depending on the angle. One way, it showed a boy wearing the same sort of clothes Pat had worn as a boy. The other, it showed a beautiful young woman in a sparkling blue gown. \"I feel like I showed up in my bathrobe,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Jimmy,\" Kevin said, \"let's show our dates how special they are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys escorted us away from the poster. \"FYI,\" I whispered to Pat, \"<i>that</i> is a prom dress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin asked me what I wanted from the concession stand, and Jimmy did the same with Pat. Then, the sent us to wait in the lobby while they got everything. It seemed unnecessary to me, but, hey, I didn't buy the ticket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Excuse me, I'm awfully sorry, miss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to see what had happened. Apparently, the janitor had accidentally hit a young girl in the face with the business end of his mop. Apologizing profusely, he took her to one of the restrooms to wash up. Oddly, however, he pulled her to the opposite side of the building, even though there was a restroom just past us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever. The staff know their business. And, anyway, Kevin and Jimmy were here with the food and drinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">****************************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe had a great time. The movie showed how the young man in question was picked up in his sleep, and changed for reasons he didn't know. <i>This movie is closer to our story than Kevin knows,</i> I thought. <i>Or, at least, closer than he</i> ought <i>to know.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, I wasn't averse to Kevin knowing our secrets. I felt he ought to know what he was in for, after all. But <i>I</i> certainly hadn't told him anything. So was it a coincidence? And, if it wasn't, how did he find out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the movie let out, another peculiar incident happened. We walked out to find Darcy Darling standing in the lobby, soaking wet from two huge sodas. I wondered how that could have happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter we left, the janitor removed his baseball cap and mask, revealing it was Nicole. \"The eagles have left the perch,\" she said into a walkie-talkie, \"and are in search of a meal. Drama Queen has been sidelined. Be ready.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kevin and Jimmy took Pat and I to Momma Mia's, a popular Italian restaurant near the theater, where we were greeted by Momma Mia herself. She was tall and pleasantly plump, with long salt and pepper hair and blue eyes. \"Young love is always a blessing to see.\" Gushing, she said in a heavy Italian accent. \"It's even more of a romantic blessing when your dates buy out the entire restaurant just for their first date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPat and I blushed at the first part of Mia's statement, but gasped at the second part and turned to Kevin and Jimmy, shocked. Kevin blushed just as much as I. \"Pop helped out a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little...?\" surprised, Pat asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, he helped out a lot.\" Blushing as well, Jimmy said. \"We wanted to make sure we show you two a really great time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The restaurant is yours, little love birds.\" Smiling, Mia said. \"I will bring you some menus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin led me to one booth while Jimmy led Pat to another. shortly after, a young waitress approached, handing Kevin and me menus. As we were looking them over, I noticed more young workers pulling the shades down over all of the windows. I spotted someone standing outside but I did not catch who it was. Just as I was tempted to investigate, the lights were dimmed and a single candle lantern was placed on Pat's and my tables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing like a little atmosphere to make this dinner perfect.\" Smiling, Kevin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" Blushing profusely, I said. \"You and Jimmy really gave this date a lot of thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We wanted it to be perfect.\" Smiling, Jimmy said. \"Order whatever you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was completely blown away. I had the urge to giggle like a little girl on Christmas day. I held the menu in front of my face to hide my gaiety until I could compose myself. Only I broke into giggles when a young worker began to play a romantic tune on the violin between Pat's table and mine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If this is the first date, I'm going to need to prepare myself for the second.\" giggling, Pat said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI giggled at that, not knowing until later that the violin music was to drown out Brooklynne pounding on the glass window, due to not being able to get in. Pat and I ordered our meals and engaged in friendly conversation with our dates. It was a wonderful experience, though I was curious about the young workers. When we were done and ready to leave, Kevin produced his wallet, only Mia stopped him with a wave of her hand. \"I've already been paid far more than I normally make on a day like this.\" Kindly, she said. \"It's on the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, I felt it would not be appropriate to ask about the young looking workers, and we left with our dates, who took us back home. Inside the restaurant, one of the violinists took off her work cap and mask to reveal Trish, who turned to the others. \"Great job, sisters.\" Smiling, she said. \"The Queen Bee has been snubbed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Momma Mia confronted Brooklynne, who was trying to intercept us. \"I do not appreciate anyone banging on my windows!\" Sternly, she barked. \"If you come here again, I will slap you so silly, you will forget your own name!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooklynne looked past Mia to see that Kevin's car was well out of reach and stormed off, ignoring Mia's threat. After she was gone, Mia smiled and pulled out a cellphone. \"Okay, little brother, your stepdaughter and daughter had a great time with no Queen Bee to ruin either of their evening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, sis.\" Calmly, Pop replied. \"I owe you one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Family is always there for each other.\" Smiling, Mia said. \"Adopted or not.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Our date the night before was an experience I doubted either of us would soon forget. Everything was perfect, and it ended with our very first kiss. \"I feel so weird, but I feel so good.\" Entering the dining room, Pat said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom giggled. \"You still haven't come down from the high of that kiss, I see.\" Smiling, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I have either.\" Dreamily, I said. \"What a first date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop smiled. \"Your circle of friends made certain of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to Pop, surprised, then smiled, remembering the young bumbling janitor and the young workers at Momma Mia's. \"I should have guessed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We saw both Darla and Brooklynne looking into one of our windows before you two left on your dates with Kevin and Jimmy.\" Calmly, Mom said. \"Trish had a feeling they would try to pull something, and rallied the sisterhood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True friends...\" Tearing up, Pat said. \"We should do something like that on their first dates.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree.\" Smiling, I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon walking into school, we were in for a surprise. There were posters on almost every locker stating: <i>Cassie and Pat for prom queen.</i> We turned to each other, not knowing how to react, as Darla approached my sister with a certain fury in her eyes, with Brooklynne right behind her. I found it interesting that her Queen Bees were not with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try all you want, freak!\" Angry, Darla fumed. \"You will always be a loser!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarla curled her fingers into a fist and tried to punch Pat in the lower abdomen. Knowing what her intention was, Pat dodged her first swing, and then the second, and third... \"Hold still, damn you!\" Raging, Darla yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had prepared myself to intervene, not knowing that a number of students, witnessing it, ran for the principal's office. What happened next seemed to occur in slow motion. Pat's expression turned to rage and caught Darla's hand before it came even close for another try, and squeezed it with such untapped strength, Darla was forced to cry out in pain and fall to her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you <i>dare</i> touch my baby!\" Literally screaming, Pat warned. \"Try that again, I'll...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is enough, Patrica!\" Firmly, principal Switch said. \"Let her go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to find Ms Switch approaching from the crowd. Reluctantly, Pat released Darla, who quickly began to nurse her hand as Ms Switch confronted her. \"This is a new low for you, Darling.\" Softly, angrily, she said. \"You were warned... clean out your locker, young lady, you are expelled as of today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, Ms Switch escorted Darla off to her office while I turned to Brooklynne. \"Don't tell me you're going to be the sensible one.\" Sarcastically, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had never before seen fear in Brooklynne's eyes, until that day. She slowly backed away, and I swore I saw her gulp. \"You're both freaks...\" Whispering, she said. \"Everyone has something to hide, I'll have you and your play ruined!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked away, I knew that we no longer had rivals, we had enemies. Darla tried to harm Pat's unborn child and she reacted as any mother would. Only she stopped the attack with a strength I never would have guessed she had. \"We're going to need to warn the Sisterhood and the Drama Club.\" Softly, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day was mostly uneventful, with the exception of gossip about Pat's rage and unheard of strength. \"It's always the quiet ones...\" I heard one girl whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darla had it coming to her.\" Another girl replied. \"I just never thought it would be the shy boy turned girl who would give it to her...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Patrica is almost guaranteed to win prom queen this year, now that Darla has been expelled.\" Yet another girl said. \"Her retaliation was out of self defense, so that won't disqualify her...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the school day ended...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'm asking you to find out what you can, and, if you think it's necessary, take action to protect and defend the Sisterhood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, as I lay in bed, I talked to my unborn baby. \"I wonder what development is like for Gaian babies? Do you have ears yet? Can you hear me when I'm talking?\" I rubbed my flat belly. \"Jonathan Donald Pennant. That'll be your name when you come out. Jonathan for my father, Donald for Pop.

I tried to ask, but Pop would not say. He just smiled and said, \"Trust me. When the time is right, you will know everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not until lunch the next day when I saw Brooklynne again, only she was staring down her former Queen Bees, who had all decided to confront her on her latest lie. \"You went too far, Dietrich!\" a tall blond huffed. \"It's one thing to dig up dirt on people, making up lies is another!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, Gretchen.\" Stress in her voice, Brooklynne said. \"I can explain...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pop has literally saved dozens of lives as a preacher, including my own!\" Angrily, a well built brunette scolded. \"Trying to drag a man like that through the mud is a new low for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darci, I only did that to get back at...\" Brooklynne began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do next, girl?!\" Scoffing, a brown haired girl demanded. \"Start spreading dirt on us?! Don't forget, we have plenty of dirt on you to spread in kind!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you threatening me now?!\" turning red, Brooklynne asked. \"Have you forgotten who I am?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brooklynne Marybeth Dietrich!\" Angrily, a male voice thundered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the cafeteria turned to find a towering man with crew cut black hair and green eyes. It was Brooklynne's father, Maximus Dietrich, the owner of the local bank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daddy...!\" With a nervous grin, Brooklynne said. \"I thought you were still on a business trip...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just got in this morning, to hear that my son is a rapist, and that you are knowingly spreading misinformation at school about one of my most decorated clients and his family!\" Furious, Maximus roared. \"If I lose a single penny because of your antics, young lady, your inheritance will be cut in half!\" He then cleared his throat and straightened his tie and softly added, \"I do hope I have made myself crystal clear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he walked out of the cafeteria to talk to someone. From where I was sitting I was able to see Maximus was talking to Pop! It was then that it all made sense. Pop had placed all of the treasure left for us into Max's bank! I could not help smile. \"Well played, Pop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then turned back to Brooklynne, to find her almost literally dead in the eyes. She turned to me with a heavy sulk on her face. Fortunately, I had dropped my smile before then, as she merely shook her head and slowly walked away with her former Queen Bees walking toward me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I hear you have a little sisterhood going on.\" Slightly nervous, Gretchen said. \"Are you accepting new members?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to the others, who could only shrug, it was left up to me. \"Sit with us, we'll talk.\" Politely, I said. \"It's at least a start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Gwendolyn, my friends call me Gwen.\" Softly, the brown haired girl said. \"We hung around Brooklynne for various reasons...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is in the past, Gwen.\" Quoting Pop, I said. \"Focus on the present, it's the only time you have to act.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen smiled, I knew she was grateful not to have to explain her past actions. \"You play is really amazing, guys.\" Honestly, she said. \"What inspired it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what we are doing to our own planet was part of it.\" Softly, I replied. \"That, and getting raped at the Stardust hotel.\" I gulped. \"Those substitute teachers chose their targets carefully.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Worried, Darci asked. \"Why did they target you four?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think about it,...\" Firmly, Pat said. \"Three shy girls with very few friends, and an inwardly drawn boy slowly turning into a girl...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGretchen's eyes went wide as she fit the pieces into her mind. \"There would be little chance of an investigation, because almost literally no one would have your backs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded and added, \"Can you imagine how many other girls they may have attacked before they were caught in the act because of a perverted hotel manager?\" I then shuddered. More in  disgust of having to lie about three brave aliens trying to save their world from extinction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you keeping the babies, then?\" Wincing, Gretchen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They did not ask to be born.\" Softly, Pat replied. \"I will not take a life because someone could not keep it in their pants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will be punishing those rapists every day by raising our children to be better than them.\" Firmly, I said. \"It's the best form of justice we could ever ask for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a way, it was the truth. The Gaians had ruined their own planet, and, by raising their next generation right, it would be an ironic form of justice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy thoughts were interrupted by Gretchen suddenly hugging Nicole. \"When that creep, Bronx, gets out of jail, we are not going to let him anywhere near the Sisterhood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Sisterhood was growing.</span></div></div>",

Not only was our message, Gaia's message, being spread through the most popular music and art magazine in the world, but we were going to perform in the most watched theater in the US, and possibly the world.

It was the best news we had received since this had all started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will have to get permission from our parents, of course.\" Excited, I said. \"But I don't see any problems, I'm too excited!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations, girls.\" Smiling, Sharon said. \"My people will contact your parents to iron out all of the details.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the interview, I walked out of the classroom and gave my friends the good news.

I then looked around. \"Where is Pat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She went to the bathroom about five minutes ago.\" Calmly, Stan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked around again, and did not find Brooklynne either.

Pop merely nodded and gave an occasional grunt as he listened, then sighed as I had finished. \"I'm proud of you and Pat, the play you and your friends had put together is obviously a huge success.\" Calmly, he said. \"However, this new development with Brooklynne has me worried.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think she may try to go after her again?\" Wincing, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop shook his head. \"it's just a gut feeling.\" Softly, he said. \"It comes from years of working with people of all walks of life. I think Brooklynne may be very sick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean other than in the head?\" Trying to be light, I asked. Only Pop was not smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean she may be very physically sick, as well as mentally.\" Serious, Pop replied. \"Suddenly switching from trying to destroy you both to loving one is a dead giveaway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you suppose is wrong with her?\" now worried, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop drummed his fingers on the table in a nervous manner. \"Again, its just a gut feeling.\" Softly, he said. \"I'll need to make a call to confirm my suspicions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched, curious and anxious, as Pop made a phone call. \"Principal Switch, Pop Pennant here.\" Firmly, he said. \"Are you aware of Brooklynne Dietrich's unusual personality changes lately?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop listened as Ms Switch told her what she knew of it. His expression told me that it was not good news. \"I understand.\" Softly, Pop said. \"We will do what we can on this end...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Pop was done on the phone, he turned to me, looking worried. \"Brooklynne was targeted, just as your friends were, with a seed.\" Serious, he explained. \"Only there was a marginal risk we were not informed of until now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A risk?\" gulping, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop sighed. \"Inbreeding brings the risk of genetic disorders.\" Darkly, he said. \"I have seen this first hand, and it is not pretty.\" he sighed. \"Ms Switch fears that, by making love to her brother, Brooklynne developed a Gaian genetic disorder from her unborn child.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why was she targeted?!\" Surprised, I demanded. \"I thought they were looking for those who were isolated due to shyness or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is more than one form of isolation.\" Calmly, Pop said. \"A rich girl who gets all she wants but her father's love can be very isolated, indeed. No time to listen to either of them, and allowing his wealth to take care of them for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was now seeing Brooklynne in a new light. \"What did she develop?\" Whispering, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms Switch called it Endless Lust Disorder.\" Almost sadly, Pop replied. \"Unfortunately, her brother is just a privileged horny brat who is all too happy to fuel Brooklynne's illness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a cure for this?\" Wincing, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms Switch told me she can help her, but we need to first find her.\" Firmly, Pop said. \"If we don't find her soon, she may harm herself in order to satisfy that never ending 'itch'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a thought, I took up my phone and called Nicole. \"I just got word that Brooklynne is very sick and needs medical attention.\" Serious, I said. \"She's confused and frightened, we need to find her, fast.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And don't go in without her, unless you absolutely have to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI called up the former Queen Bees and let them know what was happening, then I borrowed the car and rounded them all up. \"What's going on?\" Gwen asked. \"How did Brooklynne get so sick? And how is Ms. Switch going to help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a long story,\" I said. \"The short version is, there are things I and the rest of the Sisterhood haven't told you, for your own protection, and it looks like I need to tell you now.\" One as-brief-as-possible recap later, I said, \"So now Brooklynne's sick from her relationship with Bronx, and Ms. Switch needs to help her and her fetus. Still in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were wide-eyed after everything I'd told them, but they still cared enough about Brooklynne to agree to help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we got to the lake, it wasn't hard to spot the houseboat, as the lights were on. As we got closer, we could hear two voices coming from inside. \"Looks like we'll need to go in,\" I said, \"ahead of Ms. Switch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we entered the boat house, we saw Brooklynne, naked, tying her father to a post. \"Brooklynne,\" he yelled, \"I <i>demand</i> an explanation!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need you, Daddy,\" she said. \"But you never have time for me. So now, we're going to <i>make</i> the time, and do all the things I want to do with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Except you don't want to do this, Brooklynne,\" I said, \"not really. You're sick, and we've come to help you get well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe charged at me, but I was ready, knocking her into the water. When she climbed back out, Nicole and the others held her down, while I untied Mr. Dietrich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would someone tell me,\" he said, \"precisely what in the blazes is going on here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A battle for your daughter's mind, body, and soul is going on here, Mr. Dietrich,\" Ms. Switch said. \"And, if you ever cared about her as more than an extension of yourself, you will do exactly as I say.\"</span></div></div>",

With him distracted, Ms Switch turned to a small radio. \"We are ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blue light entered the living area, before becoming a man I recognized as the new school janitor, Mr. Barns. He was of average height and build, but had a very handsome face with sandy blond hair and gentle blue eyes. \"I need everyone to think of a person who wants a child.\" Calmly, he said. \"Do not speak of this person, just think. I am what you would call a clairvoyant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were surprised, and somewhat startled, but we all thought of who wanted a child but could not, and Mr Barns smiled. \"It is unanimous.\" Calmly, he said. \"Let us begin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you people?\" Frightened, Brooklynne demanded. \"What is going on?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have what is called Endless Lust Disorder.\" Startling her, Pop explained. \"It is a rare genetic disorder triggered by interbreeding pregnancy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooklynne turned white. \"Is that what I have?\" Shaking, she demanded. \"i thought i was going mad, after so long of letting Bronx violate me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You let your brother rape you?!\" disturbed, Nicole asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First cousin.\" Softly, Brooklynne replied. \"Daddy adopted him after his parents had died in an avalanche while skiing overseas.\" She began to cry. \"I figured, as long as he was focused on me, he would not tarnish the family name by...\" She fell apart, crying uncontrollably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, child.\" placing a hand onto Brooklynne's forehead. Ms Switch said. \"All will be well in a matter of moments.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes turned blue and began to glow as Mr Barns transformed back into his blue light form and entered Brooklynne. Just as quickly as it had happened, he flew out of her and vanished through the wall. Ms Switch looked at her watch then turned to us. \"In less than a minute, Brooklynne will have a new child growing within her.\" Serious, she said. \"This will stabilize her condition, but the trauma of what she has gone through will remain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to Brooklynne, seeing her in a new light. The stress and heartache she had suffered was enough to make all of us cry. Before we could react, a blue light passed through her before Mr barns returned. \"It is done.\" Politely, he said. \"Her madness will subside and eventually vanish, and the odds in favor of our survival will increase.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We took her unborn child and gave it to Mrs Norris.\" To our shock, Ms. Switch said. \"She has always wanted a child, but feared she was sterile.\" She smiled. \"This way, her pregnancy will not be questioned, but welcomed with open arms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here I thought they just targeted us.\" Ruefully, I muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are trying to save an entire species, Cassie.\" Serious, Pop said. \"Do you seriously believe that they would risk everything on seven lone young women?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStunned, I turned to Ms Switch. \"How many of you are there?\" Wincing, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Switch sadly smiled. \"Far fewer than you might think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who... Who are you people?\" Trembling, Brooklynne demanded. \"Please... I'm scared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are a victim too, Brooklynne.\" Softly, I said. \"That does not mean you have to be a victim all on your own.\" I held my hand out to her as the others relaxed their grip. \"We are stronger together, we can make a difference.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, hesitantly, Brooklynne took my hand and I pulled her into a warm hug. It was then that she completely fell into hysterical tears. She gripped my blouse as if she feared she would lose me if she were to let go. The rest of the sisterhood soon joined in the hug, all realizing that, like the Gaians, we were slowly making peace with our foes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He apologized for being gone so much, and he promised to help me. And the baby.\" She rested a hand on her womb. \"It's so weird. Why me? Why did they pick me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We had the same questions,\" I said. \"The Gaians who impregnated us said that they wanted girls with great capacity for love, because we would give that love to our children.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the first time Brooklynne had ever heard herself described that way. Her face brightened... and then sank again, as Pat came down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Pat came closer, Brooklynne stood, her head lowered. \"I know sorry can never be enough,\" she said, \"but it's all that I have. I threw up when I got home, from disgust with myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPat said, \"I've never been so afraid as I am now. But Pop told me what happened, and why. I can't forget what you did.

If any rumor or theory does spread, it would be shrugged off as them hearing about the play.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooklynne giggled. \"That's deviously clever, Cassie.\" With a rueful grin, she said. \"We'll make a bee out of you yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all giggled, catching on to the irony of her statement. \"Welcome to the Sisterhood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to us, miles away, a dark figure watched a segment of the news, talking about our play to soon hit Playhouse Theater.

At first, I was surprised then angry but all of that vanished when I saw tears running from Darla's eyes. \"It wasn't bad enough that you and your sister got me expelled?\" Tearfully, she asked. \"You had to send some muscle after me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" Confused, I demanded. \"First, you got yourself expelled by attacking Pat and second, we did not send anyone anywhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't send them?\" Surprised, Darla asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the last time, what are you talking about?!\" irritated, I asked. \"We have enough problems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A number of substitute teachers came to my new school out of the blue.\" Frustrated, Darla explained. \"They all claimed that the regular teachers got a vacation.\" She scoffed. \"I may not be an A-plus student but I know BS when I hear it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was too much of a parallel for it to be a coincidence. \"Let me guess, they were all fixated on you, asking strange questions about our play.\" Frowning, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do know something about this!\" Accusing, Darla yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because we got the same problem here!\" Yelling back, I countered. \"The same BS excuse of a lot of teachers suddenly taking a vacation and the substitutes only having an interest in us, those who had anything to do with the play.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarla paused. \"It sounds like your play has made someone very nervous.\" Softly, she said. \"My guess is that this someone sent these phony teachers to get more information.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who would be nervous about our play?\" confused, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyone who profits off of ignoring clean air legislation or waste management laws.\" Serious, Darla replied. \"Your play gives a powerful message that we need to take better care of our environment and each other before there is nothing left but regrets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, still angry with Darla for her stunt that got her expelled. \"What was with you trying to punch Pat anyway?\" irritated, I demanded. \"You now she's pregnant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't going to actually hit your sister... hard.\" Frowning, Darla said. \"I just wanted to get my message across loud and clear that she should not be running against me.\" She sighed, seeing my face harden. \"The point is, we both have a problem on our hands. Maybe, if we call a truce and share what we know, we can get that problem out of our hair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hesitated but eventually sighed and shook Darla's hand. \"Okay... truce.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The two looked at each other for a moment then demanded, in unison, \"What is she doing here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brooklynne and her friends are a part of the Sisterhood.\" Calmly, Lauren said. \"It turns out they were trying to protect us, and others, in their own ways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You joined them?!\" Surprised, Darla asked. \"When we met at their house by chance, I was under the impression that you hated them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was the old me.\" Somewhat sadly, Brooklynne said. \"I'm pregnant too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarla took a step back. \"You're what?!\" a look of fear formed upon her face. \"What is this, an epidemic of mysterious pregnancies?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooklynne stepped up to Darla with a cross look on her face. I had a suspicion that she was going to show her the intimidation she had used on so many others in the past. Only she instead sniffed the air near her. This made Darla visually disturbed and concerned. Finally, Brooklynne's face softened as she softly said, \"You've been seeded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you certain?\" Surprised, Mom asked. \"Why her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you guys talking about?\" Becoming worried, Darla demanded. \"I'm in enough trouble for jumping school...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring Darla for the moment, Brooklynne turned to us. \"I first noticed it on myself.\" Calmly, she explained. \"Our body odor typically has an almost almond smell to it. Only when seeded or impregnated, that body odor changes to a scent closer to coconut.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, Darla gave her armpit a quick sniff then turned to us, shocked. \"What...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop sighed and turned to Darla, with a look that caused her to step backwards in fear. \"I didn't touch your daughter!\" Near tears, she whimpered. \"Sure, I tried to scare her, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop placed a firm hand onto Darla's shoulder, causing her to freeze, tears rolling down her face. I became concerned at this point, but was surprised as Pop knelled down to Darla's level and removed a layer of makeup under her eye, revealing a very bad shiner. Everyone gasped as Darla then began to freely cry. \"Don't tell mom...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooklynne stepped forward and began to examine Darla, becoming more and more distressed as she did. \"She has two broken ribs, a badly healed broken arm, and I can feel a number of cuts under her clothing.\" Sadly, she said. \"Someone has been physically abusing her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone began to shed tears, now having a better understanding of the roots of Darla's physical attacks on others. Pop looked Darla in the eye. \"Who... did... this?\" Firmly, he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My- My stepfather.\" Whimpering, Darla said. \"Since I was around four... he- he gets drunk a lot, and can't control himself...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't make excuses for a sinner.\" Serious, Pop said. \"He's been hurting you, hence you know no other way.\" He gave Darla a kind smile. \"That ends today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarla began to cry more. \"My stepdad is impossible to live with!\" Wailing, she said. \"He went crazy when Mom told him I was being transferred to an all girls boarding school!\" She began to gasp for breath. \"He sneaked in the other night... He... He... I had to run...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe completely broke down in Pop's arms. \"It took a lot of courage to come to us from a boarding school for help.\" Gently, Pop said. \"t took even more courage to tell us of your stepfather's crimes against you.\" He began to rub her back in a soothing manner. \"I promise you that your stepfather is going to be in very serious trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should we do?\" Worried, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, I'm going to call Darla's mother.\" Serious, Mom said. \"If her second husband is willing to sneak into an all girls boarding school, there is no telling what he will do to her, now that his favorite punching bag is out of the picture.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll call the boarding school.\" Standing up, Pop said. \"Their security needs serious updates.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll call my father.\" Retrieving her cell phone, Brooklynne said. \"He can have his attorneys on this case within the hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll call my mother.\" Firmly, Nicole said. \"She is a lieutenant in the local police force. A report will need to be made.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll call Ms Switch and tell her Darla's story.\" Firmly, Pat said. \"Once she understands the reasons behind her behavior, maybe she will let her come back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarla was now freely crying, seeing every member of the Sisterhood rallying behind her with what they had to offer, to help her. I could sense that a huge weight had been lifted off her shoulders, and pulled her into a warm hug. \"It's going to be okay, Darla.\" Firmly but kindly, I said. \"Your nightmare is over.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

My cousin used me for his pleasure, and it threatened to destroy me, heart and soul. The Sisterhood, and my baby, are helping me to heal.

All fifteen of us, including Mom and Pop, who seemed a bit lost. \"So this is the mall...\" Awestruck, Mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm used to buying everything at the thrift shop.\" Softly, Pop added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooklynne giggled. \"Well, prepare yourselves, Pop and Mrs Pennant.\" Smiling, she said. \"We are all about to get pampered and primped for our trip to the New York big stage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This should be quite an experience for you, Pat.\" Smiling, Darla said. She nudged her arm. \"Being born a boy and all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPat smiled. \"I am reborn.\" Softly, she said. Turning to Sarah, she added, \"In more ways than one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah smiled at that, but said nothing. I decided to get the ball rolling by asking, \"Where to first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, we get you all up to date in fashions.\" Kindly, Brooklynne said. \"We want our looks to literally shout out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rich...?\" Raising an eyebrow, Pop asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooklynne shook her head. \"New Yorker...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled at that, as we were then led into a clothing store called Rose Bud Fashions where we were greeted by a young saleslady with a patient smile. \"Good morning, Miss Dietrich.\" Kindly, she said. \"I see you have brought some friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, I would like you to meet Viva Rose.\" Kindly, Brooklynne said. \"At the age of twenty, she is the owner and operator of Rose Bud Fashions. She is very interested in the costumes in our play, and has an offer for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see the costumes in your play becoming an instant hit new fashion sensation.\" Serious, Viva said. \"If whoever came up with those fashions gave me exclusive rights to them, I'll give her or them a partnership in the business, and dress you all up to the nines for free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all turned to each other, surprised and flattered. \"Ms Switch, the principal of our school, came up with the original idea.\" Smiling, I said. \"I drew up the designs with a few ideas of my own, and Nicole made them for the play.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a way, it was the truth, as Ms Switch came from the world the fashions came from, and I did alter the designs a bit to make them more 'Earth friendly,' and Nicole made them with Mom's sewing machine with impressive speed. Viva seemed surprised, but she still smiled. \"Do you think we can hammer out a deal?\" Hopeful, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to Nicole, who smiled, her eyes pointing towards inside the store. I turned and smiled myself upon seeing Ms Switch, who was smiling as well. \"I believe that can be arranged.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViva squealed, clapping her hands like an excited teenager. When she was able to compose herself, she motioned to the many clothing racks \"Let's get started then! New York awaits you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Switch giggled, a joyful tear rolling down her cheek. \"My world is coming back to life...\" Whispering, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gave her a one armed hug. \"Our world, Ms Switch.\" whispering back, I said. \"Welcome home.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Upon returning to school, we felt rather overwhelmed. Our play was affecting everything, from fashion, to hairstyles, to even music. There were students wearing Rose Line replicas of our costumes, others were sporting the hairstyles... Pat and I even heard the song 'Gaia' being played on the radio to promote the play being held at Playhouse Square next month!  It was a high that was hard to explain. Only we were not the only ones to notice this movement, The substitute teachers who had come as mysteriously as the aliens seemed to carry looks of concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is your secret, Miss Pennant?\" Curious, one of the teachers asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure what you mean.\" Taken aback, I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You practically have the entire school, no, the entire town, in the palm of your hands.\" Softly, the teacher said. \"All from a play you and your friends had written.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shrugged. \"Our ideas just caught on, I guess.\" Honestly, I said. \"We're all very proud of the work that has gone into it to bring it this far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you are.\" With a slight frown, the teacher said. \"I just hope you aren't too disappointed if this movement of yours does not last too long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get the feeling you don't like the play.\" Slightly louder, I said. This caught the attention of the students around us, a tactic I had learned from Brooklynne. \"May I ask why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher looked around, noticing he now had an audience to his hushed conversation to me. \"Clever, kid...\" Whispering, he said. Then, out loud, he said, \"I'm just saying that this could be just a flash in the pan. Popular now, and yesterday's news tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Square!\" Grinning, one boy said. \"No sense of the in and now.\" I noticed he was wearing a Rose Line Gaia shirt and pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most adults don't get it.\" Giggling, a girl added. I noticed she was wearing a Gaian-inspired hairstyle as she added, \"Every generation has its movement, and this is ours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Gaian movement.\" Smiling, I said. \"This generation is going to do something to save our world, where the old did nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheers erupted from the class as the substitute teacher frowned, before returning to the front of the class to begin his lecture. At lunch, we all shared similar stories of the substitute teachers trying to downplay the excitement over our play, and failing in an epic way. \"What have we started?\" Bemused, Pat asked. \"It feels as if we are transforming the entire town into a Gaian settlement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the power of the prophets.\" Startling us, Ms Switch said. \"The Gods have smiled upon you all, and are giving us the second chance we had prayed for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think it's all that.\" Blushing, I said. \"I think it's just so new and fresh that everyone wants to be a part of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps...\" smiling, Ms Switch said. \"We all have our own beliefs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all shared a nervous giggle after Ms Switch had walked on, before I noticed that Lauren was drawing something in a notebook with her hands shaking. \"What do you have there?\" Curious, I asked. \"A design keeping you awake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, yes.\" Wincing, Lauren replied. She sighed. \"I have this uncomfortable feeling that, if I don't draw this, it will hurt us all down the road.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat caught my attention. \"I had that same feeling about the Gaian music.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had the same feeling about the Gaian world.\" Gulping, Pat said. \"Sarah and I are working together to make a globe of the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this the same with the rest of you?\" Worried, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others nodded. Apparently, the movement was affecting us, as well...<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

They looked like blueprints to a complex machine that, to my surprise, I understood perfectly. \"Accelerated Artificial Photosynthesis.\" Calmly, I said. \"It's basically a large mechanical plant that takes in carbon dioxide, light, and water  then quickly turns it into energy and oxygen.\" I smiled, staring at the blueprints. \"It can literally power itself once it gets started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You understand all of this?\" Shocked, Lauren asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand it better than the songs and art work flooding my mind at night.\" Shaking my head, I replied. \"Technology is more my thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren smiled. \"Art and music is mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on...\" Curious, Pat said. \"Do you think the Gaians invented that to try to save their world?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They did.\" Sadly, Brooklynne said. \"Only it was too little, too late...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only it's not too late for us.\" Softly, Sarah said. \"Do you think we can get that gizmo built and running, with everything else going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head. \"We would need hundreds of these units to do any good.\" Serious, I replied. \"Besides, I doubt any of us are qualified to build anything this advanced.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incoming...\" Frowning, Pat said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to see one of the substitute teachers, Mr Smith, approaching the table. He saw Lauren drawing something on paper and curiously looked over her shoulder. \"I didn't know you were into technology, Lauren.\" Surprised, he said. \"I have a degree in mechanical engineering, do you mind if I have a look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren and I both shrugged and moved to give Mr Smith a better view. Only we both held on to the paper, to ensure he didn't take it. \"It's just something that had been floating around in my head for a while.\" Honestly, Lauren said. \"Technology is more Cassie's comfort zone, so she had been helping me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is incredible.\" Showing genuine interest, Mr Smith said. \"Are you planning to use this in your little production?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were considering it.\" Serious, I replied. \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This might actually work in real life.\" Serious, Mr Smith said. \"I am impressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren blushed at that. \"Um... thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not really a teacher, are you?\" Wincing, Darla asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr Smith sighed. \"I do have the degrees to be a teacher, but that is not my true profession, no,\" softly, he admitted. \"May I sit down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough we were all slightly annoyed and disturbed that Mr Smith wasn't a real teacher, we made room for him to join us. \"Who are you really, then?\" Frowning, Brooklynne demanded. \"Also, why shouldn't we report you to the school board?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, it would be your word against ours, so good luck with that.\" Calmly, Mr. Smith replied. \"Second, my colleagues and I are scientists under the hire of the Grimm Oil Company.\" He raised his hand. \"Before you even ask, we had nothing to do with the so-called attorney who disrupted your rehearsals. This was Maximilian Grimm's ploy to slow down the production.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's the CEO of Grimm Oil.\" Serious, Nicole said. \"A multibillionaire and advocate for the rich and powerful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why come after us?\" Curious, Pat asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If anyone were really after you, less subtle means would have been applied.\" Serious, Mr Smith said. \"The save Earth movement was picking up steam long before you kids came up with this play, but your production has given that movement vast momentum in a very short time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess.\" Frowning, Brooklynne said. \"Saving the Earth is bad for business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grimm Oil, and other companies around the world, are struggling to come up with alternative fuel supplies that meet the existing demands.\" Serious, Mr Smith explained. \"However, new technology takes time and a lot of money... scientists do not come cheap.\" He then smiled. \"However, this device promises to buy that time and money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you suggesting?\" Curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agree to a private meeting with us.\" Serious, Mr Smith said. \"Perhaps we can get a working prototype of this device built.\" He shrugged. \"What do you have to lose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to the others, who seemed just as surprised and skeptical as I was,...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The play hits the big stage in less than a month.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will be there.\" Calmly, Grimm said. \"Until then... goodbye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon ending the call, I relayed what was said to the others. \"I don't know about you, but I get the feeling he's not telling us everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's usually how it goes with agreements over the telephone.\" Serious, Ms Switch said. \"Neither party knows who is listening in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's right.\" Serious, Mr Smith said. \"It was wise of you not to put all of your cards onto the table over the phone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is your position in all of this, Mr Smith?\" Firmly, Ms Switch demanded. \"Why were you and your associates sent here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr Smith turned to her, surprised, to which Brooklynne said, \"No one cane keep a secret from Ms Switch for long, she always figures it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr Smith shrugged. \"To learn more about the production, and how it is influencing everything in this town so quickly.\" Calmly, he replied. \"Based upon its success in this school, it could easily become a worldwide phenomenon soon after hitting the big stage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy friends and I turned to each other, shocked and surprised. We had not even considered that, but, with how our play is affecting our small town, it seemed very possible. Mr Smith smiled at our expressions. \"I take it you had not thought that far ahead yet.\" Calmly, he said. \"You kids really have something special here, and a lot of people will soon want to be a part of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or want it not to move forward.\" Frowning, Lauren said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr Smith nodded. \"It's possible.\" Serious, he replied. \"There are a lot of big companies who would lose billions if clean air and water restrictions become tighter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But they are hurting our planet with the way they are doing things now.\" Wincing, Pat said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr Smith nodded. \"I agree, but there is a quote: 'When a pickpocket enters a church, he does not see the worshipers or the priest, he only sees their pockets.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So when these big companies pollute our planet, they do not see the damage, they only see the money they are making.\" Frowning, Ms Switch said. \"History repeats...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of us nodded, leaving Mr Smith confused, until we all softly sang the villain song of the play, 'Don't Abandon Us'...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe\u2019ve paid the price, the sky it burns<br>\r\nWhen time runs out it affects us all<br>\r\nThe world is dead though it keeps on turning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsed to deny, it seemed so bold<br>\r\nAll claimed innocence<br>\r\nWe all pay the toll<br>\r\nWe must leave our world<br>\r\nBut where are we going?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end<br>\r\nYou\u2019d expect us to learn from mistakes<br>\r\nHistory repeats and<br>\r\nIn the end there\u2019s really no one to blame<br>\r\nCome on\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon\u2019t abandon us!<br>\r\nWe\u2019ve been through enough<br>\r\nWe all must leave paradise!<br>\r\nThis is all that\u2019s left<br>\r\nThis is all we\u2019ve got<br>\r\nWe all must leave paradise!<br>\r\nWe can\u2019t save them all<br>\r\nAnd it\u2019s tearing us all apart<br>\r\nWe all must leave paradise!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s them or us, you or I<br>\r\nThe time has come to take command<br>\r\nPanic consumes us all<br>\r\nThough the world keeps turning<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHistory repeats, karma strikes<br>\r\nNo lessons to learn, we paid the price<br>\r\nWe\u2019ve doomed our world though it keeps on turning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon\u2019t abandon us!<br>\r\nWe\u2019ve been through enough<br>\r\nWe all must leave paradise!<br>\r\nThis is all that\u2019s left<br>\r\nThis is all we\u2019ve got<br>\r\nWe all must leave paradise<br>\r\nWe can\u2019t save them all<br>\r\nAnd it\u2019s tearing us all apart<br>\r\nWe all must leave paradise!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we were done, Mr Smith was wiping at tears under his glasses. \"That was beautiful and tragic.\" softly, he said. \"Not to mention so true, when it comes to our world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the message we are trying to send out.\" serious, I said. \"If we do not act now, this play could become a reality.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Smith nodded. \"What do you need us to do?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We gave it our all to put on a good show, hoping to get the oil tycoon in a good mood for the meeting. The four scientists were there as well, with a tall, thin man in a suit, with short brown hair and green eyes behind gold-rimmed glasses. I could only guess he was Grimm's attorney. Among them were all of our parents, including Sarah's mother. After the play, there was not a single dry eye among the scientists, parents, or the presumed attorney, but Mr Grimm remained neutral as stone, his expression revealing nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You play is a bit apocalyptic, almost biblical in its message.\" Calmly, Grimm said. \"Although I must admit it is very well put together, I cannot endorse this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are not looking for your endorsement, nor do we need any permission from you to perform our play on Playhouse Square.\" serious, Pop said. \"We are here to discuss your apparent opposition to the play going on stage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said over the telephone, I am not interested in the children themselves, or their play.\" Calmly, Grimm said. \"I am more interested in the play's impact upon the population.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis attorney sighed. \"Jay Higgins, company attorney,\" he said. \"Imagine if this play moves the population to demand stricter regulations on air and water purity. The powers that make our laws will be moved to comply.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will cost all oil and manufacturing companies billions.\" Frowning, Grimm said. \"Now, I know you see us as billionaires, more interested in making money than the health of our planet, but understand the demands of our customers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Without oil or manufacturing , the world will almost literally slow to a halt.\" Serious, Jay said. \"The demand for both is too great to just stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have a solution for that, actually.\" Calmly, I said. \"Lauren came up with the idea, and I helped her with the design.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimm raised a single eyebrow. \"I assume this is what you had to offer me.\" Calmly, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These kids are quite brilliant, Mr. Grimm.\" Calmly, Mr Smith said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimm grunted as Lauren and I showed him the blueprints we had drawn together over the course of the night. It took less time that we had feared, and we were able to sleep well before the play. \"Accelerated Artificial Photosynthesis.\" Reading the title, Grim said. \"Interesting...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over the blueprints with Jay, who seemed impressed. \"This is very complex, well beyond any normal teenage girl.\" Softly, Grimm said. \"It would seem we are dealing with a group of prodigies, Mr Higgins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We try to be humble.\" Serious, Brooklynne said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They could make a fine addition to our company, Mr. Grimm.\" Calmly, Jay said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My partner, Mr Creed, might agree with that.\" Calmly, Grimm said. \"However, I do not share that optimistic enthusiasm.\" he sighed. \"This device, as brilliant as it is, will completely replace any need for oil for generations, it will ruin me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The patents alone are worth billions, Mr Grimm.\" Serious, Mr Smith argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not own the patents!\" Angrily, Grimm yelled. \"This play, this invention, will completely destroy everything I have built!\" He stood up, fuming. \"One day, in the far future, oil and gas will be replaced with alternative fuels, but I will not allow it to happen while I am at the height of my wealth!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pickpockets in a church...\" Whispering carefully, Pop said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are very sorry you feel that way, Mr. Grimm.\" Standing up, Mr Smith said. \"We cannot, in good conscience, continue working for your company... we resign, effective immediately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are things worth more than money, Mr. Grimm.\" Calmly, Pat said. \"You stand to make trillions with this device we are offering.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That, and, with this device, you could become a world-renowned hero.\" Serious, Sarah replied. \"Money comes and goes, but legends never die.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr Grimm paused, only for a second. \"You are telling me that history will judge me for this day.\" Coldly, he said. \"That might be true, but I live in the here and now.\" He shook his head. \"I will buy out every last seat in every last performance, no one will see this play.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are a bit too late for that.\" Smiling, Nicole said. \"My parents made certain to advertise the dates of the performances, and they sold out within hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You stand to make more working with us than against us, Mr. Grimm.\" Serious, Brooklynne said. \"Please reconsider this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough...\" Through gritted teeth, Grimm said. \"I will do whatever it takes to bring this production down, and as for that device...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's already patented.\" Frowning, Ms Switch said. \"You were given the chance to cash in on this with us, and it's still open, as long as you stay and listen to reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr Grimm huffed and stormed out of the auditorium, with his attorney hesitantly following. \"Why can't he see that this helps everyone, including him?\" Wincing, Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's blinded by his wealth and pride, dear.\" Gently, her mom said. \"The love of money is the root of all evils, and the more money one has, the deeper the roots of evil can get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, he can't stop the play... can he?\" Worried, Pat asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will have an extra set of eyes on your side.\" Serious, Mr. Smith said. We were all shocked to see his eyes turn a bright blue before returning to their normal hazel color. \"We are, sadly, the villains your play spoke of. Only, unlike Grimm, we have learned our lesson...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The new Gaians were still there, but in the form of hall monitors, due to the open threats by the oil tycoon, Mr Grimm. I had told Pop of the meeting the night before. His words stuck with me as I sat down to lunch...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Powerful men like Max Grimm will stop at nothing to remove whatever lies within his path to further riches and power.\" Serious, Pop told me. \"However, Grimm is currently under the microscope of the federal government, he will not do anything that would directly tie him to any serious crime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can we do?\" worried, I asked. \"We are no threat to him...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The powerful message your play delivers is a threat to his status quo.\" Calmly, Pop said. \"He is blind to the damage he is causing, due to the money he is making.\" He surprised me with a gentle smile. \"As for what you can do, just press on... I and the other parents will be holding a meeting to discuss our options for fighting back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning my mind to the present, I turned to Sarah. \"Did your father say anything to you when you told him about the meeting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah shrugged. \"Just that all the riches of the world are nothing compared to the Grace of God, and that he would be talking to the other parents about preparing for a storm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dad said something similar.\" Serious, Nicole said. \"He told us that we have the power of youth and change on our side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dad was furious when I told him about the meeting.\" Serious, Brooklynne said. \"He told me that Grimm is not the only tycoon at the table, and that he would look into his threats against us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one, all of my friends informed me that their parents reacted in a similar way to Pop, and that they were going to discuss their options to fight back. \"It's incredible.\" Smiling, I said. \"Our parents have untied behind us and our message.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day went smoothly, and I was feeling good about our chances, until we entered the auditorium for rehearsals. Every last prop was destroyed, every costume was torn to shreds, every scenery panel was destroyed with splashed paint... everything we worked so hard to build for the play was ruined. For a moment, we just stood there with our mouths open in shock, before both Brooklynne and Darla knotted their jaws with anger in their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So they want to play, do they?\" Angry, Darla asked. \"Okay...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're not stopping us that easily!\" Furious, Brooklynne added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you have in mind?\" Wincing, Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We used to do this all the time to others who stood in our way.\" Serious, Brooklynne said. \"That said, we always prepared ourselves for retaliation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched in amazement as Darla turned to her cellphone. \"Mom, they did just as we had suspected.\" Calmly, she said. \"Does Uncle Frank have the backup scenery ready?\" She smiled. \"Great, we will need them delivered ASAP.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooklynne turned to her own cellphone. \"Rose, someone just destroyed all of our props and costumes, do you have the backups ready?\" She smiled. \"Great... yes, you have exclusive rights to sell them to the public as promised. Call High End and tell them to have the wigs we need ready within the hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a cue from the others, Lauren called her father. \"Dad, they destroyed all of the musical instruments, as you suspected.\" Tearfully, she said. \"Did you have the time to make new ones?\" she smiled. \"You are amazing, Dad! We need them at the school as soon as you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know your father made musical instruments.\" Surprised, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren giggled. \"Neither did I.\" Bemused, she said. \"It's apparently a hobby of his to make strange and unusual musical instruments.\" She smiled. \"He told me that there just might be a market for the instruments once the production hits the big stage.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAfter hanging up with her mother, Darla turned to me, smiling. \"My Uncle Frank has become like a second father to me, like Pop is to you.\" Tears forming, she said. \"He is a masterful artist who makes scenery for Broadway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rose was more than happy to make professional costumes for our production, in exchange for exclusive rights to sell them to the public.\" Grinning, Brooklynne said. \"Likewise with High End for the rights to the hairstyles and wigs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clear away the old and get ready for the new.\" Startling us, Pop said. \"Your next rehearsals will be better than ever. The new props, costumes and scenery are on their way as we speak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all cheered while, in the back of the auditorium, Grimm's attorney, Jay, watched with a frown on his face. He turned to a cellphone. \"Vandalism will not slow them down, sir.\" Disappointed, he said. \"The children have the means to replace everything in quick order.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimm's dark voice echoed over the phone. \"Then we will have to rely on less subtle methods...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Jay could react, Mr Smith took the phone from him. \"We know you are behind the vandalism, Grimm.\" Coldly, he said. \"Do not interfere any further, you are not the only player with wealth and power at the table.\" He then returned the cellphone to Jay. \"We have video proof you vandalized the school, and the police are here to question you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJay sighed. \"Taking me out of the picture will not stop Mr. Grimm.\" Coldly, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr Smith shook his head. \"No, it won't.\" Darkly, he agreed.  \"However, he now knows we are on to him, and that strengthens our hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Jay was taken into the custody of the police. \"History repeats, karma strikes.\" softly, he muttered. \"No lessons to learn, we paid the price... We must all leave paradise.\" he shook his head. \"To think I was once like that monster, Max Grimm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to quietly sob as he watched us rebuild everything for our production.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Halfway through my first song, a trapdoor opened up, almost directly beneath my feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah came to me first. \"Another inch,\" she said, \"and you would be down there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was trying not to think about that,\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think it's just a coincidence?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head. \"Max Grimm's attempts to stop us have failed bitterly, and he's getting desperate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trapdoors opened a few more times, nearly taking out five of us. \"I knew Grimm was desperate,\" Pat said, \"but I never thought he'd sign off on nearly causing a miscarriage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He sees us as a threat to his profits,\" I replied. \"He loves his money more than we love our babies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven so, we were all horrified by what came next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was in the middle of her song and dance number when a spotlight began to sway. Mr. White pushed her away, but none of us could do anything when the spotlight fell right on top of him.</span></div></div>",

She swung from its rail to the next catwalk up, where the mysterious figure was, and blocked his path! The man swung what looked like a knife, only Ms Switch blocked it, before delivering a crushing blow to the man's jaw. The punch sent the man reeling, but Ms Switch was not done. She kicked him in the knee, then threw him over the catwalk railing, where one of the scientists caught him and threw him over the seats onto the stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all had the beaten man surrounded in the next breath.

Had the guy not jumped in, the spotlight would have landed right next to the kid...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Switch easily lifted the man with one hand, anger in her eyes. \"I will ask you one last time.\" Darkly, coldly, she said. \"Who paid you to attack us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...\" Tears forming, the man said. \"I was mailed a package with payment in advance and the description of the job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Switch sighed then turned to Mr Smith. \"Torque peek ta meh yap.\" Softly, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr Smith nodded, then dragged the now frightened man out of the auditorium. Once they were gone, I asked, \"What did you say to him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told him in our language to pay him to keep quiet.\" Serious, Ms Switch said. \"The man told us that he performs a task for money, so logic suggests that, if we pay him more, he will ignore the orders of the one who originally hired him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you're right.\" Wincing, I said. I looked around, only to find Pat was no where in sight. \"Where is Pat?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI called Pat's name and heard her scream.

It had become more than a just a play or a movement, Gaia had become a phenomenon among 'Save the Earth' advocates all over the world. Lin smiled at us as we stepped out of the dressing rooms, ready for the first act we had called 'Too Late Realization'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is it, people.\" Serious, Lin said. \"Everything you have all worked so hard for is about to come full circle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More than you realize.\" Carefully, Ms Switch whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all smiled at that, to which Lin merely shrugged. \"I'm going to give a short speech before the performance, so sit tight for a moment.\" Smiling, he said. \"I want this production to get the proper introduction, so to send our message loud and clear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he marched out onto the stage. Curious, I peeked out from stage right and found the theater completely packed. I had never before seen so many people in one place. it sent my excitement and nervousness to a whole new level. Brooklynne looked out at the audience and smiled. \"Take my advice.\" Kindly, she whispered. \"Do not look at the audience, look beyond them to the entire world, as that is who our message is aimed at.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded, smiling. \"Thanks...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Industrial Revolution began in 1760.\" Serious, Lin began. \"This was also when we humans began to seriously pollute our precious planet.\" He frowned. \" The domestic petroleum industry began in 1859, with a well drilled just 69.5 feet deep. This forever changed America's economy, standard of living, and culture, with the rest of the world soon following.\" Lin sighed and walked away from the podium. \"Ladies and gentlemen, it has only taken us roughly one hundred and sixty years to destabilize what took billions of years to create. Gaia is a deep look into what we may face if we do not change our ways, and soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he walked off the stage, with a stage hand taking away the podium. As Lin passed us, he whispered, \"They're all yours, kids... break a leg.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe nodded, not only moved by Lin's speech, but determined to get our message across to the entire world. The opening music began to play and we walked onto the stage with the audience greeting us with an applause. Once all was quiet, we began our production, with Mr Dietrich playing a rich oil tycoon in his office, singing 'It's Too Late' with other actors playing the roles of his yes men...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey say it's too late!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe've ignored the warnings for far too long<br>\r\nThe realization has panic all around<br>\r\nWe prepared for things to go awry<br>\r\nBut now we've set fire to the sky<br>\r\nHere they come, the mob with rage in their eyes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey say it's too late!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe've burned our bridges and crossed the line<br>\r\nSealed our fate, claiming all is fine...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo we need to save the world before there is no way back<br>\r\nOne disaster at a time, we can make a backwards track<br>\r\nYou know we lose time waiting for someone to start<br>\r\nLets all work together with all of our hearts!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not too late though time is quickly running out!<br>\r\nWe're all going to change how we do things<br>\r\nGaia will be reborn like a phoenix...!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the production went on without a single hitch before I played the ending with the song, 'Little Baby'...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle baby, please understand<br>\r\nI won't be there for you<br>\r\nWhen you become a man<br>\r\nThis generation may be the last, we fear<br>\r\nUnless we reach another world so near<br>\r\nWe need them so... hear our woe...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTake these broken dreams<br>\r\nAnd lift our hopes up again<br>\r\nOf a life lived so free<br>\r\nWhen we hear the angels sing<br>\r\nWe'll know Earth has opened up their arms<br>\r\nAnd let us in<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle baby, a kiss goodbye<br>\r\nI must leave to right the wrongs<br>\r\nTo give you a better life<br>\r\nLittle baby, it's all we have to hold<br>\r\nA desperate plan to save our race<br>\r\nSo pray for the brave and bold<br>\r\nWe rely on them so...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTake these broken dreams<br>\r\nAnd lift our hopes up again<br>\r\nFrom extinction, we'll be free<br>\r\nAnd when we hear the angels sing<br>\r\nWe'll know Earth has opened up their arms<br>\r\nAnd let us in...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to all, Maximilian Grimm watched the production from a high booth, with a .44 rifle with a silencer attached at the ready, waiting for just the right moment. As I sang the final verse of the last song, Grimm took careful aim at me. Only I did not realize he was not aiming for me, but my unborn child. \"This will stop you from ever singing again...\" Coldly, he whispered. He took a breath and pulled the trigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom stage left, Pop was watching me alone on the stage, and caught something out of the corner of his eye. He turned and saw the lights reflecting off of Grimm's scope. With no time to think, he charged out onto the stage. I turned, seeing him, and gasped, just as the rifle was fired...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I could not help but cry, seeing him there. \"That bullet was meant for me, Pop...\" Crying, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop smiled. \"You don't have a vital bone plate like I do.\" Softly, he said. \"It's like a shield of bone over a Gaian's heart and lungs, rather than separate bars of bones you would call a rib cage.\" He chuckled before wincing. \"It stopped the bullet, but it stings like a club-dog.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A what?\" confused, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's kind of like a sheep dog, but with a clubbed tail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPat winced before saying, \"Cassie said you are a Gaian... does that mean I'm....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop nodded. \"You are half-Gaian, which was how the others were able to change you.\" Calmly, he said. \"<i>Paht</i> in our language means Valor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The police caught Maximilian Grimm.\" Softly, I said. \"He will pay for his crimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop nodded. \"Of that, I am quite certain.\" Firmly but kindly, he said. \"All of the parents have notified their attorneys of the situation, and a class action lawsuit is in order, along with criminal charges we intend to press against him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPat began to cry. \"Pop,... you're going to be okay... right...?\" Her eyes glowed a bright blue, before returning to their original green color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this, Pop chuckled. \"Keep your emotions in check, Pat.\" Scolding slightly, he said. \"You still need to learn to control your natural talents.\" He then turned to me. \"That goes for you as well, young lady. \"You will be part Gaian, too, once your son is born.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your time is up, kids.\" Firmly but kindly, Mr Smith said. \"Pop will be back in action before the next performance, but we will have extra security set up, just in case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following morning, I looked at the headlines on the newspaper, it read...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Pulling out the <i>Playbill</i> for the show, she asked, \"Could I get your autographs?

Max Grimm was my business partner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What brings you here to see me, Mr. Creed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We would like to apologize for what happened,\" Mr. Creed said. \"Grimm's actions were taken without any knowledge from myself or the board of directors. In fact, I have been spending the week investigating the monies he was spending left and right. I woke up this morning to my attorney informing me that the board had unanimously voted to rename the company Creed Energy Solutions. If there's anything I can do, Mr. Pennant, just name it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's one thing,\" Lauren said, pulling out the plans for the AAP. \"Your predecessor was completely uninterested in this, said he built the company on oil, not alternative energy sources.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Creed took the plans. \"We're very much interested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There will be some familiar faces looking for jobs working on that,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's the four I'm thinking of,\" he replied, \"they're hired as soon as they come in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI put my hands over my womb. <i>It's happening, JD,</i> I thought. <i>Our dream, the Gaians' dream, is coming true.</i></span></div></div>",

Lauren and Sarah were going out with the Rafferty twins, Mike and Bill. They were going to see <i>Witch Academy</i>, a drama romance about a school that taught witches how to responsibly work magic.

Jimmy was taking Pat to meet his parents, and the same for the others. \"Good luck with Stan's parents, Darla.\" Grinning I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarla giggled. \"He's a little angel and I'm a little devil.\" Teasing, she replied. \"Opposites attract.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStan chuckled at that. \"My kind of girl...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all had a good laugh at that, and parted ways to finish our dates. Kevin drove me to his house, after calling Pop to tell him where we were going, and I came face to face with his parents, Joshua and Francis Stewart. \"Top of the evening to you, lassie.\" With a heavy Scottish accent, Mr Stewart said. \"I can see the apple does not fall far from the tree, my son has good taste.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed at that but giggled as Mrs Stewart lightly smacked him on the back of the head. \"Behave yourself in front of our guests.\" Scolding, she said. \"I did not slave over a hot stove for your pride or ego.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr Stewart tried to wince and pout, but I could tell he was chuckling underneath it... the two were no doubt still very much in love with each other.

She giggled slightly as the gel was spread onto her belly, then watched the monitor with curiosity as the probe was gently moved over the gel. A gasp escaped her lips before she teared up, blushing as she cooed at the monitor. Looking over her shoulder, I let out a short giggle... \"Twins!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, there were two tiny little ones inside Pat's womb. \"I'm having twin girls.\" Blushing, Pat whispered. \"Oy vey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations to you both, girls.\" Smiling, Kyrl said. \"Thus far, your children are perfectly healthy, as are you both.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you seen your child yet?\" Curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyrl blushed profusely before nodding. \"I have, with the help of Ms Switch.\" Softly, she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And... ?\" anxious, Pat asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyrl giggled. \"I'm having twins, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all shared a hug before Kyrl provided us with a number of pictures of our developing children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPat and I left the doctor's office, feeling more than elated as we proudly held pictures of our upcoming children. Pop noticed our good moods upon picking us up. \"I take it you received good news from Dr Foster?\" Smiling, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPat nodded. \"Cassie is having a baby boy, and I'm having twin girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop's jaw dropped slightly before he smiled. \"Seriously, Pat? Twins... ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPat nodded and showed him the pictures.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not only did we help the school in many ways, we helped the entire community, and all of our friends got dubbed our court. We would be dancing with our dates at the first and last song of the evening. Kevin showed up precisely on time, with Jimmy right behind him, both in dashing black tuxes. The two of them first greeted Mom and Pop before placing the corsages onto our wrists. \"Your chariot awaits, my lady.\" Bowing, Kevin said. \"Hear my soul speak. Of the very instant that I saw you, did my heart fly at your service.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed at that. \"You are such the romantic...\" softly, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy rolled his eyes, then bowed before Pat. \"You and I rock no other, Pat.\" Smiling, he said. \"Let's wake up this sleepy town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPat giggled. \"You sure know how to charm a lady...\" Smiling, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy shrugged. \"Shakespeare has been done to death.\" Honestly, he said. \"Talking from the heart carries more weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is not a competition, you two.\" Bemused, Mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop chuckled. \"With boys, everything is a competition.\" Smiling, he said. He then turned to the boys. \"I want my daughter and stepdaughter home no later than eleven. Is that clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin and Jimmy nodded before escorting us to two separate limousines that took us to the school prom. There, we were in for a surprise... What we were expecting to be a normal high school prom had become a media extravaganza. There were film crews everywhere. Kevin and I were bombarded by camera flashes and shouts from reporters. Fortunately, two security guards escorted Kevin and me into the school, with Jimmy and Pat right behind us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that all about?!\" Startled, I demanded once inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Switch walked up to Pat and me with a sigh. \"Literally every motion picture agency is fighting over rights to make a movie out of <i>Gaia</i>.\" Patiently, she explained. \"The media is all over it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I thought we gave all the rights to Lin.\" Confused, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not officially on paper, you haven't.\" Serious, Ms Switch said. \"He is here to talk to you about it, before any other company can get to you.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was pale, but not unhealthily so, with bloodshot eyes due to her holding them closed so tight during the delivery. In her arms were the two most adorable girls I had ever seen. They, too, were slightly pale, with blue Anime like eyes, slightly larger than normal, and a button nose like Pat. I cooed at them before turning to Pat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you holding up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPat smiled, releasing a sigh. \"I'm a half-alien boy, who became a girl, who gave birth to twin girls.\" In a dreamy voice, she said. \"I don't think anything will surprise me anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI giggled at that. \"It certainly changed our lives.\" Smiling, I said. \"All in all for the better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are the others?\" Curious, Pat asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waiting in line for their turn to see you and your angels.\" Motioning to the curtain, I replied. \"The good doctors don't want us to crowd you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPat smiled. \"Jimmy and I have decided to call them Grace and Faith.\" Softly, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It suits them.\" Smiling back, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're keeping me for a few days, to make certain I'm in good health.\" Sighing, Pat said. \"I'm not a fan of hospital food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laughed at that. \"Very few are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassie, your time is up.\" Politely, Mr Smith said. \"The others need their time to see the new mother, including your mother and stepfather.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, I nodded, then turned back to Pat. \"I'll be back later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you then.\" Nodding, Pat said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cooed at the twins as they yawned, almost in perfect unison, then left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others got their turn to see Pat and her twin babies, before leaving her to rest. The twins were taken to the hospital nursery to be looked after while she recovered. \"I hope my baby is just as beautiful.\" Gently rubbing her baby bump, Brooklynne said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hear, hear.\" Smiling, Lauren replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just the beginning of your adventures, girls.\" Smiling, Pop said. \"Raising children is not as easy as you might think.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When Pat first came home from the hospital, she carried Grace and Faith into the guest bedroom to nurse. After a few days of that, she got tired of it. Now, when it was time to nurse, she just opened her nursing top and nursing bra, and held Grace and Faith to her breasts like footballs. She did this whether she was alone or not, as two Mormon missionaries and the new deacon over at the Baptist church could attest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom,\" I asked, \"how can you tell false labor from the real thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom stopped what she was doing. \"How bad is the pain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about to reply when it hit. \"Goddamn!\" I yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have a winner,\" Pat said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom went to get my delivery bag, while Pat got on the phone. \"Kevin? Pat. Hope you didn't have plans, 'cause Cassie's in labor. See you there.\" Then she got the phone tree started to notify the rest of the Sisterhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn retrospect, it occurred to me that my language could serve as a barometer for how close I was to delivery. I was yelling \"Shit!\" by the time Kevin got to the hospital. And, as we went into the delivery room, I was accusing Kevin of practicing incest with his mother, if you know what I mean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's amazing how your attitudes change when you're in labor. Going into the delivery room, I was uncomfortable with so many strangers looking at my private parts. By the time I was fully dilated, I didn't even care when I pooped right in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI confess, I did tell Kevin that I never wanted to have sex with him again. The nurse just told him that she heard that all the time, and none of the mothers had meant it so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after I don't know how many hours, and nearly as many protests from me that I was spent, I felt my baby leave my body, followed shortly by his cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a boy,\" Dr. Foster said, even though we already knew that. She cleaned him up, then brought him to me, to look at and hold for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had my hair. He had my ears. But those big, brilliant blue eyes were 100% Gaian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" I said, \"you're the one who's been kicking me for months.\" I kissed his little head. \"Welcome to the world, Jonathan Donald Pennant.\"</span></div></div>",

It was not until much later that we learned it was an escape pod.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Pop crashed here.</i> Tearfully, I thought. <i>I wonder what led him to being in that escape pod so long ago.</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maybe it would be different if I had to deal with twins, but I was way too modest to just whip out my girls in front of my mother and stepfather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We saw Mia leaving as we came in,\" Pop said. \"Did she come to see you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. \"She brought a care package of some home cooking. Don't tell anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We won't,\" Mom promised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She... she also told me about how you and she first met.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop nodded. \"It's not that I never planned to tell you that story, Cassie. It's just, I didn't want to depress you while you were getting ready for this little guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded for him to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were coming to make our home here,\" he said. \"Only, our ship developed mechanical problems coming out of hyperspace. By the time we reached Earth, it was clear that those of us who could should get into the escape pods while it was still possible.\" His eyes began to glow. \"My parents had been injured, I remember. I think there was some kind of malfunction, and it caused my pod to eject prematurely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe turned. Ms. Switch had come to visit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your parents were hurt worse than they let on to you. They... they wanted to spare you the sight, the memory, of watching them die. So, they put you into the escape pod, and launched it. I know. I was there. I saw it as Kyrl and I got into our own pod.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four of us mourned for Pop's parents, and for the others who couldn't make it off the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" Ms. Switch said, \"let's pull ourselves together - and, the three of us, make our eyes a little less conspicuous - and remember that we're here to celebrate the happiest of occasions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI still wasn't used to my eyes doing that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The reason I came, Cassie,\" Ms. Switch said, \"is to let you know that congratulations and well wishes are flooding social media.\" She showed me her tablet. A picture of me and JD that Kevin had taken just after I got settled in here had pretty much broken the internet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you check my Facebook page for me, Mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom did as I asked. \"Yep. I've never seen so many likes. Oh, there's a message from Mr. Miranda. He wants to know if he can show this to some friends in New York.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell him to go ahead.\" I checked on JD. \"Looks like he's full. Give me a couple minutes, I'll make myself presentable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs one nurse took JD out, another nurse came in. \"If you three could step out,\" the second nurse said, \"Cassie's about to get a roommate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom, Pop, and Ms. Switch said goodbye for now, and my new roommate was brought in. \"Nice to see a familiar face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Lauren, along with Mike and her brand-new baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to see you, too. And who is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my daughter, Hope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled. \"Pop will like that.\"</span></div></div>",

I turned to Pat, who shrugged. \"Pop told me to put my present to you in the trunk last night for a surprise birthday party.\" Softly, she explained. \"I didn't expect this, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were all duped.\" Ruefully, Sarah said. \"My father told me the surprise party was going to be on holy ground.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. White smiled. \"To the Gaians, this is holy ground.\" Calmly, he explained. \"This is where their dying world was given its second chance, through the three virgin mothers and the transformed boy of their religion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren, Sarah, and I blushed, knowing we were those virgin mothers. Pat blushed as well, knowing she was the transformed boy, though she gave Mr. White a confused look, who merely shrugged before Mrs. White spoke. \"He and I had a long talk with Sarah, learning all about the Gaian religion.\" Kindly, she said. \"It would be a sin to allow the religion of an entire world to just die off and be forgotten.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all smiled at that, as Mr White spoke again. \"All that matters is the belief in a God and that, through Him, all fears and obstacles can be conquered.\" He then smiled. \"Now that I had my chance to give my sermon, let us celebrate the many victories of the Sisterhood!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone cheered, and the party went into full gear, starting with my presents from everyone. Lin gave me a copy of our play, <i>Gaia</i>, on DVD, along with my Tonys. \"These DVDs are selling like hotcakes.\" smiling, he said. \"I have a strong feeling the movie is going to break the internet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI giggled at that, as Pat gave me her present to me. It was a small globe of Gaia. \"Dr Foster and Ms Switch helped me piece it together.\" blushing, she said. \"It almost feels like home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI teared up, looking at the globe of seven great continents and six great seas. \"It does feel like home, in a way.\" Softly, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Mom and Pop, I got a journal with the words, 'From Gaia and back again' written in gold on the cover. \"It has our legacy written in the first several pages.\" Tearing up, Pop said. \"It is now up to you to fill in the rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gave both Mom and Pop a hug, with tears of joy. \"I'll write in it every day.\" Smiling, I promised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne present after the other was opened and appreciated. Every member of the Sisterhood was given their Tony, which we all decided to donate to the Stardust Hotel, to show guest that it was from there it all began. \"My business has boomed since <i>Gaia</i> hit the Playhouse Square.\" Blushing, Mr. Stewart said. \"This will bring even more guests.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we will have to expand sooner than we thought.\" Smiling, Mrs. Stewart said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin chuckled. \"I know what I'll be doing this summer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense!\" Serious, Mr. Stewart said. \"Your place is at your lover's side.\" He smiled seeing both Kevin and me blush. \"Besides, we already have it covered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't suppose the Sisterhood has any ideas to fix our rivers, lakes, and oceans...\" Hopeful, Mr. Creed said. \"Just asking...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren and I shared a grin. \"As a matter of fact, we do...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maybe someday, somebody will develop a more baby-friendly method of intercontinental travel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur first stop was Paris. Paris was every bit as beautiful as I'd heard. Remember when I said I didn't know anything about the Eiffel Tower? Well, I do now, and it's this: You have to see it in person to really appreciate it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing we definitely appreciated was the attitude towards public breastfeeding. Back home, covering up was expected.

Instead, she embraced me, and said, \"It is true, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last part surprised me enough for me to say, \"I know. My son is proof.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she turned her attention to JD. \"He is so beautiful,\" she said. \"I hope my baby will look like him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your baby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded, and motioned to her friends. \"We are all having Gaian babies.\"</span></div></div>",

Yes, I heard all the jokes... this is my brother, now sister, Josette.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie and Josette both had long auburn hair. Marie was tall and well-built, while her sister was very short and frail. We all turned to Josette, who gave a shy wave and turned to Pat. \"Were you... a boy before this, like me?\" Softly, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPat blushed before nodding. \"You, too...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosette nodded back. \"I was halfway through transition when it happened.\" Blushing, she explained. \"I guess the strange hotel workers thought I was close enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hotel workers?\" Surprised, Lauren asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third girl nodded. She was short and slightly plump, with short black hair. \"I'm Rose Rossi. We had all ended up at the same hotel, the Star Gazer, for different reasons, and had to spend the night.\" Serious, she said.  \"Josette was the one who made the connection between our mysterious pregnancies and a strange blue light that had flown through all of our rooms while we slept.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pat made that same connection.\" Calmly, Mom said. \"Did you all search yourselves for a tracking device?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose gulped. \"Tracking... device...?\" startled, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed. \"Please turn around.\" Softly, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncertain, Rose turned around, and I checked the base of her skull. Sure enough, there was something that looked like a mole in the exact same spot. I gently ripped it off and showed her the tiny transmitting device. \"This was how they were tracking us, and how they are now tracking you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girls turned pale, raising their hands to their necks as if they had just learned they had cancer. Mom helped them, one at a time, to remove the devices and dropped them into a nearby drain, sending them far away. \"They should come to you now.\" Serious, she said. \"There, you can confront them, and get the answers you need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fourth girl sighed. She was of average height with long blond hair. \"The aliens... already came to us.\" Softly, she said. \"I'm Christina Romano, by the way. My friends call me Chris.\" She shook her head. \"Why would they... tag us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was to ensure their plan did not fail.\" Softly, Pop explained. \"I can assure you that move was highly controversial, and heavily protested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fifth girl turned to Pop, curious. She was tall and well-built, with shoulder-length brown hair. \"I'm Lena Russo... the aliens told you this?\" Softly, she demanded. \"The aliens who came to us said that their planet was dying, and that they had a desperate plan to save their race...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop allowed his eyes to glow blue before changing back to their natural color, stunning the other group of girls. \"I came here as a child when the plan was first being put together.\" Serious, he explained. \"I only learned of this after reviewing parchments that were recovered from my escape pod.\" He teared up. \"I was one of the only survivors out of a hundred Gaians, in a desperate journey to fly to Earth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria and her friends teared up, hearing that, before Josette suddenly lit up as if inspiration had struck her. \"Maybe we can make a play out of that.\" Serious, she suggested. \"Honor the Gaians who gave their lives, so that their desperate plan could be put into motion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is truly inspiring, Josette.\" Impressed, Maria said. \"We could call it <i>Gaia Deux</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop teared up more. \"I would be honored...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You may observe them if you wish, but you have no need to know where they are at all times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What means 'Sisterhood'?\" Marie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When we found out that we all were pregnant under the same circumstances,\" I explained, \"one of our mothers called us the Sisterhood of the Maternity Pants. It's a reference to a series of American novels aimed at teenage girls. The Sisterhood part stuck.

We drove off, waving and smiling at the crowd, before reeling over our all too easy escape from the Paparazzi. \"How did you know that would work?\" Curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop grinned. \"You'd be surprised how one can work a crowd to his favor.\" Calmly, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what now...?\" Worried, Josette asked. \"We don't have any songs, or dialog, or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped, seeing Lauren and me grinning. \"We have the songs, and Pop here was on the ship that paved the way home to Earth.\" Calmly, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was on that ship, too.\" Smiling, Ms Switch said. \"We have all of the songs, dialog, and ideas for props and musical instruments.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know Gaian history.\" Softly, Marie said. \"Only I'm really into philosophy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm into history, only I know all about Gaian philosophy.\" Wincing, Josette said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is so you will teach each other.\" Smiling, i said. \"I'm into gadget making, like Pop, but my head is filled with songs and artwork.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm into songs and artwork, but my head is filled with gadgetry and inventions, so we help each other piece things together, using what we both love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My head is filled with animals and insects of Gaia.\" With a shudder, Rose said. \"Only my love is really Astrology and Tarot card reading.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love animals and insects, but my head is filled with Astrology and Tarot card reading.\" Calmly, Lena said. \"Maybe we can work together and use some of what we love in the next musical.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see why not.\" Smiling, I said. \"We have been getting a lot of questions about Gaia since our play streamed world wide.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you, Chris?\" Curious, Pat asked. \"What fills your head?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris teared up. \"Nothing....\" Pouting, she said. \"Just strange sounds that I can't explain...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Switch smiled. \"You mean sounds like this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to make beautiful yet haunting sounds that almost resembled singing, but it was unlike any song we had ever heard. Chris's eyes widened in shock as she slowly nodded. \"What are those sounds...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs Switch teared up, smiling brightly. \"My dear, Chris, you had been blessed with the songs of the ancient Gaians.\" Softly, she explained. \"Earth folk would call them... Indians, Aborigine, Dogon, and so on.\" She wiped at her tears. \"I am among the last of those lost people, and I am blessed and honored that you are carrying on our legacy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris began to cry. \"I will not let you down, Ms Switch.\" Serious, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Switch gave Chris a warm hug. \"I know you won't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... where do we start?\" Curious, Josette asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop smiled. \"By telling you the tale...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Pop, tell us what you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only know what I do from the captain's logs, as I was very young when we took the journey.\" Calmly, Pop explained. \"Our scholars had determined that the ancient Gaians knew the only way to preserve their way of life was to branch out to other planets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most of their records had been destroyed over time, due to age, war, or arrogance.\" Sadly, Ms Switch added. \"We know that they had fled to several other planets, but the only record that had survived the test of time were tales of Earth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tales of Earth...?\" Curious, Josette asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop nodded. \"The ancient texts described Earth as a place to hide.\" Serious, he said. \"A world filed with a hostile populous still struggling with their own inner demons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Here there be tigers,'\" Softly, Pat said. \"It was what sailors had said when they had found a hostile place,... a cryptic warning to avoid going there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At first, we were hesitant to go to Earth.\" Sadly, Ms Switch said. \"The path to take us there was not clear, but the warning of its hostile inhabitants were.\" She sighed. \"Still, we were no better in our own past, so there was hope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our scholars pieced together what was left of the ancient texts to lay out the most likely course, but warned us that there were no guarantees.\" Calmly, Pop said. \"The Mayans may not have made it to Earth, and, if they had, they may not have survived long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Switch nodded. \"We left Gaia on faith alone, to pave the way to salvation. The journey was treacherous and long.\" She sighed. \"We had taken almost half of what was left of the fertile soil in our remaining living valley, so as to grow our own food for the journey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We had been out six months, traveling at ten times the speed of light, and still no sign or signal of Earth from what the ancient texts told us to look for.\" Sadly, Pop said. \"We were all beginning to lose hope...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, a young Earth girl sent out a simple message.\" Smiling, Mom said. \"'Hello from planet Earth... Is anyone out there?'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone cried and cheered, hearing that beautiful, wonderful voice from a small child.\" Tears flowing, Ms Switch said. \"We followed the signal, and found a wormhole that led us straight to the glorious blue planet of Earth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know about the signal from a little girl, Mom?\" Curious, I asked. \"Had Pop told you the story before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop smiled. \"Cassie, your mother was that little girl who sent the message.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy jaw dropped as Pop began to sing, with the other Gaians joining in...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>We have left our home<br>\r\nInto the dark unknown<br>\r\nWe're praying for a sign<br>\r\n'Cause we're lost and alone<br>\r\nIt's not over...

They wrote and performed the hit play, <i>Gaia</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An honor,\" Smiling, Ms Rugby said. \"Your play has sparked a new momentum to save the planet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just doing our small part.\" Blushing, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Rugby smiled. \"I came to ask how far along <i>Gaia Deux</i> is from the stage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're just getting started, actually.\" Wincing, Marie replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need time to make the costumes, build the props, and polish the songs.\" Calmly, Ms Switch said. \"That, and rehearsals...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I may be so bold, Pangaea Academy has an excellent drama club, with all the material and room needed to piece your play together.\" Softly, Ms Rugby said. \"If I recall, <i>Gaia</i> was produced in a high school as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pangaea Academy does have everything we need.\" Thoughtfully, Josette said. \"That, and it is summer vacation, so the school will be empty. We should be able to piece the play together without interruption.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone nodded, giving their approval, and I turned to Ms Rugby. \"I guess we accept your offer, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Rugby smiled. \"I'll let the school board know of your decision.\" Happy, she said. \"We will see you there tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... So how long is our vacation going to be?\" curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop smiled. \"Relax, I have already arranged for you to take online courses to finish the year, due to your newfound fame.\" Calmly, he said. \"We can stay in Europe for as long as it takes to help them complete their play.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That, and the school security staff did a marvelous job at keeping the paparazzi at bay. Still, news of <i>Gaia Deux</i> being produced at Pangaea Academy brought them a record number of applications for the following year. \"Popularity always bring a crowd.\" Bemused, Pop said. \"Fortunately, we have plenty of songs for this part of the story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed we do.\" Smiling, Ms Switch said. \"With some luck, these songs will touch the hearts of every nation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who do we have first for the auditions?\" curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie looked at the clipboard she was holding and sighed. \"Serafine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Switch nodded. \"Serafine, you are up to sing 'We Can Be Heroes'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerafine stepped up, holding a defiant look on her face, which annoyed both Marie and me, only I noticed that both Pop and Ms Switch raised an eyebrow. Only, to our surprise, her eyes briefly glowed a bright blue, before returning to their normal color as she muttered, \"I have to be the best... I have to be the best...\" under her breath. I knew Pop had seen this, too, as he raised his hand, calling for her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on a moment, young lady.\" Firmly but kindly, he said. \"Ms Rugby and I will have a brief word with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerafine opened her mouth to speak, but she stopped, her eyes growing wide, as Pop whispered something to her. She began to tremble as Pop calmly led her out of earshot with Ms Rugby. I could not hear what was being said but, knowing Pop, it was something close to a sermon. Within seconds, Serafine was crying into her hands, and Pop gently pulled her into a hug, slowly rocking her. \"What did he say to her?\" Worried, Marie asked. \"I mean, I know we are rivals, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He told her the truth.\" Softly, Ms Switch said. \"It seems that Serafine is your rival for a reason other than jealousy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop brought a trembling Serafine and stunned Ms Rugby back to the group. \"Marie, your rival, Serafine, was the victim of a hate crime.\" Firmly, Pop explained. \"She is on a crusade to protect those in her same predicament... Including you, Marie, only she thought she was alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What predicament...?\" Worried, Marie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is pregnant, but, like you, did not have sex.\" Softly, Ms Rugby replied. \"Word got out, and her life took a bad turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From what she was willing to tell me, she went through what you all did and more.\" Serious, Pop said. \"From being kicked out of her house to being beaten by her uncle, only she was willing to face it all alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are not alone!\" Bolting up, Kevin exclaimed. \"Not anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hear! Hear!\" Standing up, Jimmy added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone's eyes turned bright blue for a moment, then returned to their original color, showing their support. Serafine gasped, taking a step back, before Pop produced a mirror from a table. \"We are not Frenchmen or Americans.\" Calmly, he said. \"We are all Gaians here, that includes you... You are not alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears fell from Serafine's face, and she ran to Marie before wrapping her arms around her, crying onto her shoulder. After a moment, Marie slowly returning her embrace. \"<i>Bienvenue \u00e0 la Fraternit\u00e9,</i> Serafine... Welcome to the Sisterhood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, Serafine, still trembling but more collected, stood in front of the microphone and began to sing. As she did, we all joined in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>We came from far away<br>\r\nEarth is a breath away<br>\r\nIt could die any day<br>\r\nCame too far to fail today!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe need a plan<br>\r\nTo save the humans<br>\r\nAnyone got a plan?<br>\r\nGot to save Earth from its fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother planet torn!<br>\r\nConsumed by hate, creed and war!<br>\r\nThere is time, it's not too late!<br>\r\nPull them back from the brink...<br>\r\nSave this world from the mistakes we made<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe can be heroes! To save the day!<br>\r\nRedemption for our world we slayed!<br>\r\nWe can be heroes, give Earth new life<br>\r\nSave the humans in the nick of time!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the number was finished, Marie and I turned to each other, smiling. \"You're in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerafine gave the first genuine smile I had seen from her. \"<i>Merci</i>...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat smile then vanished as she saw two adults approaching. \"It's her parents...\" Whispering, Ms Rugby said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPop frowned. \"Are they now?\" Darkly, he demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your father is not about to challenge my parents, is he?\" Wincing, Serafine asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled. \"Just watch.\" calmly, I said. \"My stepdad is amazing...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maribel grudgingly participated, though she did give everything a hundred percent in her own way. She handled the dance choreography.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... No... NO!\" Hurrying onto the stage, she yelled. \"Look at your feet, Rose...

Everyone came to the stage in support of her, with Marie and me in the front. I was angry, outraged, that anyone, regardless of wealth, would treat their own child as a trophy or prized possession. Before I could stop myself, my eyes glowed a bright blue, before returning to their original color as I almost literally screamed, \"How dare you treat your own flesh and blood like a trophy to be paraded around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eyes of everyone around me glowed a bright blue in response to my outburst, to which the couple took a step back, shock on their faces. Only, instead of running or screaming back, their eyes glowed the same bright blue color before they both bowed their heads. \"Is that how you see us, daughter?\" Softly, her mother demanded. \"Parents who only care for you when it suits us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How else do you explain leaving me here year after year while you go who knows where, living life to its fullest?!\" Crying, Maribel demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe father sighed. \"The most precious resource, more valuable than all the gem stones of the world, are our children.\" Firmly, he said. \"They must be protected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, to our surprise, they both sang a short number... one which made Pop and Mrs Switch gasp, then cry as they sang along...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Songs sung throughout the ages<br>\r\nTruths locked in memory for you to find it<br>\r\nSongs live longer than any pages<br>\r\nReminders of what we left behind!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLocked deep inside the lyrics<br>\r\nYou struggle to see the story behind it<br>\r\nA vision of a world far away<br>\r\nA cry in the dark then all is silent!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain and again you listen intently<br>\r\nHoping, Praying to hear the message again...<br>\r\nYou hear the foreshadowing<br>\r\nThose in power still insist to be blinded<br>\r\nWith tears in our hearts, we fled away!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur world was beyond saving<br>\r\nAre they listening now? It's too late<br>\r\nWe must never break our home again<br>\r\nWe left to show the path to the light!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were all shocked, even stunned. Maribel's parents were Gaians... Pop stepped forward after the song had been sung, and began to speak in a language that sounded like a mixture of different Indian dialects. Maribel's parents responded in the same dialect, in a short exchange, before the mother crumpled to the floor, sobbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Bard and Belle Caron.\" Serious, Pop said. \"They are the descendants of the nomads who had left Gaia ages before us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't explain why...\" Wincing, Maribel began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those in power here are just as blind as those we had left on Gaia.\" Weeping, Mrs Caron said. \"We had feared what they would do to you if they ever discovered your alien origins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We had enough practice to keep our origins a secret, despite our wealth, but you would be discovered if kept too close to the spotlight.\" Sadly, Mr. Caron said. \"So we hid you away and kept you safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only in doing so, we have pushed our angel away...\" Still weeping, Mrs Caron said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The humans have a saying.\" Calmly Ms Switch said. \"It is never too late to be what you might have been.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaribel stepped forward. \"We are all Gaians here.\" Softly, she said. She offered her hand. \"Please join our family...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, hesitantly, Mrs Caron took Maribel's hand and they shared an emotional embrace, which Mr Caron soon joined with the rest of us. Gaians reunited after an eternity of being stars apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The stories you must have...\" After the embrace ended, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The stories <i>you</i> must have.\" Smiling, Mr Caron countered. \"We had thought we would never see our ancestors' home world until <i>Gaia</i> hit the theaters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're now working on <i>Gaia Deux</i>.\" smiling back, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr and Mrs Caron nodded. \"We will make certain it is played on the grandest stage.\" Mr Caron said. \"The Theatre de La Ville.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all turned to each other, smiling. <i>Gaia Deux</i> was closer to a reality.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I\u2019d been through several of them in the last few years, but this one seemed to be particularly thorough. \u201cNow that you mention it, Pop; I do remember having a physical exam with Dr. Foster.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cI didn\u2019t think much about it at the time; but I do remember having to be sedated for a portion of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI must\u2019ve been onto something there, because, suddenly, Cindy gasped.  \u201cOh my God!

I could use a distraction.\u201d Chuckling, Teresa said, \u201cI\u2019ll have to ask my mom, but I don\u2019t think she\u2019d mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat, I\u2019ll text you my address.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cSee you soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee you soon.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Hearing a flushing noise from the bathroom, I realized someone was in there.  Walking into the room, I saw Cindy standing in front of the toilet with her back to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking up behind her, i wrapped my arms around her waist and kissed her on the cheek.  \"I could get used to seeing you when I wake up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I appreciate the sentiment, but don't you think Cindy might get angry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Huh?</i> Cindy turned around to face me; revealing that I had in fact just kissed Teresa.  \"Oh my God!\" Blushing, I said, \"Teresa, I-I'm so sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay.\" Blushing, Teresa said, \"That was a nice, albeit slightly awkward, way to start the day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you seen Cindy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, she was gone when I woke up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, I wonder where...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could finish my sentence, I was interrupted by someone loudly banging on the front door.  This was quickly followed by someone yelling, \"Where's my daughter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeresa and I ran downstairs to see what was going on, as Cindy and Pat came running out of the kitchen.  I didn't have time to ask what was going on before Pop walked to the door and slowly opened it.  \"Can I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door pushed open to reveal Cindy's dad, who looked furious.  \"I want to know where my daughter is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding next to Pat, who was holding her hand in support, Cindy said, \"I-I'm right here, daddy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Pat and Cindy holding hands did nothing to dampen Mr. Roger's emotions.  In fact it had quite the opposite effect.  \"So you're the horny bastard who got my little girl pregnant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No sir, it's not what...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anyone of us could react, Mr. Rogers came over and punched Pat square in the nose.</span></div></div>",

Once we were back in my room, Cindy turned and gave me a kiss.  We kissed for a few moments, until I broke the kiss.  Looking at me, Cindy said, \u201cI knew Daddy was having trouble with me being pregnant; I-I just never realized he\u2019d go this far.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about that now, babe.\u201d As Cindy changed her shirt, I said, \u201cPop\u2019s going to do everything he can to keep you safe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you really think they\u2019ll let me stay here?\u201d turning to me, Cindy said, \u201cIt\u2019s not like Pop and your Mom are my legal guardians or anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter what your dad did to Pat, and tried to do to me, I\u2019m sure the courts won\u2019t have a problem making my folks your legal guardians.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWon\u2019t that make things, you know, weird for us?\u201d pausing, Cindy said, \u201cI mean, your folks would be the legal guardians of your girlfriend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf our relationship can survive both of us being pregnant, I think we can figure something out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving me a quick kiss, Cindy said, \u201cI love you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love you, too.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cNow let\u2019s go check on Teresa and Pat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of us walked down the hall, I heard voices coming from Pat\u2019s room.

I peeked inside to find Pat and Teresa sitting on the bed, their backs turned to us, as Pat was showing Teresa his comic book collection.  I was about to barge inside to tell Pat to stop bugging Teresa, when I heard her say, \u201cRemind me to show you my limited edition Marvel #1.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have Issue #1?  I\u2019m so jealous!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stepped back from the door when I realized the two were bonding over a surprising, mutual interest in comics.
