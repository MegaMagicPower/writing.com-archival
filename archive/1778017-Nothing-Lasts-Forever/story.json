Great grand-children.  Who'd have thought with the way he'd lived, old Alan would have lived to see that.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinner won't be long,\" Jane shouted from downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheers erupted from the living room as the home team got on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA faint happiness invaded his mind as he headed upstairs, clouding his vision.  He didn't notice the plastic dinosaur on the step, and his weak grip on the handrail couldn't keep his weight from shifting over the precipice.

He ran through straight away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found his grandfather lying at the foot of the stairs.  His eyes were open, and he had a slight smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeiran pushed his head.  It felt loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wake up Granpa\", he said.  When no response came, he started sucking his thumb and moved through to the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad!  Dad!\" he shouted over the chatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron looked over, and seeing the look on Keiran's face jumped out of his seat and made for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up son?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's something wrong with Granpa.  He won't wake up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not unusual, son.\" Aaron said, throwing a smile to the group behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.  Look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron moved into the hall, and froze for a second.  Autopilot kicked in, and he took Kieran through to the kitche.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jane...Jane.  Look after Kieran.   Dad's had an accident.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it bad?\"  Aaron's eyes told her everything she needed to know.  \"Did he see it?\" she whispered, nodding down to her son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knelt down and hegged her son.  \"Are you ok, sweetie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeiran shook his head and began to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron went back to the hallway, picked up the phone, and dialled emergency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter explaining to the woman, he grabbed a jacket from the hooks in the porch.  He closed his father's eyes, looked at him one last time, the draped the jacket over his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the hustle and bustle of clearing the house and the men in white coming to remove the body, Aaron locked up and headed home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour months later, Jane and Aaron were headed to Disneyland.  Kieran sat in the back, squirming with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was playing with a battered toy soldier.  It fell into the footwell, and Kieran unclipped his seatbelt to retrieve it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron wasn't concentrating, unused to driving on the wrong side of the road.  He turned left at a roundabout.  Despite the low speed of the crash, Keiran was catapulted through the windscreen.</span></div></div>",

When she did open them, the light blinded her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted her head off the dashboard and checked the back seat for her son.  Her breath quickened when she couldn't see him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nudged Aaron, trying to wake him up.  Blood trickled from his head, but she could see his chest rising and falling.  She fumbled with her seatbelt for a moment before it unclipped, freeing her from the seat.  She had to put her shoulder into the door to open it.  She looked in disbelief at the tangled mess of steel.  The van had hit them square, and the two had now formed one insepearable mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued on, looking for her son.  She found him on the tarmac, a creeping pool of blood growing around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard sirens, dimly, hardly real.  Like the image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved towards him, kneeling beside his broken form.  His breath touched lightly on her ear as she leant over him, and her breath released.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ambulance came, and Keiran was taken away with Aaron.  Jane rode with a policeman back to the hospital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had a neat brown mustache, and an eyebrow that mirrored it a few inches above.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou alright?\" he asked. His voice sounded like gravel in a grinder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm....fine.  Shaken up, headache.   But my son...do you think he'll be ok?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure he'll pull through,\" the officer replied, wiping sweat from his brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't lose him,\" Jane said, staring out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she arrived at the hospital, a young doctor with receding hair, spectacles and a sombre look ushered her into a private room.  It was homely, in a  clinical way.  Soft furnishings, curtains, picture.  All too precise, somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your husband is in a stable condition.  He is still unconscious but it appears to be under control.  We expect him to wake up in the next few hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And my son?\" Jane asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your son is alive, Mrs Jackson,\" the doctor began, \"but I have some rather bad news.  Perhaps you should sit down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down on the couch in a daze, running over terrible possibilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor sat down across from her, and cleared his throat.  \"Are you sure there isn't anyone you would like to have here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me now.\" Jane said, staring at the doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You son suffered multiple fractures to the limbs and torso in the crash.  His head was largely spared, and this is what has saved him so far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will he survive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is in a critical condition, however we expect he will recover.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane breathed a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, his spinal cord was severed just above the pelvis.  He is currently paralysed from the waist down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane vision greyed out, and she slumped back into the sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following years were a round of appointments, operations and physiotherapy.  Jane hoped daily for a miralce, but none came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeiran began with homeschool, until he developed enough control of his chair to attend the local primary.  He was a bright child, but struggled when he saw the other kids out at play.  He consoled himself by spending his day in the library, devouring information about his passion.  Planes.  He had only flown once, on the way to Disneyland many years before, but the hazy memory still clung to him.  His dream was to fly a plane one day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Keiran was approaching graduation, they made their usual monthly visit to the doctor.  The same young doctor who had met her after the crash sat across the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs Jackson, I have an exciting proposition for you and your son.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane's heart jumped.  She barely even dared to hope after so many years of disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your son has been selected for the trial of a new technique,\" he said.  \"The surgery is not without risks, but it offers your son a good chance at regaining sensation in his legs.  Maybe even walking again, in time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane froze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we talking about here?\"  Keiran asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It involves the use of your own stems cells to regrow the damaged parts of spinal cord.\"  The doctor coughed. \"Now, I know stem cell research may have issues for some people.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want it.  How soon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you are still a minor, we require permission from your parents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair turned to Jane and Aaron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.  This really is incredible news.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe operation was scheduled for two weeks later, and Jane held her son's hand all the way into the theatre.  She waited outside the hospital, pacing the slabs and breathing the cold November air.  Eventually she fell asleep in a chair in the waiting room, surrounded by the clamour of the damaged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe awoke to the yound doctor shaking her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs Jackson.  The operation went smoothly, and your son is now awake.  You can see him if you like, although he will still be rather groggy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane made her way up to the ward.  It felt like sleepwalking.  She saw her son laying on the bed at the end of the row, and ran over to him, holding his head in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, careful,\" he slurred.  \"I'm not superman, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo months later, and Keiran was making good progress.  Jane had stayed at the hospital, watching him taking supported steps.  Feeling his excitement at being able to move three of his toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter his physio, they returned to his ward before the next session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're doing so well, Keiran,\" Jane remarked, ruffling her son's hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Easy on the do, ma.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really am very proud.  Won't be long till you're running the hundred meters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey chatted for a while, and finally it came time for Jane to leave.  As pulled the door into the corridor, something twinged in her chest.  Sharp pains ran up and down her arm, and her vision greyed again, like it had when she found out Keiran was paralysed.  It faded further, then out to black.</span></div></div>",

His mother ran out a few moments later, crying<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYears passed, and Keiran's obsession with cars gew and grew.  He first sat on his father's lap and took the wheel at the age of 5.  From there, he progressed onto professional racing, and eventually became one of the finest Formula 1 drivers in history.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter six conscutive championship wins, Keiran was at the peak of his game.  Seemingly undefeatable, he was heading straight for his seventh.  Starting in pole position on a dry day at Monaco, it seemed another clear win was on the cards for Keiran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat day, things didn't quite go as planned.  He arrived late after his driver backed into into an irate mother of three on the way out of the lot.  His usual car was out of commission, so Courtney Sheldon, his up-and-coming teammate had to sacrifice his car, and his race, for the good of the team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeiran started well, and held a lead of over a second as he went into the thirty-third lap.  As he came out of the tunnel, he moved out to lap a lagging driver at the rear of the field.  He clipped the other driver's front wheel as he pulled back into the racing line and spun straight into the tire wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, everything seemed fine.  Keiran slapped the wheel in frustration, then tugged at his seatbelt.  It was jammed, pinning him in his seat.  Something stung his nostrils through the helmet.  Burning gasoline.  He began to panic.  His fingers fumbled hopelessly with the buckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scanned frantically for help.  Looking over toward the stands, he could see Courtney standing at the front of the throng.  He could feel the heat bulding beneath him.</span></div></div>",

Jane fixed him a sandwich, but he wouldn't come down from his room to get it.  Jane decided he just needed some quiet time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kieran grew, he grew more and more reclusive.  He never mixed too well with the other kids at school, always speaking of death and gruesome attacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane tried to reach him, but as he reached his teenage years their connection snapped.  Arguments over the smallest things were commonplace, and the tension in the house was palpable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, when Keiran was out, she went into his room.  She knew he would react if he caught her, but the curiousity overcame her.  Scrawled pentagrams adorned the walls, and candles dripped pools of wax all over the shelves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she moved into the room, she noticed something on the desk, partially obscured by a ring of candles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe inched closer, and realised what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small bird lay on the desk, with a scalpel next to it.  It's head was severed, and its chest has been opened up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gagged, and ran out of the room, crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane couldn't look at her son in the eyes after that.  He became openly hostile, bringing up anything he knew would scare or anger her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week later, they were passing on the landing at the top of the stairs.  Keiran grabbed her arm, and looked straight into her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you like my little experiment, Mum?\"   His eyes bored through her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what you mean,\" she replied, trying to pull away.  His grip was too tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The bird.  Isn't it beautiful?\"  A distant smile crossed his face.  \"I'm learning so much, you know.  So much.  I've realised things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.....I don't understand,\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This place....this...this is hell.  You know that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're scaring me, Keiran.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to help you, Mum.  I'm going to help you.\"  He laughed, a cold hollow sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began dragging her by her arm.  His strength was too much for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see Granpa, soon.  I won't be long.\"  Keiran gripped his mother by both arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't right, Keiran.  You can't do this.  I'm your mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeiran smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm helping you.  You'll see soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he let go of Jane.  She fell 25 steps, landing on the cold marble hall.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been a long day.  The worst dregs crawled out of the woodwork on Friday afternoons.  A drunken hobo had been the star of today's show.  He finished up throwing a can of super lager at the perspex barrier that protected the public servants from the public's wrath <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got out of the car anticipating the smell of a hot roast. He walked up the path hoping for a night of lazing, watching TV and reading the paper. He turned the knob thinking of a warm welcome from Jane, and a solemn grunt from Keiran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the door swung aside, he knew today nothing was to be as expected. Many years had passed since he settled into his routine, and now it was torn from him, leaving only a visceral emptiness behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe crouched beside the two bodies, praying for a sign of life. The stillness held for a moment, mocking him.  Then he heard a faint whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keiran...\" Jane croaked more than spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's right here.\" Aaron looked at his son's broken form.  \"Don't worry.  He'll be fine.  You'll both be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled his phone from his pocket and dialled those familiar numbers for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello...yes....I need an ambulance,\" his eyes flashed back to his family. \"As soon as possible.  They're really hurt.\" The last phrase lowered to a whisper.  \"55 Holly Tree Avenue.  Be quick, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hung up, and turned to look at Jane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes were different, empty.  He knew she was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSobs racked his body.  The world disappeared into a wall of grief.  He didn't hear the sirens.  He didn't react when the police broke the door in.  Only when they tried to pry him away from his family did he come to, screaming and swinging wild fists.  The paramedics sedated him, and the ambulance he called for his family found a different purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe awoke in the hospital, groggy and disoriented.  He saw took in the part of his family that stood around his bed, searching for something unseen, unknown.  It took him a while to remember the events that brought him there.  The memory burst like a dam, flooding his mind and leaking out through every facial orifice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took days for Aaron to speak again.  When he did, all he would ask was:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one could answer.  The coroner's report said blood spatters indicated they fell slightly apart, Jane first.  That was all they had.  He assumed they had been fighting, Jane lost balance, and Keiran either followed straight after, off balance, or couldn't live with the event and threw himself after his mother.  Accidental death, both counts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few weeks later, Aaron returned to his old house, and his old job.  His workmates could tell he never really came back, though.  Aaron was never a particularly happy man, dry wit carrying him through the working day.  The wit left with his family.  He seemed to be carrying on, unthinking, a lifeless shell repeating actions out of habit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside work, he went from a social drinker into a victim, submerging the grief and constant questions in a sea of hard liquor.  The official story never sat right with Aaron.  He knew there was more, and the agony of that tore him apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSix months after the accident, Aaron pulled into the carpark on a Monday morning, 7:00am prompt as usual.  The only thing unusual was the entrance he made.  Tyres screeching, the back end of the car slid out, clipping three other cars, including the manager's.  He stopped, popped the door, inspected the damage and walked into work, whistling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are....are you ok, Aaron?\" asked Nikki, the receptionist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely fine, my dear,\" said Aaron.  His arms swung vigorously, and his voice held a manic happiness.  \"Where is Mr Crocker?  I have something to tell him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....I uh....think he's in his office,\" she looked at Aaron, a familiar face, now changed into something entirely alien.  \"I'll call through, make sure he isn't busy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no.  He'll be happy to see me.\"  Aaron strolled towards the big office, oblivious to Nikki's cries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood in front of the door for a moment, admiring the elegant gold lettering picked out on the opaque glazed panel.  He wondered how many times he had dreamed of having that office.  Those dreams seemed like a different life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took hold of the handle, and turned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr Crocker was sitting on the phone.  His eyes snapped towards the sound as Aaron entered the room.  His face blazed in anger, but he held together, winding up the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes....quite....yes.  We'll discuss it next week.  Yes....you too.  Give Rebecca all my best.  Goodbye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe set the receiver down, then turned his attention to the intruder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To what do I owe this pleasure, Mr Chattle.\"  Aaron's passive joy reflected his piercing gaze.  \"I hope you realise that was a very important phone call you just cut short.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It certainly sounded vital,\" said Aaron, a twinkle in his eye.  \"I just wanted to let you know I won't be in today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr Crocker looked at Aaron in disbelief.  \"As far as I can tell, you are already here.  Unless you have access to technologies us mere mortals only dream of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron laughed.  \"Oh yes, sorry.  I meant I won't be working today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.  You look to be in rude health, and usually people telephone when they are ill.  Might I ask what your reason is for requiring leave today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm quitting.  I've got more important things to do, I'm afraid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?  Well that is quite a shock,\" Mr Crocker's sarcasm was blunted slightly, \"your contract requires four weeks notice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No....not enough time,\" said Aaron, his tone firm.  \"I have so much to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Mr Crocker spluttered. \"Well, you'll forfeit your last month's pay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAarons face contorted, his plan crumbling.  \"I need that money.  It's essential.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Work another month and it is all yours.  We can part on happy terms.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr Crocker's voice softened.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Aaron, I know you've had fimaily troubles, and it can be hard to adjust.   I'm terribly sorry for that.  You need this job, not just keep your roof.  Stewing doesn't help, you need to stay active.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron shook his head, disconcerted.  He moved over to look out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just can't forget it, you know?\" he said.  His voice sounded different, a lilting vagueness betraying its owner's distance.  \"It's too much, I just have to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down, four floors until steel met asphalt.  He backed away from the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, Chattel....\" Mr Crocker began. The look on Aaron's face cut him short.  He'd never seen a focus like that before. It seemed almost diabolical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....I have to know,\" he muttered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked back to the window, and dug his feet into the oak floor.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was right.  He'd never been so sure of anything before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr Crocker's surprise stopped his first thought from forming into words until a moment too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Toughened glass,\" he said, as Aaron bounced off the transparent barrier.  Aaron fell backwards, head impacting the floor.  A trickle of blood ran from his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just can't get the staff these days,\" Mr Crocker grumbled as he picked up the phone.  He dialled Nikki, and an ambulance was dispatched to collect Aaron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he awoke this time, it was to a different kind of hospital.  More homely, yet somehow more sinister.  He found no family at his bedside this time, only a stocky, bearded man with glasses perched on the tip of his nose.  He looked like a particularly scholarly dwarf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Mr Chattel,\" he began, \"or do you mind if I call you Aaron?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  Where...where am I?\" Aaron asked, struggling against the straps holding his arms and legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm terribly sorry about those,\" the Doctor continued. \"You were a little unruly when you arrived.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arrived where?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are in Fawkes Asylum,\" the doctor answered. \"You had a psychotic break.  We are treating you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron tensed against the straps, fighting the flood of memories. He heard a high-pitched scream, a horrifying sound. Then he realised he was the source.  Orderlies rushed in, and a cold prick on his arm signalled the beginning of the descent to darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonths passed, and Aaron's sessions failed to bring any progress. He retreated into himself. The doctor's questions were gradually overcome by other, more insistent voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron stayed in his room, refusing to leave even for meals. He stayed stock still on the bed, his mind gradually seperating from reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, the doctor entered for a session to find Aaron unresponsive. He was breathing, but his pupils were unreactive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rubbed his eyes, and stepped into the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nurse! Chattel's catatonic. Bring a gurney.\" He turned back to look at Aaron's blank eyes, the sorrow of failure creeping over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron's mind was far from blank, though.</span></div></div>",

The ground was slick with the rank moisture of decomposing leaves. He felt a scuttling on his hand, and raised it to see a large , golden beetle with green eyes open its wings and flutter away. He'd never seen a creature like it in his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe raised his head from the floor, looking around. There was no path, and no patches of light to guide him back to civilisation. He sat up, swiveling his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank Hiweh!\" came a hoarse cry from behind him. \"The gods are with us today, Rampling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA low bark was the only response. Aaron placed his hands gingerly on the ground and pushed himself to his feet. He turned, and was faced with only more tress.  Lowering his gaze, he found two small horns, like those of a young goat, attached to a helmet held together with rivets bigger than the hands which wrought them. Below that, two beady eyes lurked, barely creeping over an expansive fiery beard. His stubby hands held an axe larger than Aaron with nonchalant ease.  A rangy dog lurked nearby, eyeing Aaron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening, Master Cheatle,\" the dwarf began. \"I feared we would not find you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Find me? Again? What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your quest, Master,\" the dwarf said.  \u201cThe Tower of Lysis\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Tower of who, now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dwarf heaved a long suffering sigh.  \u201cConsidering it\u2019s your quest, you seem to have a tricky time remembering it.  Every time you wake up it\u2019s the same story.\u201d  He removed his helmet and sank to the floor, stretching his legs out.  \u201cThe Tower of Lysis lies to the east of here.  An obelisk of pure evil, by all accounts.  The elves say it was raised in times long past by an ancient power, in the hope of spreading its corruption throughout the land.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the strangest dream I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d Aaron said, pinching himself.  The dwarf, the dog, the trees and the carpet of slime all remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou say that every morning too,\u201d the dwarf said.  He looked anxiously around, scanning the shadows.  \u201cWould you mind if we continued this little discussion on the way?  This place is about as safe as a Bandersnatch on heat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron surveyed the scene around him, listening to the cracking of twigs and the low rumble that could have been the wind, or the deep breaths of predatory anticipation.  The dwarf had a point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I\u2019m going to be following you, I think I should really know your name, at least.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve forgotten that too?  Did you hit your head?\u201d The dwarf looked concerned, then his face softened, in as much as the weather-worn skin of a dwarf can.  \u201cI am Rok-tuh the Lofty, though you can call me Rok.\u201d He coughed before continuing, \u201cas you have been doing for several months now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd the dog is Rampling?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dwarf beamed. \u201cExcellent, you still have some memory, then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron thought better of reminding Rok he had already mentioned the dog\u2019s name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly a little.  Remind me again why we are heading for this Tower of Lychees?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLysis, Master. Lysis.\u201d  Rok pulled himself to his feet, checking his helmet for intruders before wedging it on his head.  \u201cYou mentioned a Queen? She\u2019s trapped up in the spire by a wicked warlock.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA Queen, huh?\u201d Aaron asked.  \u201cIs she a looker?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot a clue, Master.  She\u2019s your obsession. I\u2019ve never even heard of her, except through you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRough!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron turned to search for the sound.  Rampling\u2019s bony frame was he only thing moving.  He turned back to face ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s rough!\u201d came the voice again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Aaron asked Rok.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t mind him.  He thinks he\u2019s a comedian.\u201d  Rok turned to his pet.  \u201cDon\u2019t you start annoying Master Cheatle now,\u201d he said, wagging his index finger.  It looked like a chipolata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A talking dog, and a sarcastic one no less.  Just what I need.</i> Aaron thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe threesome made their way through the thick undergrowth, clothes and skin catching and tearing on vicious spines.  Several times Aaron paused for breath, and enquired as to the possibility of finding a path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach time Rok let out an incredulous laugh.  \u201cThis forest is not one for paths,\u201d he would say, casting his eyes around the darkness.  Despite its inhspitability, the forest never lay silent. Twigs snapped and leaves rusteld.  Howls rang out from time to time, some far, some close enough to make Aaron's whole body tense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter many hours of picking their way through the treacherous undergrowth, the trees began to thin.  Aaron was surprised, looking up, to see it was daylight.  Beams of harsh light carved through the branches, sending a cornucopia of forest dwellers scuttling for safety.   Ahead the bushes and leaves blended into bright green grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Illusian Fields!  A welcome sight!\" Rok said.  He glaned around his opressive surroundings, and quickened his pace. \"Especially after this place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron matched Rok's steps, then broke into a jog.  He could see the dew glistening in the sunlight.  He quickened to a sprint, leaving Rok behind.  Only Rampling kept pace, barking \"run! run!\" as he wove around the low bushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he approached the forest's edge, he could see the striking blue sky above, softened only by the occasional pillow of cloud. He could see the dew glistening in the gleaming sunlight.  He felt joy rising in his chest, unfamiliar after so long in the dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Aaron's feet passed from the carpet of leaves onto the dew-slicked grass he dove forward, whooping as he slid face first down the slope.  Rampling skipped around him, snapping at his clothes.  The slope eased, and Aaron stood up, soaking wet.  Ahead of him, acres of rolling meadow stretched out to the horizon.  The only landmark was a tall spire in the distance, casting a long shadow in the morning sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of clanking metal drew his attention back to the slope.  Rok's legs were struggling to keep up with his body, tumbling head over heels between every few steps.  He collected in a heap a few feet away from Aaron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You all right there?\" Aaron asked, controlling his laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite, quite.\" Rok picked his helmet from the grass and rammed it on his head.  He straightened his beard, and collected his axe.  \"It isn't a race, you know?\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron released a momentary chuckle.  \"Just as well too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRok grunted, and returned to straightening his armour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that the Tower?\"  Aaron asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perceptive lad.  I always said that about you.\" Rok said, starting towards the twisted spire. \"Not more than a few hours hike now, as the crow flies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron took a few long strides to close the gap between them, then settled in beside Rok, matching his pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked together, Aaron took in the wonder of his surroundings. Lush green fields spread out on all sides, dotted with pinpoints of yellow and white where tiny flowers sprung from  between the short blades of grass. Luminous butterflies flitted through the crisp clean air.  Every breath felt like it cleansed him from the inside out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This place is incredible.  It almost feels alive,\" he remarked to his travelling partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The most beautiful place in this whole sorry land.\" said Rok.  \"Appreciate it while you can.  That tower spews darkness.  It pollutes the land.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron took his advice, and fell silent for the rest of the journey.  Rampling skipped around them, snapping at the butterflies and rolling in the grass.  Rok huffed and puffed beside him, struggling <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>TO BE CONTINUED</b></span></div></div>",
