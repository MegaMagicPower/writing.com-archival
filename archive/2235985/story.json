            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the large massive school that is Grimwall Highschool, Alex Wells was walking through the school halls. He only been to this school for two weeks and he's still trying to get used to this school. He remembers how he first enter the school the first day, surprise to see it as a massive academy like area that one would easily mistaken for some kind of small college campus where even students like Alex can live in a building just outside the main school building itself, yet surprisingly is indeed a high school. he also heard how this school is a little difficult to get into, in that you either have to be great in some kind of academic study to get enroll, or have lots of money to pay a fee, that latter surprisingly having the lowest amount of students that went with that method compare to the rest. Alex was kind of that latter of the students that got here, mainly due to dumb luck on his parents being the ones that manages to get him enrolled into the classroom, so he really doesn't excelled in some academic activity, pretty average like most people. With that said, Alex does his best to get by with what he can at this school, whether by being part of class activity, avoiding certain students, talking to teachers or the principle for assistants, so far its been a rather regular school life to say the least for Alex. However, today that was going to change for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the middle of the afternoon, school still in session with students either going to their next class, leaving the classroom or going to lunch or break. Alex was leaving his classroom and about to head towards his lunch break, giving him about an hour before having to go to his next class. However, as he was walking down the hall where not too many students are walking at this time, he notices a door open that leads into the science room. Normally he would ignore it, thinking that the teacher is out for something, but just as he passes by the door, in  the corner of his eye, he spots something in the middle of the room, an odd remote that is flashing. He can't help but wonder if maybe the remote is maybe someone project, and yet, he peeks inside and sees no one inside the room. School regulation states that if anyone is doing experiment inside the science room, they must be present until the experiment is completely done or at least lock the door to make sure no one gets inside. No one is inside and the door isn't lock, so Alex couldn't help but wonder he was careless to leave the door open. Touching the handle, he sees why as the door handle is a little busted, so whoever tried to lock the door probably didn't notices the door open on its on when they left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to leave the door open, but also curious as to what the remote is, Alex decides to step inside the room, locking the door in the process. He walks towards the remote, examining it as he wonder what exactly it is. So far, the remote doesn't look too special compare to any other tv remote. There are buttons at the bottom half, a up and down arrow at the top with screen next to it that say 100% power. Alex picks the remote up and presses some button to see if the remote does anything, not thinking of the consequences of what might happen if the remote gets broken before whoever owns the remote comes back. He continues to press more button, soon pressing one of the arrows buttons, the down arrow, before one button flashes up red at the bottom. Alex, somewhat cautiously, presses the button, not anticipating what happens next. The remote glows a bit before shooting out a laser out from the front of it, causing Alex to jump a bit as the beam bounces off a nearby mirror and made its way directly back at Alex. Alex panics as he felt his body engulf in light, feeling a tingling sensation throughout his body, before the sensation ended, and he soon found himself in a new surround. Or int this case, a different view of his surrounding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What the?!\" Shock and awe, Alex finds himself still in the science room, but its now at a far more larger size than a second ago. Everything in the room is massive, the tables looming over like mountains, the lab equipment that can be seen far in the distant, the tiny cracks on the floor and walls that are very small for people to see, everything is gigantic. Alex panics as he turns his head and sees a massive metal silver like wall standing tall near him, which turns out to be nothing more than a dime laying flat. Alex couldn't believe his eyes, realizing that somehow, the remote he was messing with shrunk him to the size of a very tiny ant, about 1/10 of an inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex panics as he notices that he doesn't have the remote in his hands. He looks around, trying to figure out where it went. It then hits him that when he jump from seeing the laser beam getting shot out from the remote, he must have dropped it before the beam bounced back towards him. He looks around and soon sees a towering device that feels a as tall as a skyscraper in the distant, the remote laying on the floor. Right here, Alex couldn't believe the situation he is in now. He is shrunk to a very tiny size, and the remote is as tall as a skyscraper while laying flat. There was no way Alex could push the buttons on the remote to grow him back to normal size. He will need help somehow, maybe by someone outside the room or maybe the owner themselves, whoever they are.  The problem is that He will have to get their attention first, and at his size, there is no telling if he can get someone to recognize him to help him. Still, he needs to think of something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute of thinking....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alex decides that his best option, other then wait for who knows how long for the owner to return, would probably be that to try to get someone outside the room. Its going to be very risky, but at this point, Alex may have risk it to get back to normal, as he doesn't know if the owner of the remote will return at all in the next hour or someone else will come across the remote. It took him a while the trek across the floor, about ten minutes to be honest, before he finally made it to the door. He couldn't help but feel intimidated of its sheer size, making him worry how massive everyone outside will look like. With his tiny size, he is able to walk underneath the door space, and is soon greeted by the answer he is afraid to see as he was about to walk out the door, only to almost get slam by a massive rubber wall that slams right in front of him. Alex fell on his back as he panics of the sight, wonder what it was that almost crushed him. It didn't take him long to see the answer as all he had to look up, and is terrified on the spot, seeing that he is in fact starring at the rubber sole of someone's shoe. He only had to look up and see the owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHigh above him, was none other than Diana Grams herself, wearing a blue short sleeve blouse, loose jeans, and grey converse shoes. Diana was already a tall girl, but at Alex's new size, she is absurdly massive, practically dwarfing a mountain by the height up to her chest alone. Alex didn't know how to process all of this as the massive girl continues to walk forward, her foot slamming for what felt like a mile away, causing the ground to shake on the spot. Alex had a cold sweat on the back of his neck as he can't help but stare at Diana's size, scared of the idea of climbing her. Sadly for Alex, it isn't just Diana that is massive as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown the hallway, Alex can see other people, one of them being Becky, wearing a green shirt with a light yellow jacket, a white skirt that goes down to her knee, and brown boots. She seems to be focusing on reading a book as she always does, but she doesn't appears to be in a rush to go anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother person to walk by, and someone Alex is now extremely scare of her size far more than Diana, is Principle Ellanor. She seems to be wearing a black vest with a pocket on it, a red undershirt, a grey dress that goes to her shin and black mary janes. Alex was scare to see the principle at this size, as he already thought the principle as some mini giantess with her tall height and his small size, but at this point, she's making Diana looking like a better option to scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex doesn't know who he should get the attention of in this hallway right now, as the three people are all smart woman, which means surely one of them might be able to help Alex if he can get their attention. Only problem being that they all have a small trait that makes Alex very hesitant risk climbing any of them. Ellanor's sheer size to tower over the tallest person, Becky's fear of bugs that would make Alex nervous that he might get mistaken for one, the only one that seems promising to climb is Diana, but the major problem is that he doesn't know if she'll even bother to help him in the first place. For all Alex knows, she might use him as a lab rat or use the remote to perform experiments instead. Still, Alex has to think of something before any of the woman walk too far away that Alex can't have any chance of catching up.</span></div></div>",

He also doesn't want to waste staying in this room forever, waiting for whoever the person made the remote to come back, and that's if that person is the first to show up and not the teacher or some other student that doesn't recognizes the remote. However as he tries to debate, Alex notices something odd happening with the remote as he notices the top of it where the beam shot out earlier is starting to glow. He was confuse at first before panicking as he remembers what the remote glowing means from firing it a minute ago. The remote falling to the floor must have cause it to have a loose wire or something, so its probably got glitch into thinking someone pressed the buttons on it and wanting it to fire again. This is extremely bad for Alex as for all he knows, the remote might be program to shrink again, and Alex is at the center of its target. Alex tries to run as fast as he possible can away from the device's path, knowing the remote will fire any second now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the remote....</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">You are freshman student, Alex Wells, going to Grimwall High school, a school in town that is garner as a rather difficult school to get into, and a school that is just as difficult to stay in due to the grade requirement by the end of the semester. You heard that you must be either the top of some academics to stay in, or have some deep pocket to afford the cost of enrollment which thankfully is very few students. However, that will not matter to you as you go about your day in school, soon to end up in a predicament, with you ending up about 1/10th of a inch tall. Best you either find the right person in this school to either help you or survive as everyone goes about their day. Will you survive in the end, will you end up at the bottom of someone's shoe, or would you end up becoming far too small for anyone to spot you, only your choose will tell in the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharacters:<br>\r\nAlex Wells (You): About 15 years old, 5 ft 2 in, light skin and shaggy hair. A rather plain looking kid that most of the students ignore, mainly due to you really not having that much of high academic skills to speak of. You only got to this skill out of pure dumb luck thanks to your parents and that's it. This is your first year in Grimwall High school and only a few days in and you are in the adventure of your life as you get shrunk to the size of a very tiny ant. Wonder how well things will go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana Grams: About 16 years old, 6 ft 3 in, very dark skin skin with a petite body dark hair that goes to her shoulder, makes a cute pony tail. A girl who in all honestly is not exactly the most well like person in school. While she appears attractive in appearance great in science, she is rather non talkative towards everyone and comes across as very boss. You remember you first time with her and she order you to help with a science project with a remote, and got upset when you brought her one wrong part. Some classmates says she can be nice, or at least not so bossy, when she isn't focus on a project. Sadly, she's always focus on a project. Doesn't help you is that it feels like she doesn't really value you or some students that much, hearing that she sometimes forces someone to be volunteer for her projects when she doesn't have one on the spot. Hopefully she will be nice to you someday....hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela Queens: About 17 years old, 5 ft 6 in, light skin with a fit body and orange red curvy hair that goes to her neck. Quite the peppy girl, she is a member of the cheerleader squad, head cheerleader you think you heard. She is like by some, but she can be consider too annoying by many. She doesn't bother you too much as she is one of the few students in the school that will at least talk to you once in a while, provided you bump into her in the first place, though she barely remembers you considering how little time you have been in this school. Other than having some problems in some classes, mainly math, she is pretty ok to ask for some help. She also is said to have quite the sweet tooth and can be selfish about candies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky Homes: 18 years old, 5 ft 4 in, light tan skin with a regular size body and dark brown hair that goes to her back. Rather a weird book worm type of girl as she is mostly spot in the library in school. She is said to be one of the smartest girls, giving Diana a run for her money to some classes when the two are around, consider to be rivals by some people. However, whenever you talk to her, she usually says some of the strangest stuff that you really can't understand. You can't tell if she's shy or trying to ignore you as she focus on reading a book. Still, it probably wouldn't hurt to try to get to know her if she has the potential of being a good friend.....you think. Though you are aware she has a disdain for bugs and anything that is potentially messy, which makes you wonder if maybe she maybe a clean freak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria Rose: 15 years old, 5 ft 7 in, Slightly dark skin with a regular size body with light brown hair that goes to her waist. Consider by many to not only be the spoil child of the school, but a rather annoying bully that likes to take advantage of situation as long it benefits her and as long she can get away for it. She only manage to get to this school because her family paid the enrollment fee and that's it. You remember your first time encountering her, very rude towards you as she force you to help carry stuff around because she doesn't want to carry anything by herself. You actively try to avoid her, maybe even goes as far as hiding behind some classmates like Diana or a teacher or principle to avoid her for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllanor McCain: 36 years old, 6 ft 6in, Light skin with a regular body but a rather large chest with blonde curly hair that goes to her back. She is the principle of the school, and consider to be very love by everyone. She has a kind motherly like personality while appearing ditzy at time, though that mainly a trick for her to see what student or staff member tries to get away of breaking some rules. She can be seen walking around the hallways to make sure no student is ditching school while also seeing if some someone does need some form of help with something. You can't honestly tell if Ellanor is supposed to be some kind of genius as you heard that she is some kind of great inventor, or someone who manages to get the title of principle for years of work, as she does at times doesn't know some basic solution to some basic question, mainly cooking. But the amount of time you met her, she has proven that she can be a very helpful woman...now if only she wasn't so tall to you that you already feel like a bug to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore characters to come when I can think of some, otherwise, don't be afraid to come up with a character or two yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n1) This is primarily a heavy shrinking focus gts unaware story. Yes, growth sequence can happen, though I prefer to see shrinking sequence instead.<br>\r\n2) Alex is the main focus of the story, so please keep the story on him. If you want other characters to get involve by the shrinking action, then make sure that Alex and co are sticking together for the most part.<br>\r\n3) There are no size limit. So you want Alex to stay 1/10 of a inch, go ahead. if you want him to be the size of a doll, go ahead. If you want him to shrink down to nothingness with no hope to ever grow back to normal size, go ahead. However, make sure there is a reason why his size changes, instead of just saying, \"He shrunk for mysterious reasons.\" and that's it. <br>\r\n4) Anything is allow, just no gross bathroom stuff like pee or other stuff like it. Also, no body part size changing stuff, just in case someone tries to throw that in here. Yes, main character can die, just asking to not get too graphic with the details, some of us are squeamish. <br>\r\n5) Please no painful short sentence or one sentence chapters, I will delete those chapters on the spot. I also want at least a paragraph with good grammar for the chapters as well. If i see extremely poor grammar in the chapter, will delete those as well.<br>\r\n6) This is a giantess focus story. Male characters can be involve, but if it involves Alex, then something has to happen to them to be at Alex's size or at least shrunk as well. Females can shrink as well if you want.<br>\r\n7) If you want to introduce a character that isn't listed on the character list I made, go ahead. Just make sure you give some sort of description, like age, height, or stuff like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Other than that, have fun.<br>\r\n</td>",
