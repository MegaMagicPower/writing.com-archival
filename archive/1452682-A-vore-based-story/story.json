Looking down he began to notice a bulge forming in his neck from were the boy was so far. Bringing up his hand Wolfy began to rub the bulge to quicken the movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another swallow he pulled the human all the way up to his waist.

You let out a gasp of air as you inter the stomach chamber, from the smell it makes you want to vomit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly feel your whole world turn upside down as you feel Wolfy begining to move. Outside Wolfy was standing straight up with his head facing towards to sky. With a few quick swallows he had pulled the boy all the way to his ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down he smiled at the small furry dome he had so far. Grinning he grabbed the bottem of both of the humans shoes before pulling them and the socks off both at the same time before dropping them to the ground, he then stuck his tongue out to pull the feet into his mouth before sealing them of to the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to struggle as you feel your feet assalted by the werewolf tongue, you then suddenly notice that he stopped, you instantly knew what was going to happen next. You feel your instantly draw into to his throut like the rest of you was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing his eyes tightly Wolfy lets out one huge swallow as he let the rest of his meal fill out into him. Opening them he is greated by the sight of his huge belly smiling wildly Wolfy began to rub and pat all over his huge gut injoying the feeling of have a meal this big in him made him smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel the last of you curl up into tight muscle before you begin to feel all the rubbing he was doing, you suddenly a rush of warm wind pass threw you before erupting out into a huge belch, you start to black out from the lack of air in the stomach you know it would be stupid to fight now so you just close your eyes and accept your fate. \"boy what a way to go\" were the last thought you had before blacking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside Wolfy noticed that his stomach started the digestion process and began to break down his meal, burping a second time Wolfy bent down to pick up the jacket he got off the boy looking at it closely he noticed that it was a camo army jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder it this will fit me\" thought Wolfy as he began to pull the jacket on him. He was surpriced to find out that it fit him perfectly \"not bad\" he thought as he straighten it a little, deciding not to bother with sealing up around his enormous gut. Wolfy began to make his way deeper into the park to find a nice place to rest off his meal before looking for another one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, he really wasn't that bad\" thought Wolfy as he began to pick his teath with one of his claws. </span></div></div>",
