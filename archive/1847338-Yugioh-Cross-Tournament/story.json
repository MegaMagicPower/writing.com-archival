He hoped that Jack wasn\u2019t also scraping his knee along the concrete as well, that would really, really, hurt. He sped up to dash past Jack, passing him and the Racers, and soon spotted where he wanted to go: a turn off to another highway. \u201cThere we go.\u201d He leaned right and turned, and shot down the turn off, onto the other highway.</span></div></div>",

Turning to swerve back into the middle of the road very quickly, he cut the other Duel Wheels off, causing them to brake suddenly.

After it went away, they all noticed that they were in a new location from where they last were. Yuma looked around, trying to figure out where they were. \"Hey, where the heck are we?\" Yuma asked Kari. Kari just sighed and hit him on the back of the head. \"How am I suppose to know that?\" she told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuma sat on the ground, crisscrossed, holding his head in pain. Astral floated over to him and said, \"Why did she hit you?\" Yuma just looked up at him with a blank face. \"How am I suppose to know, onee-chan is just irritable like that,\" Yuma said only to start sweating when he heard knuckles cracking and felt tons of killer intent. Yuma jumped up and ran away with Kari following him with deadly aura surrounding her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get back here!\" she yelled, but he ignored her and kept running. Unfortunately he tripped and hit the ground. He groaned in pain as he sat up and then felt a chill go down his back as he felt his sister put her hand on his shoulder. Yuma slowly looked up at her and smiled sacredly. Before she could hit him, a poof of smoke caught them offguard, making Kari fall over Yuma and land in front of him. Yuma looked down at her and blushed when he saw that she was wearing a skirt and that he could see her panties thanks to how she fell. Kari realized this too because she quickly rolled off him and stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both looked up and saw a weird shadow figure. \"Please return to your group,\" it said before disappearing again. Yuma and Kari looked at each other and shrugged before walking back to their friends. After getting back, they noticed that there was now more people, but they were separated by see through barriers. Astral floated next to Yuma. \"I tried to get through those barriers, but even I can't get through them,\" he told Yuma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuma nodded his head and just kept walking with Kari. After reaching their group, a loud explosion went off, catching everyone's attention. They all looked up and saw a man, wearing a long black cape that was flowing in the wind, a helmet that showed just some of his black hair, half a mask that just showed his left eye and part of his mouth, red fingerless gloves, long sleeved black shirt with a weird symbol on it, black pants, and black boots. He also had what seemed to be a weird duel disk that kind of looked like a fusion of all the duel disks from all 4 YGO series.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello duelists! My name is not important right now, but I will tell you that I have brought you all here to compete in the greatest dueling competition ever held. To get back to your homes, you will have to win this contest,\" he said. He was cut off when someone with a Brooklyn accent yelled, \"What happens to those who lose?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy looked at him and said, \"They will find out when the time comes. Now the contest will start in exactly 2 hours. I will let you all talk with the other competitors if you want. See you soon.\" The guy disappeared and the barriers separating everybody went away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuma...</span></div></div>",

He looked around and smiled awkwardly, only to yell in pain after Kari hit him in the head. \"Ow...onee-chan,\" he moaned. She glared down at him and he looked back in fright. She sighed and then said, \"Yuma, you know that I despise you're dueling, but it seems I'm going to have to rely on it to get back home.\"<br>\r\n    \"Wait one-chan...you actually want me to duel?\" he asked her in shock. She just sighed and nodded, only to look down in shock when he hugged her. She just sighed and hugged back before Yuma was sent flying away. Kari looked up in shock and turned her head to see a guy with spikey silver hair and veins bulging. He held up a rod and said, \"This disgusts me. All of this lovey dovey crap. Listen to me now. If I run into any of you, I will destroy you. I may have lost the Egyptian God Card when I arrived, but I still won't lose.\"<br>\r\n    Yuma jumped up and tried to punch him, but he dodged it and then brought up his rod. Astral, who was watching, felt a great power in it. \"Yuma move!\" Yuma heard, only to not hear and get sent flying. The guy was about to do it again when someone ran inbetween them.<br>\r\n    \"Marik, I don't know why that guy brought you from the past, but we defeated you once and we will again. It also helps that you lost the Winged Dragon of Ra. Stay away from these people, you got it,\" the short guy said. Newly named, Marik just 'hnned' as he walked away. The guy who got him to leave turned around to Yuma who was lying there looking at him. Kari ran past the guy over to Yuma and checked him for injuries. \"Thank goodness,\" she said as she hugged him.<br>\r\n    Yuma just smiled and then looked at the guy who got Marik to leave and instantly noticed him from when he was looking up historical documents on great duelists and it was the past 'King of Games' Yugi Muto. \"Y-Yugi Muto?\" Yuma stuttered. Yugi just smiled as he helped Yuma up after Kari stopped hugging Yuma. \"Watch out for that guy okay. His name is Marik Ishtar and he is able to send people's souls to the Shadow Realm, a place where people can die or be tortured for eternity. My friends and I defeated him once, but the guy who brought us here must have brought him back from the past. Thankfully he doesn't have The Winged Dragon of Ra God card. Sadly since he doesn't that means the guy who brought us here probably does,\" Yugi explained to him before walking over to a group of people that Yuma probably thought were his friends.<br>\r\n    \"Yuma. Please be careful. If that guy is as dangerous as Yugi says, we are in trouble and I don't want to lose you like how mom and dad are gone,\" Kari told him. Yuma smiled as he stuck out his pinky,\"Onee-chan I pinky promise that I won't let that guy or anybody else get rid of me.\" Kari smiled back and pinky promised with him. So she may be 20 years old. You're never to old to pinky promise anyone.<br>\r\n    Yuma and Kari saw the guy who abducted everyone come back and announced...</span></div></div>",

Yuma just glared up at him as Astral floated next to him. Yuma, Kari, and the rest of his friends that came listened to the guy speak again. \"Also! I added a new rule to this tournament. You may choose one partner if you desire. The remaining duelist or duelists will duel me for the right to return back to their time,\" he explained before disappearing again.<br>\r\nYuma looked at Astral and smiled. Since Astral wasn't really a human, he didn't count as a partner and he could travel around and help Yuma. He looked at his friends and realized that some of them were in trouble since some doesn't know how to duel. Well Kotori does, but what about...he looked at his sister. He walked over to her. \"Onee-chan will you like to be my partner?\" he asked her. Akari looked at him in shock before saying, \"Yuma what do you mean. I don't know how to duel. I would be a nuisance to you.\" Yuma just shrugged his shoulders and said, \"You are the only one of the people who arrived here with me who doesn't know how to duel and with people like that Marik guy walking around, I don't want you to be walking around by yourself okay.\"<br>\r\nAkari looked at him for a second before smiling and hugging. She looked over and saw duel disks, duel gazers for some, and duel monster cards packs for the people who came and don't duel. After getting a duel gazer, her own styled duel disks, and enough duel packs to make her own deck, she walked back over to Yuma and told him she was ready to start. Yuma looked up at her and smiled. <br>\r\nHe then headed over to his friends. \"Guys I have teamed up with onee-chan since she is the only one of us who doesn't know how to duel so I'm going to protect her. I'll meet you guys later I guess. Please don't lose and if you meet a guy named Marik, try not to duel him okay,\" Yuma warned them before walking back over to Akari. They then headed to their designated spots that those same shadow creatures from earlier showed them to. Suddenly everyone in the room heard the mastermind's voice say, \"On your marks, get set, go!\" Everyone then vanished from where they were standing.</span></div></div>",

This was all so sudden, and Yuma\u2019s brain was still trying to process it. While it was a Duel Championship, they way it was all set up and the dude who was running it.....it confused him.<br>\r\nAs his friends started to spread out, Yuma decided to ask his partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAstral, do you have any idea of what exactly is happening here?\u201d he inquired, hoping to get something from his partner that could make sense to him. Unfortunately for him....\u201dI.....have no clue.\u201d Astral said, stumped. This was a shock. \u201cAside from the fact this is a Dueling Competition with the stakes being a way back home, I have no idea who that man could be, or what technology he\u2019s using, or why he has called us here, or if he has any ulterior motives....I am as clueless as your are normally.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Thanks a lot...\u201d Yuma angrily muttered at the burn Astral had given him. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t know then I guess we\u2019ll have to figure it out as we go along.\u201d he said, renewing his vigour. \u201cFor the sake of everyone, I\u2019ll win this thing and get us back home!\u201d he said with fire in his eyes and a red hot fiery spirit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s more, I have no clue how this particular Duel Competition works. It was never mentioned by the black figure...\u201d Astral muttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*beat*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHHHHUUUHHHH?! YOU MEAN WE DON\u2019T EVEN KNOW THE RULES?!\u201d Yuma\u2019s shock was heard through the whole area of Duelists.(An expatriated \u2018you only just figured that out?\u2019 came from one of his friends.) What\u2019s more, at this, a poof of smoke occurred and the shadowy figure that had told Yuma and Kairi to go back to their group appeared again. \u201cDo you require assistance?\u201d it asked, in a echoey voice. \u201cYes, please. We would like clarification on the rules of this championship.\u201d Astral replied. The shadowy figure responded with a simple \u201cCertainly.\u201d and then began to explain the rules.<br>\r\n \u201cAlthough in two hours time the rules will be explained to you, you requested that you have the rules explained to you now. The Cross Championships Rules are simple yet strange: Master Rule 4, No Banned Cards, 60 Cards Maximium Deck Size, 17 Card Maximum Extra Deck Size. You will all be released into a cityscape, and your goal is to rack up 10 wins and then make it to the Arena in the middle of the cityscape. The first 8 Duelists there will be the Top 8, and will fight each other in the Egao Torinement, where the winner will receive the prize of sending everyone from his dimension home. However, if you arrive at the arena without 10 wins, you will not get the spot in the top 8. Losing a Duel will subtract a win, and if you lose 5 times in a row or cheat, you will be eliminated. Also, there are cards scattered about the cityscape that you can add to your deck to improve it. All understood?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmmm.....what\u2019s Master Rule 4?\u201d Yuma asked, confused. Astral chimed in.\u201dI\u2019ve never heard of that before, either.....did the duel format get updated on us?\u201d The shadowy figure nodded, and a shadowy duel mat with two extra zones in the middle of the board appeared. \u201cMaster Rule 4. This format of Dueling include the Extra Monster Zones, for which Special Summoned Monsters  from the Extra Deck must go when Special Summoned. They cannot be placed in Normal Monster Zones.\u201d<br>\r\nIt took a moment to process it, but when Yuma did....\u201dYOU\u2019RE KIDDING ME! THAT\u2019S-?!\u201d...he flipped out. <br>\r\n\u201cInteresting. Very interesting! The restriction of Special Summoned Extra Deck Monsters to this Extra Monster Zone adds for some more strategy to Dueling.....do you go for a Link to get more Extra Deck Monsters out and risk losing them when the link is destroyed or restrict yourself to one Extra Deck Monster?\u201d Astral, on the other hand, was marvelling at it.<br>\r\n\u201cHowever, there is a way to get around the restriction. A special type of monster, called a Link Monster, is blue with circuit lines on it and arrows around the artwork. If the arrow is coloured orange and it is pointing to a Normal Monster Zone, you can Special Summon an Extra Deck Monster there. That is why the Extra Deck limit has been raised to 17, to fit two Link Monsters to help you out. Is that all you require assistance with?\u201d the shadowy figure finished with.<br>\r\n\u201c..yeah, I got it. Two spaces to summon Extra Deck Monsters to, and unless a Orange Arrow on a Link Monster is pointing to a Normal Monster Zone, you can\u2019t summon Extra Deck Monsters there.\u201d Yuma summed up. \u201cThat is all.\u201d Astral said, which dismissed the shadowy figure, as it vanished in another puff of smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d Yuma said, pulling his D-Gazer out of his pocket and fixing it to the side of his head, \u201cI\u2019m ready to duel, Astral! Can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve gotta wait out two whole hours, though.....\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed.\u201d The Astral World inhabit spoke. \u201cNow that we know the rules, and we have time to burn, let\u2019s....as you say, \u2018scope out the competition\u2019, shall we?\u201d <br>\r\nThere were a lot of people...who to talk to first?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You are suppose to be dead.<br>\r\nWhat do you mean dead? Seto said as he got free. <br>\r\nThe man  then looked around and stared at Joey. And Your Joey Wheeler.<br>\r\nSo You heard of me.<br>\r\nOf course. a Friend of the undisputed King of games.<br>\r\nHey who do you think You are? Joey asked.<br>\r\nJack Atlas. I am known as the Duel King.<br>\r\nIs that so. Then let's duel.<br>\r\nI don't think this is the place for a duel. They looked to see a little guy with spiked black, blond, and Purple hair.<br>\r\nYou're Yugi Muto. Jack said.<br>\r\nI agree with him, Jack. Said a man with spiked black hair with blond hightlites and a yellow mark going down his cheek.<br>\r\nYusei, your here to? Yugi said.<br>\r\nSo the gang is all hear. Said a boy with two shades of brown hair wearing a red jacket.<br>\r\nJaden. You too. <br>\r\nYeah. But who is the one reponsible for this?<br>\r\nJust then a pilliar of black light appeared. everyone stepped back. Then the pilliar disappeared and then a man wearing a black cloak stood where the pilliar was.<br>\r\nSo you are the one responsible. Yusei said. WHo are you?<br>\r\nThen man reach up and lowered his hood. With that the cloak disappeared and the man was wearing a black suit instead. He had scraggy red hair with black hightlights.  He was wearind sunglasses so his eyes could not be seen.<br>\r\nOne more time. Yugi said. WHo are you?<br>\r\nTHe man then said. The name is Zenaku, and I brought all you here for one reason.<br>\r\nAnd that reason is? Seto asked.<br>\r\nWhy to duel of course. Zenaku said.</span></span></div></div>",

Many of the duelist's asked but the one that Zenaku focused on was Jack.<br>\r\nI will explain this the best way I can. Attention Duelists. at this time you are all in a dimention I created using ceirtain means that some of you will not believe. You are all from different points in time and space. All of you are from points that your disappearence will not cause a big enough impact to change history. Zenaku passed. I gathered the strongest duelists in all time to find out who is the best. Participation is maintory.<br>\r\nLooks like we have no choose. Seto said.<br>\r\nRight. Jack said.<br>\r\nBefore I declare the start with there anything that any of you wish to say?<br>\r\nYeah. The voice was from a boy with spiked black hair with a red hightlight and red eyes. <br>\r\nWhat is it that wish to say. Yuma Tsukumo.<br>\r\nYeah bring it on. Yuma said. How did you know my name?<br>\r\nSimple. Everyone for the most part were chosen at random. But there were a few that I hand picked to bring here. You are one of them.<br>\r\nThe tornament is three stages. First is the elimitaion round. You duel to earn points. You may duel someone more then once but don't think that you can win only doing that. After all the same opponents will not give you the same points in a duel. Those who win the most points will pass to the next round. I will explain more later on that. In one hour the matches will start. Just then the area change. I thing wildrness is the best setting for the an elimitation round. Take that time to get yourselves ready. With that Zenaku disappeared.<br>\r\nWell I guess if we have to duel then be should duel to win. Jaden said.<br>\r\nRight. Yusei said.<br>\r\nAh ha. Yugi said. Just then there was a glow in front of him. <br>\r\nAt the same moment Yusei and Jack felt a burning sensation on their right arms. <br>\r\nIn front of Yugi appeared the Millenium Puzzle. How do I have the Puzzle.<br>\r\nJack and Yusei looked to see that they had there respective marks. What is going on?<br>\r\nThat Zenaku guy said he wants the stongest Duelist. Looks like he thinks you are stronger with same help.<br>\r\nThat sounds about right. Said a voice.<br>\r\nDid you hear that?<br>\r\nI heard nothing. Joey said.<br>\r\nThen it must be. Yugi said as he placed the Puzzle around his neck. Just then Yugi grow to about the same height as the others.<br>\r\nThe Pharaoh must be back. Joey said.<br>\r\nPharaoh? I don't see him anywhere?<br>\r\nIt is complicated. \"Yugi\" said. But now lets get ready for the tornament.<br>\r\nThey all shook there heads. All but Seto. This my  not be the why I wished it but Atleast I will take the title from you Yugi.<br>\r\nAnd if we duel then I am looking followed to it. Yugi said. <br>\r\nThere was a flash that signaled the start of the first stage of the tornament. </span></span></div></div>",

Zenaku then snapped his fingers and seveal people disappeared. What did you do? Yugi asked.<br>\r\nDon't worry. I just sent those how have not earned enough to advance into storage. They will be find. Zenaku said. Now time for the next round. WIth that the area changed into a cityscape.You each will find you have a circler device with one piece in each.

With that he disappeared again.<br>\r\nWhen he left everyone then started off to duel. Some how, Yugi, Jaden, and Yusei managed to met up with each other. So What now? Jaden asked.<br>\r\nI think Zenaku want's a big show. I think the best show would be to save us for last. Yusei said.<br>\r\nSo it is agreed that we will wait for the finals to due each other. Yugi said. They all agreed. Just then there was a commotion. What could that be? <br>\r\nLet's check it out. Jaden said as the three of them headed for the commotion.</span></span></div></div>",

Weevil said.<br>\r\nWhy were you two running? Yusei asked.<br>\r\nNo reason. The two said. Plus it has nothing to do with you. Weevil said.<br>\r\nThere you are! they all looked to see who just spoke. It was the kid Yuma. Give it back.<br>\r\nWhat are you taking about? Jaden asked.<br>\r\nThis two steal my friend's cloak pieces. Yuma said.<br>\r\nThere is no proof. Weevil said.<br>\r\nHe may not by I do.

A judge to make sure there is fair play. <br>\r\nThen you can prove that these two stole my friend's pieces. Yuma said.<br>\r\nI am sorry but dispite there methods there is nothing I can do. What done is done. Your friends have already been kicked out of the tornament. But this two can not be left unpunished. Just then lighting struck Rex sending him back.<br>\r\nWhat was that?

They may have stole but they are duelists and deserve a chance to stay in.<br>\r\nYuma Tsukumo, there was then a pause. Alright. Weevil Underwood,Yuma Tsukumo. The two of you will duel and if Yuma wins then he gets both yours and Rex Raptor's pieces. If you win then you get Yuma's one piece.<br>\r\nAlright then.

Unless Yuma agrees to it.<br>\r\nThere was a pause. Yuma then looked to his right. Alright. He said. Alright I will do it.<br>\r\nGood. The Overseer said.

Jaden asked.<br>\r\nDuel disk Set. Yuma said as his duel pad turned into a duel disk. D-gazer on line.<br>\r\nD-gazer? Jaden asked.<br>\r\nTHen the overseer spoke. A d-gazer is a type of viewer used to see the Augmented Reality, or AR, that exist in the time period of Yuma. <br>\r\nWhat is AR, exactly? Yusei asked.<br>\r\nAs you may assume there are a lot of technology in his time. So much that the electricial signals allow an virual world to duel in. This realm has been modifyed to allow them to duel in this Enviroment.<br>\r\nEnough talk. Weevil said. Let's duel.<br>\r\nWith that both duelist's life points were set to 4000.<br>\r\nYuma: 4000<br>\r\nWeevil: 4000<br>\r\nI'll go first. Weevil said. I summon Pinch Hopper in attack mode. With that a giant grasshopper appeared. att: 1000 Def: 1200.<br>\r\nIs that all? Yuma asked. Yuma then looked to his right. You think so ha? <br>\r\nThe duel has started already and you are breaking up. Weevil said. I activate Eradicating Aerosol. With that Pitch Hopper was destroyed.<br>\r\nYou just destroyed your own monster. Yuma asked. But why?<br>\r\nWhen Pitch Hopper is Destroyed i can summon an insect monster form my hand to the field. I summon Insect Queen. A giant bug appeared on Weevil's field. Att: 2200 Def: 2400.<br>\r\nThat is one big bug. Yusei said.<br>\r\nThat is my turn.<br>\r\nOkay My move. Yuma then draw. I summon Gogogo Golem in defence mode. Just then a green and blue stone creature with one red eye appeared. Att: 1800 Def: 1500. Now I play two cards face down. Your move Weevil.<br>\r\nVery well. Weevil then draw. I summon a second Pitch Hopper. Now I tribute it so i can attack with insect queen. but first i can special summon another monster. Larva Moth. A small worm apeared. Att: 500 Def:400.<br>\r\nIt is only a level two monster. Yuma said. What do you have planned?<br>\r\nMore on that later. Now Insect Queen attack. Insect Queen attacked but Gogogo Golem remained. Hey what is the deal. I attacked your golem. It should be destroyed.<br>\r\nOnce per turn when Gogogo Golem is attacked in defence mode he is not destroyed. Yuma said. <br>\r\nI set two cards and end my turn. Weevil said.<br>\r\nOkay my move. Yuma said. I summon Achacha Archer in attack mode. A bowsman appeared. when he is summoned I inflict 500 points of damage to my opponent. The archer then pulled an arrow back and then when it lit on fire the archer let it go striking Weevil.<br>\r\nYuma: 4000<br>\r\nWeevil: 3500<br>\r\nNow Achacha Archer attack Larva moth. It attacked.<br>\r\nI activate my trap card. DNA Surgury. It allows me to change the type of monsters on the field. And I choose Insect.<br>\r\nSo what My attack still goes through.<br>\r\nNot with this. Insect Barrier. Insect monsters on your field can't attack. <br>\r\nThe attack faded. I end my turn.<br>\r\nMy move. Weevil said. First i play the spell card Cell Division. Now i make a copy of larva moth. Next I tribute the true Larva Moth for Cocoon of Evolution. now I tribute my token to attack.<br>\r\nInsect queen attacked.<br>\r\nI activate my trap. Bye Bye Damage. Since you attacked an attack mode monster I can make my monster unable to be destroyed and then deal twice the damage to you.<br>\r\nYuma: 2600<br>\r\nWeevil: 700<br>\r\nI end my turn.<br>\r\nOkay my move. Yuma said. Man I need to win. What do I do? That's it. I summon Gagaga Magician. A spellcaster with a scar appeared. Att: 1500 Def: 1000.<br>\r\nThat monster. It looks like Dark Magician. Yugi said. <br>\r\nBut what would that do? Yusei asked.<br>\r\nNow I will overlay with Gagaga Magician and Gogogo Golem. With this two monsters I create the Overlay Network. I XYZ summon Number 39 Utopia. With that a giant white and gold winged warrior appeared. Att: 2500 Def: 2000.<br>\r\nWhat is a Number monster? Weevil asked. Don't matter. It still can't attack.<br>\r\nI set one card face down and end my turn.<br>\r\nMy move. Weevil draw.<br>\r\nI activate my face down Command of the Sword.<br>\r\nWhat dues that do? You must show me that card. if it is a spell or trap i get one of two effects. Ethier you Discard the revealed card or I Target 1 Spell or Trap Card you control and destroy it.<br>\r\nLucky you. Weevil showed the card to be Infection.<br>\r\nI am destroying Insect barrier.<br>\r\nWhat ever. I summon Cockroach knight and tribute it to attack.<br>\r\nI activate the effect of Utopia. I remove one XYZ matiral and negater your attack.<br>\r\nI end.<br>\r\nNo I attack Insect Queen but I negate my attack and activate Double up and attack again.<br>\r\nNo.<br>\r\nYuma: 2600<br>\r\nWeevil: 0<br>\r\nYuma wins.<br>\r\nJust then two more pieces appeared in Yuma's Clock.<br>\r\nI won Yeah. Yuma said.<br>\r\nAnd now for this two. the overseer said. He then pulled out a shroad and throw it over Rex and Weevil. The two the disappeared and soon did the Overseer.</span></span></div></div>",

The reason? To hold the biggest Dueling Tornament in all of Time and Space. The only way that he will let them go free is if they win the tornament. Follow the activitys of the tornament as either Yugi Muto, Jaden Yuki, Yusei Fudo, or Yuma Tsukumo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules for Additions:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"justify\">no character bashing.<br>\r\nno OC characters, except the master mind of the tornament and those working as eliminators, or OC personallities.<br>\r\nKeep Duels of people from the same timeline (series) to a minimum. ( That way it decreases the chances of someone just typing a duel scenario that already accured.) In addition, make sure to have Character counter parts duel against each other at least once throughout the tornament. Ex. Yugi = Jaden  = Yusei = Yuma.<br>\r\nYou can have non-dueling Characters added. Also you can have it that some how they get seperated form their group and meet up with another's group.<br>\r\nThe decks of each duelist must be, for the most part, be accurate. You can have it that duelist have cards that would improve there deck. Ex. Joey Wheeler may same how get his hands on an XYZ.
