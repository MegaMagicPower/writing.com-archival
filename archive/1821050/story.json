BOW DOWN TO ME!!\" Tsubaki looked at her partner in embarrassment. \"Black*Star, not everyone here gets up at 7 am. Quiet down and let them sleep.\" Black*Star just grinned at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2 hours later*************************************************************************** **********************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Soul!\" called out Black*Star. \"Get over here, Tsubaki made a great breakfast!\" Soul perked up. \"Breakfast?! Great I'm starving!\" Maka stared at him. \"But you just ate!\" Soul ignored her, and rushed to the picnic table where Black*Star was eating. <i>Boys! When they aren't cheating on you, they're stuffing their faces!</i> A loud belch brought her back to reality.

Maka sighed. There was no stopping those two.<br>\r\nSoul had eaten three heaping plates of hashbrowns, eggs, and toast, and was already eating another. Black Star had eaten 5 plates, and was halfway through his 6th. <i>Jeez, they're going to make themselves puke</i>, thought Maka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA half hour later*************************************************************************** ******************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boy, I am stuffed!\" Black Star half grinned. Soul just hiccuped in agreement. Both boys looked absolutely stuffed, stomachs bloated out a little. They had eaten all of the food Tsubaki had made, then leaned back to rub their bellies. Maka was beyond embarrassed with Soul, whose shirt exposed a little of his gut. Soul then....</span></div></div>",
