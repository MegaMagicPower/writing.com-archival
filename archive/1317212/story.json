He was sitting at the table outside the house under the shade of the brightly colored umbrella attached to the table. Master Roshi was inside watching his exercise programs like the old pervert he was, Turtle was out in the ocean somewhere doing who knows what and 18 was out doing shopping in West City. She had needed to pick something up and decided to just do the weeks shopping instead of waiting until Sunday. That wasn't what was depressing him however. Goku, Gohan, Vegeta, Piccolo, everyone who was a fighter had left to go out into space to aid a planet that King Kai had informed them was in danger. Krillin had wanted to go to help, but they had shouted him down. There was only room for a certain amount of people and they needed all the strongest fighters they could get. Krillin apparently didn't meet that level of one of the strongest fighters. How the times had changed! He was never the strongest out of any group he'd been in but he'd always been able to hold his own and had gained respect from friends and the populace at large. Now he was always shunted to the side, forced to watch while the saiyans took center stage and fought whenever it was needed. Even Piccolo had been pushed aside at various times throughout their adventures, but he was apparently a little higher up the chain then Krillin was. He sighed and got off the chair he was sitting in, falling a short distance to the sand. That was another thing he didn't like. He was trapped in a child like body, forced to look up to everyone he talked to. It was no wonder he never got any respect anymore!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to go inside and get something to eat from the fridge when he saw someone flying towards the house. He shielded his eyes wondering who would be coming to visit.</span></div></div>",

Yamcha had always been strong but he'd never made too much of a name for himself. In every fight he'd been in he'd almost always end up getting hurt, killed, or beaten in some way. Krillin was about to ask him what was going on when Yamcha grabbed him by the shoulders and said, \"Krillin this is our chance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrillin looked surprised as Yamcha started grinning at him. Krillin laughed a little and said, \"What are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamcha laughed and said, \"All the strongest guys are gone in space to help some strange planet out in the East Galaxy and we have a situation here on Earth!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrillin's heart leaped as he heard this. \"Wh-Why is that a good thing?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamcha turned back to Krillin and said, \"Someone's attacking the planet and you haven't even sensed their ki yet right? Well Tien is fighting this guy right now and he's been kicking butt! Whoever this guy is he's a total wuss! We'll be heroes again if we take him out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrillin liked the sound of that. If it was only for a moment, he wanted to be back in that spotlight. He flew up into the air, Yamcha right behind him and said, \"Where to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamcha turned and said, \"Follow me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took about fifteen minutes of flying to reach the city where the attack was being held. Tien was indeed already there and fighting what appeared to be a small man wearing a tank on his back. He was currently getting his butt handed to him by Tien.  Yamcha and Krillin landed just behind Tien who turned around and said, \"I can handle this guy on my own you guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamcha snorted and said, \"Not likely! This is all of our chances, not just yours!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Yamcha and Tien argued, the man got to his feet, a little shakily, and said, \"Now I finally have you where I want you! I've waited years for this moment when the World's Strongest fighters would be gone for me to attack. Now the Dragonballs will be mine and the world will be mine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrillin glanced at the guy and said, \"You're still out of your league here little guy. Once we're done talking you're going to get hurt so you might want to surrender.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man stomped his feet angrily and said, \"No, no no! You three will die right now! Prepare to taste by poison developed from the world's most lethal animals!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA needle suddenly darted out of the tank and stabbed Krillin in the arm. Before he could react Tien and Yamcha were also stabbed. A strange burning green liquid was injected into them causing them all to wince in pain. The man giggled insanely and said, \"In a few seconds you'll all be dead and no one will stand in my way! I'll be an all powerful, immortal king!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes ticked by and nothing seemed to happen.The man started looking worried. When ten minutes had passed and no one had done or said anything (and no one was dead) Yamcha laughed and said, \"Your poison sucks little man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man growled in anger again and said, \"Then lets up the dosage!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral more needles darted out of the tank, stabbing the three humans all over their bodies, injecting them with more and more poison. Soon, the large tanks on the man's back was empty. And still neither of the humans were dead. The man fell to his knees and said, \"Why isn't my poison working? This isn't how it was supposed to go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled out a piece of paper and muttered, \"Maybe I mistook the formula. Perhaps if I changed this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small ki blast destroyed his plans causing him to cry out in sadness. Before he could even look up from the ashes, Yamcha landed a punch square on his head knocking him out. It took all of ten minutes to put the man in jail without his now empty tanks. Yamcha put an arm behind his head and said, \"Well, maybe this wasn't the fight that'll put us back on the map after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrillin sighed and said, \"Thank you for a colossal waste of time. I'll see you guys later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrillin then flew home, not noticing a strange tightening in his clothes.</span></div></div>",

Trunks hopped out of the plane and greeted Krillin, it always annoyed him how he was eye level with most children. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis disdain must have showed on his face because Trunks asked him what was wrong, \"Oh nothing.....It's just I'm a little tired of being left behind all the time! Back in the day your mom and me would go on the greatest of adventures! Remember Bulma?\" Krillin asked reminded of their past exploits searching for the Dragon Balls.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha! I remember that time we were trying to escape from that General Blue guy! Goku almost got beat by him too! Oh but now it seems like such a long time ago!\" Bulma remembered fondly.  \"Hey I think I've got something that'll cheer you up!

And how exactly did you make this thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulma happily launched into an explanation. \"Well it all started back when I made a shrinking watch when I was just a kid. It worked well and I thought I'd go back to my old blue prints and try to create a machine that could not only shrink things but also increase them past their original size. Once I decided that I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrunks groaned as he Bulma talked on and on about her invention. He looked at Krillin and said, \"Nice going. Now she'll never stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrillin laughed a little uneasily and said, \"Uh Bulma? Can I see that gun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulma handed him the gun with a quick, \"Sure.\" then continued explaining how it worked. Krilling looked it over and saw that the gun was labeled quite simply. There was a switch that could be toggled between grow and shrink and that was it. He switched the gun from its neutral position to grow. Trunks, who had been staring out over the ocean, turned to watch Krillin, interest plain in his face. Krillin pointed the gun at himself and pulled the trigger. A burst of energy shot out of the gun and coursed through Krillin's body. Instantly his body started expanding slightly. Within seconds he had surpassed Bulma's height and continued to grow. His clothes weren't faring too well with his growth. His pants had rode up to just below his knees while his shirt tore at the shoulder, the material falling around his waist. He stopped growing when he was Goku's height. He looked at his body in awe, shocked at his growth. This was something he had never believed would be possible. He looked over at Trunks and saw that he was staring at him in awe. Bulma had stopped her flood of explanations and smiled at him, \"I'll let you hold onto that for awhile. Just make sure you give it back to me before the week is out. Come on Trunks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrunks stayed put and said, \"Aw come on Mom! Can't a stay a little while?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulma looked over at Krillin and said, \"You wouldn't find looking after Trunks for awhile would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrillin had been too busy looking over his new bigger body to pay much attention. He quickly said, \"Yeah, sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulma climbed back into her plane and said, \"I'll come pick you up in a few hours Trunks. Have fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she took off.

He grew and grew and grew, until he towered over Kame House! His clothes didn't fare too well though, his shirt had rode up to where you could see his belly button, his pants now looked like tight fitting shorts, and his shoes had burst leaving him in his socks. All this time the perverted Master Roshi had been too absorbed in watching his exercise programs to notice the giant Krillin who was now blocking out the sunlight on the island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow this thing is awesome!\" Krillin said happily. \"Hey Krillin!\" Trunks shouted up to his babysitter, \"Can I try it out now?\"</span></div></div>",

He pointed the gun at Trunks and said, \"I'll give you a little more size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrunks cheered happily and waited for Krillin to fire the gun. Krillin pointed the gun at Trunks and pulled the trigger. Trunks was showered in bright light, his body quickly absorbing the power of the gun fueling his growth. Within seconds Trunks had reached Krillin's waist. Krillin had stopped pulling the trigger at this point allowing the once small boy to grow a little while longer until he was at Krillin's stomach. Trunks' clothes had fared about the same as Krillin's. His shirt had rode up from the bottom with the v cut that showed off his chest revealed only a small portion of each one of his pecs the majority of the chest muscle spilling out the other side of the straps. His pants were hugging his thighs tightly while his briefs had torn slightly at the sides. His shoes had burst off revealing his big bare feet since he wasn't wearing socks today. Trunks was about equal to the height of the Kame house, his head rising just a few (relatively speaking of course) inches above the roof line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so cool!\" Trunks shouted happily. \"Wait until Goten gets a load of me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrillin was happy that his little friend was happy and looked out over the ocean. There was a lot of fun to made on the mainland. There was really not much point sticking around out here.

Countless times he's saved the world and countless times he's been near death. It wasn't too much to ask for a little time off, was it? Apparently it was. Chi-Chi had been on his back nonstop about various things from cleaning to running chores. Gohan was busy with his studies and Goten was too young to do much so Chi-Chi focused on Goku. He was currently hiding out in Mount Paouzu far enough away from his house that Chi-Chi wouldn't  be willing to walk to find him. Goku was relaxing by a mountain stream intending to catch some fish after resting so that Chi-Chi would let up on him a little. He sighed and sat up, watching the dark shadows moving under the sparkling surface of the water. He started stripping and got down to his underwear when something in the sky caught his eye. Shielding his eyes against the sun he watched as something came flying down, landing a few yards away!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck was that?\" Goku wondered out loud, crossing his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, Goku left his clothes behind and flew towards where the thing had fallen. It was easy to find since it had made a crater about ten feet wide and twenty feet deep. Expecting the worst, Goku slowly made his way down into the hole. Surprisingly it wasn't an alien ship, egg, or other strange disturbance. It was just a rock. Goku grabbed it and turned it over in his hands. It was a bright silver color and as Goku turned it in the suns rays it sparkled like a star. Goku thought it looked really beautiful and an idea came to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chi-Chi would love this!\" Goku said holding the rock up. \"This is sure to make Chi-Chi leave me alone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku climbed out of the hole and flew back to his clothes, looking at the stone the whole way. He sighed and said, \"Maybe Chi-Chi won't even care about this. I wish she'd just let me be me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Goku said these words out loud, the rock suddenly flashed a blinding white causing Goku to be temporarily blinded to the point that he crashed into the stream. Once his vision cleared, Goku made for the surface of the moving water and climbed out onto the bank, soaking wet. The rock was still in his hand but it had lost its lustrous silver shine. It was still glowing but a very dull silver color. Goku looked dismayed and thought, \"Aww, now Chi-Chi really won't care about this rock! Oh well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku didn't feel like throwing it away since it was probably one of kind. Stuff didn't just fall from the sky everyday you know. It was a short walk back to his clothes and Goku quickly got dressed. He shrugged his shoulders and moved his arms around a little. His clothes felt strangely tight. Usually his clothes were loose giving him greater maneuverability during fights. Now it felt like his undershirt was gripping tightly to his chest and stomach, riding up slightly while his orange shirt felt like it was straining to the point of nearly breaking near his shoulders. His pants weren't faring any better, no longer hanging loosely at his boots. Even his boxers felt tighter, hugging his legs to the point of feeling like briefs. He purposely pulled off his boots not liking how cramped his toes were. He shrugged it off. What did it matter if his clothes were a little tight? It was possible his clothes shrunk when he got wet and from sitting in the sun. Goku let that explanation suffice in his mind, not really realizing how impossible it was. He flew off, forgetting about the fish and hoping Chi-Chi had cooled down.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cUhhh\u2026.\u201d Goku grumbled, slowly shifting his position on his bed from lying down on his stomach, to lying down on his back. He slowly opened his eyes as the morning sun flooded into his room, his whole body feeling really uncomfortable for some reason. He rubbed his eyes and looked in front of him, seeing his bare feet sticking out of the covers, being cooled by the morning breeze which was coming from his room window. He wiggled his thick, uncovered toes as he threw his bed sheet off of himself, sitting up in a slight daze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I was getting the shivers in the middle of the night\u2026 but why\u2019re my sheets too short?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Goku had the chance to ponder this, his room door flew open, his youngest son running in, yelling, \u201cMorning Daddy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku smiled, opening his arms as Goten jumped onto his lap with a lot of force, knocking him backwards onto the bed. \u201cGood mornin\u2019 to you too!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nGoku ruffled Goten\u2019s hair, lying straight on the bed as he held Goten high into the air with his legs raised upwards, his calves and thighs pulsing, his bare feet against Goten\u2019s torso. Goku smiled at his son, holding him up with his legs and feet for a few seconds, until he saw the confused look on his son\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey\u2026 daddy?\u201d Goten started, \u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku continued holding his son up, grinning as he replied, \u201cYeah! What\u2019s wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you told me that I\u2019d be as big as you someday\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you are gonna be!\u201d Goku said, wondering why his son sounded as if he doubted he would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoten smiled at his dad, pointing at him. \u201cBut how I am supposed to catch up with you if you\u2019re still getting bigger? It looks like you need new pajamas! And your feet\u2019re bigger to!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku stared at his son, dumbfounded. \u201cWha\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku set his son down onto the floor, and sat up, looking himself over. The buttons on his pajamas had popped off in the middle of the night, exposing his mesmerizing, perfectly defined pecs, and his rock-hard six-pack. The ends of his sleaves had been pulled to the middle of his forearms by his longer arms, his huge triceps and biceps straining his sleaves to the point where little holes had appeared, his skin visible.   The cuffs at the bottom of his pajama pants had ridden up high enough so that he could see a little more than half of his monstrous calves, while his behemoth sized thighs caused the seams at the side of his pants to rip slightly. Goku\u2019s boxers were unbelievably tight as his package hadn\u2019t been left out in his sudden growth spurt, it bulging out obscenely in front of his son. He looked down at his larger, bare feet, and flexed his toes as he noticed his feet were now a few inches too big for his boots. Goten had probably noticed that his feet had grown, besides his entire body, while he had been held up in the air on them. At the moment, Goku was probably a foot taller, give or take an inch, than his usual self!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoten crossed his arms, staring at his dad. \u201cSo? Why\u2019re you bigger daddy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Goku began, thinking of an excuse, \u201cI\u2019ve been\u2026 training. Yeah! I\u2019ve been training a lot lately!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally!? Maybe I should be training more then!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku smiled, simply replying, \u201cYeah, you should! Go ahead!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoten nodded, as giggled as he ran out of the room, believing his dad. Meanwhile though, Goku couldn\u2019t understand how, and why he had suddenly grown. And, besides that, why his clothes felt as if they were STILL getting tighter! Goku then pulled off his shirt, and pulled off his pants, both ripping a little in the process. He looked in the mirror, now only in his boxers, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with me being bigger!\u201d He told himself, \u201cI feel fine, so there shouldn\u2019t be anything to worry about!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, little did Goku know, as he looked through his closet for some clothes, he was still slowly getting bigger! And, all thanks to that rock, he\u2019d continue to slowly grow, and grow, and grow! Luckily, or not, he had forget about the rock, and had left it in his room cabinet, meaning that no one else knew about it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After searching around for at least ten minutes, Goku finally decided on a pair of sweat pants and a black tank top. It wasn't his usual outfit, but it was the only thing stretchy enough to fit him...almost. He pulled the pants up, the cuffs tight around his calves; they seemed even smaller than the pajama pants and they were the biggest pants he owned! Was he still getting bigger? He pulled the tank top on, the bottom of it resting comfortably just on top of his second row of abs, leaving the two bottom rows and his belly button on full display. Goku looked in the mirror again, scratching the back of his head lightly at how ridiculous he looked. He chuckled and said, \"It almost looks like I put on Goten's clothes by mistake or something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed for a bit at that idea until his stomach rumbled. He patted his abs and headed for the kitchen, needing to duck slightly under the door frame to get out. He measured himself against it and nodded. Yup, definitely bigger than he was when he woke up. He shrugged and soon entered the kitchen, looking around for Chi-Chi...who wasn't there. He looked at the clock and saw he WAS a few hours later in waking up than he normally was. Did Chi-Chi go shopping? His eyes suddenly fell on a note that was situated obviously on the table. He grabbed it, the note looking downright tiny in his huge hand, as he scanned the words Chi-Chi had written.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear Goku: I know this is sudden, but my father has taken ill. Judging by what he told me his symptoms were, I'll probably be gone for at least a week, probably more. I'm counting on you and Gohan to take care of Goten. Everything you need should be in the cupboards, the refrigerator, or the closet, depending on what you need. If you're confused about anything, Gohan will be able to help you. Don't get into any trouble while I'm gone! Love, Chi-Chi\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku chuckled a little nervously and said, \"Well, how do you like that? Guess it's just us guys for awhile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku had to admit he was relieved. Chi-Chi probably would have thrown a fit if she had seen how big Goku was, and still growing (the tank top was starting to feel AWFULLY tight...). Goten had been pretty blase about it and he didn't think Gohan would react much differently. In the end, Goku just shrugged and started looking for something to eat. \"It'll all work out, I'm sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat wasn't going to work out was lunch. Chi-Chi hadn't made anything before she left and there was nothing pre made that Goku could just open and eat. It didn't help that he was totally clueless when it came to this kind of stuff. Goten wouldn't be any help either, even if he wasn't hanging around outside training in an effort to grow bigger. His stomach growled angrily again. Goku rubbed it gently and said, \"I know, I know...Oh! I know something that might help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly made his way back to his room, having to duck down even lower to get inside, his pecs pressing up under his chin slightly (it seemed his muscles were slowly swelling larger too), and rummaged through his dresser drawer, pulling out a drawstring bag. He tipped it upside down and a single green bean dropped out. \"Perfect! One Senzu Bean left!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Senzu Bean was capable of healing almost every wound, but another effect that not many people remembered, was its ability to keep you feeling full for ten days straight. Of course, for someone like Goku it never quite lasted that long, but it would do in a pinch. He tossed the bean into his mouth and chewed it to bits, swallowing down. Almost instantly, his stomach bulged out a little filling him up like any good meal would. \"Aaaaah....much better~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo longer feeling hungry, Goku squeezed back out of his room and headed for the front door, leaving the house as best he could. He smiled as he saw Goten training his body and walked over to him, his big bare feet leaving sizable foot prints in the soft grass. As Goku approached his son, Goten looked up, his face going from a look of determination, to happiness, to shock as he saw just how big his father has grown. Goku slowly stopped, seeing the look on Goten's face, and looked down at his body. Just how much bigger had he grown?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Wow! Daddy you're even bigger!\" Goten was in awe, staring up at his massive father, his clothes incredibly tight on him. It looked like any kind of stray flex might rip the tank top and pants apart. The bottom of the shirt barely reached the bottom of his chest, and the pants were now officially short enough to be considered shorts, his muscles bulging even larger than they had before. Goku laughed nervously and said, \"Yeah, I guess I am!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoten pouted again, crossing his arms. \"No fair! You haven't even been training! Why are you so huge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku grinned and scooped Goten up easily in one arm. \"Well, your dad started out a lot bigger and stronger, so it only makes sense that I'm getting bigger faster!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, yeah, that does make sense!\" Goten said with a big smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're feeling really sweaty Goten...why don't we go take a bath?\" Goku suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! I'll go get the water running!\" Goten leaped from his father's grasp and around to the back of the house, lighting a fire under the drum where they normally bathed before grabbing the hose and filling it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku walked after him at a slower pace, noticing that every time he breathed, his chest expanded just a bit bigger, his view rising just a bit higher. The sound of straining fabric filled his ears the closer he got to the bath, his tank top ripping apart as he rounded the house. So, he was still growing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoten didn't notice, his back turned to his father. He was just finishing pulling off his shirt, his pants soon following, leaving the boy stark naked. Goku stuck his thumbs inside the waistband of his pants and pulled, the already strained material ripping apart at even a fraction of his strength. Goku chuckled and tossed it aside, walking up to the drum...which was less than half his size. Goten jumped in, tossing the hose out as he did. Goku sighed and rolled the hose up, turning the water off as he did. Goten giggled and splashed around in the water, getting himself cleaned off. Goku stretched and walked back over to the drum, scratching his head as he saw how small it was. \"Move over Goten! I need to get in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoten looked up in awe as he scooted over to the side. His father was starting to look a little scary he was getting so big...Goku stuck his feet in first, his toes almost instantly denting the sides of the drum. He pulled his feet back out and reassessed the situation, straddling the drum instead. Goten quickly jumped out of it, the sight of his dad's bare junk dangling above him scaring him off. With a huge splash, water slopping out the edges, as he wedged himself inside, half his upper body sticking out one side while half his lower body stuck out the other. Goten's face was inches from his father's massive feet. Goku sighed and closed his eyes, relaxing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoten slowly reached out and touched his father's foot. It was so big...he quickly lifted up his own foot, his eyes widening when he realized his foot was about the size of Goku's heel! Goku giggled, Goten's soft foot tickling his own, his toes flexing, each thick digit moving with a slow, but powerful movement. Goten smiled and knelt down in front of the huge feet, his small hands rubbing them all over. Goku laughed harder, his feet shaking slightly, shoving against Goten. Goten pressed back harder, fighting a losing battle against his father's appendages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs this went on, Goku's body grew larger and larger, his feet stretching longer and wider, each toe lengthening in front of Goten until his big toe alone was the size of Goten's foot. His growth seemed unstoppable! Goten didn't notice, his attention fully on the magnificent feet in front of him. Goku playfully pressed Goten between his feet, lifting him off the ground and spinning him slightly as he did. Goten giggled happily, the warm, strong feet holding him firmly in place. Goten was starting to look like a doll against Goku's massive size, his arms able to wrap around the big toe and hold on. Neither male seemed to notice, both of them having too much fun to care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Goku couldn't ignore his change as...</span></div></div>",

Goten continued to hold onto his father\u2019s big toe, having to re-adjust his grip every once in a while as it continued to lengthen slowly, until he lost his grip by accident. He landed with a loud THUD, under his father\u2019s massive feet. At this moment, Goku\u2019s sped up growth spurt came to an end, the feelings of pleasure and fun of his son holding onto his colossal feet, and, his huge toes not influencing his growth rate anymore. Though, without a doubt, he was surely still growing, just at the same rate as before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoten looked past his giant father\u2019s tempting, big feet, the huge toes flexing slightly, and gave his father a reassuring smile to show he was okay. Though, as he looked his dad over, admiring his father\u2019s ever so large stature, and unbelievably large, developed muscles, while avoiding the site of his massive junk, he realized something\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD-Dad! You\u2019re SO BIG!\u201d Goten yelled, staring quizzically at his father. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku looked over his massive body as he sat uncomfortably on the bathing drum, one off his muscular ass cheeks pushing off the edge slightly. He then attempted to sit up on the drum, his feet landing with a massive THUD as he did, Goten barely diving out of the way, avoiding being accidently crushed by his father\u2019s manly feet. Still staring at himself in a bit of disbelief and childish excitement, he finally looked down to his small son, smiling awkwardly and rubbing his head as if he was apologizing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, well\u2026 Uhhh\u2026 you see\u2026\u201d Goku mumbled, trying to think of a way to tell his son why he was so massive, him not knowing himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, before the growing Saiyan could give his son an explanation, both him and Goten suddenly heard a dull, loud, creaking sound. And, a few seconds later, the drum finally caved in, not able to withstand Goku\u2019s monstrous weight anymore. Goten was knocked off balance by the tremors his father\u2019s fall had caused, leaving the young boy a little amazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 Daddy?\u201d Goten began, intimidated by his father\u2019s massive stature, Goku\u2019s feet now slightly longer than he was tall! He had to be at least 12 feet tall at this point! \u201cI think\u2026 you\u2019re getting too big\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Goku smiled more reassuringly, hoping to make Goten feel more at ease. It seemed to work as Goten smiled back, though the smile didn't quite stretch to the usual lengths Goten was known for. He hurried off and grabbed a towel, holding it out to Goku who grabbed it. It was about the size of a wash cloth to his new, much bigger body. Both males knew this was simply not going to work. Goku just laughed a little sheepishly and grabbed his boxers which were nearby. Goten covered his eyes like a good boy and waited while Goku stood up, the ground shaking slightly under his much heavier (and still slowly increasing) weight. He pulled the boxers on, having to tug once the material reached his thick thighs. He was barely able to pull them up high enough to cover his package which still bulged out obscenely in front of him, the tops of his pubes still clearly visible as well. The back fared no better, the material stretched tightly over his butt cheeks, nearly pulling up in back, barely hiding anything at all. Goku rubbed the back of his head.  Well, it would have to do...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoten uncovered his eyes and slowly looked up...and up...and up at his father. The top of the house now barely reached the bottom of his chest. Clearly this wasn't normal. Even Goten could see that. \"Daddy! How are you getting so big?\" His voice was equal parts amazed, frightened, and jealous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really don't know Goten but I think we'd better go inside for now.\" Goku replied, heading towards the door. Goten quickly ran after him, staying slightly behind so he wouldn't accidentally get crushed under Goku's enormous feet. Once they reached the entrance Goten walked right in, leaving the door open behind him. He turned back and watched as his father crouched down, his huge body easily taking up the entire doorway and more. \"Uh...I don't think you're going to fit...\" Goten said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm going to try!\" Goku said with a determined air. He got down on his hands and knees and pushed his head and one arm through. He grunted a little and kept pushing, slowly getting more and more of his body through the door. Goten grabbed one of Goku's giant fingers and started pulling, trying to help him get through the door. He was about halfway through when...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gohan sighed as he filled out yet another sheet of homework. Ever since beating Cell his life had been one big drag of school work. With his dad gone to Otherworld for good, the only ones in the house were Gohan and his mother and she was firm in her beliefs of making Gohan work hard to get through school. He had never minded school before, but with his dad gone it was all work and no play. Chi-Chi was not letting Gohan do anything remotely fun until all his homework was done. She especially didn't want him sneaking off with any of Goku's friends doing who knows what. Gohan had survived Cell and Chi Chi was making darn sure that Gohan didn't get into any more trouble. Gohan looked longingly out the window wishing he could just spend some time alone in the woods and maybe do a little fishing. He turned back to his homework and continued writing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not having too much fun are you?\" a voice suddenly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan whipped around, looking for the source of the voice but couldn't see anyone. Gohan stood up and said, \"Who said that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did my dear boy!\" the voice spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan looked all around but couldn't see anyone. The voice suddenly became sharp as it said, \"Look down boy, look down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan looked down on his desk and saw a strange sight indeed. A tiny man, no bigger then a pencil eraser, was waving up at him. Gohan crouched down as low as he could focusing on the man. It wasn't easy since he was so small.The man bowed and said, \"Good day to you lad! My name is Mixel the Imp and I'm here to help you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan pinched himself to make sure he wasn't dreaming. This was just so strange. He turned back to the man and said, \"How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMixel laughed and jumped up, pulling off his top hat as he did so. A cane dropped out of the hat and Mixel jumped into the air, landing on the tip of Gohan's nose. Gohan's eyes focused in on the tiny man and he said, \"Why, I'm going to give you a gift of course!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMixel waved his cane around and poked Gohan in the nose. The cane was surprisingly sharp and Gohan winced, a movement that knocked Mixel into the air. He laughed and twirled his cane, the tip erupting into an umbrella that let him glide safely to the ground. Gohan rubbed his nose and checked to see if he was bleeding. He wasn't. Mixel twirled his cane a bit and said, \"There. A gift from me to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohand frowned and said, \"But you didn't give me anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the contrary!\" Mixel said waving a finger. \"I gave you exactly what you need. The gift I gave you will ensure that you can do what you want, when you want. And the best part is, nothing can make you change! Magic is greater than science after all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a laugh Mixel launched into the air again, landing on Gohan's window sill. He turned back and said, \"Just look deep in your mind and you'll find your new power. Enjoy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the minuscule man jumped out the open window and was gone. Gohan knocked himself in the head a little to make sure he wasn't just dreaming. But he wasn't. That imp really had given him something. Gohan closed his eyes and relaxed his mind. Almost instantly something glowed brightly in his mind. Gohan focused his attention around it and activated its power. Gohan opened his eyes to a big surprise!</span></div></div>",

Can I shrink back down?\" Gohan asked.  Mixel laughed, \"Of course you can! You can also grow as much as you want to!\" Mixel said chipperly.  Gohan checked himself out again, \"....Cool!\" Gohan said as he shrunk back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...Enjoy your new gift!\" Mixel said jumping out the window again.

Gohan was scrutinized day after day by his new tutor, who whenever he thought Gohan wasn't working hard enough...Would hit him with a whip! Little did Chi Chi know her son was suffering such abuse at the hands of the very man she had hired herself! (As if Gohan needed a tutor :P) After a few days of this Gohan was beginning to get fed up with this man and his whip...Especially after the man had insulted his father! \"Yes you certainly are a typical case my boy....Whenever fathers leave their family it often results in the child acting out to get attention.\" The man would say snidely. \"My father was a great man! He would never leave us!\" Gohan would yell back. Then the man would laugh and say \"If so then where is he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen something in Gohan snapped, And all his rage accumulated in one big burst of growth! The man turned around as an enormous shadow engulfed him, only to see a sight which made him faint dead away! Gohan was towering about him, his clothes had begun to rip a little. His head hit the ceiling with a gentle 'Thump' and then he luckily stopped growing before he outgrew the house! Once Gohan had calmed down he noticed the unconscious man at his feet.

The pair just stared at each other for a few seconds before Chi Chi fainted dead away. Gohan scratched his head and said, \"Now what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell he didn't want to exact revenge on his crappy tutor with his mother on the floor of his room. If she woke up while he was doing it she wouldn't be too happy. Gohan flicked open his window and set the tutor outside. Shrinking down to normal size, Gohan flew out the window and grew to a much bigger size, his clothes shredding off his body until he was standing with only his briefs on, his foot just a little bit bigger than the house. Bending down, he set the tutor on his feet and held him in place with a finger. Aiming carefully, Gohan flicked the man sending him flying away into the distance. Gohan laughed and shrank back to normal size, flying back into his room. Luckily Chi Chi was still in a dead faint allowing Gohan to change into a different pair of clothes before taking his mother to the living room where he set her down on the couch. He put a wet wash cloth on her forehead and waited for her to wake up. Slowly her eyes fluttered open. She groaned and said, \"Gohan what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan thought fast and said, \"I don't know mom. The tutor you got me left while I was studying. I heard a thump from the kitchen and I found you on the floor while the tutor was long gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChi Chi sat up and tossed the wash cloth away. \"That idiot attacked me! I remember now! Well that's the last time I allow a complete stranger into this house!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan had to bit the inside of his lip to keep from laughing.

Gohan then flew to the mountain and stood right next to it, noticing that the mountain itself only reached to his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe half sayian looked down at the mountain and laughed, he imagined himself fighting a great ape like this, all it would take was one step, and then BOOM, crushed like a bug.

A day of peace, where there was no need to fight, where it was summer so no school, and where you could spend the whole day with friends. Which is exactly what Trunks and Goten were doing. Goten had been allowed to spend the whole day and night with his best friend and they had spent it well, playing outside, sparring with each other, watching T.V., playing videogames and things like that. It was now night and Trunks and Goten were in Trunk's room, trying to find something to do. They were allowed to stay up late tonight because it Saturday but it was almost midnight and the other members of the house had already gone to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want to do now Trunks?\" Goten asked, bouncing up and down on Trunks' huge bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrunks smiled and said, \"Come here, I want to show you something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoten quickly ran over as Trunks reached into his closet and pulled out a small suitcase. He opened it and revealed several vials of an unknown green and blue liquid. Goten looked at it and said, \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrunks sighed and said, \"What do you think it is? I stole it from my mom's lab.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Won't she know it's missing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" Trunks insisted. \"I replaced it with Kool Aid. It looks exactly the same and she won't look too hard at it until she needs it on Monday so all we have to do is switch it back before then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool! So what does this stuff do?\" Goten asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a growth serum!\" Trunks said excitedly. \"If you drink it you grow bigger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" Goten said in awe. \"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet! I've seen it myself! My mom used it on a tomato and it grew as big as her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me try it!\" Goten said, reaching for a vial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrunks held him back and said, \"No way! I took the stuff, I get to try it first!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoten looked unhappy about this but stopped struggling and said, \"Fine, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrunks took out a green vial and opened it up. He knew his mother had only used a few drops on the tomato to make it grow as big as it did, but he didn't know how well it would work on a living organism. To be safe, he drank the whole thing down. They both waited in anticipation for something to happen. They didn't have to wait long. Slowly Trunks began to grow bigger. His arms lengthened, his shoulders widened, his legs stretched. He inched up so that Goten was just below his chest, then at his stomach, then at his waist! His gi top ripped at the shoulders, the material falling down to reveal Trunks' naked torso and display slowing thickening muscles. A loud ripping sound was heard and both boy's looked down to see Trunk's shoes had split open, revealing his big bare feet. He wiggled his toes and smiled as he continued to grow. Soon, his pants ripped away leaving him in a pair of tight briefs. The growth finally stopped as his head pressed against the fifteen foot high ceiling. Trunk's looked himself over, grinning from ear to ear and said, \"This is so cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoten was just staring open mouthed up at his friend. When Trunks yelled out, however, he grinned and ran up to his friend, shouting, \"You look awesome Trunks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrunks put his hands on his hips and grinned down at Goten. \"Wow, you look so small Goten!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoten laughed and said, \"Can I have some now, please? Please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrunks said, \"Sure! Then we can both be giants and have some real fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoten ran over to the suitcase and stopped for a moment. There were two kinds of vials, one with green liquid and one with blue. What did the blue one do? Was it worth the risk. Goten was undecided only for a moment. He grabbed a vial, opened it, and drank the whole thing down. But what color was it?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Goten waited, eager to get as big as Trunks. Soon, the growth started and Goten grinned as he felt his clothes start to get tight. Trunks watched as Goten continued to grow, his gi and undershirt ripping to reveal his own strengthening muscles. Goten pulled off his shoes before they ripped but wasn't fast enough to remove his pants which swiftly ripped. At half Trunks' size he too was only in his briefs. His head pressed against the ceiling and Goten stood next to Trunks, equal to him in height for the first time. But something was wrong. He didn't stop growing! Trunks stepped back as Goten started to crack the ceiling with his head. Noticing this he quickly sat down, his body still expanding. Trunks looked up in amazement as Goten's body filled the room, his back pressing against the wall furthest from the door, his head hitting the cieling again, his arms pressing against the opposite walls and his feet pressing one against the door and the other just to the right of Trunks. Finally the growth stopped with the back of Goten's head pressed flat against the ceiling, his neck bent, his shoulders cramped together, his arms twisted against each other in front of his chest,his knees pressed tight against the ceiling, his toes pressed flat against the walls while his feet stayed as planted as they could on the floor. Needless to say it was extremely uncomfortable. Trunks was pressed up against his friend's white covered crotch, the only conceivable place where there was still room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trunks.\" Goten said, \"Why did I grow so big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...\" Trunks said. \"I guess it works differently on other people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trunk's my neck is starting to hurt.\" Goten said, a tremor in his voice. \"I'm starting to hurt all over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just stay calm Goten!\" Trunks said. The last thing they needed right now was for Goten to start crying. If he did, at his size, the room would quickly fill with liquid. Goten sniffed loudly and said, \"I can't help it! It really hurts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrunks was thinking fast. What could they do? There was a chance the other vial would be able to shrink Goten, but what if he only grew more? They could knock the walls down, but someone would surely hear that in the house and come running and then they'd get in trouble for taking stuff from Bulma's lab. Trunks heard Goten's breathing start to get heavier and felt a drop of water on his back. He looked up and saw that Goten was starting to cry. Great, he was sure his parent's would notice a flood of water coming from under his door as well. Tears started streaming down Goten's face, dripping onto various parts of his body, but mostly ontop of Trunks. Trunks felt like he was standing in a shower with low water pressure and he was getting soaked. He looked up at his friend and said, \"Don't cry Goten! Come on, this is serious! You're a boy, boy's don't cry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Trunks!\" Goten wailed, the tears falling faster. \"But I can't help it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you've got to try!\" Trunks yelled, getting all the wetter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoten only sniffled and cried harder. Obviously yelling at him wasn't going to work. Trunks looked down and was surprised to see he was already standing ankle deep in tears. This wasn't good. Trunks reached over Goten's body and grabbed the suitcase. Slowly the water level rised until it reached his knees. Goten only cried harder as time went on, his awkward position cramping the various parts of his body. Soon, sitting, Trunks was up to his chest in water. There was nothing else for it. He was going to have to break down the walls. Before he could do that, however, something odd happened. </span></div></div>",

He surely hadn't envisioned this turn of events when he had stol...er...borrowed those chemicals from his mothers lab. Maybe they were still in testing or something. He really couldn't think of much of a use for this kind of technology. Regardless, now wasn't the time to be thinking about that. Goten's face took up all of Trunks' vision and Trunks, while thinking of other things, had missed whatever it was Goten had said. Suddenly, he felt the hand under him shift, lowering swiftly to a new location. Trunks didn't know what to expect and felt dread well up within him as Goten's cotton clad crotch was brought into view. Goten giggled as he pulled open his tight briefs revealing the hairless darkness below. Trunks barely had time to register what was happening before Goten turned his palm over completely, dropping Trunks into that darkness. Just before Trunks reached the pulsing mass of Goten's genitals, he powered up his ki and managed to stop himself in midair. Turning himself around he flew as fast as he could up to the opening. The last thing he saw before the briefs closed over him was Goten's grinning face. Then the sky was blocked completely, and he was trapped. He had almost made it too. He was unable to stop himself as the briefs closed, causing him to collide into the soft material. It stretched slightly, then catapulted him back down, landing on Goten's scrotum, right next to the balls. The impact he made caused a very slight tremor of pleasure race over his body. Other than that, Goten couldn't even tell if Trunks was in there, since he was so small. It was turning out to be a disappointing experience. What was the point of having your friend in your pants if you couldn't even feel it? Goten got onto his hands and knees and picked carefully through the rubble of the Capsule Corp building looking for the tiny suitcase full of chemicals. He soon found it and held it close to his eyes. One of the chemicals caused you to shrink, the other to grow, that much he knew. But at his size, he couldn't tell which was which. It didn't help that it was still dark out. Goten shrugged and just held onto the suitcase for now. Once morning came, he'd be able to see about doing some more size changing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe yawned as he realized it must be very late. Looking around, Goten wondered if he should simply sleep where he is, or find a better, more comfortable place.</span></div></div>",

Trunks pinched Goten between his two fingers as softly as possible. Despite this, Goten felt like he being crushed between two boulders. The trip was breif as Trunks released the boy so he was sitting on his finger, looking straight into his god-like face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job, slave.\" spoke the older saiyan. \"Now I want you to clean my belly button out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout being able to even mumble a protest, Goten was lowered to his master's stomach and dropped onto his youthful abs.

Goten gulped at the intimidating sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing? Daydreaming? Hurry up, bug.\" ordered the young god.

Gasping for breath, the kid used all his strength to break free...only to smack right into Trunks' flesh and become plastered to it. He pulled himself away from the sweaty wall with some effort abd floated above the substance, which he guessed was a mix of lint and sweat. Creating a small spark of energy in his hand for light, he took a glance at his surroundings. He was shocked to see that the entire floor of the pit was covered in tons of lint.

Goten watched as Trunks filled the bathtub with hot water. While the water was filling the tub Trunks started stripping off the remains of his clothes that had managed to survive his growth spurt.

The soap felt slimy on his back. Trunks climbed into the hot water and dunked the soap into the water causing Goten to gasp at the heat and the sudden wetness. Trunks ran the soap over his face first. Goten felt his body crushed against his friend's warm soft skin being rubbed into Trunks' face. Soon, Goten was covered in a white film of soap, his body quickly becoming indistinguishable from the soap. Moving on, Trunks soaped up his chest running Goten against the young muscle of his upper body from his biceps to his abs. Trunks stopped for a moment and saw Goten gasping on the soap, wanting this terror to be over. Trunks knew he had to wash his legs and feet yet but there was another area that could use some attention. What does he do first? </span></div></div>",

Looking up, he noticed he couldn't see any clouds. Turning his gaze downward, he saw the clouds clustered around his legs. And yet, he still continued to expand. Since the chemicals first shrank the subject to a certain size, then changed composition and reversed the effects to perfectly mirror the previous effects. Since Goten had gone down beyond subatomic levels, he was in true danger of outgrowing more than just the planet. Was the universe infinite? Who knew?

He looked down at his bulge and was happily surprised to see that his bulge had definitely gotten bigger as well, and not just because it was growing in proportion to his body. He had definitely gained some new length and girth. Goten was no longer embarrassed by his situation. Rather, he was finding it enjoyable.

NOW YOU CAN COME WITH US PEACEFULLY OR BY FORCE!!. Goten just stared at the man then he began to grin with confidence. '' you guys dont have a chance against me'' said the self absorbed teen '' you wont be able to stop me when i grow even bigger ''. Goten began to climax his muscles thinking he would grow again '' I'll be invincable and no one would be able to stop me'' he said in his mind. but nothing happened, so the concerned Goten climaxed again and still nothing happened.'' I'VE HAD ENOUGH ! '' said the frustrated officer  ''A TEAM ATTACK !!!''. Suddenly 5 jets appeared and headed towards the giant hero buzzing around him like bees. The frustrated Goten tried to smack the jets away '' GET AWAY !! '' he yelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''TAKE HIM DOWN WITH THE SECRET WEAPON'' said the officer  '' roger that '' said the soilder, then the soilder flies his jet right under goten's nose leaving alot of smoke in it's place.Soon after that Goten inhaled all of the smoke.Suddenlly Goten stopped fighting,he began to inhale strangley.''Sir whats happening ?'' said the soilder, ''I dont know'' said the officer.'' ALRIGHT MONSTER THIS IS YOUR LAST WARNING !!! ARE YOU GONNA COME WITH US OR YOU WANT TO CONTINUE OUR BATTLE!!'' .Goten: AH.. AH... officer :'' LAST CHANCE !!!! MONSTER!! ''.Goten : AH... AHHHH..... officer : THATS IT !! ATTACK '' soilders: YES SIR!!!. Goten:AAAACCHHHOOOO!!!!. Soilders and officer and citizens: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!. Goten's sneeze blow away all the people into a far distance.His accident caused them to be burried under the building remains and dirt that was blown away with them .''excuse me '' Goten said sniffling '' sorry about that''. ''HUH !?'' said goten suprsied ''where did every body go ? '' oh well i guess they relized that I'm to strong for them '' said the confident teen .'' Hey maybe i should go home and show my big brother  who's the biggest one now ''. So goten eggarily walked home not even watching what he stepped over.

His once sweet little brother had become a voyeuristic giant in less than ten minutes! And now that same giant was holding him hostage! Goten rolled Gohan's body between his fingers as he thought about what to do with him. Gohan, when he was sixteen and still in high school, had been a lot more fun to be around. Then he met Videl and everything had gone downhill from there. Goten couldn't help but feel that Gohan had married their mother. Videl was just as bossy as Chi Chi, at least when she was young, but she had at least mellowed out over time and didn't try to control Gohan's life. Then again, Gohan was already so whipped from the constant pressure from Chi Chi that he didn't really do anything to out of the way anymore. As a result, Gohan had gone from being his cool older brother who would play with him all the time, to a boringly responsible adult that spent every waking moment with his girlfriend and soon to be wife. Goten had stopped hanging out with him and taken up hanging out with Trunks and whatever girl he could find at the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now he had Gohan just exactly where he wanted him to do with as he pleased! An idea finally came to Goten, a way to punish Gohan for all the years of neglect and his now boring attitude and test the theory of Goten's growth. He dropped to the street, his butt crashing down on a small portion of the buildings on either side as well as the entire street. Even sitting down his head and shoulders cleared the buildings on either side of the street. Goten dropped Gohan on his dick and laid his arms on the buildings next to him. He grinned down at Gohan and said, \"Alright bro, get to work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan stared up at Goten in dismay. He couldn't possibly be expecting him to do what he thought he wanted him to do. But Goten nodded affirmation to Gohan's silent question, with a thunderous frown that clearly said 'Or else'. So Gohan tucked his glasses inside his suit coat and tossed it to the side along with his tie. Next, his shoes and socks came off leaving him barefoot. Lastly, he rolled up the sleeves of his shirt and started rubbing his brother's cock. Goten moaned lightly in pleasure and leaned his head back, totally enjoying the feeling of Gohan's velvety hands rubbing across his skin. Gohan slowly hovered up the dick as it started getting hard until he was straddling Goten's dick head, the piss slit dilating in front of him. Gohan braced his knees on either side of the purple head and stuck his hands directly into the slit. He called a little ki into his hands and pressed it against Goten's urethra. To Goten, it registered as little more than an intense vibration sending him past all his barriers and causing him to climax in record time. He had never realized Gohan could cause pleasure in such creative ways. Gohan was caught full on in the milky white eruption getting the sticky ropes caught in his clothes, between his toes, slicking in his hair, and sneaking into his mouth. With a few swallows the semi large amount of cum that had made its way into Gohan's mouth was swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoten panted and looked down at his tiny cum soaked brother, waiting to see what would happen.</span></div></div>",

Soon the remaining shreds of his briefs fell off his sack and dick, leaving him completely naked and free. Again and again and again the sticky goo burst forth, blasting Gohan off the dick and onto the ground far below. But because he was a Saiyan, the only thing hurt was the little pride he had left. \"Ohh....OHHHHH!!!\" Goten moaned as his dick spurt forth one last blast of semen, which shot clear over the buildings. And landed, right on top of his house! It covered the lawn (Not to mention Chi Chi who was out hanging the laundry to dry.  Chi Chi stood there in shock for a moment, wondering what this sticky concoction was....She smelt it, she even tasted it and quickly spat it out! \"Yuck! Wait...I recognize that taste! Is this....EWWW!!\" Chi Chi said (Heh...Wonder how she knew what it tasted like XD)  Chi Chi then fainted dead away on the lawn, landing in a pile of the sticky mess. Goku however wasn't home (He was off collecting Dragon Balls with Trunks and Pan) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the city, since each climax had caused him to grow bigger.

Soon, Gohan found himself staring at a ball bigger than several buildings pulsing lightly in front of him. Goten as a whole was almost incomprehensible his massive form stretching above the skyline. Looking shakily behind him Gohan saw Goten's legs and feet stretching off into the distance.

Standing around him were his comrades. Guldo was focusing most of his attention on the monitors and was prepared to use his special ability in case anything went wrong with the experiment. Recoome was munching on a chocolate nut bar in the corner, lost in his own little world. Burter was watching Jeice intently, making sure nothing went wrong to hurt his best friend. Ginyu was standing the closest out of all of them, ready to criticize Jeice at any time. The doctor walked inside and proceeded with the experimentation. He stuck a syringe filled with an odd liquid square into Jeice's chest. Jeice started screaming out in pain as the liquid inside was forced into his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after, Jeice passed out. The doctor noted that this was a normal reaction to the formula and left. Ginyu then turned to Burter, \"Take him to his room.\" Burter was in a bit of emotional pain from seeing such a sight, but he knew better than to show it in front of Ginyu as he nodded and carried Jeice out of the room. After a short distance, Burter arrived in a bedroom that was very similar to most of the other rooms in the same building. Burter laid Jeice down onto his bed and just sat there for a little while. He didn't know what was going to happen to Jeice with that formula. It was said to forcibly increase battle power, but tthe effect it had on Jeice just twisted Burter's stomach. Suddenly, something happened.</span></div></div>",

The problem is, there isn't a succesful story out there that caters to the dudes and the dudes alone. So I've created this! In this interactive any guy is up for grabs for growing. But there's not just growing my friends! No, there is also shrinking! For to a shrunken person a normal person is a giant, no? There are, of course, a few groundrules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">NEW RULES AS OF 11/25/11! Read them carefully BEFORE you add a new chapter:</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Guys grow only! Keep female content to a minimum. No giantess, no muscle growth, nothing of that kind for the females! There's enough content out there for that if that's your thing. We're male oriented here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. No hard vore AND no toilet stuff of any kind!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Size is unlimited! They can grow as big as you want!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Multiple giants are allowed! Don't be afraid of having more than one guy grow!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Use proper grammar PLEASE and do not submit a chapter that is only one or two lines long! Each chapter should be of a decent length (at LEAST one or two paragraphs) and readable. There is a spell check for a reason!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. With change of size comes with change of attitude. OoC is welcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. Gay stuff is allowed! In case that's not been made obvious by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8. DO NOT add a choice chapter UNLESS you are also starting the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n9. If you are going to start a new story, it must be at LEAST 2 paragraphs long, and comply with rule #5.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>REPEAT OFFENDERS WILL BE BLOCKED! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollow these rules and we'll get along just fine! Read, add, and enjoy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo add on if you read and lets try and make this as succesful as my other stories! Thank you!</td>",
