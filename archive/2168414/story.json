        "created":1536308760,
        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">You are a young man (Mike, 18) that his starting university, in a social sciences background. You are the normal nerdy boi in many respect : you are a bit of a lazy lad, you like videogame and you are especially shy. The only exception with that normal world is that you are affected by a strange disease known as the toon factor : your body react like a toon character ! It's not contagious, but you can affect other people<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou live with your two flatmate Enora and Gwenael (that's a boy name), that are friendly but sometimes quite weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Characters</b> (all character are over 18)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Mike : it's you, the toony boi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Enora : One of your flatmate. She is a funny girl, but quite a weirdo at some time. She is always talking about scientific stuff that you don't understand. She really like to \"study\" your toon factor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Gwenael : Your other flatmate. He is friendly but kinda invasive. The kind of guy that will try to solve your trouble for you, and that doesn't really know how to stop. He likes some strange stuff, and often makes joke about how his browser history is like a battlefield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Elizabeth : A kinda bully girl of your university. She likes to pick on you and to tease you. You have had a sexual relationship with her at a time when you were both drunk, and it makes sometime things a bit weird. She is quite of a loner. She is kinda tsundere, and it makes her crazy to know that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Seb : Another kinda bully boy. He is quite muscular and sportive, and - you must admit - quite good looking. He doesn't really likes nerd, and often bother you. He don't admit it, but he is really afraid to failing his studies. Despite his hard shell, his dream is to become a sociologist to talk about social issues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Shania : A shy girl, that is also part of your university. She doesn't talk often, and is quite intrigued (but doesn't want to bother you) by your toon factor. She got a strong but kinda closed-minded education, that make her hesitant to try everything new, even if she really wants too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Paul : Another boy, that looks like the sportive type\u2026 but that is basically even more a nerd than you. He is totally gay, and openly admit it. It's quite harder for him to admit feelings, though.  He talks reaaally fast, and it get faster the more he is excited/interested by something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Toon factor effects</b> (please respect that, I'm a nerd and I like when my lore works well)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- You are basically immortal. You can be \"destroyed\", but your consciousness might remain in the different parts and you can be regenerated with a special device (both Enora and Gwen' have one)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- You don't really get unbearable pain when shenanigans happens to you, but some sort of really strange/weird discomfort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- You can be stretched, flattened, squished, inflated like any cartoon character. With time you can get back to your normal form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- You can be inserted quite easily in basically anything, even if it's way too small. A bottle ? It works. The mouth of someone else ? No problem. A vacuum cleaner ? Perfect. As long as you are in it, you are stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Really hot temperature + humidity can melt you. Regrowing to your normal form is impossible without some help. (see later)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- You can be absorbed into cloth, and become one with it. Regrowing to your normal form is impossible without some help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Vore rules : you can be eaten and digested by other character (you will melt and your liquid form will be absorbed, no scat). You will be used to make grow a bodypart of the older, and your consciousness will be inside it your eater want to. If not, you won't exist until you are regenerated. You can't get to your normal form without help in this condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Cock vore transform you into sentient cum (you can't move, though). Breast vore to sentient milk. You can't get to your normal form without help in this condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- All your bodyparts can be cut without arming you. They'll keep sensations until they are destroyed. To reattach them ? Just use some glue, it'll work !<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Someone can steal a cut bodypart by eating it. The bodypart will be destroyed by the stomach (you won't sense it) and one will grow on the thief (or it'll make grow the equivalent existing bodypart)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- The character can affect other character like if they had the toon factor. Meaning that you can put anybody in a bottle, voring them, steal one of their bodypart\u2026 They only get the toon effect that you used on them, though (for instance if you cut the arm of someone, they won't get any other toon effects than having an arm cut without harm). The device can remove the toon effect and get them to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- When activated without aiming at a toon-affected person, the regenerating device will regenerate you and you only. To regenerate another destroyed person, you have to aim it to something that belong to them. The regeneration remove any effect you had on other people (for instance if someone stole a bodypart, he'll loose it)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- You have spare regenerating devices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules :<br>\r\n- <b>No underage</b>. All characters must be over 18, <br>\r\n- <b>No incest</b> or no fetish interaction with familly members. Please not. Do not want.<br>\r\n- No scat/piss, things like that, too.<br>\r\n- If you add an ending, please add before a way out of it, to make other people able to continue the story from that point<br>\r\n- The main character is bisexual. He isn't bothered by relation with any gender. Technically, you can make everybody have a crush with the main character in a route if you want.<br>\r\n- I'm not the best at writing english, but let's all try to have chapter that are a minimum readable, okay ? :)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAknowledgement :<br>\r\n- The \"squishy universe\" that made me try to do an interactive with some stretching and transformation, but with my own rules.<br>\r\n- The guillotine story, that inspired me the cutting rules</td>",
